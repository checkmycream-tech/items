            <li>AWESOME!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great having movie star hair too at an affordable price!</li>
            <li>I ordered WEN from Amazon [Exquisite Emporium/ab-bookshop] because it said [ 1 TIME SHIPMENT - NO CONTRACT!</li>
            <li>the customer service at WEN is excellent.</li>
            <li>It feels great while using it, but even after a blowout, it&#x27;s FRIZZY and looks parched!  </li>
            <li>ITS WONDERFUL, CHANGED MY HAIR!  </li>
            <li>and i wasnt impressed</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>The product is wonderful...</li>
            <li>The styling cream is awesome though!</li>
            <li>but I shouldn&#x27;t have had to in the first place!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very impressed, but it could just be my hair type.</li>
            <li>and It worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Yes, this product works best when you follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>Cheaper,and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>However, after using for about two months - I started to notice a HUGE amount of my hair falling out!!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE WEN!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE WEN!!!</li>
            <li>This time my hair was even better!!!  </li>
            <li>All it did was make my hair incredibly greasy and not to mention doesn&#x27;t smell the best.</li>
            <li>Loving what this is doing for my hair!!  </li>
            <li>It is a very good product though.</li>
            <li>My hair was incredibly damaged before using this product and nothing else</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li>I experienced excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked and felt great, and I received wonderful comments about it.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>I used it for 8 weeks thinking this would be a good test, but this stuff just doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard!  </li>
            <li>(a good reason to try it on Amazon instead of the website!).</li>
            <li>All in all a good product that in this case works well!</li>
            <li>Good luck to my fellow ladies!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wast your money, go to a salon and buy something good from your hairdresser!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li>and it is beautiful...</li>
            <li>My wife uses this and it made her hair beautiful.</li>
            <li>the smell is beautiful ..</li>
            <li>My hair looked beautiful and shiny, and I already had really great hair.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be great</li>
            <li>Since I think it&#x27;s always a great idea to make impulsive purchases based solely on celebrity endorsements I decided to order some.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>and I think they work great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I got all the \\&quot;extras\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I found a great alternative at Sally Beauty called \\&quot;One Hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This item was great because I could try the product without committing to monthly mailings if I didn&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li>product is great for a once in a while product.</li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>if I style my hair it looks great...</li>
            <li>Their hair looks great, like movie stars.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Provides great moisture</li>
            <li>I did find it makes a great conditioner to use with a shampoo product.</li>
            <li>So I thought great</li>
            <li>Great don&#x27;t have to deal with monthly shipments.</li>
            <li>Well I get the products and the bill says welcome to Wen</li>
            <li>Kept my color longer and made my hair feel great.</li>
            <li>and they do a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li>This product smells great, but it made my hair look greasy even without using it as a leave-in conditioner (and I don&#x27;t have oily hair).  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>Great results for me.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to report that the texture and appearance of my has improved drastically.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product and I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>I happen to be one of the hair types it works great</li>
            <li>My hair is chin length and 6-8 pumps works great from me.</li>
            <li>set worked great, expect for the balm.</li>
            <li>The Wen haircare system is great.  </li>
            <li>If you have a detachable showerhead, then this product is great and you won&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li>I cried for joy over how great it it made my hair.</li>
            <li>This product may work great for others</li>
            <li>This is what I learned to accept as part of the great DNA passed from my parents and that there are no permanent fix.</li>
            <li>but after I used it and seen how great it is</li>
            <li>The service was great from Ginger Lily Boutique.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>and I found the results were great.</li>
            <li>so it was great to see that I have the option of a one time shipment.</li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>but the end result not so great</li>
            <li>and this was a great way to order a \\&quot;one time shipment\\&quot; of the Wen</li>
            <li>She is happy</li>
            <li>so I am happy.</li>
            <li>my wife&#x27;s hair smells great and she loves this product.</li>
            <li>Another great thing about this product is if you color your hair, this product doesn&#x27;t strip your color so your color lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Wen is a great product, but it is not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It looked and felt great.</li>
            <li>However, the comb is great for detangling.  </li>
            <li>The texture bald is great for hold hair in place without the hard-fix that hair spray does.</li>
            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>but it can be a great product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great product, wish I could afford to purchase this all the time.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up on it and just ordered the pomegranate cleaning conditioner and can&#x27;t wait to try that formula!!</li>
            <li>nothing more!!</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing!</li>
            <li>I also use the cleansing conditioner to bathe my 2 cats, it&#x27;s animal-friendly, and they smell amazing when they come out!</li>
            <li>I have nothing but amazing things to say about wen!</li>
            <li>It was simply amazing!</li>
            <li>yeah they would never dare have someone with my kind of hair as their hair model!  </li>
            <li>It did have a nice fragrance however!</li>
            <li>I am now stuck loving this product!</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and it works better then anything I have ever tried before.</li>
            <li>I would rather spend $50 on a 32oz bottle of the best shampoo on earth than spend even $5 more dollars on any size bottle of Wen.</li>
            <li>I know many people claim this stuff is the best, but around our house, Chaz Dean&#x27;s name is mud.</li>
            <li>The agent handled my request efficiently and pleasantly.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for a great product that will clean and moisturize your hair without damaging it, this is a great choice!</li>
            <li>Loved the Shampoo and comb, haven&#x27;t had to use any type of conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>I already have gorgeous hair</li>
            <li>Again, I had a good hair day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved how it felt.  </li>
            <li>that was the good part.</li>
            <li>You also need to have good water pressure in your shower.</li>
            <li>The styling creme is fair.</li>
            <li>how was I to know when the TV sellers push that \\&quot;this product is good for all hair types?\\</li>
            <li>and my hair looks good, but I wasn&#x27;t informed that it would be a repeat order. .</li>
            <li>34;too good to be true&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price as well.</li>
            <li>GOOD RIDDENS</li>
            <li>I would never recommend this to a friend and i have nothing good to say about this</li>
            <li>The shampoo is good in cleansing my curly hair as well as not hindering my curl pattern.</li>
            <li>my hair was shiny and smelled good.</li>
            <li>I also loved that it was a once-step process in the shower.</li>
            <li>I just loved the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had used the styling creme and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser smells really good and feels good on your hands-not slimey.</li>
            <li>What good is softer hair if it ends up all gone?</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so good.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good too.  </li>
            <li>The good news is after about 4 months after having stopped using wen, my hair stopped falling out...</li>
            <li>massage into hair really good and than wrap it up and leave in for 3-5 mins.  </li>
            <li>those girls alteady have good hair.look at them.  </li>
            <li>It was a good try at it, but I won&#x27;t be buying this product anymore.</li>
            <li>Its a good product.</li>
            <li>so money wise</li>
            <li>Good morning, I purchased wen hair care about two weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I laughed thinking she was just playing as she is always joking.</li>
            <li>I would have loved to try this product, however the WEN company never sent it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>my hair look so good now with me using wen you have to get it.</li>
            <li>, I still get the good products and</li>
            <li>I loved the product.</li>
            <li>and she loved it too.</li>
            <li>Not all good</li>
            <li>, when i got it I loved it.</li>
            <li>My hair felt almost as good as it did before I started messing with it.  </li>
            <li>I would advise their products are not that good.</li>
            <li>I said good.</li>
            <li>God bless you and good luck.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells good but does NOTHING for my hair.</li>
            <li>Packaging was good.</li>
            <li>it was a good size kit, it worked well</li>
            <li>loved the product would buy it again and recommended it to my friends also.smells wonderful makes my hair shine and clean</li>
            <li>NOTHING MORE THAN GOOD MARKETING.. PERIOD!</li>
            <li>It smells great and it feels refreshing</li>
            <li>Like most people, I saw this infommercial at 3 am and thought this would be a great system for my wavy but unruly hair.</li>
            <li>Soo awesome and its worth the try.  </li>
            <li>great product works better then shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am proud to say that I am a Wen girl. :)</li>
            <li>but it is nice and makes your hair feel so good.</li>
            <li>So I think they emphasize more!</li>
            <li>more!</li>
            <li>more!</li>
            <li>LOVE WEN!</li>
            <li>I found mane and tail to be a better product than this garbage!</li>
            <li>This makes my hair more managable and it also dries faster!</li>
            <li>but the supplier helped me and went out of her way to make sure I got it!</li>
            <li>I am completely in love!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I used to be able to floss with my hair - no joke!</li>
            <li>Love these products!</li>
            <li>WEN sure does help!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Styling Cr&amp;egrave;me and the Texture Balm!</li>
            <li>And what do you know - my scalp looks much, much better (&amp; feels cleaner)!</li>
            <li>Love everything about the Shampoo!</li>
            <li>while your washing, the longer it is on the better!</li>
            <li>When I first used this product-I loved it!!</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>I Love it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fall in to the \\&quot;healthy silky and soft\\&quot; hair trap!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re created for specifically curly hair and work so much better!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I have called many times to cancel and continue to be charged without receiving the product!</li>
            <li>alot,to make sure its cancelled!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>Yes!  Love it!</li>
            <li>Love him!</li>
            <li>and i can honestly say at first I was impressed.</li>
            <li>They always did a great job and cancellation was always easy.</li>
            <li>The sweet almond mint smells good but the cleansing conditioner made my hair fall out!  </li>
            <li>is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I put it on my wishlist and my husband, being the amazing man he is, bought it as a gift for me.</li>
            <li>The WEN products are quite amazing.  </li>
            <li>the scent smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It is amazing that after just one washing you will find your hair softer, and healthier.</li>
            <li>It worked so amazing, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to spend $40 dollars for wen.</li>
            <li>It seems that once you purchase the \\&quot;AMAZING</li>
            <li>Just an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Have used the hair gel and haven&#x27;t noticed anything spectacular</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t liked that styling balm stick (still have used it twice) and the hair gel seems so so.  </li>
            <li>In the shower the menthol in the product really smelled wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I always used better quality salon products so my hair was in good shape when I started.  </li>
            <li>Nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>I liked trying it without being enrolled in \\&quot;the club\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I ordered this pack off of their website &amp; I have to say I really liked the cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comb is nice, though</li>
            <li>Wonderful product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but it was good to be able to try it</li>
            <li>I liked the things it came with the balm, comb, hair treatment.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set.</li>
            <li>When I used after a shampoo it made your hair nice.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know about using it on its own.</li>
            <li>so I kind of rigged it?</li>
            <li>she said she had been using it for 2 years  and liked the results.</li>
            <li>And I own the Pomegranate scented Wen product with pump.</li>
            <li>As much as I wanted this product to work, I was the farthest from impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 50 and have received compliments on how shiny and nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li>100 hairs a day, and to be honest</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of a wash.</li>
            <li>But I liked the Styling Creme and Replenishing Treatment.</li>
            <li>I liked the cleanser, hair treatment and stying cream  </li>
            <li>thats a rip off to be honest.</li>
            <li>and you even get a nice picture of Chaz</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so much more managable smells so good and no longer breaking off like before.</li>
            <li>If you want to wear your hair straight - then it&#x27;s perfect for you.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>I do not use the product as often as they send it so it is nice to have that option.</li>
            <li>The yogurt did my hair more good too.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed with this product and its incredible with curly hair!</li>
            <li>I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product</li>
            <li>The lovely head of gorgeous hair in the photo is all gone.  </li>
            <li>aka makes your hair nice and</li>
            <li>Got the set and to be honest</li>
            <li>Warm water will not rinse it out totally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was not convinced that this product was the end-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice comb and added to the value of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging was very nice and the comb I received was fabulous</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to receive the product, but it wasn&#x27;t even close to being great.</li>
            <li>TO GET A REALLY BEAUTIFUL SMOOTH, HEALTHY STYLE.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for Wen but was not that impressed.</li>
            <li>This is a great package to buy if you want to try the WEN product line, however, they are samples and not the full size versions.  </li>
            <li>Sweet almond conditioner is a great product.</li>
            <li>It has done a very nice job to clean my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the texture balm would work great for people who have thicker hair, but for people who have baby fine hair like me, its not all that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt this good and it was sooo easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>ALSO, it has been my experience with my fine/baby hair that making sure there is not too much on the crown and scalp yields the best results.</li>
            <li>And the sweet almond mint fragrance is very nice, not over powering at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be warned, it has a VERY STRONG scent.</li>
            <li>Besides the fact that I did not like the products, I feel very strongly that the company is trying to take advantage of customers.</li>
            <li>It is softer, it is VERY easy to comb, it is THICKER than before</li>
            <li>and I am so grateful for a product that gives my hair beautiful shine, is sulfate free, keeps my hair smooth but my curls looking and feeling amazing.  </li>
            <li>I purchased mine through eBay at first, then you really get the best deals through QVC if you&#x27;re looking to get a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yea, right?!!!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is very smooth, and already has a nice sheen-</li>
            <li>and i was very pleased with it, great for the hair and reasonably priced</li>
            <li>and oh wow am I happy I did!</li>
            <li>This is a great value pack and worth purchasing to try the product.</li>
            <li>Also you might as well buy it directly from the Chaz Dean website because this seller (Exquisite Emporium is a scam).</li>
            <li>I am so completely surprised and happy with the results!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and I have used a lot of hair product trying to find the right thing, none of them gave me the results that I got from Wen.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine shoulder length+ hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, flyaway hair</li>
            <li>but i have processed hair and it makes my hair silky, shiny and strong!</li>
            <li>Was excited to use the product because my mom was telling me how she loved this product.  </li>
            <li>This little kit is great and the portions of the product are wonderful.</li>
            <li>I gave it one star because that first week it was great</li>
            <li>Upon trying it the first time i thought it smelled great and</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested it because I am pretty happy with the Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too good to be true</li>
            <li>The sweet almond mint has a great smell and works wonderfully on my hair (AA with a tendency to be dry).  </li>
            <li>Tons of flyaways, even though I used to have very smooth hair.</li>
            <li>and my hair is heavier, though very smooth).  </li>
            <li>My hair is very smooth after using Wen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy and so effective</li>
            <li>The real product that comes from the site WEN.com (own pain there but excellent product), has the first three ingredients as Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Camomilla Recutita flower extract...</li>
            <li>And even with out using it every single day my hair smells great and looks great.</li>
            <li>I liked the wen just fine</li>
            <li>I have used four &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; the Sweet Almond Mint is my favorite as my hair responds best to this particular formula.</li>
            <li>It made a HUGE difference with my hair!</li>
            <li>This product is much better than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>love the products and will continue to purchase them on Amazon for always.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a hundred times better than Wen.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Once again, make sure it&#x27;s rinsed out of the crown and roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you read the reviews of fig, some love it and some call</li>
            <li>add 1/2 to 1 more pump to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>can see why some give it okay reviews.  </li>
            <li>so ultimately that is the best buy</li>
            <li>Did notice more improvements doing this over time.  </li>
            <li>I found Wen on Amazon and after making sure I would not receive additional orders, went ahead and bought the 5 piece set.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be purchasing more of the Conditioning Shampoo and Wen re-moist mask.  </li>
            <li>great product too much when i can go on wen and get it for 29.95</li>
            <li>WEN has made me love my hair again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s even more than I hope for.</li>
            <li>I even added a shower filter thinking I would make sure I did all I could to make it work.</li>
            <li>I love beachy hair, but I had yet to find something to get me that desired affect...until I met Wen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After watching the instructional videos on Chaz Dean&#x27;s website, I tried again and the results have been so phenomenal I&#x27;m not going to use anything else on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really felt great in my hair</li>
            <li>I love what this product does for my hair.  </li>
            <li>, it feels healthy, not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>I plan to buy more.  </li>
            <li>WELL, I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love Wen products.  </li>
            <li>so many time I decided I needed to try this product for myself.</li>
            <li>It does help hold my color in for sure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s in marginally better shape.  </li>
            <li>I just need more time.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT...</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments from people at work, asking if I&#x27;ve changed my color or cut my hair.</li>
            <li>but if you order from their website, just make sure you call &amp; cancel if you don&#x27;t want anymore</li>
            <li>shipments b/c they will charge your card &amp; send more if you don&#x27;t cancel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The styling creme is 2nd best.</li>
            <li>but I like the results, better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I am always trying to find a \\&quot;deal\\&quot; on the cleansing conditioner as its the mostly used product for me.  </li>
            <li>Its OK as a conditioner or even a leave in</li>
            <li>either Suave Conditioner or Alberto Vo5 Conditioner will do a better job because of an added cleaning ingredient.</li>
            <li>I love the silky feel of my hair during and after cleaning.</li>
            <li>and I asked me to cancel the every three month shipment since my Wen lasted more than three month.</li>
            <li>the rep at the costumer service told me that since the reason that I canceled was because the product lasted more than 3 moths so they decided to send it to me every five months.</li>
            <li>; do you want us to send it every six months instead&amp;#34; I told her more than once I don&#x27;t want the product at all.</li>
            <li>they just want your money and the trick you in so many ways to get your money.</li>
            <li>so I decided to order three more bottles, 16 oz size..different scents...</li>
            <li>I give 2 stars because it was ok in the beginning.</li>
            <li>also since i started useing it my hair looks healthier, feels healthier, and has ALOT more body to it.</li>
            <li>After using the mask (overnight) my hair had more volume and body.</li>
            <li>so i am going to give it more time.</li>
            <li>but like most things you see on t.v.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from an info-mercial and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the Cleansing Conditioner, Re-Moist Intensive Hair Treatment, and the comb.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>my head was itchy &amp; didn&#x27;t really smell all that great</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I took their advice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I love the way the products work on my hair.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s cheaper</li>
            <li>For some reason or another I wasn&#x27;t able to start it until 2 weeks after I got it.  </li>
            <li>hoping that with time, more use, more pumps, something would change but it never did.  </li>
            <li>If I had looked more closely, I would see that 1)</li>
            <li>I used this product ONE time and that was one time too many.  </li>
            <li>and then if YOU don&#x27;t cancel in the appropriate time period, you are automatically enrolled in their membership program?</li>
            <li>Product worked okay, however was signed up with WEN for autoshipments even though the detail on this product stated that you would not be joining any memebership.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>A lot of people have talked about their hair feeling greasy, but mine feels more waxy....</li>
            <li>You better hope you LOVE the product, because if you ever try to cancel your membership, you&#x27;re hooped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve called and cancelled more than once,</li>
            <li>and they would not send me any more products or bills -</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and see if it gets better</li>
            <li>I have been using WEN Hair care products for over a year now and my hair has never been in better condition</li>
            <li>and i dident want to pay more $ for return shipping</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>do all 3 steps and BETTER</li>
            <li>The more I cleansed my hair</li>
            <li>If I could report to the better business bureau, I would.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>When I called the 800 number to make sure that I hadn&#x27;t been enrolled, since it was NEVER authorized by me, I found that I had been.  </li>
            <li>If you want to try the product, make sure you order it where you do not get automatically added to \\&quot;auto ship\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Im anticipating improvement to healthy hair.</li>
            <li>and I have lost more then 2/3 of my hair.</li>
            <li>Pleased with product.</li>
            <li>And to top it all they charge your credit card month after month and would not acknowledge your returns.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 30 days and love it.  </li>
            <li>I just bought more.  </li>
            <li>and I use 8 pumps, 3 to the top, 3 to the underside, 2 to the sides.  </li>
            <li>On top of that we have a water softener, so you can imagine how damaged my hair is.  </li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t give up and played around with the number of pumps until I found a magic number, which for me is 8-9 pumps.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say I love the product now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, I will now start out by telling you that I DO love wen.  </li>
            <li>Its TOOOOO BADDDDDDDDDD, because Wen realllly works on whatever hair it actually leaves on your head, lol!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>some people just don&#x27;t read now, do they?\\&quot;  OK, admittedly</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and even putting it on at the beginning of my shower and not rinsing it out till the end because they say on the commercials the longer it is on the better.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have had my starter kit for a month now, and do not need to reorder at this time, but I do love the product.</li>
            <li>After seeing all the commerials about the product, I was sure it would be a hit with my hair..</li>
            <li>then I will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>sure I would never buy the product again.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of it too.</li>
            <li>, i was pleased with this order ...</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using the WEN products.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the products.</li>
            <li>I tried using more, I tried changing the routine but nothing.</li>
            <li>In fact I use Dove Hair care which costs a fraction of this product and works better.  </li>
            <li>My hair needs alot of love.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I bought the kit from the WEN website and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love Wen and</li>
            <li>then I add one more.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I took a chance and tried it.</li>
            <li>and it is everything and more.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love love love the product.  </li>
            <li>It is all the \\&quot;infomercial\\&quot; says and more.</li>
            <li>HASSLE FREE!</li>
            <li>ok-</li>
            <li>and I had better not see it on my charge bill.  </li>
            <li>and I for sure wish I had looked it up on amazon before calling in an order.</li>
            <li>i love wen</li>
            <li>Like most, I saw this infomercial and did my research.</li>
            <li>The instructions almost put me over the edge... sectioning off your hair, putting gads of the goop on each section, leaving on forever and then rinsing forever more.</li>
            <li>This smells to me of a means of getting customers to use more product than they need so they can order more.</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>The longer and thicker yourhair is, the more this will cost you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use it once more</li>
            <li>Since the shampoo didn&#x27;t make my hair any better</li>
            <li>I have one more item that I purchased through Amazon</li>
            <li>I. Thought ok</li>
            <li>and if you do not want any more shipments, just tell them...</li>
            <li>love the product</li>
            <li>/&gt;they take out more money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>many of you, I saw the infomercial about WEN and decided to give it try.  </li>
            <li>Gluten free hair product alone, had not done the trick, but one use of WEN and the itch was gone!  </li>
            <li>She will probably order more.</li>
            <li>and I got better results.</li>
            <li>I used most of the product</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, each time i got a box (which I gave to salvation army), without me ordering it, I got charged more.</li>
            <li>Today i called to see why I was getting so many orders and the salesperson told me they send the product each month , but if you dont call to cancel, they will continue sending and charging for the stuff.</li>
            <li>I had watched the info-mercial so many times and wanted to try this.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been better.  </li>
            <li>The texture balm doesn&#x27;t do much for me, but the leave in is great in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite product is the Re-moist Mask intensive hair treatment I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I really love the Wen products.</li>
            <li>hair looks so healthy, what are you</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>(I have medium length hair, so I used four pumps on each of the four sections of hair); and make sure the cleansing conditioner is spread thoroughly throughout your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried Dove damage repair after I tried Wen and it was 100 times better.</li>
            <li>i love wen</li>
            <li>I love Wen shampoo/conditioner combo, as my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy in humid conditions.</li>
            <li>I also love that there&#x27;s no detergents to strip my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it that it dosen&#x27;t foam</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of the almond mint.</li>
            <li>loves it, swears its her favorite hair product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I mostly use the styling cream and my wife uses the shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love my hair</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to a friend who had better luck with it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these products.</li>
            <li>OK, so \\&quot;washing\\&quot; your hair with conditioner??</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Suave is BETTER.</li>
            <li>Suave is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>definitely think it&#x27;s the best ever!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Love it though.</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought from Amazon [Exquisite Emporium/ab-bookshop] is because it said ONE TIME SHIPMENT.</li>
            <li>(I straighten it) and thought this might be the magic product for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I had gone to great lengths just to avoid that very issue and this seller specifically states \\&quot;1 time</li>
            <li>/&gt;Controlled flyaways better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the packaging, the stench was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried it,</li>
            <li>My wife really love.</li>
            <li>and asking me to buy more of this product.</li>
            <li>I bought her this and her hair became more healthier.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>but my hair felt thicker and more manageable.</li>
            <li>At this point I feel I need to use more before I make a more informed suggestion.</li>
            <li>I read up on it and saw that many people talked about hair loss.</li>
            <li>I wish there was more</li>
            <li>or they would have sent me more product every 90 days......</li>
            <li>My hair is better moisturized and my scalp does not itch after using this product.</li>
            <li>Many compliments on the healthiness and shine of my hair.</li>
            <li>I feel that the longer you leave it on the better</li>
            <li>and  do not feel we should be able to take advantage of one another.  </li>
            <li>I am still enjoying the benefits of these products.  </li>
            <li>The deep conditioner is wonderful and I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>I wood recommend this product to any body who wants better looking hair that feels great.</li>
            <li>I love the comb and the texture bald.  </li>
            <li>That way, the product works, will not fade your color, and your hair will be healthy.</li>
            <li>Next we received a collection letter from the wonderful people over at Wen.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure at some point the Better Business Bureau will get to the bottom of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>it seemed like to me instead of my making my hair better</li>
            <li>it just made it more greasier</li>
            <li>I said sure.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li>The more I use it the better my hair gets.</li>
            <li>I WOULD MOST DEF RECOMAND</li>
            <li>and I would say the product works but not any better than Bedhead, Redken, etc.</li>
            <li>I figured let&#x27;s try this product and maybe, just maybe my hair will get better.</li>
            <li>but I will not get any more of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad my boyfriend didn&#x27;t listen to me and ordered this for me anyway.  </li>
            <li>I like this shampoo for the most part.</li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about this stuff</li>
            <li>I was able to comb through her hair without any tears or &amp;#34;ouchies&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>used the entire 4 step process and am very impressed at the results.</li>
            <li>While Chaz Dean promises beautiful with wen hair care it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>and I loved it right away.</li>
            <li>It was nice to have had the experience with the original, authentic product</li>
            <li>your research and be aware!!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t order it in the first place!!!</li>
            <li>From flat to full.!!!!!</li>
            <li>I pretty much never write reviews, but I have to write one for this stuff because its awesome.</li>
            <li>However, my hair never got as clean as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>His hair is even more fine than mine -- and with Wen he actually has &#x27;body&#x27; now, hehe. :-D</li>
            <li>I was so happy, my hair was so soft, and much healthier and looked great.</li>
            <li>Again I used the Wen Sweet Almond Conditioner but followed it up with my own styling products.  </li>
            <li>The comb is a pretty good comb I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>loved it for the first month but then noticed a lot of hair in the drain...</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the product was pretty good.</li>
            <li>I LOVED this product at first.</li>
            <li>(Suave produces good, consistent results.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product and surprised a product does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to try it!  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product for anyone looking to achieve healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I love the feel and the fact that it is now shinny and easy to control.</li>
            <li>tried the sweet almond mint first, and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Wen as long as I am able to get it!!!</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, and this stuff made my hair soooooooo bouncy, manageable and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Fig works better for my lightened, fine hair.</li>
            <li>This seems to be the perfect combo for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Great product made my hair really soft and shiny added volume and bounce and would recommend to family and friends</li>
            <li>and I guess we will see if the more the better is really true.</li>
            <li>Apparently they didn&#x27;t use this product correctly, I have used this product for three years &amp;&amp; let me tell yhu it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>It smells great all day, make your hair soft, but it just doesn&#x27;t control the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have written a more detailed review about this which you can find if you look for all my reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway I finished and it looked great and soft.</li>
            <li>The best item is the wide tooth styling comb.</li>
            <li>it was shiny and smooth, the shampoo is like conditioner it don&#x27;t lather and the longer you leave it in the better</li>
            <li>Considering the amount of money you pay for one bottle, I can buy 2-4 bottles of cheap shampoo and it cleans and repairs my hair better than this product.</li>
            <li>I decided to stay on until I spoke with a REAL PERSON (I recommend getting a good book to read while you wait.)</li>
            <li>I give it 2 stars for smelling good, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It felt great as she washed my hair, which was tangle free (something no other shampoo or condtioner has ever been able to pull off)</li>
            <li>I was more than excited when I finaly got it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product and highly recommend it to others who have fussy hair and have also never been able to find the right product.</li>
            <li>Products are easy to use.</li>
            <li>My hair did not feel like straw at all, the color had not faded one bit and once again, using my own straightening products, I was able to blow-dry my hair in about 1/2 the time and without battling as much frizz.  </li>
            <li>I love it,the product did every thay promised and more.my hair has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>this is getting taken care of so easily and not like the horror stories</li>
            <li>is so easy to comb out after words.and</li>
            <li>5 stars isn&#x27;t easy for me to give in the hair category, but this time it was easy.</li>
            <li>(you can easily request this by e-mail, phone, or online chat</li>
            <li>Also the shipper had it sent VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>It also was easy to syle and gave me lots of volume.</li>
            <li>However, it is extremely easy to cancel and there are no fees.</li>
            <li>When something is advertised on a 30 minute TV infomercial, it&#x27;s easy to be dubious about the claims made.  </li>
            <li>I even called the company and asked about the amounts (they say that the best results come from using a lot of product and leaving it on a long time, neither of which have proven true for me) and</li>
            <li>I LOVE how it made my hair feel right away!</li>
            <li>I thought Wen products were amazing when I first started to use it.</li>
            <li>and I simply love the sweet almond conditioner works well as a pre-poo treatment.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll stick to the fig from here out, with maybe the sweet almond mint as a scalp treatment from time to time.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The first experience was quite nice, my head felt minty and the hair was softer than before.  </li>
            <li>The Sweet Almond Mint scent was calming and yet sophisticated, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>know there is a hot debate about this product, with some people loving it and</li>
            <li>this product is awesome, but NOT WORTH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it, but this is NOT for me (or anyone with the tendency to be frizzy).&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0048O2R1E WEN® Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]]</li>
            <li>Even if it does hold up my color better, I&#x27;ll stick to my normal shampoo/conditioner routine and take more trips to the salon!</li>
            <li>Without a doubt hands down the best hair care product out there.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff it makes my hair soft and eay to comb and my scalp fills clean as wells as my hair</li>
            <li>And my hair is fine.  </li>
            <li>the fine print before you order this</li>
            <li>I read the fine print in the letter that accompanied my Introductory Kit.</li>
            <li>this that, but ALL of that was fine....</li>
            <li>, I did not read the fine print</li>
            <li>the guy said thats fine</li>
            <li>I gave it my best shot for one month before I gave up and returned to previously used products.</li>
            <li>I use half the amount and it works great!</li>
            <li>Also, I prefer those products because I could go a day in between without washing my hair and it would look fine - with the Wen product</li>
            <li>I said that was fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine if you want to use it in addition to your shampoo as a conditioner</li>
            <li>The leave in products seem to work fine, but the cleansing conditioners gave me dandruff.</li>
            <li>My hair was silky and light, yes, but it wasn&#x27;t clear how AMAZING this product was until I tried using shampoo again!</li>
            <li>It is a bold faced CAPITALIZED LIE!  </li>
            <li>liked that Wen had a pleasant aroma and had a very creamy texture which felt great when FIRST applied to my soaking wet hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is difficult--baby fine, tending to be oily, easily frizzy and just wavy enough to look messy--but tonight it looks great.</li>
            <li>It helped my scalp a little, the best thing that works for me is Suave for Men, peppermint.</li>
            <li>but some folks are making a HUGE profit from the markup.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a Huge HUGE skeptic when it comes to buying ANYTHING off tv.</li>
            <li>This is a huge scam and that must be why it&#x27;s not sold in stores.</li>
            <li>no I had two huge bald spots.</li>
            <li>you have a huge bald</li>
            <li>That is HUGE amount of product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable to buy from Amazon,</li>
            <li>Still debating on whether i should keep using it or not, if you have the chance JUST to try it out at a cheap price i would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Actually this is a great way to try the product before you get stuck.</li>
            <li>The customer service when I call is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I settled my account, called and confirmed that it was settled</li>
            <li>and when I mentioned to my hairstylist that I had been shampoo free for a couple months she automatically started raving about Wen.</li>
            <li>My set style with sponge rollers stays for 2 days looking great in the deep south humidity.  </li>
            <li>Wen products made my hair feel silky smooth and shiney.  </li>
            <li>the extras that come with your initial purchase are great.  </li>
            <li>many others, I&#x27;m not crazy about the menthol in the product</li>
            <li>My hair looked great when she finished, but I also had mistreated my hair prior to that, so let&#x27;s just assume that anything I would do to it, would do wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel silky smooth and</li>
            <li>AND they even sent me free products for my troubles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is important.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth with volume and thicker and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>As a beauty product junkie, I am rarely this pleased.  </li>
            <li>Congratulations, Wen Hair Products and Guthy Renker for such great execution.</li>
            <li>I used almost the whole bottle, thinking it would get better the more I used it</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor, save your money and find a good stylist and a product with a solid reputation - you deserve better than Wen.</li>
            <li>So I havent purchased this system yet, though I plan to do so as this conditioner made my hair so soft and shiny and it smells sooo good.</li>
            <li>I saw numerous posts about this making your hair fall out, and saw even more that loved it.</li>
            <li>With this product, more really does seem to be better.  </li>
            <li>I really hope that you have the right hair conditions where it will work for you otherwise good luck trying to cancel.  </li>
            <li>They claimed if you use the right amount you get better results.  </li>
            <li>you dont see the difference right away, and being that it doesnt lather and has a more conditioner feel, i was nervous that it would leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I told them it was a ripoff and a scam and that they had better cancel right away</li>
            <li>I used it one time and my hair was shiny, healthy and even my color was more vibrant.</li>
            <li>When I received my package, I realized that it didn&#x27;t contain all the free gifts described on TV; but I was not deterred since I was so excited to try the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product...</li>
            <li>The trick for me with my fine, medium length, wavy hair, was to use less than 1/2 the amount, spread the shampoo evenly, and rinse a great deal more than you think it needs.</li>
            <li>Wen is a great product when it comes down to leaving the hair soft and smelling great</li>
            <li>This product works great for me, I have medium length fine colored hair that tends to get dry and oily.</li>
            <li>hair felt clean and light.</li>
            <li>Hope I love them as much as the sweet almond mint!</li>
            <li>i usualy have to put some kind of oil in my hair after i shower because my hair is so damaged that it tangles easily, but so far i have not had to with this product.</li>
            <li>I alternate between this and my regular shampoo and my hair feels healthier, so I am happy with this product and it smell good too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since originally writing this I went from ordering the one time shipment to signing up with QVC for ongoing shipments.  </li>
            <li>It made me excited about trying Wen again or maybe just trying 613.</li>
            <li>I excitedly ordered it and eagerly awaited it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li>After watching all of the commercials i was excited to try wen</li>
            <li>I called up and the guy originally told me that I didn&#x27;t cancel my account</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product through Wen website.</li>
            <li>I was beyond excited when my hair felt like silk when washing out..</li>
            <li>While the wen products are more expensive than most of the store bought cleansers, if you look into salon products, you&#x27;ll find you have a comparable price point with the best brands</li>
            <li>For me, Wen is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>no this is not almost $40 worth of products!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>The product is great for my long hair.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to order wen through the infomercial</li>
            <li>So finally excited again I waited.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>This product is not for everyone--be aware and stop using if you have these problems because I don&#x27;t believe they will get better eventually.</li>
            <li>I love this product i noticed the difference on the first use.</li>
            <li>It really helped my hair (curly, wavy, fine and frizzy) be more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, pin straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel clean and after a day my hair was begging to be washed again.</li>
            <li>but in my opinion it docent clean your scalp and because of it you will develop Dandruff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update on amount used: I do realize that my hair is not as clean</li>
            <li>to ensure your hair gets clean.  </li>
            <li>SMells great, makes my hair soft, like the styling products for when I wear my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions to the letter and was amazed to find after use my hair felt clean, including my scalp.  </li>
            <li>, its doesn&#x27;t clean well and it leaves my hair a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li>and my hair is finally clean and not greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>Felt my hair and scalp squeaky clean soon after.</li>
            <li>however Wen doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel clean.</li>
            <li>I scrub my scalp as instructed however it doesn&#x27;t feel clean and by the end of the day it looks matted and oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for people with dry hair will halp damaged hair</li>
            <li>It would cost me $90 a month just to clean my hair</li>
            <li>Even with no lather the product leaves my hair clean longer.</li>
            <li>My scalp has never felt so clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>but it does what it claims to do, nice soft hair!</li>
            <li>Instead, my hair is still soft and most of my ringlets are still intact!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While researching, I learned that Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply has their own, much cheaper version of Wen called Hair One - also found right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny and healthy, but when I have used other products because I was traveling or something, it also looked good.</li>
            <li>The lavender for fine hair can be a little too much but the Pomegrante and Almond are perfect.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the special package for $29.95.  </li>
            <li>but none if them did anything special for my hair.</li>
            <li>but not anything special for the cost that I paid, I like it</li>
            <li>Here again, you must get the right formula for your hair!</li>
            <li>After doing more research online and seeing how many people reported major hair loss after using this product, I&#x27;m not even tempted to try this product again.</li>
            <li>Well....the conditioner works pretty good and make&#x27;s your hair amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>For the first few months it was great!</li>
            <li>Directions say 10-15 pumps, but obviously that is a general suggestion and youshould use an amount that best benefits your hair type and length.</li>
            <li>I really massage it in there making sure</li>
            <li>BE SURE to work on the rinse out as much as you did on the work in.</li>
            <li>I have tried Sweet Almond Mint, Pomegranate, Lavender, and Fig.</li>
            <li>and it shows their credit card not mine, which was true.  </li>
            <li>The whole \\&quot;use as many pumps as you</li>
            <li>They claim the hair continues to improve as you continue to use it so we shall see if that&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>:B003PXZI2O WEN BY CHAZ DEAN SWEET ALMOND CONDITIONER,STYLING CREME, RE-MOIST MASK INTENSIVE HAIR TREATMENT,TEXTURE BALM,WIDE TOOTH SHOWER</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are also different kinds of Wen conditioning shampoos based on your hair type, and details about what kind of conditioning shampoo works for which kind of hair is very informative and helpful.</li>
            <li>I JUST RECIEVED MY WEN SWEET ALMOND MINT STARTER KIT TODAY AND COULDNT WAIT TO TRY IT OUT.</li>
            <li>when I went to a home with a softener, my hair looked better and I didn&#x27;t use as much product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love WEN.</li>
            <li>being that i get very greasy hair, these shampoos didnt work for me because they did not remove the grease, and i ended up getting more acne</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if it was more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>When I called to complain they of course said that I had agreed to this, which I suppose is true.</li>
            <li>I immediatley stopped using it and went back to my good ol&#x27; reliable shapmoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have used the Fig &amp; The Lavender and Now Sweet Almont Mint.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I got out of this was a comb and the texturizing balm.</li>
            <li>I received the Wen sweet almond 5 piece kit as a mother&#x27;s day gift.  </li>
            <li>What I really liked about it are the amount of natural products used.</li>
            <li>I ultimately gave it to another family member who styles hair and they didn&#x27;t have good result either.</li>
            <li>I love the product, the information that comes withthe product advises to use Too much product.</li>
            <li>I purchased both the sweet almond mint and the fig through amazon so that I could avoid being enrolled in the auto-renewal and have an opportunity to sample the product.</li>
            <li>But I LOVE this product so much.  </li>
            <li>but orders religiously should be good</li>
            <li>but I have a feeling that I&#x27;ll be returning the kit for a full refund.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I may not get my full refund or get any justice.</li>
            <li>I am really looking for something to add shine and volume to my hair, as well as keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>This product was good for conditioning, but left my hair without body.</li>
            <li>The business is full of deceit and lies, don&#x27;t fall in the trap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen the informercial and I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>, I decided to order the Wen Sweet Almond Mint hair care kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried sweet almond and fig.</li>
            <li>i remember having my hand full of hair</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I use as much as it requires, or I rinse it out all the way, and my hair is still 100% better than what it was.  </li>
            <li>So, I may try to order more of the styling creme if I can catch it reasonably</li>
            <li>My hair has NEVER looked this healthy, clean, vibrant, or full of body.</li>
            <li>The product smells wonderful and it makes my usually dry hair so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Not silky and beautiful but HUGE mess!  </li>
            <li>I started using Wen for  a month with no other products, I can honestly say that it hasn&#x27;t helped with regrow but it does clean my hair well</li>
            <li>The price however is something to be desired, and might off set me from purchasing it in the future, since I require more product than most people, but nonetheless a good product overall.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t exactly give you the comfortable clean</li>
            <li>as I would any other product (rather than using the longer time frames for both washing and rinsing suggested) and my hair turned out great.</li>
            <li>I started to do a lot of research online on my hair loss and found other reviews about people who had experienced hair loss after using Wen.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been searching high and low to find a product that allows me to maximize my beautiful curls, but not let it be frizzy or crunchy.  </li>
            <li>love the product, leaves  my hair silky, comms down the freezes and my hair is more manageable, my hair feels and looks thicker now,  I&#x27;m not ashamed of the way my hair looks any more,  because of Wen</li>
            <li>(it didn&#x27;t stink, just didn&#x27;t smell fresh &amp; clean).</li>
            <li>But it leaves my scalp and hair clean and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>Oh and then there is the fancy ultra super comb</li>
            <li>I ordered the ten ounce size to start..and everyone including the creator says the more you use the better..</li>
            <li>I LOVED THIS PRODUCT, IT REALLY DID MAKE MY HAIR FEEL SOFT, LIKE</li>
            <li>BUT it also made my hair super puffy.</li>
            <li>All products were delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Super easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shipment arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair super greasy too.  </li>
            <li>Receieved quickly.</li>
            <li>It made my daughters hair super greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and smells great, and looks great for at least two days afterward!  </li>
            <li>I must first say that I am on my 2nd bottle of Wen, because I originally thought I LOVED this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes and even made sure I used a lot in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have high lights in my hair and they stand out more, it brings the color in your hair out and does not fade it.  </li>
            <li>got nervious right away and went and checked my whole head to find more bald spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is much more manageable and healthy looking and it cuts down on my shower time as well as styling time which is perfect especially since i am 7 months pregnant and have a 5 year old son.</li>
            <li>you DO purchase this product, be very aware of the 60 return policy.  </li>
            <li>I have normal hair that has become more &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; as I&#x27;ve gotten into my 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Be sure to massage the scalp for a few minutes, make sure your hair is saturated with the cream, then add a bit of water and massage more.  </li>
            <li>My roommate got the WEN system and had me try it, and after the first day, I saw the difference, there was an immediate shine to my hair, Ive only used the Sweet Almond Mint, and it works perfectly, that i dnt even want to try anything different .</li>
            <li>I love trying new products and have tried the off brand</li>
            <li>So I tried this new product and I love it.</li>
            <li>I received the shipment yesterday and tried the Sweet Almond Conditioner right away.</li>
            <li>It feels like its such a waste, but I wanted to make sure I am doing it right to get the best results!</li>
            <li>I thought it was too dry to ever look good</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t do anything really.</li>
            <li>Upon initial use, made my hair beautiful, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did was because a good friend of mine did Chaz&#x27; first infomercial</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will get better by the time I finish the bottle, but that will probably be very soon since you have to use so much in one shower!</li>
            <li>I called the service center to request a cancellation of my shipment and the girl was so pleasant and polite, offering to send me sample of another product.  </li>
            <li>Well....2 months later a huge box arrives with a 6 month supply of wen!!</li>
            <li>And I noticed a difference after the first use!</li>
            <li>I used Wen the first day and noticed an incrediable difference in my hair!</li>
            <li>This product really does work!!</li>
            <li>I have found that the conitioner/ cleanser works very well all alone!!  </li>
            <li>but I have SO MUCH HAIR!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try Wen and the first five days</li>
            <li>I cannot stop touching my hair - it is so soft!</li>
            <li>I really did!!  </li>
            <li>will advice people to first read the reviews before making a purchase,!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not mad that the product didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>The product arrived 3 weeks later than expected, but hey, they call it snail mail for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;The first week my naturally curly hair looked amazing and felt GREAT!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the &amp;#34;Stick&amp;#34; balm but the other three products work beautifully.</li>
            <li>most people I had seen the infomercials for Wen and honestly thought, like all television products, this one would be a dud; either it would never clean my scalp or would leave my hair so oily looking</li>
            <li>The cleansing conditioner feels wonderful, it is very thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li>i was hoping that it would be amazing, now after 4 washes every time the next day, i have oily hair.</li>
            <li>but well worth it</li>
            <li>Pomegranate is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>I hope this review has left you with some tips that I had to discover on my own.</li>
            <li>I was SURE I was going to be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth trying @</li>
            <li>:) I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>My hair did have twice the volume but that was mostly because my natural curls were frizzing up</li>
            <li>Ever after 8 months after not using Wen my hair was not as vibrant and strong as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product, altho not enough to spend the money on it again</li>
            <li>All the products are great and my hair is always soft, manageable, and my color last longer.  </li>
            <li>I lost over $100.00 for a product thats not even worth $10.00.  </li>
            <li>The re-moisture intensive hair cream is my favorite part because it just makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I feel like it is kind of a process to use especially if your in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>It is sooooo soft and looks soooo much better.</li>
            <li>It dose have mint ingredent so it helps your scaple feels fresh.</li>
            <li>I tried following them the first day and the outcome was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Also rinsing your head with cool water when you first get in the shower does indeed make a difference.  </li>
            <li>a healthy 34 year old woman and have never had any issues with my hair or health, and haven&#x27;t changed anything in my diet or routing besideds</li>
            <li>these items were worth buying, I would buy them again...</li>
            <li>So I contacted the phone number in my box and customer service told me I received a SAMPLE set worth $9.99 and what for what I paid</li>
            <li>I am a professional hairdresser, and I do love how my hair glows as a result of these products.</li>
            <li>I have to say that the Wen is really worth it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth your time.</li>
            <li>However, for me, it left my hair feeling kind of tacking.  </li>
            <li>I believe most people use too much, saturate the crown of the head too much, and do not rinse well.</li>
            <li>Not a product that is worth the money at all.  </li>
            <li>You are better off using homemade, natural remedies that moisturize your hair.</li>
            <li>and I rarely give into informercials.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked and continue to use is the comb.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money, just not in my budget.</li>
            <li>Little did I know I was enrolled in a club in which they sent me MORE WEN!!</li>
            <li>I have fine and oily hair and also exercise regularly so its important for my hair to look and feel clean</li>
            <li>Usually my hair looks great the day I wash it, and then quickly deteriorates from there.</li>
            <li>shipping was pretty quick although they provided no tracking number.</li>
            <li>To achieve a clean scalp, I&#x27;m often left with the choice of drying my hair out even more or go with an oily scalp to save some moisture in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The original $39 a month was just too much for me to spend, even when diluting the product.</li>
            <li>And my &#x27;color-treated&#x27; hair normally looks much better than most anyways (even without the Wen) because I never blowdry or use styling products on it, so its not like I was starting out with &#x27;straw&#x27; to begin with.  </li>
            <li>After a day, my hair lost it&#x27;s wave, became flat and honestly, a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I saw the Try Wen infomercial, ordered, and am now convinced that a person or the ordering software should be specifically asking, \\&quot;What hair type are you?\\&quot; in order to receive the right Wen for your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the dry-hair formula with Olive Oil, which now, sounds about right for me.</li>
            <li>It gives the appearance that you haven&#x27;t showered for days, right after use.</li>
            <li>but it was greasy looking right away.</li>
            <li>no shampoo or hair product EVER works quite right for me.</li>
            <li>(after I figured out which shampoo was right for my hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try canceling your account.  </li>
            <li>The price was right, and I wanted to try the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you used right, it will work.</li>
            <li>Each product is for a differnt hair type go to the Wen Website to find what is right for you.</li>
            <li>You neeed to use the right amount of product for your hair length.</li>
            <li>i have been searching for some new kind of shampoo and conditioner, ive used organic and sulfate free, hopeing to undo the damage i regularly do to my hair.</li>
            <li>I thought it wouldn&#x27;t clean very well</li>
            <li>I had watched the Wen with Chaz Dean commercial so many times before I bought the wen sweet almond mint</li>
            <li>this makes my hair feel really nice,sleek and clean...</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t clean your hair....</li>
            <li>&quot; I must give some high marks to my 2012 discovery, Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo - also available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>is it true that it really works because i have oily hair that i can.t get rid of i</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking about a large handful of hair!</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin that breaks out easily I would advise you not to use purchase this product.</li>
            <li>Love the Wen products, my hair is soft and much easier to deal with than before.</li>
            <li>It did make my hair soft, shiny and easy to brush through.</li>
            <li>I consider it a good buy for the results it produces, and anticipate saving money on trips to the salon for trims since there is less splitting now as well.</li>
            <li>Luckily I saw the WEN infomercial and, as I was ready to try anything, I ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Delivery was SUPER fast, and I did not specify expedited.</li>
            <li>I love my thick hair, but since I started using Wen, I noticed that it started losing body and kind of lifeless and thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I use less my hair does not come out as good.</li>
            <li>My hair was immediately calm, smooth, soft and shiny but with body.  </li>
            <li>my daughter, didn&#x27;t see any good change, only got grease and with a built up, I used small amounts and it never feel clean, when I used more</li>
            <li>Through Wen&#x27;s website when you purchase at $29.95 it automatically enrolls you to receive more each month at $29.95 + $7.95 S&amp;H; for someone like me who forgets to cancel those kinds of programs and get a surprise charge to my credit card, it&#x27;s worth the extra $20 to try it out the first time.</li>
            <li>I was interested in the &#x27;no laurel sulfate&#x27; and wanted to try a more healthy product without harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>If you order from Wen ( even if it&#x27;s a present) READ THE FINE PRINT!</li>
            <li>I received my order very fast.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, very straight hair that is always flat.  </li>
            <li>I was one of the lucky ones who had beautiful dark hair my entire life.</li>
            <li>Thing is, she is so used to the lather a normal shampoo produces, she just can&#x27;t convince herself her hair is clean.</li>
            <li>I also want to mention that I wasn&#x27;t too excited about getting a comb, as I have never been a comb user, because I&#x27;ve never really been able to get one through my hair.</li>
            <li>Hell, I can pass a fine tooth comb my natural hair.</li>
            <li>When I used the product for the first time, I had a good feeling about it, but nearly halfway through the day my hair was oily, shiny and flat.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so good with so little effort.</li>
            <li>After watching the infomercial, I was SO EXCITED to try this new Wen product.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly as it says on the bottle, yet my hair looks blah.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed the results within my first use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use Organix from the pharmacy it give me better results, especially the coconut milk one.</li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t the biggest problem, I broke out all over my face and neck and body from it, and on top of that it did not get rid of the frizziness, it made my hair more frizzy and gave it this weird fro from the top.</li>
            <li>After the first time, I thought eh, it&#x27;s o.k</li>
            <li>I run and get pretty sweaty.  </li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve now had two weeks to evaluate the product and have to admit I&#x27;ve gone from skeptical to very happy.  </li>
            <li>I just washed my hair for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>It feels different that is for sure</li>
            <li>just say Herbal Essence left my hair more moisturized that this.</li>
            <li>Know that when you go online and order this product that the first time it is the $29.95</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t follow the directions EXACTLY like</li>
            <li>&amp; I definitely wash my hair more than 5 times a month</li>
            <li>So I ended up cancelling my future orders because there is no way I would be able to afford this stuff...</li>
            <li>I am so very thankful for the reviews!  </li>
            <li>I think that I was thinking from the first shampoo a miracle would occur...</li>
            <li>wen works very well!</li>
            <li>and they told me to stop using this that the last client we had that used  this  came in for a perm that she had got many times before that</li>
            <li>I find that I do not need to use as much as is recommended -- it does feel divine on my hair in the shower!</li>
            <li>The comb and the deep hair repair are my favorite parts.</li>
            <li>I really would recommend it!</li>
            <li>Maybe I just didn&#x27;t give it enough time, but I think Wen is just ok...</li>
            <li>felt like by the end of the first week</li>
            <li>4 days back on my Organix Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner and my hair and scalp are healthy again.</li>
            <li>I returned the first box</li>
            <li>I TRIED THIS PRODUCT FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sent product back - more keeps coming.</li>
            <li>it turns out, after the first shipment, they send you 3 MONTHS of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I tried it out the first week</li>
            <li>I saw a difference after the first time using it and more people have commented on my hair in the last week than ever before!!  </li>
            <li>First things first.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>My hair is actually bouncy, which I never thought I could say about it, and way more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I first heard of Wen through one of those beauty guru ladies on YouTube</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m overall pleased with Wen</li>
            <li>I wish I went online to read the reviews before I ordered it instead of when I wanted to cancel it, or so I thought, the first time.</li>
            <li>I found a cheaper route, thinking it was cheaper, First the bottle was an 12 OZ.</li>
            <li>P.S I do love Wen though it has given me my hair back....</li>
            <li>I have more confident in myself because of my  hair is looking more like it did in my younger years, Praise God for small miracles,  </li>
            <li>I used the first bottle</li>
            <li>I found that my hair felt thinner and more breakage was present.</li>
            <li>Everyone says that not only does it kill hair and cause it to fall out that they don&#x27;t respond to phone calls or emails and keep taking money after ending service to the point that most have said they&#x27;ve had to cancel their cards</li>
            <li>and it works EXACTLY as it is described</li>
            <li>Thanks for the violation!</li>
            <li>I was at first sketical about this product but</li>
            <li>It even does a better job at controlling my dandruff than Selson Blue did.</li>
            <li>It did not make my hair better than regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>First off it took over 3 weeks to get my product in the mail.</li>
            <li>I got pissed at first because my hair was so frizzy and poofy.</li>
            <li>These scammers sent me more (billed me over $100) and now I have to send the unwanted product back.  </li>
            <li>much more should be left unsaid....</li>
            <li>By the way, when I told my hair dresser that I tried WEN, her exactly words were,</li>
            <li>I love how I could just apply it and leave it in and then rinse it out the next day.</li>
            <li>I must say, I am glad I finally did it!  </li>
            <li>It took the itch out of my scalp for the first time in about 3 years...</li>
            <li>going to a natural (Sulfate free, no parabens, no proplylene butylene glcols, petroleum, sulfates, alcohol, PEGs, TEA, DEA, NPE, phthalates, (GMO), silicones, triclosan (pesticides)</li>
            <li>I tried it twice, then I thought Ok enough.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and smooth looking.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Almond Mint!!</li>
            <li>I thought at first</li>
            <li>so I did re read the instructions and adjusted stuck to the exact amount of product and did leave in some for as a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The moist mask treatment worked really well though!</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I thought it was so-so.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly as I ordered.  </li>
            <li>At first I was like alright....</li>
            <li>After the first wash, you need to let it settle in.</li>
            <li>They had this amazing deal for 30 bucks and for 40 bucks, bringing several different items, including a free travel kit for making the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I believe their marketing team is fully aware of it, which is why it is done in the way they do it.  </li>
            <li>This should have been my first indicator that this was not for me</li>
            <li>FIRST off...</li>
            <li>Thanks Wen!</li>
            <li>cause they have the same trail pack thing like this but its alot more product</li>
            <li>I love the comb and use the hair smoother daily--its terrific.  </li>
            <li>, my hair didn&#x27;t look any different with or without it, so I quit using it since it was just more product&lt;</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>When I first started using Wen</li>
            <li>If this was the case, why did the hair loss start with the first use of Wen?</li>
            <li>My hair color is not fading after using this product, it definitely is shinier, has a thickier feel and has more body.</li>
            <li>But Wen by Chaz Dean really works!</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I am sure I am not the only person this happened too.  </li>
            <li>So anyone who has dealt with them and their business practices know exactly what I am talking about.</li>
            <li>The texture of my hair changed from soft and smooth to a wooly, brittle, frizzy, and wiry texture.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel that the product left on my hair</li>
            <li>I too, at first, felt my hair was still greasy after shampooing.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s suppossed to be even better called six Thirteen which I will be trying next.</li>
            <li>all, be-all when I first tried it.</li>
            <li>However, this product works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>and I have no ill will towards Wen...</li>
            <li>First world problems.</li>
            <li>...wish I could afford it on a regular basis...when I have a couple of bucks I&#x27;ll get more.</li>
            <li>I tried the Wen hair products a few months ago, I think it has good ingredients but is over priced.</li>
            <li>Renker also works with Proactive which I used for a few years, I never had a problem and customer service is good.</li>
            <li>My hair was immediately at least 90% better: softer, shinier, so easy to comb through!  </li>
            <li>, I have very fine long hair</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be great on my hair since some times the ends seem to dry out, but no it only made my hair look greasy and unwashed.</li>
            <li>My hair typically is oily and does better with cheap products like herbal essences.</li>
            <li>DO NOT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TO RUIN YOUR HAIR!!!!</li>
            <li>Once you figure out how much rinsing is just right, you have it made.</li>
            <li>have not tried any of the other wen products, but since fig, and sweet almond mint are considered to be the most moisturizing</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try the original formula, Sweet Almond Mint, in a one-time kit shipment from a seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li>First, dealing with GR has been an unusually POSITIVE experience for me.</li>
            <li>I have reordered some of those other products because I really liked them.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that no matter how much or how little I tried using, it didn&#x27;t do anything good for my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have hair that&#x27;s easily weighed down or easily becomes oily; avoid using the texture balm.</li>
            <li>Trick is go easy on how much you apply and go easy on any other product you use for styling.</li>
            <li>Knowing that my hair can withstand the harsh coloring treatments I get and still look healthy and shiny is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>it rinses out clean and leaves my hair fairly soft and not tangly.</li>
            <li>But with WEN, not only is my hair &amp; scalp super clean</li>
            <li>Even use it on my grand children&#x27;s long hair and now their Mom wants to too!  </li>
            <li>so I have been looking for cleansing products that will treat it more gently than the traditional sulfate-based shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I told her that I had ordered Wen because I watched the TV commercials, and it implied that Wen was much more gentle than regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Normally my hair will stay down until maybe lunch time, on a good day, before it&#x27;s so out of control from frizz, I give up and put it into a bun or ponytail.  </li>
            <li>though it costs a little more it is SO worth it!  </li>
            <li>wow was she right!</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of hair care to make my hair look thick and healthy, for the most part it weighed my hair down so much that there was no way for it to look full and healthy.  </li>
            <li>the CSR told me that others have found it to be true that they get better results with less product.</li>
            <li>Was supposed to work within 3 washes, I didn&#x27;t notice a positive change in my hair.</li>
            <li>I finished, my hair felt luxuriously clean, with more body and less frizz, with gentle movement.</li>
            <li>place I ordered it from was okay since it took so long to get to me</li>
            <li>Partly, because I really do have pretty  unmanageable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty suspicious to me that you don&#x27;t see much of that on the reviews on the Wen site.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 weeks now and at first my hair did get very sticking and oily but after about a month it went away.</li>
            <li>About two years ago I decided to begin blending the increasing amount of grey hair on my head using more highlights.</li>
            <li>I liked the price for the items received and the comb other than that; the product itself is not that great!&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner&#x3D; Doesn&#x27;t leave the hear like a real conditioner</li>
            <li>I used it exactly per directions and it set my scalp to itching unbearably and did absolutely nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I said,\\&quot; really is this funny to you.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>As long as my hair likes it, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full natural curl state,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good started kit if you are not sure it will work for you.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Sweet Almond Mint\\&quot; formula appeared to have ingredients that are beneficial for hair that isn&#x27;t naturally oily.</li>
            <li>I never experienced the bouncy, beautiful hair that I saw in the infomercial.  </li>
            <li>Fig is for thicker, curly or color treated hair, Sweet Almond Mint and Pomegrante are universal formulas, Tea Tree for Scalp issues, Lavender for fine hair provides volume, Cucumber Aloe fine hair that tends to have oily scalp and dry</li>
            <li>Amazingly, with the Wen I kept it down all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The kit contained all the products pictured here: Sweet Almond Mint Conditioner (12 oz.), Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment (2 oz.), Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cream (2 oz.), Sweet Mint Texture Balm (.35 oz.), and a black wide-tooth</li>
            <li>however, do the exact same thing my sister did back in April, which was dye my hair prior to using the product, so my hair looked so shiny and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>My hair had been feeling limp and fine for the last several years and now it is full and has amazing body!</li>
            <li>The mask was great for a deep conditioning treatment and the texturizing stick is hardly needed, unless you want to tame a fly away</li>
            <li>I do wish Wen would devise a Conditioning Shampoo that would work better for those of us with oily hair but using normal shampoo from time to time isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s back to using oils or grease or styling gels, and most definitely shampoo, while I wait for the next big thing that will greatly aid in ethic hair</li>
            <li>Those, too, were less than spectacular.</li>
            <li>If your hair is normal or coarse it would work better.</li>
            <li>I followed directions in guide,and the end result was super soft hair with tons of volume.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions 100 percent and my hair has never been more dry.  </li>
            <li>She feels her normal shampoo and conditioner, Garnier Fructis does a better job at a lesser cost.</li>
            <li>I saw instant results -- after the first wash my hair was smooth &amp; glossy and felt like silk.  </li>
            <li>So far almond oil has help tremendously.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Made my hair greasy and flat not full and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Between the response from customer service, which pretty much summed it up that the whole thing is a marketing gimmick, to literally being cut off by the customer service representative as I was stating my dissatisfaction with everything.</li>
            <li>my hair was super shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>I air dry my air and its thicker, more volume and shiny.</li>
            <li>Easy to comb hair out, but hair is oily next day.</li>
            <li>After using hair vitamins and some oil treatments, I&#x27;ve got my shine back, but my hair is still not as strong as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>I bought this from Sephora after one of the employees strongly recommended it for my hair--I used it the next day, and came out of the shower with my hair in knots.</li>
            <li>Certainly nothing like the results advertised.  </li>
            <li>So I end up paying $180 per year to use this as a conditioner and another $20 for 2 large bottles of Pantene coming out to $17 per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Well, almost immediately I started losing large amounts of hair while washing it in the shower.</li>
            <li>but I certainly did not.</li>
            <li>I was expecting some positive results but nothing really huge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to spend a little extra time keeping track of your orders/order dates, then I feel certain you will be more than pleased.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend bought Wen for me as a thoughtful gift - that was my ONLY positive experience with Wen.</li>
            <li>They trick you into signing up for extra product to be purchased by shoving some sort of agreement in the fine print.</li>
            <li>My fine blonde dyed hair with gray is youthful again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After more research I&#x27;ve found that the concept of not using traditional shampoo - instead using conditioners or sulfate free cleansers - is not a new one.</li>
            <li>It is frizzy and very dry most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I have short little fly aways all over my head.</li>
            <li>she just put a little oil in my hair and it dried naturally into perfect frizz free and soft curls all over.</li>
            <li>I have blonde medium-thick straight to light wavy hair..</li>
            <li>Thanks Chaz Dean and Amazon.</li>
            <li>I ended up wasting so much money that they wouldn&#x27;t refund.</li>
            <li>You really have to work it in, and you really have to wash it out.</li>
            <li>but I have to use lots of products depending if it&#x27;s curly or straight and also depending the temperature and even thought my hair</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really afford getting them too often and QVC does let you adjust how often you receive shipments.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any results.  </li>
            <li>My hair does have improved shine, very manageable.  </li>
            <li>Now my hair is tangle free even into the next day.  </li>
            <li>I had to do a lot of work to get my hair to go silky and straight.  </li>
            <li>again followed the instructions and after washing my hair I followed it up with the re-moist mask, leaving it on for about an hour and rinsed very well.  </li>
            <li>My hair really has gotten softer and silkier the longer</li>
            <li>&quot; it made my hair very flaky almost like sand from the beach</li>
            <li>I like the way my hair feels and it looks so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>scalp wasn&#x27;t very cleansed, still had some residue from my hair products when I used it.</li>
            <li>REALLY WELL, SMELLS WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;AS</li>
            <li>AND IT WAS SOO MUCH EASIER AND QUICKER</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase another Wen refill because it is very costly.</li>
            <li>They have been very flexible with me and ship the products I want out when I want it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so fast b/c of how much product you have to use each time in order for it to work and</li>
            <li>After that not so much.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product really at all.</li>
            <li>I dont think much for the texture balm, the comb, and the styling creme.  </li>
            <li>and I really couldn&#x27;t afford to.</li>
            <li>I have come to really like the Wen cleansing conditioner shampoos.  </li>
            <li>not so much...</li>
            <li>my hair has always been frizzy and i really havent seen improvemnt in that area.</li>
            <li>Smells ok, not really into mint hair stuff though.</li>
            <li>I really would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I Wonder do the people who advertise using this really use it?</li>
            <li>I find I must put something in my hair to soften and moisturize my very curly ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>Mine, not so much.</li>
            <li>Instead, I used a brush, which worked better than my attempt with the wide tooth comb.  </li>
            <li>I really tried to hang in there</li>
            <li>But very time consuming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much of a coincidence</li>
            <li>They really make my hair nice,soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I just cant justify spending so much on something that really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>It was very noticeable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hoping it keeps working</li>
            <li>For the price I really expected more.  </li>
            <li>We should all be very leary about a product that goes through a business run this way.  </li>
            <li>I just went straight into ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I was ready to comb my hair</li>
            <li>&quot; [HAHA]</li>
            <li>and it really helps keep the color longer.</li>
            <li>Could this really be the wonder product for my frizzy, curly hair?</li>
            <li>If you believe in your product so much it might be wiser to give the option of automatically restocking your customers as opposed to forcing it on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was going to be really greasy because it did not lather.  </li>
            <li>I used to use a mousse, frizz control creme (thanks to Florida), and hairspray.  </li>
            <li>and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>No matter how straight I blowdry my hair, Florida&#x27;s humidity wreaks havoc with my curls.  </li>
            <li>The remoist mask is fantastic as a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it leaves your hair very greasy and/oil feeling.</li>
            <li>I tried undoing it for three days straight--I just had to suck it up and make a hair appointment, where they had to cut through them (including five inches of hair), which I really didn&#x27;t want to do.</li>
            <li>Thanks Wen.</li>
            <li>Wen did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>very easily).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like Wen but, with the economy the way it is</li>
            <li>really what happened to the 1 time shipment.</li>
            <li>Boy I guess I really need to talk to someone before believing what they put in their ads....</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy unmanageable hair and was hoping this product would help.</li>
            <li>but this one is the real thing because it comes with a wen booklet</li>
            <li>The texture and moisture level of my hair and scalp are much improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took the time, followed the instructions precisely and washed my hair with this product several times in order for my hair to \\&quot;get used\\&quot; to the product.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight, silky hair anyway, but this product gives me off the charts shine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all in how much you RINSE your hair after cleansing.</li>
            <li>Both of them have given me very satisfactory results.</li>
            <li>(I do torture my hair into submission, so I really shouldn&#x27;t complain when I get what</li>
            <li>and I really wish I could keep using it.  </li>
            <li>Really if you have been searching for a product and you don&#x27;t have hair like mine or you have the money, you really need to try this product.</li>
            <li>These people are scam artists that buy the product under the buyers name throught Wen, for a much cheaper price, and keep the profit.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I really resent this mis-representation and canceled the membership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t need to purchase as much as they think</li>
            <li>If anything my hair does not fall out as much.</li>
            <li>I am, and always have been, very picky about my hair care products.</li>
            <li>I continue to order online and have to be responsible about the auto ship.</li>
            <li>I feel my hair has gotten much stronger and softer after using this.</li>
            <li>I really do hope the Wen system will work for you as well as it did for me.</li>
            <li>much, much nicer than when I used to use shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if I had straight to wavy hair it would work but not for curly.</li>
            <li>I went straight up stairs to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please people be very cautious of this.</li>
            <li>I am seeking legal help, contacting the fda, QVC,WEN and anyone else that is connected to this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Chaz.</li>
            <li>AND so much easier than washing and conditioning.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser said something about there being too much protein in the product.</li>
            <li>I have not seem much difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much change.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m going to be straight up.</li>
            <li>But the real test would come after I blew it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it help me out so much</li>
            <li>but after using, I noticed so much of my hair coming out when I combed it and in 3 years I have never had that problem...</li>
            <li>So it runs out fast if you have any amount of hair.</li>
            <li>makes your hair very gummy.  </li>
            <li>They add some products in the \\&quot;kit\\&quot; but what you really use is the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>My expectation was that this product should let me straighten my hair out easier if it can really soften the texture.</li>
            <li>Someone who loves your product gave me a bottle to try and I used the whole bottle</li>
            <li>I can re-order when I am ready.  </li>
            <li>she said it really works on her..</li>
            <li>Then fast forward to August of 2013.  </li>
            <li>Really????  </li>
            <li>So as I am expressing to the customer service representative on how I think their whole concept is a gimmick to rob money from consumers, the customer service representative literally begins to speak over me, while I am talking, just trying to cut me off, telling me that I just need to return the items, and I will be refunded the charges and hung up.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t use as much product.  </li>
            <li>I used the product as per the directions and found that it really didn&#x27;t work on my hair.  </li>
            <li>everything else dries my hair out too much</li>
            <li>Also, the suggested amount to use for each section of your hair is way too much in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>Can make hair look very oily</li>
            <li>but when just made it very greasy.</li>
            <li>It seemed to moisturize my hair and really bring out the curl.  </li>
            <li>I started to get really scared and wondered what was causing it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Wen.</li>
            <li>So I threw the whole thing in the garbage.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t want to believe that this product would really make me lose my hair.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser admitted that my hair felt much thinner.</li>
            <li>Also--if you have longer hair, you are not going to believe how much of the product they recommendthat you use--several pumps (like 6) on each section of hair.</li>
            <li>Brought the color back and my kinky hair was smooth like when my stylist does it, saving me $30.00.</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged from over-processing, coloring, bleaching...the works.  </li>
            <li>My hair is also very fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had called them telling them I wasn&#x27;t ready for a shipment in April.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was cleaning my hair very well, either.</li>
            <li>I am almost ready to reorder and I think this time I&#x27;ll try the Lavender.</li>
            <li>I really expected it to be mostly hype and/or</li>
            <li>SHIPPING WAS FAST COSTUMER SERVICE WAS PROMPT AND VERY HELPFULL</li>
            <li>but you really have to follow the instructions</li>
            <li>I make sure my hair is thoroughly WET - all the way to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I really have no use for this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The accessories that come with it work really well, and the Wen conditioner works well as just that, a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I went back to the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>I really feel like the Wen comb (or a good wide tooth comb) is essential.</li>
            <li>Another suggestion was a second wash after the first rinse, or using tea tree oil or the cucumber for your scalp and the fig or sweet almond mint for the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you made the mistake of signing up with Wen directly and decide to cancel automatic-auto-renewal, be sure to cancel ALL of your memberships as they break-up the product lines into different accounts.</li>
            <li>I liked it .It is different then my regular shampoo .</li>
            <li>My hair is softer and more manageable, but I must alternate my normal shampoo because my hair becomes weighed down after too many uses.</li>
            <li>My hair was really soft, fell nicely in place and didn&#x27;t seem to tangle nearly as much as when I used other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh, like you I have seen the commercial and was so excited I could get it for less on amazon, but the only things I liked were the excitment of getting started and the sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>Right away my hair did feel soft.</li>
            <li>Other products I have for blowing curly hair straight seemed to work much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how much it will affect my hair after numerous uses.</li>
            <li>Seriously, using cheap suave is way better on my hair this this.</li>
            <li>you could find other products that could be better to your hair and hair type.</li>
            <li>First time i used it i immediately noticed how soft my hair was!</li>
            <li>I am glad that I tried it in this way and would recommend anyone who is curious about the Wen system to try it first before they order it with the automatic shipment requirement directly from Wen.</li>
            <li>and I sent back the remainder of my original products.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of weeks I used this stuff, my hair was so soft!</li>
            <li>but I save more because I dont use a ton of gel and other hair care stuff.</li>
            <li>I cancelled my memberships, they continue to bill me, and supposedly send more products, although I haven&#x27;t received anything other than my bank stating I paid Wen, again.</li>
            <li>and I should try their other line which will be more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>so i will be getting some more for my other 2 daughters.</li>
            <li>Maybe this won&#x27;t happen to you, but it did to me,and it has happened to many other people (do some online research) and</li>
            <li>I went to my stylist to see what we could do to change my hair texture and color back to its original glamorous condition.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try Wen, especially after watching the glorified infomercials and hearing reviews.  </li>
            <li>(hers: fine, straight, dry, shoulder length, processed.</li>
            <li>It looks like the newer QVC formulas begin with more plant extracts vs the one time shipment which had a few alcohols listed as the first three ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>concern was that my hair wouldn&#x27;t actually get clean.  </li>
            <li>Following the directions and separating the hair into four sections and using the comb keeps my hair looking clean all day.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use an off brand basic shampoo just to &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean once a week or so.</li>
            <li>No tangles at all (my hair is long and fine and tangels</li>
            <li>think that for someone with straight hair, this would probably be a decent product.  </li>
            <li>(Mine is long and fine and I like 12 pumps.)</li>
            <li>Just a clean smell overall.</li>
            <li>Seriously this stuff is really good</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but there&#x27;s a lot of it and tends to be oily at the scalp and dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li>set thinking I was going to the normal size set of Wen that I once purchased before(from the original WEN Company)for the same price this company is selling it for.</li>
            <li>My hair type is fine and oily at the scalp and dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li>This is my third purchase of Wen By Chaz Dean Sweet Almond 5 piece set from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>From the first day my hair was soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>b/c I would find twice as much hair in my drain than I normally find after I washed it with Wen(which</li>
            <li>I like the fact that there was no foaming, because then I got the chance to actually handle my massive mound properly and gave it a good wash.</li>
            <li>It was good , but not s good as the Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stated I only paid $9.95 for the product, when my credit card was charged the full price of $32.00 +</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the full amount recommended and only wash my hair 3 times a week</li>
            <li>After the first shipment the charge shipping and $90 for a three month supply which is a complete rip off.</li>
            <li>I have only used the Sweet Almond Mint &#x27;flavor&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>most def not worth the money.</li>
            <li>B0048O2R1E WEN® Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]] has a DIFFERENT and in my opinion gentler ingredient list than the one on wenhaircare.com!  </li>
            <li>I have fine, but coarse, hair, naturally curly, and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;shampoo/conditioner\\&quot; for my hair, which is fine and thick, made my hair a bit too soft and fly away; the texture balm calmed it down.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I was thinking that this was going to weigh my hair down</li>
            <li>I just will be ordering directly from WEN where I will get my monies worth because now as I see the price suddenly went up right after this</li>
            <li>When we finally got to the full treatment of highlights which would typically cause a lot of damage, she was just amazed at how healthy my hair continued to be.</li>
            <li>while it did help, it didnt give me the SHINE I wanted - which is the real reason I&#x27;ve been shopping around for new hair products.</li>
            <li>I say try using less, comb it thru and add more if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten blood tests to rule out thyroid and hormone problems, and I am healthy, not pregnant, etc.</li>
            <li>I think thata business should have more integrity than that, and getting a customer like me who uses less</li>
            <li>It is most useful when you use small dabs of it to tame the most stubborn strands.</li>
            <li>Wen was able to get all the way to the root and fix the damgage that had beeen done by previous non-wen products.</li>
            <li>Despite that, I still do not use the recommended number of pumps and just work it through from scalp to ends until there is a decent amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall you may be better off spending the 30 bucks for one of the 16 oz bottles instead of spending 30 bucks for a 12 oz (in this package) and other products that so far seemso-so (but there is that comb!</li>
            <li>It feels great long after my hair has dried!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have also been informed: Both \\&quot;Wen\\&quot; and \\&quot;Hair One\\&quot; are mainly conditioners.</li>
            <li>I just sent back the product to meet the 60-day guarantee window, and I will have to do a lot of reconstruction on my hair to get it back healthy.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this particular item combo because it says in caps:</li>
            <li>I have blonde highlighted shoulder length light brown hair which is naturally wavy/curly.  </li>
            <li>I would buy that if I saw it in a store for a decent price.</li>
            <li>The balm dried out my hair more than what it all ready was and the comb was horrid.  </li>
            <li>So I went to the post office trying to return everything, and bought a priority box big enough for the 2 boxes and made sure I got a delivery confirmation</li>
            <li>have a sensitive scalp, by the way, so I massaged the cleansing conditioner into my scalp as well as combed it through my hair, and my scalp felt instantly soothed, moisturized and comfortable.</li>
            <li>My hair looks ok, no big difference from regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>What you mainly look at are the charges.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I thought the solution was to use more Wen and more often.  </li>
            <li>Also, when I e mailed Customer Service about the autofill issue, they replied immediately and answered my questions clearly and with a positive, customer oriented mindset.  </li>
            <li>I expected to be completely disappointed with the products and like so many others in my continual search for the perfect hair products, find it being dropped into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Plus, with my long hair, I had to use so much of the product that I figured the bottle wouldn&#x27;t last more than one or two weeks.  </li>
            <li>My curls are bouncy instead of droop, full instead of flat.</li>
            <li>I really liked it the first few times I used it, but then it started to make my blonde hair look brassy.  </li>
            <li>I had to be very careful or it would leave my fine hair very greasy.</li>
            <li>I have always had very strong thick healthy hair, that I am just starting to see again for the first time in a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product after watching the infomercial.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend NOT using their products or services.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li>I highly discourage anyone from using it.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes but my hair was frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product after watching the infomercial.  </li>
            <li>I knew the application procedure was way to high maintenance for me</li>
            <li>She highly recommended it to her fellow women.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>But once I used the flat iron it was smooth and shiny and SOOOOO soft.  </li>
            <li>and it worked ok, still a little too greasy for my taste.</li>
            <li>but that does not mean I have to like their sneaky business practices.  </li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money!!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH that I have thrown out my old shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I could have ordered the product directly from the retailer much CHEAPER</li>
            <li>but it does absolutely nothing for people with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Okay, too many reviews on here are too lengthy and honestly too boring to read.</li>
            <li>and so far I really like the Lavender and Cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you may never want to return to a traditional shampoo ever again and its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I used it a few more times anyway.</li>
            <li>I did have was nothing compared to my normal frizz factor.  </li>
            <li>YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THE COOLING, FRESH SENSATION FROM THE ALMOND MINT.ALSO</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to order a bunch of it in order for it to last &amp; be worth my while.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have lost of time to do my hair and was hoping this would help save some time... not the case.</li>
            <li>It does take a bit longer to use than normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I used a gift card to purchase this and didn&#x27;t waste my money.  </li>
            <li>...don&#x27;t bother, just another late night commercial scam packed nice but product s^&amp;t!</li>
            <li>Loved the extra trips to the docs and the extra money spent there.</li>
            <li>Normally I go a couple days between shampoos</li>
            <li>I should have received the Normal size set...</li>
            <li>I love the product, but this stuff is not cheap..</li>
            <li>I think the product is heavy and requires a multi-step application process, but it did not leave my hair any more sleek than my normal product.</li>
            <li>I have really long hair, and I only have to use about 6-7 pumps each use even though the label says that I should use much more.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, seems like alot of product to use (according to the instructions) and feels reall thick.</li>
            <li>I did think it was an effective cleanser, and my hair was moist after its use, but I would only re-purchase it if the price came WAY down.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am african american, but tend to have better results with mainstream shampoos due to my hair texture being more that of a mixed person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;let&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I got off Wen and switched to the Body Shop shampoo and conditioner which contains no hard chemicals.  </li>
            <li>keep in mind, i would eventually have to pay about 100$ on two bottles that surely wont last me but 2  months because i said my hair is very long.</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised that it added a slight refreshing tingle and wasn&#x27;t overpowering in scent or sensation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I mentioned above, I love comb-thru texturizers but they leave me extremely dry.</li>
            <li>Received as ordered and have used product three times and find my hair to be more soft and silky with less flyaway hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was gentle on my multi-racial fine and soft hair (African American/European American).  </li>
            <li>evening my hair looked just as clean as when it was first washed and the little bit of frizz</li>
            <li>Both are under $3 each and both are found right here on Amazon, but neither contains the added ingredients which target specific hair-type needs.</li>
            <li>I also thought perhaps this hair care is designed more for people who really style their hair like straighten or blow dry it, but I just air dry my hair</li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit of it made my hair look chunky, oily, and weighed down, which pretty much counteracted the fabulous results I got from the Wen shampoo itself.</li>
            <li>-- I am still rating this product 5 stars because I really like it, but after prolonged use on my fine hair, I found that my hair got heavy and greasy looking after awhile.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the shampoo and when they asked, \\&quot;would you like a free trial of Endless Youth Vitamins?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>and I had been thinking about getting a new hair product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- New Wen Ad - October 2013&lt;</li>
            <li>- you should always try new things because what works for you may not work for someone else and vice versa.</li>
            <li>and I live in FL</li>
            <li>[I don&#x27;t live in the US of A btw]</li>
            <li>however, i still received new shipments at my door.  </li>
            <li>When you order from Wen your visa number is saved and you will automatically be shipped a new supply of product after 30 days or 3 months (depending on what you order).</li>
            <li>They automatically send you new products.  </li>
            <li>; I even have new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I started trying the new scents as they come out</li>
            <li>This whole thing is a huge sham.</li>
            <li>The products are fine, but not worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li>I have natural afro-textured hair and yes it made my hair extremely soft and loosened my curls which leave me to wonder what really is in it</li>
            <li>&quot; you see advertised, you are actually binding yourself to a membership, which is why it&#x27;s so cheap at the initial purchase.</li>
            <li>Ok, no better than my normal Organix shampoo.</li>
            <li>and it got better, but if I tried to use it in the shower or on wet hair, the smell came back.</li>
            <li>It did feel very soft, but I decided to go back to using my regular, sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft (my son keeps petting it) and manageable.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very very soft but very very frizzy so overall this product do not deliver what claims to do.  </li>
            <li>this is a good shampoo to use only a few days a week and then alternate with another normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, but if you order from the WEN company they will sign you up for future orders without clearly stating it as such.  </li>
            <li>My hair reacted by becoming so dry and frizzy that it was starting to feel like hay and was breaking all of the time.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li>how convenient is it when you are only interested in trying the product?</li>
            <li>I will never buy this product again, and will discourage everyone I Love and care about not to waste their time nor money!</li>
            <li>disappointed I have to say I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.  </li>
            <li>If you purchase the first month they bill you for the next 2 months with no notice.  </li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;m going to try turning off the water during the first step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>especially the frizz the first time I used it .</li>
            <li>My hair is more fuller than usual, even as wavy.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I am completely blown away!</li>
            <li>My first &amp; last purchase from this company.</li>
            <li>When I used WEN for the first time, I could actually brush my hair.</li>
            <li>hair was \\&quot;too\\&quot; soft!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed my hair with this 2x so far and it works for me!</li>
            <li>I used the product to the exact instructions, the first time, as in the second time and the results were not the same.</li>
            <li>I used this product four times, each time following the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>The only difference was the day proceeding my first use of Wen, I had never seen my hair so matted and</li>
            <li>got it last Saturday and used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Funny, I assumed canceling THREE times would be enough to have them get the</li>
            <li>the most important step rinse with as cold as water as you can stand and rinse really well.</li>

            <li>, I also the first night I got it used the re moist sweet almond mint intensive hair treatment, I left that on for several hours for a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>She has thick, straight, very full hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s not meant for my hair type ( super thick and very long) and maybe others had a better experience using it</li>
            <li>received the kit a few days after placing my order (very quick shipping) and decided to give it a try immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have great very thick, very long hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very fine, dishwater blonde hair that I have peroxide highlights put in every few months.  </li>
            <li>styling cream seems like it could be a decent product on its own, but beware of using with any other products as it will congeal and leave you with little gelatinous chunks in your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you get a relaxer in particular, the fig can help you with breakage by keeping it in better condition as it grows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, while I have not had the problem of any sticky or oily issues, I did read on another blog that one issue with this could be the amount of time spent rinsing, especially afterward, which should be several minutes.</li>
            <li>I have long hair, almost to the middle of my back, so I use more product.</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;m on day 4 after washing my hair, and my hair is definitely gotten frizzier, but it still looks really good, especially compared to how it usually is.</li>
            <li>My scalp is pretty normal, although it can get flaky, which could be oil or dry or from the heat I use.</li>
            <li>My hair after just a blow dry was very manageable and straight.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4z afro-textured hair, dense with fine to wiry strands (meaning there is a mixture of strand types on this one little head of mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The comb is too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve thought about it, I love putting comb-thru texturizers in my hair which leave it in a state of not really permed but notreally natural either (and without a moisturizer it is highly dry), which is probably why neither Wen or Hair One worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;SIDE BAR</li>
            <li>I was excited to say the least for the first use, so after a month-</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and color treated a few inches below my shoulders.</li>
            <li>send you two large bottles with two styling creams/balms every three months (Charging $30 on your credit card per month) (4 items total).</li>
            <li>Large amounts of cleansing conditioner needed for even SHORT hair!</li>
            <li>I had  recieved 4 extra sets of the two set large orders.  </li>
            <li>careful what you are signing up for, they are very tricky!!</li>
            <li>I am mixed, black and white, so my hair is curly and gets frizzy pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I do recommend adding a little water to your hair when putting it in, the cleanser is thick and the water helps smooth it into your hair, and also the longer you leave it in the better, you can feel it working on your scalpel.</li>
            <li>It was no longer healthy, but it was dry and had split ends and was extremely damaged.  </li>
            <li>Most products leave my hair either really dry or extremely oily.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Surely my childhood favorite, Melissa Gilbert (Laura Ingalls), wouldn&#x27;t be a spokesperson for a bad product\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting more and more frustrated with this company.</li>
            <li>Soon my scalp started to clear up and Than just out of curiosity</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean my hair properly, and it makes it greasy at the roots and dry and brittle at the ends.</li>
            <li>But I will keep using my Wen products each time I clean my hair, and hopefully, over time, there will be less hair</li>
            <li>Its really sad since its such a great product.</li>
            <li>I just went directly to wenhaircare.com and bought it for 29.95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll learn his product isn&#x27;t completely natural</li>
            <li>so I was extremely surprised.</li>
            <li>nearly drove me to my knees.</li>
            <li>biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that my hair is really soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much shine or extra body like the product claims</li>
            <li>review seems more negative than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>So far, based on the ease of managing my hair, I&#x27;m thinking I will continue to use the product.  </li>
            <li>Was professionally packaged-like I&#x27;d ordered it from one of the TV commercials.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft but the wow came from how out of control</li>
            <li>I think it was because it made my hair soo soft</li>
            <li>My shoulder length hair is naturally curly with the tendency to frizz</li>
            <li>If this product was really going to work, this was the ultimate test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>THAT WHOLE 60 DAY MONEY BACK</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I have natural non relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this and washing my hair with any old conditioner in place of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair did have a shine and was soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The initial bottle has lasted a whole month</li>
            <li>My course hair is finally soft and managable.</li>
            <li>and I have never felt my hair that soft before.</li>
            <li>lastly, my favorite comb-thru texturizer, Elasta QP was discontinued late 2012</li>
            <li>Decided to get some natural Mercola shampoo and the almost immediately the hair loss stopped and the dandruff went away.</li>
            <li>It has never been so soft and i even noticed my hair was shinny.</li>
            <li>It really was such a miracle!!!!</li>
            <li>This is why I purchase from AMAZON or directly from Chaz Dean&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li>My adult girls talked me into using Wen</li>
            <li>I think I must be sensitive to the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and I do use it once in a while, but it does not work nearly as well as Wen.  </li>
            <li>I just want my hair to look shiny with the natural curl and controlled frizz.  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned WEN HAIR CARE IS OVERPRICED &amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s does make your hair soft</li>
            <li>Somehow the seller works it out so you will get the package directly from WEN</li>
            <li>this product I completely dig.</li>
            <li>but my hair feels soft and still feels and looks thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I was surprised on how well it cleaned my hair.  </li>
            <li>However, now when the humidity hits my hair, it turns into soft curls and waves instead of looking frizzy and out-of-control.  </li>
            <li>I would not waste the money or the effort buying this product.  </li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>it made my hair so silky soft, and</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>Even though Wen claims to have all of the essentials needed to restore your natural oils..</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I leave it in my hair while I&#x27;m finishing my shower and rinse it completely out before I get out.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend buying straight from the Wen website as the system is cheaper and they have a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>My hair isnt nearly as fuzzy as it use to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead you used my information to order the product directly from the retailer and I was enrolled anyways.</li>
            <li>41 years old and loosing hair -</li>
            <li>This product made my  hair stronger and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>i use it on my hair and my 2 year old grandaughter.it</li>
            <li>our hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>I have not used this product, but my 16 yr old has.  </li>
            <li>This is my first ever review, but I am a long time Amazon customer....</li>
            <li>The next day I decided to wash it again with wen and then blow it out straight.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old got up to look and said no mo</li>
            <li>Naturally, I called customer service.  </li>
            <li>The natural curls are still there.</li>
            <li>I use on my natural hair</li>
            <li>So much for this product, I went back to Pantene and my hair shines, shines, shines.</li>
            <li>(the \\&quot;way\\&quot; you are supposed to use the products) - and - even for me (who has naturally curly hair -which tends to be</li>
            <li>Besides all that, it smells like old lady shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This is the regime I&#x27;ve been following since and its been working very well for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was relaxing my hair to avoid the difficulty of combing my natural hair.</li>
            <li>This has encouraged me to grow out my natural hair and save some money.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>You must follow the directions completely.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair soft and with shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WEN leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and used the tea tree Wen.</li>
            <li>However, my hair is just as soft and managable with products I&#x27;ve bought at a drug store.  </li>
            <li>It is billed as being SO natural...</li>
            <li>There is a class action lawsuit underway.</li>
            <li>I am very grateful for my hair actually, but this stuff ruined it.</li>
            <li>It took about 1 to 2 weeks but eventually my hair stopped breaking and feels really soft again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost the entire bottle of product and I don&#x27;t see much result.</li>
            <li>I am a natural red-head with fine-medium hair (like Jessica Chastain and Amy Adams).</li>
            <li>They will enroll you in the auto-ship and the product comes directly from Chaz Dean charging you another $9.95 for shipping in addition to what I paid on Amazon</li>
            <li>This has been a complete fiasco.</li>
            <li>but u have to use it frequently to reap the benefits....</li>
            <li>oh so soft.</li>
            <li>and wow has my hair changed.  </li>
            <li>ALSO SO FAR 4 STARS FOR THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money and their customer service will argue with you on why you do not want automatic shipment.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a generous amount and leave it on at least 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>say it is worth to try it if you&#x27;re curious</li>
            <li>As i first started using this (the first few days)</li>
            <li>I am surre Chaz is an outstanding hairdresser, but his products left my hair feeling heavy and a wee bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also read most of the reviews on Amazon and found either people loved it or absolutely hated it.  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t be spreading the good word for WEN unfortunately.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product does work good.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t happen and I have paid 65.00 for a product I knew was good to get a fake and can&#x27;t seem to return it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using WEN for 5 years now, and NOTHING, and I mean, NOTHING makes my hair look and feel soft &amp; healthy like Chaz&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had problems with not rinsing it out well-enough, though I usually turn down the temp on the shower so that its between &#x27;cool&#x27; and the temp I normally bathe at (so warmer than luke warm, but not hot).  </li>
            <li>In the last couple of months, I&#x27;ve tried other conditioners and am open to replacing this one if I find one that would give me better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(which is more likely to happen with me than my daughter because my hair is fine, thin and long).</li>
            <li>I was not able to comb through my hair as easily as the infomercial showed,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, my hair tangles easily, but it&#x27;s usually nothing that some leave-in conditioner, detangler, and oil can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>There are other sulfate free shampoos that I feel do exactly what when does for less money.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, super soft, and there&#x27;s much less hair loss in the shower and while blowdrying.</li>
            <li>and I must say the supplier was FANTASTIC (the unusual UPS to USPS shipping method sent it to the east coast first when I am in Alaska - weird -</li>
            <li>and it also started to curl a little bit when it dries, which i dont know hwere that came from because i have pretty straight lifeless hair.</li>
            <li>at first i loved this shampoo but after a few months my hair stated to look dull and flat.</li>
            <li>There is definitely a need for this new product!</li>
            <li>Hair feels good after using this product but it also weighs the hair down and makes it hard to style.</li>
            <li>it is hard to find a good product what will not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So for me, having a single product that is conveniently delivered to my door for less cost as the other products I had been using is a good thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They told me I can not cancel the first order, but only future orders!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they only sent an address to send the items back to and then said you received exactly what you ordered &amp; they do not send out return labels.</li>
            <li>I am of African decent, living in the Caribbean, the heat alone will kill the stability of one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to darken my hair and heard that one of the benefits of Wen is that it makes your color last longer (and if you&#x27;ve ever died your hair red, you know how fast it fades!).</li>
            <li>I have since used it several times just to see if the first time was a fluke, but I keep experiencing the same results.  </li>
            <li>First use: My hair was very, very dry.</li>
            <li>but then I use another 3-4 pumps for all over my head with a little running water to help it spread throughout my hair and the full length.  </li>
            <li>You have high water pressure (mine is low so it would take forever to rinse the conditioner out, making my shower time seem like forever).</li>
            <li>You have to wash and rinse in cool/cold water and frankly, in the winter, I&#x27;m not down with that.  </li>
            <li>By that, I mean use warm (not HOT) water, make sure you rinse your hair for a few (two or so) minutes prior to application.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure I would say that I see a huge difference between the outcome of my hair with this product vs. using shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>As a way of describing my hair type: I&#x27;m of mixed african american and caucasian heritage, and have sort of fine, naturally curly (so frizzy) hair that tends to be dry and heat-stressed although it&#x27;s not chemically relaxed.</li>
            <li>haha, that&#x27;s a long time to build up hype.</li>
            <li>Or just a normal daily routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking a the normal ten strands, I&#x27;m talking triple that - and not just when I washed -</li>
            <li>I asked them should I send it back &amp; they send the normal set</li>
            <li>Now it is back to its normal thickness.</li>
            <li>I also mix the \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; (which is also the \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; - same bottle) - with my normal salon conditioner too.</li>
            <li>My color is fading just as it normally does with regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>So, I re-introduced my normal shampoo (Pantene - Volume) and cleared all the build-up away before following it up with the the Wen cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>It leaves a waxy coating on your hair, it took about a month for my hair to get back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Immediately, I would only lose the normal amount of hair that a person would expect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i spent a little more.</li>
            <li>My hair was prone to being dull and easily damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not exactly angry about the order, but I expected to receive what I ordered, especially since I ended up a whole item short.</li>
            <li>I think any product that has more negative reviews than positive ones is definitely not worth the money to experiment with, but if you need to fill up a birthday or christmas wish list, then get some family member to buy it for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After all, I live outside of Miami Florida, the hair frizz capital of the world.  </li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t live together, have different diets.</li>
            <li>went back to normal shampoo and my hair is not dull or flat anymore.</li>
            <li>while my hair is dry, I deal with a very oily scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, colored, medium length, frizzy hair not curly or stick straight....</li>
            <li>She absolutely LOVES it because her hair is wavy and gets dry in the summer, but this stuff smooths out the dryness/frizzies.  </li>
            <li>I just air dry &amp; wear it straight...</li>
            <li>After the 3rd usage, I started to see a very noticable differenc in shine, softness and overall health.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m now back to my regular shampoo/conditioner Garnier, which does the job at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>I figured maybe i should give it a few more tries before quitting on it..</li>
            <li>stick a tiny bit, then put it up in a towel turban and when I brush it out it is so much easier to do that with regular products!  </li>
            <li>I use the shampoo(it&#x27;s really conditioner) - mixed with my regular salon shampoo</li>
            <li>It went back to Loreal and Garnier, even though they aren&#x27;t that expensive the quality is superior.</li>
            <li>My hair felt very soft, although it still wasn&#x27;t enough to fight the humidity frizz of Austin, TX weather.</li>
            <li>have a lot of fine hair and products weigh it down, so there&#x27;s always the balance between dry ends and over treated, lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li>While the product seems to go fast, you dont have to use it every single day for results.</li>
            <li>They were very helpful in getting these charges off my credit cards and did not require me to return a single product.</li>
            <li>Me being an african american with pretty basic relaxed hair could not use the product as a \\&quot;conditioning cleanser\\</li>
            <li>No other compares.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I stopped using chaz dean product, my hair stopped shedding excessively but not before I lost a significant amount...</li>
            <li>For the first three weeks, I used this product solely (washing every other day).</li>
            <li>I used to get major</li>
            <li>I saw the infomercial and thought i&#x27;d give it a try, After a month there is a major difference.</li>
            <li>The FAKE version which, as many reviews state, makes your hair fall out!  </li>
            <li>If I like the product then I will simply order directly through Gunthy Renker!</li>
            <li>I live in New Mexico where the weather is very dry.  </li>
            <li>On my first use it stripped my hair color that was less than a week old.  </li>
            <li>With this product my brush smoothly goes through my hair when wet and then while dry as I brush it throughout the day--even the next day.  </li>
            <li>not sure my scalp felt clean either....</li>
            <li>However, this formula is better than the \\&quot;Spring Gardenia Green Tea\\&quot; formula, which left my hair dry &amp; lifeless.  </li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair that is fine in consistency</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe because I have Natural african american hair which is why I had no positive results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have curly, very dry, very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Let me start out by saying that I regularly color my hair, I have very thick, fine, straight, blondish hair .  </li>
            <li>Knowing full well that I am already outside of the 30-day trial period, I still want to send it back with a letter telling them that I am not interested in a refund</li>
            <li>I will say I&#x27;m not crazy about the texture balm because no matter how little I use, it makes my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li>After using it I started looking online and found that every other website is full of the same warnings and very low ratings.</li>
            <li>My husband kept laughing at me when I blow dried my hair out after the first time of using this product, because I kept shouting; \\&quot;Oh my god!</li>
            <li>Only clean your hair every three days, but I always raise my hair everyday because I workout.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I have curley hair that can be dry and this works really well for frizz and does not dry out the hair.</li>
            <li>&quot; There is no Fig package offered on the commercial, it&#x27;s pushing Sweet Almond Mint, the package I ordered - which smells a little mediciny, like menthol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long natural frizzy hair that I highlight, color and straighten!!</li>
            <li>and she had heard other positive comments.  </li>
            <li>Great if you like your hair feeling dirty and greasy all day long</li>
            <li>got the mint almond featured in the one time shipment and was worried the mint would be overpowering (generally don&#x27;t like mint in anything but my mojitos for that reason.)  </li>
            <li>only use a small amount and my my colored hair combs out smooth and</li>
            <li>and I think the problem was that she didn&#x27;t really rinse like she should have--or she didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.  </li>
            <li>went from being a total skeptic to a complete kool-aid drinking convert.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going to keep checking them out since I&#x27;ve only used them once so far.  </li>
            <li>I barely leave reviews</li>
            <li>(I have natural african w/</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair done by a professional and even with the color treated shampoo it still gets brassy.</li>
            <li>Believe me I know, it happened the 2nd time I used it after I thought I had completely rinsed the product out of my hair.</li>
            <li>so far I am not totally sold on the product..</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised to experience just the opposite of nightmare.  </li>
            <li>Same story, my natural curls started to frizz up</li>
            <li>Finally after I finished the bottle I used my old humectress</li>
            <li>Returned to regular shanpoo use, now my hair has kept the soft, and manageable style for weeks without the Wen products.</li>
            <li>conditions\\&quot; everyone checks off on, i apparently agreed for them to send me continuous packages and be charged.</li>
            <li>Not only had an account been set up in my name, with my payment information, but all of the contact information as far as phone number and email had been made up.  </li>
            <li>It was like this thing put back my hair to it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li>I said no and told him what happened and how I shipped my old product back</li>
            <li>My hair was definitely softer than before, but completely out of control.&lt;br</li>
            <li>did start out with the 5 piece set and so far have only used the cleansing cream and the comb.  </li>
            <li>After she used the product once, she commented how soft her hair became, considering she didn&#x27;t use a \\&quot;traditional shampoo and conditioner\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About 10 days later, after using the recommended amount of product, I was ready to open my next bottle.</li>
            <li>Be careful how much you use and unless you have long hair, do NOT use as much as directed on the back.</li>
            <li>If I wanted this I would have bought it directly from the TV commercial.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I am Asian and have naturally wavy course/thick hair at med/long length.</li>
            <li>The product definitely made my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>and I will NOT be reordering and will be going back to my old John Freida products.  </li>
            <li>My wife wanted to return this sub-par product which did the complete opposite of what they claimed...</li>
            <li>just goes to show that you have to know what you are buying and do your research, especially if your hair is sensitive to the two alcohols used in the Guthy-Renker version.</li>
            <li>Wen left her hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It takes just as long to use wen as it does to apply normal shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>used the included styling cream to blow-dry my hair and honestly can say I was not impressed with it, at all.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried the product yet, but after being rubbed the wrong way, even if I liked it, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I am sorry, but what kind of logic is that??  </li>
            <li>I am hispanic and have long thick hair, even Head and shoulders worked better for me than WEN products!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the anti dandruff shampoos made it worse, I love the Wen for my hair</li>
            <li>and it seem to get worse the more time I used it</li>
            <li>I have dark red color in my hair and red fades so quick</li>
            <li>following week I switched to the fig, and the results were much better, and dramatic: Super-glossy (not oily), soft, and ZERO</li>
            <li>After my hair was dry, I used the texture balm and styled normally.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t normal blow dry it.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recently viewed the new Wen infomercial which introduces a new product, Six-Thirteen - which is supposed to instantly hydrate damaged, dry, and chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>At first, I was skeptical because I always thought you HAD to shampoo to get your hair &amp; scalp really clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much use for the other products.</li>
            <li>The other problem is that you are supposed to use so much of it that the bottle that comes in the kit (I think it&#x27;s 12oz) lasted me 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>However, after happening on the Wen infomercial while channel surfing; I was immediately pulled in because I have EXTREMELY fussy straight hair and</li>
            <li>reading all other reviews, this product really doesn&#x27;t seem to be for everyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tonight, I used Wen cleansing conditioner and styling creme on my hair for the first time, carefully following the directions: thoroughly wet your hair; use the proper amount of pumps</li>
            <li>The comb is a bust (too bulky and thick to slide through thinner hair), but the rest is worth it!</li>
            <li>styling creme was very helpful for when I wanted to blow dry and flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice to try a sample it made my hair greasy, limp &amp; dull.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the fencepost as far as any big drastic changes from how my hair was with regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>After using a few more times made my hair oily and heavy.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t afford to spend that kind of money on daily hair care...especially since it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair!  </li>
            <li>The conditioner helps great with keeping my hair less oily and flaky as long as I wash it at least every other day.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, my sister used it on me, in combination with several other products she uses, back in April of 2013.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After calling back again and waiting an hour again to speak to a live individual I was finally informed by a \\&quot;supervisor\\&quot; the account would finally be canceled and I would receive my refund.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair that can be difficult to manage but with this product I was able to comb thru and work with my hair much easier and within less time,  </li>
            <li>Apparently I didn&#x27;t b/c it left my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I used Wen today for the first time and my hair is limp &amp; looks greasy.</li>
            <li>The product dried out my hair from the first use.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical because of the cheesiness of the infomercials (nothing can be that good) and the cost.  </li>
            <li>Oh, I also live in a very dry climate (in the desert).  </li>
            <li>i live in a very dry climate</li>
            <li>I have long (down to the middle of my back), coarse, full and curly hair.  </li>
            <li>But I can understand if you have straight and/or thinner hair how this stuff might weigh your hair down and make it seem oily/dirty.</li>
            <li>right before I started using it, and usually I start seeing split ends in a month</li>
            <li>and I have dry hair because it is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>I have dry course hair and there is no othee product that helps my natural hair retain moisture...</li>
            <li>My dry course hair is now soft, silky, and manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a good product at all, if you want something natural or sulfate-free use a L&#x27;oreal product that&#x27;s worth 5$</li>
            <li>I have to confess that I was very doubtful after seeing the infomercials, too good to be true</li>
            <li>I have used Ouidad for the last few years and even that has not been able to manage it this past year.</li>
            <li>I have mostly straight, thick, long hair, and my hair doesn&#x27;t take curl very well, however with just a nickel size amount of styling creme in it, when I curl my hair, it lasts 48 hours.</li>
            <li>I normally need a diffuser and a few products to get curls that look any where near the results from today (and it was a humid 85 degrees when I left the salon).</li>
            <li>Two handfuls of hair and a 40 minute shower later I dried my hair only to find it looked and felt exactly the same as before using Wen.</li>
            <li>My hair was SO soft and manageble, no longer dry and frizzy!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser was so worried my fine, thin hair would not hold up to this aggressive treatment.</li>
            <li>for my baby fine, thin, oily-prone medium length hair, it worked wonders after one use.</li>
            <li>The product came with a little informational pamphlet from Wen, which did not tell me to use quite as much product as I see is suggested on the Wen website.</li>
            <li>In other word, it doesn&#x27;t matter how much you return, as long as it is in one box, it can only count as one!  </li>
            <li>I did a fast wash and looked a little greasy mid day.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I have long, straight, oily hair and this product did not make my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>I went to Michigan to visit family during the past heatwave, and came back to the western part of the country with my hair looking/feeling like a rat&#x27;s nest, super dry.</li>

            <li> the customer service at WEN is excellent.</li>

            <li> Yes, this product works best when you follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li> Cheaper,and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> However, after using for about two months - I started to notice a HUGE amount of my hair falling out!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEN!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEN!!!</li>
            <li> This time my hair was even better!!!  </li>
            <li> All it did was make my hair incredibly greasy and not to mention doesn&#x27;t smell the best.</li>
            <li> Loving what this is doing for my hair!!  </li>
            <li> It is a very good product though.</li>
            <li> My hair was incredibly damaged before using this product and nothing else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li> I experienced excellent customer service.  </li>

            <li> All in all a good product that in this case works well!</li>
            <li> Good luck to my fellow ladies!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wast your money, go to a salon and buy something good from your hairdresser!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li> and it is beautiful...</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and it made her hair beautiful.</li>
            <li> the smell is beautiful ..</li>
            <li> My hair looked beautiful and shiny, and I already had really great hair.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be great</li>
            <li> Since I think it&#x27;s always a great idea to make impulsive purchases based solely on celebrity endorsements I decided to order some.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> and I think they work great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I got all the \\&quot;extras\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I found a great alternative at Sally Beauty called \\&quot;One Hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This item was great because I could try the product without committing to monthly mailings if I didn&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> product is great for a once in a while product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff</li>
            <li> if I style my hair it looks great...</li>
            <li> Their hair looks great, like movie stars.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Provides great moisture</li>
            <li> I did find it makes a great conditioner to use with a shampoo product.</li>
            <li> So I thought great</li>
            <li> Great don&#x27;t have to deal with monthly shipments.</li>
            <li> Well I get the products and the bill says welcome to Wen</li>
            <li> Kept my color longer and made my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> and they do a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, but it made my hair look greasy even without using it as a leave-in conditioner (and I don&#x27;t have oily hair).  </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Great results for me.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to report that the texture and appearance of my has improved drastically.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product and I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I happen to be one of the hair types it works great</li>
            <li> My hair is chin length and 6-8 pumps works great from me.</li>
            <li> set worked great, expect for the balm.</li>
            <li> The Wen haircare system is great.  </li>
            <li> If you have a detachable showerhead, then this product is great and you won&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li> I cried for joy over how great it it made my hair.</li>
            <li> This product may work great for others</li>
            <li> This is what I learned to accept as part of the great DNA passed from my parents and that there are no permanent fix.</li>
            <li> but after I used it and seen how great it is</li>
            <li> The service was great from Ginger Lily Boutique.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> and I found the results were great.</li>
            <li> so it was great to see that I have the option of a one time shipment.</li>
            <li> Smells great</li>
            <li> but the end result not so great</li>
            <li> and this was a great way to order a \\&quot;one time shipment\\&quot; of the Wen</li>
            <li> She is happy</li>
            <li> so I am happy.</li>
            <li> my wife&#x27;s hair smells great and she loves this product.</li>
            <li> Another great thing about this product is if you color your hair, this product doesn&#x27;t strip your color so your color lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Wen is a great product, but it is not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It looked and felt great.</li>
            <li> However, the comb is great for detangling.  </li>
            <li> The texture bald is great for hold hair in place without the hard-fix that hair spray does.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.</li>
            <li> but it can be a great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product, wish I could afford to purchase this all the time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up on it and just ordered the pomegranate cleaning conditioner and can&#x27;t wait to try that formula!!</li>
            <li> nothing more!!</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I also use the cleansing conditioner to bathe my 2 cats, it&#x27;s animal-friendly, and they smell amazing when they come out!</li>
            <li> I have nothing but amazing things to say about wen!</li>
            <li> It was simply amazing!</li>
            <li> yeah they would never dare have someone with my kind of hair as their hair model!  </li>
            <li> It did have a nice fragrance however!</li>
            <li> I am now stuck loving this product!</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and it works better then anything I have ever tried before.</li>
            <li> I would rather spend $50 on a 32oz bottle of the best shampoo on earth than spend even $5 more dollars on any size bottle of Wen.</li>
            <li> I know many people claim this stuff is the best, but around our house, Chaz Dean&#x27;s name is mud.</li>
            <li> The agent handled my request efficiently and pleasantly.  </li>
            <li> If your looking for a great product that will clean and moisturize your hair without damaging it, this is a great choice!</li>
            <li> Loved the Shampoo and comb, haven&#x27;t had to use any type of conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> I already have gorgeous hair</li>
            <li> Again, I had a good hair day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved how it felt.  </li>
            <li> that was the good part.</li>
            <li> You also need to have good water pressure in your shower.</li>
            <li> The styling creme is fair.</li>
            <li> how was I to know when the TV sellers push that \\&quot;this product is good for all hair types?\\</li>
            <li> and my hair looks good, but I wasn&#x27;t informed that it would be a repeat order. .</li>
            <li> 34;too good to be true&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price as well.</li>
            <li> GOOD RIDDENS</li>
            <li> I would never recommend this to a friend and i have nothing good to say about this</li>
            <li> The shampoo is good in cleansing my curly hair as well as not hindering my curl pattern.</li>
            <li> my hair was shiny and smelled good.</li>
            <li> I also loved that it was a once-step process in the shower.</li>
            <li> I just loved the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had used the styling creme and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser smells really good and feels good on your hands-not slimey.</li>
            <li> What good is softer hair if it ends up all gone?</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so good.  </li>
            <li> It smells so good too.  </li>
            <li> The good news is after about 4 months after having stopped using wen, my hair stopped falling out...</li>
            <li> massage into hair really good and than wrap it up and leave in for 3-5 mins.  </li>
            <li> those girls alteady have good hair.look at them.  </li>
            <li> It was a good try at it, but I won&#x27;t be buying this product anymore.</li>
            <li> Its a good product.</li>
            <li> so money wise</li>
            <li> Good morning, I purchased wen hair care about two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I laughed thinking she was just playing as she is always joking.</li>
            <li> I would have loved to try this product, however the WEN company never sent it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> my hair look so good now with me using wen you have to get it.</li>
            <li> , I still get the good products and</li>
            <li> I loved the product.</li>
            <li> and she loved it too.</li>
            <li> Not all good</li>
            <li> , when i got it I loved it.</li>
            <li> My hair felt almost as good as it did before I started messing with it.  </li>
            <li> I would advise their products are not that good.</li>
            <li> I said good.</li>
            <li> God bless you and good luck.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells good but does NOTHING for my hair.</li>
            <li> Packaging was good.</li>
            <li> it was a good size kit, it worked well</li>
            <li> loved the product would buy it again and recommended it to my friends also.smells wonderful makes my hair shine and clean</li>
            <li> NOTHING MORE THAN GOOD MARKETING.. PERIOD!</li>
            <li> It smells great and it feels refreshing</li>
            <li> Like most people, I saw this infommercial at 3 am and thought this would be a great system for my wavy but unruly hair.</li>
            <li> Soo awesome and its worth the try.  </li>
            <li> great product works better then shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am proud to say that I am a Wen girl. :)</li>
            <li> but it is nice and makes your hair feel so good.</li>
            <li> So I think they emphasize more!</li>
            <li> more!</li>
            <li> more!</li>
            <li> LOVE WEN!</li>
            <li> I found mane and tail to be a better product than this garbage!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair more managable and it also dries faster!</li>
            <li> but the supplier helped me and went out of her way to make sure I got it!</li>
            <li> I am completely in love!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I used to be able to floss with my hair - no joke!</li>
            <li> Love these products!</li>
            <li> WEN sure does help!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Styling Cr&amp;egrave;me and the Texture Balm!</li>
            <li> And what do you know - my scalp looks much, much better (&amp; feels cleaner)!</li>
            <li> Love everything about the Shampoo!</li>
            <li> while your washing, the longer it is on the better!</li>
            <li> When I first used this product-I loved it!!</li>
            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> I Love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall in to the \\&quot;healthy silky and soft\\&quot; hair trap!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re created for specifically curly hair and work so much better!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have called many times to cancel and continue to be charged without receiving the product!</li>
            <li> alot,to make sure its cancelled!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Yes!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love him!</li>
            <li> and i can honestly say at first I was impressed.</li>
            <li> They always did a great job and cancellation was always easy.</li>
            <li> The sweet almond mint smells good but the cleansing conditioner made my hair fall out!  </li>
            <li> is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my wishlist and my husband, being the amazing man he is, bought it as a gift for me.</li>
            <li> The WEN products are quite amazing.  </li>
            <li> the scent smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It is amazing that after just one washing you will find your hair softer, and healthier.</li>
            <li> It worked so amazing, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to spend $40 dollars for wen.</li>
            <li> It seems that once you purchase the \\&quot;AMAZING</li>
            <li> Just an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> Have used the hair gel and haven&#x27;t noticed anything spectacular</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t liked that styling balm stick (still have used it twice) and the hair gel seems so so.  </li>
            <li> In the shower the menthol in the product really smelled wonderful!  </li>
            <li> I always used better quality salon products so my hair was in good shape when I started.  </li>
            <li> Nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> I liked trying it without being enrolled in \\&quot;the club\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I ordered this pack off of their website &amp; I have to say I really liked the cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comb is nice, though</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but it was good to be able to try it</li>
            <li> I liked the things it came with the balm, comb, hair treatment.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set.</li>
            <li> When I used after a shampoo it made your hair nice.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know about using it on its own.</li>
            <li> so I kind of rigged it?</li>
            <li> she said she had been using it for 2 years  and liked the results.</li>
            <li> And I own the Pomegranate scented Wen product with pump.</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted this product to work, I was the farthest from impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50 and have received compliments on how shiny and nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li> 100 hairs a day, and to be honest</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of a wash.</li>
            <li> But I liked the Styling Creme and Replenishing Treatment.</li>
            <li> I liked the cleanser, hair treatment and stying cream  </li>
            <li> thats a rip off to be honest.</li>
            <li> and you even get a nice picture of Chaz</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so much more managable smells so good and no longer breaking off like before.</li>
            <li> If you want to wear your hair straight - then it&#x27;s perfect for you.  </li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> I do not use the product as often as they send it so it is nice to have that option.</li>
            <li> The yogurt did my hair more good too.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed with this product and its incredible with curly hair!</li>
            <li> I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I liked the product</li>
            <li> The lovely head of gorgeous hair in the photo is all gone.  </li>
            <li> aka makes your hair nice and</li>
            <li> Got the set and to be honest</li>
            <li> Warm water will not rinse it out totally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was not convinced that this product was the end-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice comb and added to the value of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging was very nice and the comb I received was fabulous</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to receive the product, but it wasn&#x27;t even close to being great.</li>
            <li> TO GET A REALLY BEAUTIFUL SMOOTH, HEALTHY STYLE.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for Wen but was not that impressed.</li>
            <li> This is a great package to buy if you want to try the WEN product line, however, they are samples and not the full size versions.  </li>
            <li> Sweet almond conditioner is a great product.</li>
            <li> It has done a very nice job to clean my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the texture balm would work great for people who have thicker hair, but for people who have baby fine hair like me, its not all that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt this good and it was sooo easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> ALSO, it has been my experience with my fine/baby hair that making sure there is not too much on the crown and scalp yields the best results.</li>
            <li> And the sweet almond mint fragrance is very nice, not over powering at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned, it has a VERY STRONG scent.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that I did not like the products, I feel very strongly that the company is trying to take advantage of customers.</li>
            <li> It is softer, it is VERY easy to comb, it is THICKER than before</li>
            <li> and I am so grateful for a product that gives my hair beautiful shine, is sulfate free, keeps my hair smooth but my curls looking and feeling amazing.  </li>
            <li> I purchased mine through eBay at first, then you really get the best deals through QVC if you&#x27;re looking to get a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yea, right?!!!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is very smooth, and already has a nice sheen-</li>
            <li> and i was very pleased with it, great for the hair and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> and oh wow am I happy I did!</li>
            <li> This is a great value pack and worth purchasing to try the product.</li>
            <li> Also you might as well buy it directly from the Chaz Dean website because this seller (Exquisite Emporium is a scam).</li>
            <li> I am so completely surprised and happy with the results!  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and I have used a lot of hair product trying to find the right thing, none of them gave me the results that I got from Wen.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine shoulder length+ hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, flyaway hair</li>
            <li> but i have processed hair and it makes my hair silky, shiny and strong!</li>
            <li> Was excited to use the product because my mom was telling me how she loved this product.  </li>
            <li> This little kit is great and the portions of the product are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because that first week it was great</li>
            <li> Upon trying it the first time i thought it smelled great and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested it because I am pretty happy with the Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too good to be true</li>
            <li> The sweet almond mint has a great smell and works wonderfully on my hair (AA with a tendency to be dry).  </li>
            <li> Tons of flyaways, even though I used to have very smooth hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair is heavier, though very smooth).  </li>
            <li> My hair is very smooth after using Wen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy and so effective</li>
            <li> The real product that comes from the site WEN.com (own pain there but excellent product), has the first three ingredients as Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Camomilla Recutita flower extract...</li>
            <li> And even with out using it every single day my hair smells great and looks great.</li>
            <li> I liked the wen just fine</li>
            <li> I have used four &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; the Sweet Almond Mint is my favorite as my hair responds best to this particular formula.</li>
            <li> It made a HUGE difference with my hair!</li>
            <li> This product is much better than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> love the products and will continue to purchase them on Amazon for always.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a hundred times better than Wen.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Once again, make sure it&#x27;s rinsed out of the crown and roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you read the reviews of fig, some love it and some call</li>
            <li> add 1/2 to 1 more pump to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> can see why some give it okay reviews.  </li>
            <li> so ultimately that is the best buy</li>
            <li> Did notice more improvements doing this over time.  </li>
            <li> I found Wen on Amazon and after making sure I would not receive additional orders, went ahead and bought the 5 piece set.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be purchasing more of the Conditioning Shampoo and Wen re-moist mask.  </li>
            <li> great product too much when i can go on wen and get it for 29.95</li>
            <li> WEN has made me love my hair again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s even more than I hope for.</li>
            <li> I even added a shower filter thinking I would make sure I did all I could to make it work.</li>
            <li> I love beachy hair, but I had yet to find something to get me that desired affect...until I met Wen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After watching the instructional videos on Chaz Dean&#x27;s website, I tried again and the results have been so phenomenal I&#x27;m not going to use anything else on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really felt great in my hair</li>
            <li> I love what this product does for my hair.  </li>
            <li> , it feels healthy, not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> I plan to buy more.  </li>
            <li> WELL, I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I love Wen products.  </li>
            <li> so many time I decided I needed to try this product for myself.</li>
            <li> It does help hold my color in for sure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s in marginally better shape.  </li>
            <li> I just need more time.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT...</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments from people at work, asking if I&#x27;ve changed my color or cut my hair.</li>
            <li> but if you order from their website, just make sure you call &amp; cancel if you don&#x27;t want anymore</li>
            <li> shipments b/c they will charge your card &amp; send more if you don&#x27;t cancel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The styling creme is 2nd best.</li>
            <li> but I like the results, better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I am always trying to find a \\&quot;deal\\&quot; on the cleansing conditioner as its the mostly used product for me.  </li>
            <li> Its OK as a conditioner or even a leave in</li>
            <li> either Suave Conditioner or Alberto Vo5 Conditioner will do a better job because of an added cleaning ingredient.</li>
            <li> I love the silky feel of my hair during and after cleaning.</li>
            <li> and I asked me to cancel the every three month shipment since my Wen lasted more than three month.</li>
            <li> the rep at the costumer service told me that since the reason that I canceled was because the product lasted more than 3 moths so they decided to send it to me every five months.</li>
            <li> ; do you want us to send it every six months instead&amp;#34; I told her more than once I don&#x27;t want the product at all.</li>
            <li> they just want your money and the trick you in so many ways to get your money.</li>
            <li> so I decided to order three more bottles, 16 oz size..different scents...</li>
            <li> I give 2 stars because it was ok in the beginning.</li>
            <li> also since i started useing it my hair looks healthier, feels healthier, and has ALOT more body to it.</li>
            <li> After using the mask (overnight) my hair had more volume and body.</li>
            <li> so i am going to give it more time.</li>
            <li> but like most things you see on t.v.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from an info-mercial and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the Cleansing Conditioner, Re-Moist Intensive Hair Treatment, and the comb.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> my head was itchy &amp; didn&#x27;t really smell all that great</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I took their advice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I love the way the products work on my hair.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s cheaper</li>
            <li> For some reason or another I wasn&#x27;t able to start it until 2 weeks after I got it.  </li>
            <li> hoping that with time, more use, more pumps, something would change but it never did.  </li>
            <li> If I had looked more closely, I would see that 1)</li>
            <li> I used this product ONE time and that was one time too many.  </li>
            <li> and then if YOU don&#x27;t cancel in the appropriate time period, you are automatically enrolled in their membership program?</li>
            <li> Product worked okay, however was signed up with WEN for autoshipments even though the detail on this product stated that you would not be joining any memebership.  </li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> A lot of people have talked about their hair feeling greasy, but mine feels more waxy....</li>
            <li> You better hope you LOVE the product, because if you ever try to cancel your membership, you&#x27;re hooped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve called and cancelled more than once,</li>
            <li> and they would not send me any more products or bills -</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and see if it gets better</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN Hair care products for over a year now and my hair has never been in better condition</li>
            <li> and i dident want to pay more $ for return shipping</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> do all 3 steps and BETTER</li>
            <li> The more I cleansed my hair</li>
            <li> If I could report to the better business bureau, I would.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> When I called the 800 number to make sure that I hadn&#x27;t been enrolled, since it was NEVER authorized by me, I found that I had been.  </li>
            <li> If you want to try the product, make sure you order it where you do not get automatically added to \\&quot;auto ship\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Im anticipating improvement to healthy hair.</li>
            <li> and I have lost more then 2/3 of my hair.</li>
            <li> Pleased with product.</li>
            <li> And to top it all they charge your credit card month after month and would not acknowledge your returns.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 30 days and love it.  </li>
            <li> I just bought more.  </li>
            <li> and I use 8 pumps, 3 to the top, 3 to the underside, 2 to the sides.  </li>
            <li> On top of that we have a water softener, so you can imagine how damaged my hair is.  </li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t give up and played around with the number of pumps until I found a magic number, which for me is 8-9 pumps.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say I love the product now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, I will now start out by telling you that I DO love wen.  </li>
            <li> Its TOOOOO BADDDDDDDDDD, because Wen realllly works on whatever hair it actually leaves on your head, lol!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> some people just don&#x27;t read now, do they?\\&quot;  OK, admittedly</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and even putting it on at the beginning of my shower and not rinsing it out till the end because they say on the commercials the longer it is on the better.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I have had my starter kit for a month now, and do not need to reorder at this time, but I do love the product.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the commerials about the product, I was sure it would be a hit with my hair..</li>
            <li> then I will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> sure I would never buy the product again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it too.</li>
            <li> , i was pleased with this order ...</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using the WEN products.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the products.</li>
            <li> I tried using more, I tried changing the routine but nothing.</li>
            <li> In fact I use Dove Hair care which costs a fraction of this product and works better.  </li>
            <li> My hair needs alot of love.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought the kit from the WEN website and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love Wen and</li>
            <li> then I add one more.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I took a chance and tried it.</li>
            <li> and it is everything and more.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love love love the product.  </li>
            <li> It is all the \\&quot;infomercial\\&quot; says and more.</li>
            <li> HASSLE FREE!</li>
            <li> ok-</li>
            <li> and I had better not see it on my charge bill.  </li>
            <li> and I for sure wish I had looked it up on amazon before calling in an order.</li>
            <li> i love wen</li>
            <li> Like most, I saw this infomercial and did my research.</li>
            <li> The instructions almost put me over the edge... sectioning off your hair, putting gads of the goop on each section, leaving on forever and then rinsing forever more.</li>
            <li> This smells to me of a means of getting customers to use more product than they need so they can order more.</li>
            <li> I love these products.</li>
            <li> The longer and thicker yourhair is, the more this will cost you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use it once more</li>
            <li> Since the shampoo didn&#x27;t make my hair any better</li>
            <li> I have one more item that I purchased through Amazon</li>
            <li> I. Thought ok</li>
            <li> and if you do not want any more shipments, just tell them...</li>
            <li> love the product</li>
            <li> /&gt;they take out more money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> many of you, I saw the infomercial about WEN and decided to give it try.  </li>
            <li> Gluten free hair product alone, had not done the trick, but one use of WEN and the itch was gone!  </li>
            <li> She will probably order more.</li>
            <li> and I got better results.</li>
            <li> I used most of the product</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so healthy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, each time i got a box (which I gave to salvation army), without me ordering it, I got charged more.</li>
            <li> Today i called to see why I was getting so many orders and the salesperson told me they send the product each month , but if you dont call to cancel, they will continue sending and charging for the stuff.</li>
            <li> I had watched the info-mercial so many times and wanted to try this.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been better.  </li>
            <li> The texture balm doesn&#x27;t do much for me, but the leave in is great in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite product is the Re-moist Mask intensive hair treatment I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I really love the Wen products.</li>
            <li> hair looks so healthy, what are you</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> (I have medium length hair, so I used four pumps on each of the four sections of hair); and make sure the cleansing conditioner is spread thoroughly throughout your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried Dove damage repair after I tried Wen and it was 100 times better.</li>
            <li> i love wen</li>
            <li> I love Wen shampoo/conditioner combo, as my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> I also love that there&#x27;s no detergents to strip my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it that it dosen&#x27;t foam</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of the almond mint.</li>
            <li> loves it, swears its her favorite hair product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I mostly use the styling cream and my wife uses the shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love my hair</li>
            <li> I ended up giving it to a friend who had better luck with it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products.</li>
            <li> OK, so \\&quot;washing\\&quot; your hair with conditioner??</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Suave is BETTER.</li>
            <li> Suave is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> definitely think it&#x27;s the best ever!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Love it though.</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought from Amazon [Exquisite Emporium/ab-bookshop] is because it said ONE TIME SHIPMENT.</li>
            <li> (I straighten it) and thought this might be the magic product for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I had gone to great lengths just to avoid that very issue and this seller specifically states \\&quot;1 time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Controlled flyaways better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the packaging, the stench was overwhelming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried it,</li>
            <li> My wife really love.</li>
            <li> and asking me to buy more of this product.</li>
            <li> I bought her this and her hair became more healthier.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> but my hair felt thicker and more manageable.</li>
            <li> At this point I feel I need to use more before I make a more informed suggestion.</li>
            <li> I read up on it and saw that many people talked about hair loss.</li>
            <li> I wish there was more</li>
            <li> or they would have sent me more product every 90 days......</li>
            <li> My hair is better moisturized and my scalp does not itch after using this product.</li>
            <li> Many compliments on the healthiness and shine of my hair.</li>
            <li> I feel that the longer you leave it on the better</li>
            <li> and  do not feel we should be able to take advantage of one another.  </li>
            <li> I am still enjoying the benefits of these products.  </li>
            <li> The deep conditioner is wonderful and I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I wood recommend this product to any body who wants better looking hair that feels great.</li>
            <li> I love the comb and the texture bald.  </li>
            <li> That way, the product works, will not fade your color, and your hair will be healthy.</li>
            <li> Next we received a collection letter from the wonderful people over at Wen.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure at some point the Better Business Bureau will get to the bottom of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> it seemed like to me instead of my making my hair better</li>
            <li> it just made it more greasier</li>
            <li> I said sure.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> The more I use it the better my hair gets.</li>
            <li> I WOULD MOST DEF RECOMAND</li>
            <li> and I would say the product works but not any better than Bedhead, Redken, etc.</li>
            <li> I figured let&#x27;s try this product and maybe, just maybe my hair will get better.</li>
            <li> but I will not get any more of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad my boyfriend didn&#x27;t listen to me and ordered this for me anyway.  </li>
            <li> I like this shampoo for the most part.</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this stuff</li>
            <li> I was able to comb through her hair without any tears or &amp;#34;ouchies&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> used the entire 4 step process and am very impressed at the results.</li>
            <li> While Chaz Dean promises beautiful with wen hair care it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> and I loved it right away.</li>
            <li> It was nice to have had the experience with the original, authentic product</li>
            <li> your research and be aware!!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t order it in the first place!!!</li>
            <li> From flat to full.!!!!!</li>
            <li> I pretty much never write reviews, but I have to write one for this stuff because its awesome.</li>
            <li> However, my hair never got as clean as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> His hair is even more fine than mine -- and with Wen he actually has &#x27;body&#x27; now, hehe. :-D</li>
            <li> I was so happy, my hair was so soft, and much healthier and looked great.</li>
            <li> Again I used the Wen Sweet Almond Conditioner but followed it up with my own styling products.  </li>
            <li> The comb is a pretty good comb I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> loved it for the first month but then noticed a lot of hair in the drain...</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the product was pretty good.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product at first.</li>
            <li> (Suave produces good, consistent results.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and surprised a product does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to try it!  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product for anyone looking to achieve healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I love the feel and the fact that it is now shinny and easy to control.</li>
            <li> tried the sweet almond mint first, and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Wen as long as I am able to get it!!!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, and this stuff made my hair soooooooo bouncy, manageable and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Fig works better for my lightened, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the perfect combo for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Great product made my hair really soft and shiny added volume and bounce and would recommend to family and friends</li>
            <li> and I guess we will see if the more the better is really true.</li>
            <li> Apparently they didn&#x27;t use this product correctly, I have used this product for three years &amp;&amp; let me tell yhu it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> It smells great all day, make your hair soft, but it just doesn&#x27;t control the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have written a more detailed review about this which you can find if you look for all my reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway I finished and it looked great and soft.</li>
            <li> The best item is the wide tooth styling comb.</li>
            <li> it was shiny and smooth, the shampoo is like conditioner it don&#x27;t lather and the longer you leave it in the better</li>
            <li> Considering the amount of money you pay for one bottle, I can buy 2-4 bottles of cheap shampoo and it cleans and repairs my hair better than this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to stay on until I spoke with a REAL PERSON (I recommend getting a good book to read while you wait.)</li>
            <li> I give it 2 stars for smelling good, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It felt great as she washed my hair, which was tangle free (something no other shampoo or condtioner has ever been able to pull off)</li>
            <li> I was more than excited when I finaly got it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product and highly recommend it to others who have fussy hair and have also never been able to find the right product.</li>
            <li> Products are easy to use.</li>
            <li> My hair did not feel like straw at all, the color had not faded one bit and once again, using my own straightening products, I was able to blow-dry my hair in about 1/2 the time and without battling as much frizz.  </li>
            <li> I love it,the product did every thay promised and more.my hair has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> this is getting taken care of so easily and not like the horror stories</li>
            <li> is so easy to comb out after words.and</li>
            <li> 5 stars isn&#x27;t easy for me to give in the hair category, but this time it was easy.</li>
            <li> (you can easily request this by e-mail, phone, or online chat</li>
            <li> Also the shipper had it sent VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> It also was easy to syle and gave me lots of volume.</li>
            <li> However, it is extremely easy to cancel and there are no fees.</li>
            <li> When something is advertised on a 30 minute TV infomercial, it&#x27;s easy to be dubious about the claims made.  </li>
            <li> I even called the company and asked about the amounts (they say that the best results come from using a lot of product and leaving it on a long time, neither of which have proven true for me) and</li>
            <li> I LOVE how it made my hair feel right away!</li>
            <li> I thought Wen products were amazing when I first started to use it.</li>
            <li> and I simply love the sweet almond conditioner works well as a pre-poo treatment.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll stick to the fig from here out, with maybe the sweet almond mint as a scalp treatment from time to time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The first experience was quite nice, my head felt minty and the hair was softer than before.  </li>
            <li> The Sweet Almond Mint scent was calming and yet sophisticated, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> know there is a hot debate about this product, with some people loving it and</li>
            <li> this product is awesome, but NOT WORTH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY</li>
            <li> Glad I tried it, but this is NOT for me (or anyone with the tendency to be frizzy).&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0048O2R1E WEN® Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]]</li>
            <li> Even if it does hold up my color better, I&#x27;ll stick to my normal shampoo/conditioner routine and take more trips to the salon!</li>
            <li> Without a doubt hands down the best hair care product out there.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff it makes my hair soft and eay to comb and my scalp fills clean as wells as my hair</li>
            <li> And my hair is fine.  </li>
            <li> the fine print before you order this</li>
            <li> I read the fine print in the letter that accompanied my Introductory Kit.</li>
            <li> this that, but ALL of that was fine....</li>
            <li> , I did not read the fine print</li>
            <li> the guy said thats fine</li>
            <li> I gave it my best shot for one month before I gave up and returned to previously used products.</li>
            <li> I use half the amount and it works great!</li>
            <li> Also, I prefer those products because I could go a day in between without washing my hair and it would look fine - with the Wen product</li>
            <li> I said that was fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine if you want to use it in addition to your shampoo as a conditioner</li>
            <li> The leave in products seem to work fine, but the cleansing conditioners gave me dandruff.</li>
            <li> My hair was silky and light, yes, but it wasn&#x27;t clear how AMAZING this product was until I tried using shampoo again!</li>
            <li> It is a bold faced CAPITALIZED LIE!  </li>
            <li> liked that Wen had a pleasant aroma and had a very creamy texture which felt great when FIRST applied to my soaking wet hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is difficult--baby fine, tending to be oily, easily frizzy and just wavy enough to look messy--but tonight it looks great.</li>
            <li> It helped my scalp a little, the best thing that works for me is Suave for Men, peppermint.</li>
            <li> but some folks are making a HUGE profit from the markup.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a Huge HUGE skeptic when it comes to buying ANYTHING off tv.</li>
            <li> This is a huge scam and that must be why it&#x27;s not sold in stores.</li>
            <li> no I had two huge bald spots.</li>
            <li> you have a huge bald</li>
            <li> That is HUGE amount of product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable to buy from Amazon,</li>
            <li> Still debating on whether i should keep using it or not, if you have the chance JUST to try it out at a cheap price i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Actually this is a great way to try the product before you get stuck.</li>
            <li> The customer service when I call is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I settled my account, called and confirmed that it was settled</li>
            <li> and when I mentioned to my hairstylist that I had been shampoo free for a couple months she automatically started raving about Wen.</li>
            <li> My set style with sponge rollers stays for 2 days looking great in the deep south humidity.  </li>
            <li> Wen products made my hair feel silky smooth and shiney.  </li>
            <li> the extras that come with your initial purchase are great.  </li>
            <li> many others, I&#x27;m not crazy about the menthol in the product</li>
            <li> My hair looked great when she finished, but I also had mistreated my hair prior to that, so let&#x27;s just assume that anything I would do to it, would do wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel silky smooth and</li>
            <li> AND they even sent me free products for my troubles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is important.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth with volume and thicker and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> As a beauty product junkie, I am rarely this pleased.  </li>
            <li> Congratulations, Wen Hair Products and Guthy Renker for such great execution.</li>
            <li> I used almost the whole bottle, thinking it would get better the more I used it</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, save your money and find a good stylist and a product with a solid reputation - you deserve better than Wen.</li>
            <li> So I havent purchased this system yet, though I plan to do so as this conditioner made my hair so soft and shiny and it smells sooo good.</li>
            <li> I saw numerous posts about this making your hair fall out, and saw even more that loved it.</li>
            <li> With this product, more really does seem to be better.  </li>
            <li> I really hope that you have the right hair conditions where it will work for you otherwise good luck trying to cancel.  </li>
            <li> They claimed if you use the right amount you get better results.  </li>
            <li> you dont see the difference right away, and being that it doesnt lather and has a more conditioner feel, i was nervous that it would leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I told them it was a ripoff and a scam and that they had better cancel right away</li>
            <li> I used it one time and my hair was shiny, healthy and even my color was more vibrant.</li>
            <li> When I received my package, I realized that it didn&#x27;t contain all the free gifts described on TV; but I was not deterred since I was so excited to try the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product...</li>
            <li> The trick for me with my fine, medium length, wavy hair, was to use less than 1/2 the amount, spread the shampoo evenly, and rinse a great deal more than you think it needs.</li>
            <li> Wen is a great product when it comes down to leaving the hair soft and smelling great</li>
            <li> This product works great for me, I have medium length fine colored hair that tends to get dry and oily.</li>
            <li> hair felt clean and light.</li>
            <li> Hope I love them as much as the sweet almond mint!</li>
            <li> i usualy have to put some kind of oil in my hair after i shower because my hair is so damaged that it tangles easily, but so far i have not had to with this product.</li>
            <li> I alternate between this and my regular shampoo and my hair feels healthier, so I am happy with this product and it smell good too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since originally writing this I went from ordering the one time shipment to signing up with QVC for ongoing shipments.  </li>
            <li> It made me excited about trying Wen again or maybe just trying 613.</li>
            <li> I excitedly ordered it and eagerly awaited it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> After watching all of the commercials i was excited to try wen</li>
            <li> I called up and the guy originally told me that I didn&#x27;t cancel my account</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product through Wen website.</li>
            <li> I was beyond excited when my hair felt like silk when washing out..</li>
            <li> While the wen products are more expensive than most of the store bought cleansers, if you look into salon products, you&#x27;ll find you have a comparable price point with the best brands</li>
            <li> For me, Wen is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> no this is not almost $40 worth of products!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> The product is great for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to order wen through the infomercial</li>
            <li> So finally excited again I waited.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> This product is not for everyone--be aware and stop using if you have these problems because I don&#x27;t believe they will get better eventually.</li>
            <li> I love this product i noticed the difference on the first use.</li>
            <li> It really helped my hair (curly, wavy, fine and frizzy) be more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, pin straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel clean and after a day my hair was begging to be washed again.</li>
            <li> but in my opinion it docent clean your scalp and because of it you will develop Dandruff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update on amount used: I do realize that my hair is not as clean</li>
            <li> to ensure your hair gets clean.  </li>
            <li> SMells great, makes my hair soft, like the styling products for when I wear my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter and was amazed to find after use my hair felt clean, including my scalp.  </li>
            <li> , its doesn&#x27;t clean well and it leaves my hair a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li> and my hair is finally clean and not greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> Felt my hair and scalp squeaky clean soon after.</li>
            <li> however Wen doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel clean.</li>
            <li> I scrub my scalp as instructed however it doesn&#x27;t feel clean and by the end of the day it looks matted and oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people with dry hair will halp damaged hair</li>
            <li> It would cost me $90 a month just to clean my hair</li>
            <li> Even with no lather the product leaves my hair clean longer.</li>
            <li> My scalp has never felt so clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> but it does what it claims to do, nice soft hair!</li>
            <li> Instead, my hair is still soft and most of my ringlets are still intact!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While researching, I learned that Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply has their own, much cheaper version of Wen called Hair One - also found right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny and healthy, but when I have used other products because I was traveling or something, it also looked good.</li>
            <li> The lavender for fine hair can be a little too much but the Pomegrante and Almond are perfect.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the special package for $29.95.  </li>
            <li> but none if them did anything special for my hair.</li>
            <li> but not anything special for the cost that I paid, I like it</li>
            <li> Here again, you must get the right formula for your hair!</li>
            <li> After doing more research online and seeing how many people reported major hair loss after using this product, I&#x27;m not even tempted to try this product again.</li>
            <li> Well....the conditioner works pretty good and make&#x27;s your hair amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> For the first few months it was great!</li>
            <li> Directions say 10-15 pumps, but obviously that is a general suggestion and youshould use an amount that best benefits your hair type and length.</li>
            <li> I really massage it in there making sure</li>
            <li> BE SURE to work on the rinse out as much as you did on the work in.</li>
            <li> I have tried Sweet Almond Mint, Pomegranate, Lavender, and Fig.</li>
            <li> and it shows their credit card not mine, which was true.  </li>
            <li> The whole \\&quot;use as many pumps as you</li>
            <li> They claim the hair continues to improve as you continue to use it so we shall see if that&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> :B003PXZI2O WEN BY CHAZ DEAN SWEET ALMOND CONDITIONER,STYLING CREME, RE-MOIST MASK INTENSIVE HAIR TREATMENT,TEXTURE BALM,WIDE TOOTH SHOWER</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are also different kinds of Wen conditioning shampoos based on your hair type, and details about what kind of conditioning shampoo works for which kind of hair is very informative and helpful.</li>
            <li> I JUST RECIEVED MY WEN SWEET ALMOND MINT STARTER KIT TODAY AND COULDNT WAIT TO TRY IT OUT.</li>
            <li> when I went to a home with a softener, my hair looked better and I didn&#x27;t use as much product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love WEN.</li>
            <li> being that i get very greasy hair, these shampoos didnt work for me because they did not remove the grease, and i ended up getting more acne</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it was more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> When I called to complain they of course said that I had agreed to this, which I suppose is true.</li>
            <li> I immediatley stopped using it and went back to my good ol&#x27; reliable shapmoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used the Fig &amp; The Lavender and Now Sweet Almont Mint.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I got out of this was a comb and the texturizing balm.</li>
            <li> I received the Wen sweet almond 5 piece kit as a mother&#x27;s day gift.  </li>
            <li> What I really liked about it are the amount of natural products used.</li>
            <li> I ultimately gave it to another family member who styles hair and they didn&#x27;t have good result either.</li>
            <li> I love the product, the information that comes withthe product advises to use Too much product.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the sweet almond mint and the fig through amazon so that I could avoid being enrolled in the auto-renewal and have an opportunity to sample the product.</li>
            <li> But I LOVE this product so much.  </li>
            <li> but orders religiously should be good</li>
            <li> but I have a feeling that I&#x27;ll be returning the kit for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I may not get my full refund or get any justice.</li>
            <li> I am really looking for something to add shine and volume to my hair, as well as keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> This product was good for conditioning, but left my hair without body.</li>
            <li> The business is full of deceit and lies, don&#x27;t fall in the trap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen the informercial and I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li> , I decided to order the Wen Sweet Almond Mint hair care kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sweet almond and fig.</li>
            <li> i remember having my hand full of hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I use as much as it requires, or I rinse it out all the way, and my hair is still 100% better than what it was.  </li>
            <li> So, I may try to order more of the styling creme if I can catch it reasonably</li>
            <li> My hair has NEVER looked this healthy, clean, vibrant, or full of body.</li>
            <li> The product smells wonderful and it makes my usually dry hair so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Not silky and beautiful but HUGE mess!  </li>
            <li> I started using Wen for  a month with no other products, I can honestly say that it hasn&#x27;t helped with regrow but it does clean my hair well</li>
            <li> The price however is something to be desired, and might off set me from purchasing it in the future, since I require more product than most people, but nonetheless a good product overall.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t exactly give you the comfortable clean</li>
            <li> as I would any other product (rather than using the longer time frames for both washing and rinsing suggested) and my hair turned out great.</li>
            <li> I started to do a lot of research online on my hair loss and found other reviews about people who had experienced hair loss after using Wen.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been searching high and low to find a product that allows me to maximize my beautiful curls, but not let it be frizzy or crunchy.  </li>
            <li> love the product, leaves  my hair silky, comms down the freezes and my hair is more manageable, my hair feels and looks thicker now,  I&#x27;m not ashamed of the way my hair looks any more,  because of Wen</li>
            <li> (it didn&#x27;t stink, just didn&#x27;t smell fresh &amp; clean).</li>
            <li> But it leaves my scalp and hair clean and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> Oh and then there is the fancy ultra super comb</li>
            <li> I ordered the ten ounce size to start..and everyone including the creator says the more you use the better..</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS PRODUCT, IT REALLY DID MAKE MY HAIR FEEL SOFT, LIKE</li>
            <li> BUT it also made my hair super puffy.</li>
            <li> All products were delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Super easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair super greasy too.  </li>
            <li> Receieved quickly.</li>
            <li> It made my daughters hair super greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair stays soft and smells great, and looks great for at least two days afterward!  </li>
            <li> I must first say that I am on my 2nd bottle of Wen, because I originally thought I LOVED this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and even made sure I used a lot in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have high lights in my hair and they stand out more, it brings the color in your hair out and does not fade it.  </li>
            <li> got nervious right away and went and checked my whole head to find more bald spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is much more manageable and healthy looking and it cuts down on my shower time as well as styling time which is perfect especially since i am 7 months pregnant and have a 5 year old son.</li>
            <li> you DO purchase this product, be very aware of the 60 return policy.  </li>
            <li> I have normal hair that has become more &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; as I&#x27;ve gotten into my 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Be sure to massage the scalp for a few minutes, make sure your hair is saturated with the cream, then add a bit of water and massage more.  </li>
            <li> My roommate got the WEN system and had me try it, and after the first day, I saw the difference, there was an immediate shine to my hair, Ive only used the Sweet Almond Mint, and it works perfectly, that i dnt even want to try anything different .</li>
            <li> I love trying new products and have tried the off brand</li>
            <li> So I tried this new product and I love it.</li>
            <li> I received the shipment yesterday and tried the Sweet Almond Conditioner right away.</li>
            <li> It feels like its such a waste, but I wanted to make sure I am doing it right to get the best results!</li>
            <li> I thought it was too dry to ever look good</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t do anything really.</li>
            <li> Upon initial use, made my hair beautiful, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did was because a good friend of mine did Chaz&#x27; first infomercial</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will get better by the time I finish the bottle, but that will probably be very soon since you have to use so much in one shower!</li>
            <li> I called the service center to request a cancellation of my shipment and the girl was so pleasant and polite, offering to send me sample of another product.  </li>
            <li> Well....2 months later a huge box arrives with a 6 month supply of wen!!</li>
            <li> And I noticed a difference after the first use!</li>
            <li> I used Wen the first day and noticed an incrediable difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> This product really does work!!</li>
            <li> I have found that the conitioner/ cleanser works very well all alone!!  </li>
            <li> but I have SO MUCH HAIR!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try Wen and the first five days</li>
            <li> I cannot stop touching my hair - it is so soft!</li>
            <li> I really did!!  </li>
            <li> will advice people to first read the reviews before making a purchase,!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not mad that the product didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The product arrived 3 weeks later than expected, but hey, they call it snail mail for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;The first week my naturally curly hair looked amazing and felt GREAT!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the &amp;#34;Stick&amp;#34; balm but the other three products work beautifully.</li>
            <li> most people I had seen the infomercials for Wen and honestly thought, like all television products, this one would be a dud; either it would never clean my scalp or would leave my hair so oily looking</li>
            <li> The cleansing conditioner feels wonderful, it is very thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> i was hoping that it would be amazing, now after 4 washes every time the next day, i have oily hair.</li>
            <li> but well worth it</li>
            <li> Pomegranate is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> I hope this review has left you with some tips that I had to discover on my own.</li>
            <li> I was SURE I was going to be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth trying @</li>
            <li> :) I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair did have twice the volume but that was mostly because my natural curls were frizzing up</li>
            <li> Ever after 8 months after not using Wen my hair was not as vibrant and strong as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product, altho not enough to spend the money on it again</li>
            <li> All the products are great and my hair is always soft, manageable, and my color last longer.  </li>
            <li> I lost over $100.00 for a product thats not even worth $10.00.  </li>
            <li> The re-moisture intensive hair cream is my favorite part because it just makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I feel like it is kind of a process to use especially if your in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> It is sooooo soft and looks soooo much better.</li>
            <li> It dose have mint ingredent so it helps your scaple feels fresh.</li>
            <li> I tried following them the first day and the outcome was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Also rinsing your head with cool water when you first get in the shower does indeed make a difference.  </li>
            <li> a healthy 34 year old woman and have never had any issues with my hair or health, and haven&#x27;t changed anything in my diet or routing besideds</li>
            <li> these items were worth buying, I would buy them again...</li>
            <li> So I contacted the phone number in my box and customer service told me I received a SAMPLE set worth $9.99 and what for what I paid</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairdresser, and I do love how my hair glows as a result of these products.</li>
            <li> I have to say that the Wen is really worth it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth your time.</li>
            <li> However, for me, it left my hair feeling kind of tacking.  </li>
            <li> I believe most people use too much, saturate the crown of the head too much, and do not rinse well.</li>
            <li> Not a product that is worth the money at all.  </li>
            <li> You are better off using homemade, natural remedies that moisturize your hair.</li>
            <li> and I rarely give into informercials.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked and continue to use is the comb.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money, just not in my budget.</li>
            <li> Little did I know I was enrolled in a club in which they sent me MORE WEN!!</li>
            <li> I have fine and oily hair and also exercise regularly so its important for my hair to look and feel clean</li>
            <li> Usually my hair looks great the day I wash it, and then quickly deteriorates from there.</li>
            <li> shipping was pretty quick although they provided no tracking number.</li>
            <li> To achieve a clean scalp, I&#x27;m often left with the choice of drying my hair out even more or go with an oily scalp to save some moisture in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The original $39 a month was just too much for me to spend, even when diluting the product.</li>
            <li> And my &#x27;color-treated&#x27; hair normally looks much better than most anyways (even without the Wen) because I never blowdry or use styling products on it, so its not like I was starting out with &#x27;straw&#x27; to begin with.  </li>
            <li> After a day, my hair lost it&#x27;s wave, became flat and honestly, a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I saw the Try Wen infomercial, ordered, and am now convinced that a person or the ordering software should be specifically asking, \\&quot;What hair type are you?\\&quot; in order to receive the right Wen for your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the dry-hair formula with Olive Oil, which now, sounds about right for me.</li>
            <li> It gives the appearance that you haven&#x27;t showered for days, right after use.</li>
            <li> but it was greasy looking right away.</li>
            <li> no shampoo or hair product EVER works quite right for me.</li>
            <li> (after I figured out which shampoo was right for my hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try canceling your account.  </li>
            <li> The price was right, and I wanted to try the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you used right, it will work.</li>
            <li> Each product is for a differnt hair type go to the Wen Website to find what is right for you.</li>
            <li> You neeed to use the right amount of product for your hair length.</li>
            <li> i have been searching for some new kind of shampoo and conditioner, ive used organic and sulfate free, hopeing to undo the damage i regularly do to my hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it wouldn&#x27;t clean very well</li>
            <li> I had watched the Wen with Chaz Dean commercial so many times before I bought the wen sweet almond mint</li>
            <li> this makes my hair feel really nice,sleek and clean...</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t clean your hair....</li>
            <li> &quot; I must give some high marks to my 2012 discovery, Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo - also available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> is it true that it really works because i have oily hair that i can.t get rid of i</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about a large handful of hair!</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin that breaks out easily I would advise you not to use purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Love the Wen products, my hair is soft and much easier to deal with than before.</li>
            <li> It did make my hair soft, shiny and easy to brush through.</li>
            <li> I consider it a good buy for the results it produces, and anticipate saving money on trips to the salon for trims since there is less splitting now as well.</li>
            <li> Luckily I saw the WEN infomercial and, as I was ready to try anything, I ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Delivery was SUPER fast, and I did not specify expedited.</li>
            <li> I love my thick hair, but since I started using Wen, I noticed that it started losing body and kind of lifeless and thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I use less my hair does not come out as good.</li>
            <li> My hair was immediately calm, smooth, soft and shiny but with body.  </li>
            <li> my daughter, didn&#x27;t see any good change, only got grease and with a built up, I used small amounts and it never feel clean, when I used more</li>
            <li> Through Wen&#x27;s website when you purchase at $29.95 it automatically enrolls you to receive more each month at $29.95 + $7.95 S&amp;H; for someone like me who forgets to cancel those kinds of programs and get a surprise charge to my credit card, it&#x27;s worth the extra $20 to try it out the first time.</li>
            <li> I was interested in the &#x27;no laurel sulfate&#x27; and wanted to try a more healthy product without harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> If you order from Wen ( even if it&#x27;s a present) READ THE FINE PRINT!</li>
            <li> I received my order very fast.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very straight hair that is always flat.  </li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky ones who had beautiful dark hair my entire life.</li>
            <li> Thing is, she is so used to the lather a normal shampoo produces, she just can&#x27;t convince herself her hair is clean.</li>
            <li> I also want to mention that I wasn&#x27;t too excited about getting a comb, as I have never been a comb user, because I&#x27;ve never really been able to get one through my hair.</li>
            <li> Hell, I can pass a fine tooth comb my natural hair.</li>
            <li> When I used the product for the first time, I had a good feeling about it, but nearly halfway through the day my hair was oily, shiny and flat.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so good with so little effort.</li>
            <li> After watching the infomercial, I was SO EXCITED to try this new Wen product.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly as it says on the bottle, yet my hair looks blah.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed the results within my first use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use Organix from the pharmacy it give me better results, especially the coconut milk one.</li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t the biggest problem, I broke out all over my face and neck and body from it, and on top of that it did not get rid of the frizziness, it made my hair more frizzy and gave it this weird fro from the top.</li>
            <li> After the first time, I thought eh, it&#x27;s o.k</li>
            <li> I run and get pretty sweaty.  </li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had two weeks to evaluate the product and have to admit I&#x27;ve gone from skeptical to very happy.  </li>
            <li> I just washed my hair for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li> It feels different that is for sure</li>
            <li> just say Herbal Essence left my hair more moisturized that this.</li>
            <li> Know that when you go online and order this product that the first time it is the $29.95</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t follow the directions EXACTLY like</li>
            <li> &amp; I definitely wash my hair more than 5 times a month</li>
            <li> So I ended up cancelling my future orders because there is no way I would be able to afford this stuff...</li>
            <li> I am so very thankful for the reviews!  </li>
            <li> I think that I was thinking from the first shampoo a miracle would occur...</li>
            <li> wen works very well!</li>
            <li> and they told me to stop using this that the last client we had that used  this  came in for a perm that she had got many times before that</li>
            <li> I find that I do not need to use as much as is recommended -- it does feel divine on my hair in the shower!</li>
            <li> The comb and the deep hair repair are my favorite parts.</li>
            <li> I really would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Maybe I just didn&#x27;t give it enough time, but I think Wen is just ok...</li>
            <li> felt like by the end of the first week</li>
            <li> 4 days back on my Organix Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner and my hair and scalp are healthy again.</li>
            <li> I returned the first box</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS PRODUCT FOR THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sent product back - more keeps coming.</li>
            <li> it turns out, after the first shipment, they send you 3 MONTHS of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I tried it out the first week</li>
            <li> I saw a difference after the first time using it and more people have commented on my hair in the last week than ever before!!  </li>
            <li> First things first.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> My hair is actually bouncy, which I never thought I could say about it, and way more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I first heard of Wen through one of those beauty guru ladies on YouTube</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overall pleased with Wen</li>
            <li> I wish I went online to read the reviews before I ordered it instead of when I wanted to cancel it, or so I thought, the first time.</li>
            <li> I found a cheaper route, thinking it was cheaper, First the bottle was an 12 OZ.</li>
            <li> P.S I do love Wen though it has given me my hair back....</li>
            <li> I have more confident in myself because of my  hair is looking more like it did in my younger years, Praise God for small miracles,  </li>
            <li> I used the first bottle</li>
            <li> I found that my hair felt thinner and more breakage was present.</li>
            <li> Everyone says that not only does it kill hair and cause it to fall out that they don&#x27;t respond to phone calls or emails and keep taking money after ending service to the point that most have said they&#x27;ve had to cancel their cards</li>
            <li> and it works EXACTLY as it is described</li>
            <li> Thanks for the violation!</li>
            <li> I was at first sketical about this product but</li>
            <li> It even does a better job at controlling my dandruff than Selson Blue did.</li>
            <li> It did not make my hair better than regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> First off it took over 3 weeks to get my product in the mail.</li>
            <li> I got pissed at first because my hair was so frizzy and poofy.</li>
            <li> These scammers sent me more (billed me over $100) and now I have to send the unwanted product back.  </li>
            <li> much more should be left unsaid....</li>
            <li> By the way, when I told my hair dresser that I tried WEN, her exactly words were,</li>
            <li> I love how I could just apply it and leave it in and then rinse it out the next day.</li>
            <li> I must say, I am glad I finally did it!  </li>
            <li> It took the itch out of my scalp for the first time in about 3 years...</li>
            <li> going to a natural (Sulfate free, no parabens, no proplylene butylene glcols, petroleum, sulfates, alcohol, PEGs, TEA, DEA, NPE, phthalates, (GMO), silicones, triclosan (pesticides)</li>
            <li> I tried it twice, then I thought Ok enough.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and smooth looking.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Almond Mint!!</li>
            <li> I thought at first</li>
            <li> so I did re read the instructions and adjusted stuck to the exact amount of product and did leave in some for as a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The moist mask treatment worked really well though!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I thought it was so-so.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly as I ordered.  </li>
            <li> At first I was like alright....</li>
            <li> After the first wash, you need to let it settle in.</li>
            <li> They had this amazing deal for 30 bucks and for 40 bucks, bringing several different items, including a free travel kit for making the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I believe their marketing team is fully aware of it, which is why it is done in the way they do it.  </li>
            <li> This should have been my first indicator that this was not for me</li>
            <li> FIRST off...</li>
            <li> Thanks Wen!</li>
            <li> cause they have the same trail pack thing like this but its alot more product</li>
            <li> I love the comb and use the hair smoother daily--its terrific.  </li>
            <li> , my hair didn&#x27;t look any different with or without it, so I quit using it since it was just more product&lt;</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> When I first started using Wen</li>
            <li> If this was the case, why did the hair loss start with the first use of Wen?</li>
            <li> My hair color is not fading after using this product, it definitely is shinier, has a thickier feel and has more body.</li>
            <li> But Wen by Chaz Dean really works!</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well I am sure I am not the only person this happened too.  </li>
            <li> So anyone who has dealt with them and their business practices know exactly what I am talking about.</li>
            <li> The texture of my hair changed from soft and smooth to a wooly, brittle, frizzy, and wiry texture.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel that the product left on my hair</li>
            <li> I too, at first, felt my hair was still greasy after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s suppossed to be even better called six Thirteen which I will be trying next.</li>
            <li> all, be-all when I first tried it.</li>
            <li> However, this product works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> and I have no ill will towards Wen...</li>
            <li> First world problems.</li>
            <li> ...wish I could afford it on a regular basis...when I have a couple of bucks I&#x27;ll get more.</li>
            <li> I tried the Wen hair products a few months ago, I think it has good ingredients but is over priced.</li>
            <li> Renker also works with Proactive which I used for a few years, I never had a problem and customer service is good.</li>
            <li> My hair was immediately at least 90% better: softer, shinier, so easy to comb through!  </li>
            <li> , I have very fine long hair</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be great on my hair since some times the ends seem to dry out, but no it only made my hair look greasy and unwashed.</li>
            <li> My hair typically is oily and does better with cheap products like herbal essences.</li>
            <li> DO NOT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TO RUIN YOUR HAIR!!!!</li>
            <li> Once you figure out how much rinsing is just right, you have it made.</li>
            <li> have not tried any of the other wen products, but since fig, and sweet almond mint are considered to be the most moisturizing</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try the original formula, Sweet Almond Mint, in a one-time kit shipment from a seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li> First, dealing with GR has been an unusually POSITIVE experience for me.</li>
            <li> I have reordered some of those other products because I really liked them.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that no matter how much or how little I tried using, it didn&#x27;t do anything good for my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have hair that&#x27;s easily weighed down or easily becomes oily; avoid using the texture balm.</li>
            <li> Trick is go easy on how much you apply and go easy on any other product you use for styling.</li>
            <li> Knowing that my hair can withstand the harsh coloring treatments I get and still look healthy and shiny is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> it rinses out clean and leaves my hair fairly soft and not tangly.</li>
            <li> But with WEN, not only is my hair &amp; scalp super clean</li>
            <li> Even use it on my grand children&#x27;s long hair and now their Mom wants to too!  </li>
            <li> so I have been looking for cleansing products that will treat it more gently than the traditional sulfate-based shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I told her that I had ordered Wen because I watched the TV commercials, and it implied that Wen was much more gentle than regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Normally my hair will stay down until maybe lunch time, on a good day, before it&#x27;s so out of control from frizz, I give up and put it into a bun or ponytail.  </li>
            <li> though it costs a little more it is SO worth it!  </li>
            <li> wow was she right!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of hair care to make my hair look thick and healthy, for the most part it weighed my hair down so much that there was no way for it to look full and healthy.  </li>
            <li> the CSR told me that others have found it to be true that they get better results with less product.</li>
            <li> Was supposed to work within 3 washes, I didn&#x27;t notice a positive change in my hair.</li>
            <li> I finished, my hair felt luxuriously clean, with more body and less frizz, with gentle movement.</li>
            <li> place I ordered it from was okay since it took so long to get to me</li>
            <li> Partly, because I really do have pretty  unmanageable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty suspicious to me that you don&#x27;t see much of that on the reviews on the Wen site.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 weeks now and at first my hair did get very sticking and oily but after about a month it went away.</li>
            <li> About two years ago I decided to begin blending the increasing amount of grey hair on my head using more highlights.</li>
            <li> I liked the price for the items received and the comb other than that; the product itself is not that great!&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner&#x3D; Doesn&#x27;t leave the hear like a real conditioner</li>
            <li> I used it exactly per directions and it set my scalp to itching unbearably and did absolutely nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I said,\\&quot; really is this funny to you.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> As long as my hair likes it, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full natural curl state,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good started kit if you are not sure it will work for you.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Sweet Almond Mint\\&quot; formula appeared to have ingredients that are beneficial for hair that isn&#x27;t naturally oily.</li>
            <li> I never experienced the bouncy, beautiful hair that I saw in the infomercial.  </li>
            <li> Fig is for thicker, curly or color treated hair, Sweet Almond Mint and Pomegrante are universal formulas, Tea Tree for Scalp issues, Lavender for fine hair provides volume, Cucumber Aloe fine hair that tends to have oily scalp and dry</li>
            <li> Amazingly, with the Wen I kept it down all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kit contained all the products pictured here: Sweet Almond Mint Conditioner (12 oz.), Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment (2 oz.), Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cream (2 oz.), Sweet Mint Texture Balm (.35 oz.), and a black wide-tooth</li>
            <li> however, do the exact same thing my sister did back in April, which was dye my hair prior to using the product, so my hair looked so shiny and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> My hair had been feeling limp and fine for the last several years and now it is full and has amazing body!</li>
            <li> The mask was great for a deep conditioning treatment and the texturizing stick is hardly needed, unless you want to tame a fly away</li>
            <li> I do wish Wen would devise a Conditioning Shampoo that would work better for those of us with oily hair but using normal shampoo from time to time isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s back to using oils or grease or styling gels, and most definitely shampoo, while I wait for the next big thing that will greatly aid in ethic hair</li>
            <li> Those, too, were less than spectacular.</li>
            <li> If your hair is normal or coarse it would work better.</li>
            <li> I followed directions in guide,and the end result was super soft hair with tons of volume.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions 100 percent and my hair has never been more dry.  </li>
            <li> She feels her normal shampoo and conditioner, Garnier Fructis does a better job at a lesser cost.</li>
            <li> I saw instant results -- after the first wash my hair was smooth &amp; glossy and felt like silk.  </li>
            <li> So far almond oil has help tremendously.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Made my hair greasy and flat not full and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Between the response from customer service, which pretty much summed it up that the whole thing is a marketing gimmick, to literally being cut off by the customer service representative as I was stating my dissatisfaction with everything.</li>
            <li> my hair was super shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> I air dry my air and its thicker, more volume and shiny.</li>
            <li> Easy to comb hair out, but hair is oily next day.</li>
            <li> After using hair vitamins and some oil treatments, I&#x27;ve got my shine back, but my hair is still not as strong as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> I bought this from Sephora after one of the employees strongly recommended it for my hair--I used it the next day, and came out of the shower with my hair in knots.</li>
            <li> Certainly nothing like the results advertised.  </li>
            <li> So I end up paying $180 per year to use this as a conditioner and another $20 for 2 large bottles of Pantene coming out to $17 per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Well, almost immediately I started losing large amounts of hair while washing it in the shower.</li>
            <li> but I certainly did not.</li>
            <li> I was expecting some positive results but nothing really huge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to spend a little extra time keeping track of your orders/order dates, then I feel certain you will be more than pleased.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought Wen for me as a thoughtful gift - that was my ONLY positive experience with Wen.</li>
            <li> They trick you into signing up for extra product to be purchased by shoving some sort of agreement in the fine print.</li>
            <li> My fine blonde dyed hair with gray is youthful again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After more research I&#x27;ve found that the concept of not using traditional shampoo - instead using conditioners or sulfate free cleansers - is not a new one.</li>
            <li> It is frizzy and very dry most of the time.  </li>
            <li> I have short little fly aways all over my head.</li>
            <li> she just put a little oil in my hair and it dried naturally into perfect frizz free and soft curls all over.</li>
            <li> I have blonde medium-thick straight to light wavy hair..</li>
            <li> Thanks Chaz Dean and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ended up wasting so much money that they wouldn&#x27;t refund.</li>
            <li> You really have to work it in, and you really have to wash it out.</li>
            <li> but I have to use lots of products depending if it&#x27;s curly or straight and also depending the temperature and even thought my hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really afford getting them too often and QVC does let you adjust how often you receive shipments.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any results.  </li>
            <li> My hair does have improved shine, very manageable.  </li>
            <li> Now my hair is tangle free even into the next day.  </li>
            <li> I had to do a lot of work to get my hair to go silky and straight.  </li>
            <li> again followed the instructions and after washing my hair I followed it up with the re-moist mask, leaving it on for about an hour and rinsed very well.  </li>
            <li> My hair really has gotten softer and silkier the longer</li>
            <li> &quot; it made my hair very flaky almost like sand from the beach</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair feels and it looks so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> scalp wasn&#x27;t very cleansed, still had some residue from my hair products when I used it.</li>
            <li> REALLY WELL, SMELLS WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;AS</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS SOO MUCH EASIER AND QUICKER</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase another Wen refill because it is very costly.</li>
            <li> They have been very flexible with me and ship the products I want out when I want it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so fast b/c of how much product you have to use each time in order for it to work and</li>
            <li> After that not so much.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product really at all.</li>
            <li> I dont think much for the texture balm, the comb, and the styling creme.  </li>
            <li> and I really couldn&#x27;t afford to.</li>
            <li> I have come to really like the Wen cleansing conditioner shampoos.  </li>
            <li> not so much...</li>
            <li> my hair has always been frizzy and i really havent seen improvemnt in that area.</li>
            <li> Smells ok, not really into mint hair stuff though.</li>
            <li> I really would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I Wonder do the people who advertise using this really use it?</li>
            <li> I find I must put something in my hair to soften and moisturize my very curly ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> Mine, not so much.</li>
            <li> Instead, I used a brush, which worked better than my attempt with the wide tooth comb.  </li>
            <li> I really tried to hang in there</li>
            <li> But very time consuming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much of a coincidence</li>
            <li> They really make my hair nice,soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I just cant justify spending so much on something that really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> It was very noticeable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping it keeps working</li>
            <li> For the price I really expected more.  </li>
            <li> We should all be very leary about a product that goes through a business run this way.  </li>
            <li> I just went straight into ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I was ready to comb my hair</li>
            <li> &quot; [HAHA]</li>
            <li> and it really helps keep the color longer.</li>
            <li> Could this really be the wonder product for my frizzy, curly hair?</li>
            <li> If you believe in your product so much it might be wiser to give the option of automatically restocking your customers as opposed to forcing it on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was going to be really greasy because it did not lather.  </li>
            <li> I used to use a mousse, frizz control creme (thanks to Florida), and hairspray.  </li>
            <li> and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> No matter how straight I blowdry my hair, Florida&#x27;s humidity wreaks havoc with my curls.  </li>
            <li> The remoist mask is fantastic as a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it leaves your hair very greasy and/oil feeling.</li>
            <li> I tried undoing it for three days straight--I just had to suck it up and make a hair appointment, where they had to cut through them (including five inches of hair), which I really didn&#x27;t want to do.</li>
            <li> Thanks Wen.</li>
            <li> Wen did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> very easily).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like Wen but, with the economy the way it is</li>
            <li> really what happened to the 1 time shipment.</li>
            <li> Boy I guess I really need to talk to someone before believing what they put in their ads....</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy unmanageable hair and was hoping this product would help.</li>
            <li> but this one is the real thing because it comes with a wen booklet</li>
            <li> The texture and moisture level of my hair and scalp are much improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took the time, followed the instructions precisely and washed my hair with this product several times in order for my hair to \\&quot;get used\\&quot; to the product.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight, silky hair anyway, but this product gives me off the charts shine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all in how much you RINSE your hair after cleansing.</li>
            <li> Both of them have given me very satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> (I do torture my hair into submission, so I really shouldn&#x27;t complain when I get what</li>
            <li> and I really wish I could keep using it.  </li>
            <li> Really if you have been searching for a product and you don&#x27;t have hair like mine or you have the money, you really need to try this product.</li>
            <li> These people are scam artists that buy the product under the buyers name throught Wen, for a much cheaper price, and keep the profit.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I really resent this mis-representation and canceled the membership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t need to purchase as much as they think</li>
            <li> If anything my hair does not fall out as much.</li>
            <li> I am, and always have been, very picky about my hair care products.</li>
            <li> I continue to order online and have to be responsible about the auto ship.</li>
            <li> I feel my hair has gotten much stronger and softer after using this.</li>
            <li> I really do hope the Wen system will work for you as well as it did for me.</li>
            <li> much, much nicer than when I used to use shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if I had straight to wavy hair it would work but not for curly.</li>
            <li> I went straight up stairs to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please people be very cautious of this.</li>
            <li> I am seeking legal help, contacting the fda, QVC,WEN and anyone else that is connected to this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Chaz.</li>
            <li> AND so much easier than washing and conditioning.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser said something about there being too much protein in the product.</li>
            <li> I have not seem much difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m going to be straight up.</li>
            <li> But the real test would come after I blew it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it help me out so much</li>
            <li> but after using, I noticed so much of my hair coming out when I combed it and in 3 years I have never had that problem...</li>
            <li> So it runs out fast if you have any amount of hair.</li>
            <li> makes your hair very gummy.  </li>
            <li> They add some products in the \\&quot;kit\\&quot; but what you really use is the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> My expectation was that this product should let me straighten my hair out easier if it can really soften the texture.</li>
            <li> Someone who loves your product gave me a bottle to try and I used the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I can re-order when I am ready.  </li>
            <li> she said it really works on her..</li>
            <li> Then fast forward to August of 2013.  </li>
            <li> Really????  </li>
            <li> So as I am expressing to the customer service representative on how I think their whole concept is a gimmick to rob money from consumers, the customer service representative literally begins to speak over me, while I am talking, just trying to cut me off, telling me that I just need to return the items, and I will be refunded the charges and hung up.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t use as much product.  </li>
            <li> I used the product as per the directions and found that it really didn&#x27;t work on my hair.  </li>
            <li> everything else dries my hair out too much</li>
            <li> Also, the suggested amount to use for each section of your hair is way too much in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> Can make hair look very oily</li>
            <li> but when just made it very greasy.</li>
            <li> It seemed to moisturize my hair and really bring out the curl.  </li>
            <li> I started to get really scared and wondered what was causing it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Wen.</li>
            <li> So I threw the whole thing in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t want to believe that this product would really make me lose my hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser admitted that my hair felt much thinner.</li>
            <li> Also--if you have longer hair, you are not going to believe how much of the product they recommendthat you use--several pumps (like 6) on each section of hair.</li>
            <li> Brought the color back and my kinky hair was smooth like when my stylist does it, saving me $30.00.</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged from over-processing, coloring, bleaching...the works.  </li>
            <li> My hair is also very fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had called them telling them I wasn&#x27;t ready for a shipment in April.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was cleaning my hair very well, either.</li>
            <li> I am almost ready to reorder and I think this time I&#x27;ll try the Lavender.</li>
            <li> I really expected it to be mostly hype and/or</li>
            <li> SHIPPING WAS FAST COSTUMER SERVICE WAS PROMPT AND VERY HELPFULL</li>
            <li> but you really have to follow the instructions</li>
            <li> I make sure my hair is thoroughly WET - all the way to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I really have no use for this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The accessories that come with it work really well, and the Wen conditioner works well as just that, a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I went back to the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> I really feel like the Wen comb (or a good wide tooth comb) is essential.</li>
            <li> Another suggestion was a second wash after the first rinse, or using tea tree oil or the cucumber for your scalp and the fig or sweet almond mint for the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you made the mistake of signing up with Wen directly and decide to cancel automatic-auto-renewal, be sure to cancel ALL of your memberships as they break-up the product lines into different accounts.</li>
            <li> I liked it .It is different then my regular shampoo .</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and more manageable, but I must alternate my normal shampoo because my hair becomes weighed down after too many uses.</li>
            <li> My hair was really soft, fell nicely in place and didn&#x27;t seem to tangle nearly as much as when I used other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh, like you I have seen the commercial and was so excited I could get it for less on amazon, but the only things I liked were the excitment of getting started and the sweet scent.  </li>
            <li> Right away my hair did feel soft.</li>
            <li> Other products I have for blowing curly hair straight seemed to work much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see how much it will affect my hair after numerous uses.</li>
            <li> Seriously, using cheap suave is way better on my hair this this.</li>
            <li> you could find other products that could be better to your hair and hair type.</li>
            <li> First time i used it i immediately noticed how soft my hair was!</li>
            <li> I am glad that I tried it in this way and would recommend anyone who is curious about the Wen system to try it first before they order it with the automatic shipment requirement directly from Wen.</li>
            <li> and I sent back the remainder of my original products.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of weeks I used this stuff, my hair was so soft!</li>
            <li> but I save more because I dont use a ton of gel and other hair care stuff.</li>
            <li> I cancelled my memberships, they continue to bill me, and supposedly send more products, although I haven&#x27;t received anything other than my bank stating I paid Wen, again.</li>
            <li> and I should try their other line which will be more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> so i will be getting some more for my other 2 daughters.</li>
            <li> Maybe this won&#x27;t happen to you, but it did to me,and it has happened to many other people (do some online research) and</li>
            <li> I went to my stylist to see what we could do to change my hair texture and color back to its original glamorous condition.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try Wen, especially after watching the glorified infomercials and hearing reviews.  </li>
            <li> (hers: fine, straight, dry, shoulder length, processed.</li>
            <li> It looks like the newer QVC formulas begin with more plant extracts vs the one time shipment which had a few alcohols listed as the first three ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> concern was that my hair wouldn&#x27;t actually get clean.  </li>
            <li> Following the directions and separating the hair into four sections and using the comb keeps my hair looking clean all day.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use an off brand basic shampoo just to &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean once a week or so.</li>
            <li> No tangles at all (my hair is long and fine and tangels</li>
            <li> think that for someone with straight hair, this would probably be a decent product.  </li>
            <li> (Mine is long and fine and I like 12 pumps.)</li>
            <li> Just a clean smell overall.</li>
            <li> Seriously this stuff is really good</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but there&#x27;s a lot of it and tends to be oily at the scalp and dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li> set thinking I was going to the normal size set of Wen that I once purchased before(from the original WEN Company)for the same price this company is selling it for.</li>
            <li> My hair type is fine and oily at the scalp and dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of Wen By Chaz Dean Sweet Almond 5 piece set from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> From the first day my hair was soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> b/c I would find twice as much hair in my drain than I normally find after I washed it with Wen(which</li>
            <li> I like the fact that there was no foaming, because then I got the chance to actually handle my massive mound properly and gave it a good wash.</li>
            <li> It was good , but not s good as the Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stated I only paid $9.95 for the product, when my credit card was charged the full price of $32.00 +</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the full amount recommended and only wash my hair 3 times a week</li>
            <li> After the first shipment the charge shipping and $90 for a three month supply which is a complete rip off.</li>
            <li> I have only used the Sweet Almond Mint &#x27;flavor&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> most def not worth the money.</li>
            <li> B0048O2R1E WEN® Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]] has a DIFFERENT and in my opinion gentler ingredient list than the one on wenhaircare.com!  </li>
            <li> I have fine, but coarse, hair, naturally curly, and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;shampoo/conditioner\\&quot; for my hair, which is fine and thick, made my hair a bit too soft and fly away; the texture balm calmed it down.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was thinking that this was going to weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> I just will be ordering directly from WEN where I will get my monies worth because now as I see the price suddenly went up right after this</li>
            <li> When we finally got to the full treatment of highlights which would typically cause a lot of damage, she was just amazed at how healthy my hair continued to be.</li>
            <li> while it did help, it didnt give me the SHINE I wanted - which is the real reason I&#x27;ve been shopping around for new hair products.</li>
            <li> I say try using less, comb it thru and add more if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten blood tests to rule out thyroid and hormone problems, and I am healthy, not pregnant, etc.</li>
            <li> I think thata business should have more integrity than that, and getting a customer like me who uses less</li>
            <li> It is most useful when you use small dabs of it to tame the most stubborn strands.</li>
            <li> Wen was able to get all the way to the root and fix the damgage that had beeen done by previous non-wen products.</li>
            <li> Despite that, I still do not use the recommended number of pumps and just work it through from scalp to ends until there is a decent amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall you may be better off spending the 30 bucks for one of the 16 oz bottles instead of spending 30 bucks for a 12 oz (in this package) and other products that so far seemso-so (but there is that comb!</li>
            <li> It feels great long after my hair has dried!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have also been informed: Both \\&quot;Wen\\&quot; and \\&quot;Hair One\\&quot; are mainly conditioners.</li>
            <li> I just sent back the product to meet the 60-day guarantee window, and I will have to do a lot of reconstruction on my hair to get it back healthy.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this particular item combo because it says in caps:</li>
            <li> I have blonde highlighted shoulder length light brown hair which is naturally wavy/curly.  </li>
            <li> I would buy that if I saw it in a store for a decent price.</li>
            <li> The balm dried out my hair more than what it all ready was and the comb was horrid.  </li>
            <li> So I went to the post office trying to return everything, and bought a priority box big enough for the 2 boxes and made sure I got a delivery confirmation</li>
            <li> have a sensitive scalp, by the way, so I massaged the cleansing conditioner into my scalp as well as combed it through my hair, and my scalp felt instantly soothed, moisturized and comfortable.</li>
            <li> My hair looks ok, no big difference from regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> What you mainly look at are the charges.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I thought the solution was to use more Wen and more often.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I e mailed Customer Service about the autofill issue, they replied immediately and answered my questions clearly and with a positive, customer oriented mindset.  </li>
            <li> I expected to be completely disappointed with the products and like so many others in my continual search for the perfect hair products, find it being dropped into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus, with my long hair, I had to use so much of the product that I figured the bottle wouldn&#x27;t last more than one or two weeks.  </li>
            <li> My curls are bouncy instead of droop, full instead of flat.</li>
            <li> I really liked it the first few times I used it, but then it started to make my blonde hair look brassy.  </li>
            <li> I had to be very careful or it would leave my fine hair very greasy.</li>
            <li> I have always had very strong thick healthy hair, that I am just starting to see again for the first time in a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product after watching the infomercial.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend NOT using their products or services.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I highly discourage anyone from using it.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes but my hair was frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product after watching the infomercial.  </li>
            <li> I knew the application procedure was way to high maintenance for me</li>
            <li> She highly recommended it to her fellow women.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> But once I used the flat iron it was smooth and shiny and SOOOOO soft.  </li>
            <li> and it worked ok, still a little too greasy for my taste.</li>
            <li> but that does not mean I have to like their sneaky business practices.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money!!</li>
            <li> SO MUCH that I have thrown out my old shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I could have ordered the product directly from the retailer much CHEAPER</li>
            <li> but it does absolutely nothing for people with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Okay, too many reviews on here are too lengthy and honestly too boring to read.</li>
            <li> and so far I really like the Lavender and Cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you may never want to return to a traditional shampoo ever again and its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I used it a few more times anyway.</li>
            <li> I did have was nothing compared to my normal frizz factor.  </li>
            <li> YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THE COOLING, FRESH SENSATION FROM THE ALMOND MINT.ALSO</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to order a bunch of it in order for it to last &amp; be worth my while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have lost of time to do my hair and was hoping this would help save some time... not the case.</li>
            <li> It does take a bit longer to use than normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I used a gift card to purchase this and didn&#x27;t waste my money.  </li>
            <li> ...don&#x27;t bother, just another late night commercial scam packed nice but product s^&amp;t!</li>
            <li> Loved the extra trips to the docs and the extra money spent there.</li>
            <li> Normally I go a couple days between shampoos</li>
            <li> I should have received the Normal size set...</li>
            <li> I love the product, but this stuff is not cheap..</li>
            <li> I think the product is heavy and requires a multi-step application process, but it did not leave my hair any more sleek than my normal product.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, and I only have to use about 6-7 pumps each use even though the label says that I should use much more.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, seems like alot of product to use (according to the instructions) and feels reall thick.</li>
            <li> I did think it was an effective cleanser, and my hair was moist after its use, but I would only re-purchase it if the price came WAY down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am african american, but tend to have better results with mainstream shampoos due to my hair texture being more that of a mixed person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;let&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I got off Wen and switched to the Body Shop shampoo and conditioner which contains no hard chemicals.  </li>
            <li> keep in mind, i would eventually have to pay about 100$ on two bottles that surely wont last me but 2  months because i said my hair is very long.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised that it added a slight refreshing tingle and wasn&#x27;t overpowering in scent or sensation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I mentioned above, I love comb-thru texturizers but they leave me extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Received as ordered and have used product three times and find my hair to be more soft and silky with less flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was gentle on my multi-racial fine and soft hair (African American/European American).  </li>
            <li> evening my hair looked just as clean as when it was first washed and the little bit of frizz</li>
            <li> Both are under $3 each and both are found right here on Amazon, but neither contains the added ingredients which target specific hair-type needs.</li>
            <li> I also thought perhaps this hair care is designed more for people who really style their hair like straighten or blow dry it, but I just air dry my hair</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit of it made my hair look chunky, oily, and weighed down, which pretty much counteracted the fabulous results I got from the Wen shampoo itself.</li>
            <li> -- I am still rating this product 5 stars because I really like it, but after prolonged use on my fine hair, I found that my hair got heavy and greasy looking after awhile.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the shampoo and when they asked, \\&quot;would you like a free trial of Endless Youth Vitamins?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> and I had been thinking about getting a new hair product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- New Wen Ad - October 2013&lt;</li>
            <li> - you should always try new things because what works for you may not work for someone else and vice versa.</li>
            <li> and I live in FL</li>
            <li> [I don&#x27;t live in the US of A btw]</li>
            <li> however, i still received new shipments at my door.  </li>
            <li> When you order from Wen your visa number is saved and you will automatically be shipped a new supply of product after 30 days or 3 months (depending on what you order).</li>
            <li> They automatically send you new products.  </li>
            <li> ; I even have new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I started trying the new scents as they come out</li>
            <li> This whole thing is a huge sham.</li>
            <li> The products are fine, but not worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li> I have natural afro-textured hair and yes it made my hair extremely soft and loosened my curls which leave me to wonder what really is in it</li>
            <li> &quot; you see advertised, you are actually binding yourself to a membership, which is why it&#x27;s so cheap at the initial purchase.</li>
            <li> Ok, no better than my normal Organix shampoo.</li>
            <li> and it got better, but if I tried to use it in the shower or on wet hair, the smell came back.</li>
            <li> It did feel very soft, but I decided to go back to using my regular, sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft (my son keeps petting it) and manageable.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very very soft but very very frizzy so overall this product do not deliver what claims to do.  </li>
            <li> this is a good shampoo to use only a few days a week and then alternate with another normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but if you order from the WEN company they will sign you up for future orders without clearly stating it as such.  </li>
            <li> My hair reacted by becoming so dry and frizzy that it was starting to feel like hay and was breaking all of the time.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> how convenient is it when you are only interested in trying the product?</li>
            <li> I will never buy this product again, and will discourage everyone I Love and care about not to waste their time nor money!</li>
            <li> disappointed I have to say I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.  </li>
            <li> If you purchase the first month they bill you for the next 2 months with no notice.  </li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m going to try turning off the water during the first step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> especially the frizz the first time I used it .</li>
            <li> My hair is more fuller than usual, even as wavy.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I am completely blown away!</li>
            <li> My first &amp; last purchase from this company.</li>
            <li> When I used WEN for the first time, I could actually brush my hair.</li>
            <li> hair was \\&quot;too\\&quot; soft!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed my hair with this 2x so far and it works for me!</li>
            <li> I used the product to the exact instructions, the first time, as in the second time and the results were not the same.</li>
            <li> I used this product four times, each time following the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> The only difference was the day proceeding my first use of Wen, I had never seen my hair so matted and</li>
            <li> got it last Saturday and used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Funny, I assumed canceling THREE times would be enough to have them get the</li>
            <li> the most important step rinse with as cold as water as you can stand and rinse really well.</li>
            <li> B003PXZI2O WEN BY CHAZ DEAN SWEET ALMOND CONDITONER, STYLING CREME, RE MOIST MASK INTENSIVE HAIR TREATMENT, TEXTURE BALM, WIDE TOOTH SHOWER COMB, 5 PIECE SET, 1 TIME SHIPMENT]]</li>
            <li> :B003PXZI2O WEN BY CHAZ DEAN SWEET ALMOND CONDITONER, STYLING CREME, RE MOIST MASK INTENSIVE HAIR TREATMENT, TEXTURE BALM, WIDE TOOTH SHOWER COMB, 5 PIECE SET,</li>
            <li> and as anyone with curly hair knows it is super sensitive and normally dry.  </li>
            <li> it had nothing to weigh it down to make it smooth.  </li>
            <li> The box I just received apparently is for 59.00!!!!</li>
            <li> , I also the first night I got it used the re moist sweet almond mint intensive hair treatment, I left that on for several hours for a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> She has thick, straight, very full hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not meant for my hair type ( super thick and very long) and maybe others had a better experience using it</li>
            <li> received the kit a few days after placing my order (very quick shipping) and decided to give it a try immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have great very thick, very long hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very fine, dishwater blonde hair that I have peroxide highlights put in every few months.  </li>
            <li> styling cream seems like it could be a decent product on its own, but beware of using with any other products as it will congeal and leave you with little gelatinous chunks in your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you get a relaxer in particular, the fig can help you with breakage by keeping it in better condition as it grows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, while I have not had the problem of any sticky or oily issues, I did read on another blog that one issue with this could be the amount of time spent rinsing, especially afterward, which should be several minutes.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, almost to the middle of my back, so I use more product.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m on day 4 after washing my hair, and my hair is definitely gotten frizzier, but it still looks really good, especially compared to how it usually is.</li>
            <li> My scalp is pretty normal, although it can get flaky, which could be oil or dry or from the heat I use.</li>
            <li> My hair after just a blow dry was very manageable and straight.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4z afro-textured hair, dense with fine to wiry strands (meaning there is a mixture of strand types on this one little head of mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The comb is too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve thought about it, I love putting comb-thru texturizers in my hair which leave it in a state of not really permed but notreally natural either (and without a moisturizer it is highly dry), which is probably why neither Wen or Hair One worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;SIDE BAR</li>
            <li> I was excited to say the least for the first use, so after a month-</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and color treated a few inches below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> send you two large bottles with two styling creams/balms every three months (Charging $30 on your credit card per month) (4 items total).</li>
            <li> Large amounts of cleansing conditioner needed for even SHORT hair!</li>
            <li> I had  recieved 4 extra sets of the two set large orders.  </li>
            <li> careful what you are signing up for, they are very tricky!!</li>
            <li> I am mixed, black and white, so my hair is curly and gets frizzy pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I do recommend adding a little water to your hair when putting it in, the cleanser is thick and the water helps smooth it into your hair, and also the longer you leave it in the better, you can feel it working on your scalpel.</li>
            <li> It was no longer healthy, but it was dry and had split ends and was extremely damaged.  </li>
            <li> Most products leave my hair either really dry or extremely oily.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Surely my childhood favorite, Melissa Gilbert (Laura Ingalls), wouldn&#x27;t be a spokesperson for a bad product\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting more and more frustrated with this company.</li>
            <li> Soon my scalp started to clear up and Than just out of curiosity</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean my hair properly, and it makes it greasy at the roots and dry and brittle at the ends.</li>
            <li> But I will keep using my Wen products each time I clean my hair, and hopefully, over time, there will be less hair</li>
            <li> Its really sad since its such a great product.</li>
            <li> I just went directly to wenhaircare.com and bought it for 29.95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll learn his product isn&#x27;t completely natural</li>
            <li> so I was extremely surprised.</li>
            <li> nearly drove me to my knees.</li>
            <li> biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that my hair is really soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much shine or extra body like the product claims</li>
            <li> review seems more negative than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> So far, based on the ease of managing my hair, I&#x27;m thinking I will continue to use the product.  </li>
            <li> Was professionally packaged-like I&#x27;d ordered it from one of the TV commercials.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft but the wow came from how out of control</li>
            <li> I think it was because it made my hair soo soft</li>
            <li> My shoulder length hair is naturally curly with the tendency to frizz</li>
            <li> If this product was really going to work, this was the ultimate test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> THAT WHOLE 60 DAY MONEY BACK</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I have natural non relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this and washing my hair with any old conditioner in place of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair did have a shine and was soft and silky.</li>
            <li> The initial bottle has lasted a whole month</li>
            <li> My course hair is finally soft and managable.</li>
            <li> and I have never felt my hair that soft before.</li>
            <li> lastly, my favorite comb-thru texturizer, Elasta QP was discontinued late 2012</li>
            <li> Decided to get some natural Mercola shampoo and the almost immediately the hair loss stopped and the dandruff went away.</li>
            <li> It has never been so soft and i even noticed my hair was shinny.</li>
            <li> It really was such a miracle!!!!</li>
            <li> This is why I purchase from AMAZON or directly from Chaz Dean&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li> My adult girls talked me into using Wen</li>
            <li> I think I must be sensitive to the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and I do use it once in a while, but it does not work nearly as well as Wen.  </li>
            <li> I just want my hair to look shiny with the natural curl and controlled frizz.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned WEN HAIR CARE IS OVERPRICED &amp;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does make your hair soft</li>
            <li> Somehow the seller works it out so you will get the package directly from WEN</li>
            <li> this product I completely dig.</li>
            <li> but my hair feels soft and still feels and looks thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I was surprised on how well it cleaned my hair.  </li>
            <li> However, now when the humidity hits my hair, it turns into soft curls and waves instead of looking frizzy and out-of-control.  </li>
            <li> I would not waste the money or the effort buying this product.  </li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> it made my hair so silky soft, and</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> Even though Wen claims to have all of the essentials needed to restore your natural oils..</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I leave it in my hair while I&#x27;m finishing my shower and rinse it completely out before I get out.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend buying straight from the Wen website as the system is cheaper and they have a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> My hair isnt nearly as fuzzy as it use to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead you used my information to order the product directly from the retailer and I was enrolled anyways.</li>
            <li> 41 years old and loosing hair -</li>
            <li> This product made my  hair stronger and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> i use it on my hair and my 2 year old grandaughter.it</li>
            <li> our hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product, but my 16 yr old has.  </li>
            <li> This is my first ever review, but I am a long time Amazon customer....</li>
            <li> The next day I decided to wash it again with wen and then blow it out straight.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old got up to look and said no mo</li>
            <li> Naturally, I called customer service.  </li>
            <li> The natural curls are still there.</li>
            <li> I use on my natural hair</li>
            <li> So much for this product, I went back to Pantene and my hair shines, shines, shines.</li>
            <li> (the \\&quot;way\\&quot; you are supposed to use the products) - and - even for me (who has naturally curly hair -which tends to be</li>
            <li> Besides all that, it smells like old lady shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This is the regime I&#x27;ve been following since and its been working very well for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was relaxing my hair to avoid the difficulty of combing my natural hair.</li>
            <li> This has encouraged me to grow out my natural hair and save some money.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> You must follow the directions completely.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair soft and with shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WEN leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and used the tea tree Wen.</li>
            <li> However, my hair is just as soft and managable with products I&#x27;ve bought at a drug store.  </li>
            <li> It is billed as being SO natural...</li>
            <li> There is a class action lawsuit underway.</li>
            <li> I am very grateful for my hair actually, but this stuff ruined it.</li>
            <li> It took about 1 to 2 weeks but eventually my hair stopped breaking and feels really soft again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost the entire bottle of product and I don&#x27;t see much result.</li>
            <li> I am a natural red-head with fine-medium hair (like Jessica Chastain and Amy Adams).</li>
            <li> They will enroll you in the auto-ship and the product comes directly from Chaz Dean charging you another $9.95 for shipping in addition to what I paid on Amazon</li>
            <li> This has been a complete fiasco.</li>
            <li> but u have to use it frequently to reap the benefits....</li>
            <li> oh so soft.</li>
            <li> and wow has my hair changed.  </li>
            <li> ALSO SO FAR 4 STARS FOR THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money and their customer service will argue with you on why you do not want automatic shipment.</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use a generous amount and leave it on at least 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> say it is worth to try it if you&#x27;re curious</li>
            <li> As i first started using this (the first few days)</li>
            <li> I am surre Chaz is an outstanding hairdresser, but his products left my hair feeling heavy and a wee bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also read most of the reviews on Amazon and found either people loved it or absolutely hated it.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be spreading the good word for WEN unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product does work good.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t happen and I have paid 65.00 for a product I knew was good to get a fake and can&#x27;t seem to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN for 5 years now, and NOTHING, and I mean, NOTHING makes my hair look and feel soft &amp; healthy like Chaz&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had problems with not rinsing it out well-enough, though I usually turn down the temp on the shower so that its between &#x27;cool&#x27; and the temp I normally bathe at (so warmer than luke warm, but not hot).  </li>
            <li> In the last couple of months, I&#x27;ve tried other conditioners and am open to replacing this one if I find one that would give me better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (which is more likely to happen with me than my daughter because my hair is fine, thin and long).</li>
            <li> I was not able to comb through my hair as easily as the infomercial showed,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, my hair tangles easily, but it&#x27;s usually nothing that some leave-in conditioner, detangler, and oil can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> There are other sulfate free shampoos that I feel do exactly what when does for less money.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, super soft, and there&#x27;s much less hair loss in the shower and while blowdrying.</li>
            <li> and I must say the supplier was FANTASTIC (the unusual UPS to USPS shipping method sent it to the east coast first when I am in Alaska - weird -</li>
            <li> and it also started to curl a little bit when it dries, which i dont know hwere that came from because i have pretty straight lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> at first i loved this shampoo but after a few months my hair stated to look dull and flat.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a need for this new product!</li>
            <li> Hair feels good after using this product but it also weighs the hair down and makes it hard to style.</li>
            <li> it is hard to find a good product what will not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So for me, having a single product that is conveniently delivered to my door for less cost as the other products I had been using is a good thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They told me I can not cancel the first order, but only future orders!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they only sent an address to send the items back to and then said you received exactly what you ordered &amp; they do not send out return labels.</li>
            <li> I am of African decent, living in the Caribbean, the heat alone will kill the stability of one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to darken my hair and heard that one of the benefits of Wen is that it makes your color last longer (and if you&#x27;ve ever died your hair red, you know how fast it fades!).</li>
            <li> I have since used it several times just to see if the first time was a fluke, but I keep experiencing the same results.  </li>
            <li> First use: My hair was very, very dry.</li>
            <li> but then I use another 3-4 pumps for all over my head with a little running water to help it spread throughout my hair and the full length.  </li>
            <li> You have high water pressure (mine is low so it would take forever to rinse the conditioner out, making my shower time seem like forever).</li>
            <li> You have to wash and rinse in cool/cold water and frankly, in the winter, I&#x27;m not down with that.  </li>
            <li> By that, I mean use warm (not HOT) water, make sure you rinse your hair for a few (two or so) minutes prior to application.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I would say that I see a huge difference between the outcome of my hair with this product vs. using shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> As a way of describing my hair type: I&#x27;m of mixed african american and caucasian heritage, and have sort of fine, naturally curly (so frizzy) hair that tends to be dry and heat-stressed although it&#x27;s not chemically relaxed.</li>
            <li> haha, that&#x27;s a long time to build up hype.</li>
            <li> Or just a normal daily routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking a the normal ten strands, I&#x27;m talking triple that - and not just when I washed -</li>
            <li> I asked them should I send it back &amp; they send the normal set</li>
            <li> Now it is back to its normal thickness.</li>
            <li> I also mix the \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; (which is also the \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; - same bottle) - with my normal salon conditioner too.</li>
            <li> My color is fading just as it normally does with regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> So, I re-introduced my normal shampoo (Pantene - Volume) and cleared all the build-up away before following it up with the the Wen cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> It leaves a waxy coating on your hair, it took about a month for my hair to get back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Immediately, I would only lose the normal amount of hair that a person would expect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i spent a little more.</li>
            <li> My hair was prone to being dull and easily damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not exactly angry about the order, but I expected to receive what I ordered, especially since I ended up a whole item short.</li>
            <li> I think any product that has more negative reviews than positive ones is definitely not worth the money to experiment with, but if you need to fill up a birthday or christmas wish list, then get some family member to buy it for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After all, I live outside of Miami Florida, the hair frizz capital of the world.  </li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t live together, have different diets.</li>
            <li> went back to normal shampoo and my hair is not dull or flat anymore.</li>
            <li> while my hair is dry, I deal with a very oily scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, colored, medium length, frizzy hair not curly or stick straight....</li>
            <li> She absolutely LOVES it because her hair is wavy and gets dry in the summer, but this stuff smooths out the dryness/frizzies.  </li>
            <li> I just air dry &amp; wear it straight...</li>
            <li> After the 3rd usage, I started to see a very noticable differenc in shine, softness and overall health.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m now back to my regular shampoo/conditioner Garnier, which does the job at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> I figured maybe i should give it a few more tries before quitting on it..</li>
            <li> stick a tiny bit, then put it up in a towel turban and when I brush it out it is so much easier to do that with regular products!  </li>
            <li> I use the shampoo(it&#x27;s really conditioner) - mixed with my regular salon shampoo</li>
            <li> It went back to Loreal and Garnier, even though they aren&#x27;t that expensive the quality is superior.</li>
            <li> My hair felt very soft, although it still wasn&#x27;t enough to fight the humidity frizz of Austin, TX weather.</li>
            <li> have a lot of fine hair and products weigh it down, so there&#x27;s always the balance between dry ends and over treated, lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li> While the product seems to go fast, you dont have to use it every single day for results.</li>
            <li> They were very helpful in getting these charges off my credit cards and did not require me to return a single product.</li>
            <li> Me being an african american with pretty basic relaxed hair could not use the product as a \\&quot;conditioning cleanser\\</li>
            <li> No other compares.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I stopped using chaz dean product, my hair stopped shedding excessively but not before I lost a significant amount...</li>
            <li> For the first three weeks, I used this product solely (washing every other day).</li>
            <li> I used to get major</li>
            <li> I saw the infomercial and thought i&#x27;d give it a try, After a month there is a major difference.</li>
            <li> The FAKE version which, as many reviews state, makes your hair fall out!  </li>
            <li> If I like the product then I will simply order directly through Gunthy Renker!</li>
            <li> I live in New Mexico where the weather is very dry.  </li>
            <li> On my first use it stripped my hair color that was less than a week old.  </li>
            <li> With this product my brush smoothly goes through my hair when wet and then while dry as I brush it throughout the day--even the next day.  </li>
            <li> not sure my scalp felt clean either....</li>
            <li> However, this formula is better than the \\&quot;Spring Gardenia Green Tea\\&quot; formula, which left my hair dry &amp; lifeless.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that is fine in consistency</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe because I have Natural african american hair which is why I had no positive results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have curly, very dry, very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying that I regularly color my hair, I have very thick, fine, straight, blondish hair .  </li>
            <li> Knowing full well that I am already outside of the 30-day trial period, I still want to send it back with a letter telling them that I am not interested in a refund</li>
            <li> I will say I&#x27;m not crazy about the texture balm because no matter how little I use, it makes my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> After using it I started looking online and found that every other website is full of the same warnings and very low ratings.</li>
            <li> My husband kept laughing at me when I blow dried my hair out after the first time of using this product, because I kept shouting; \\&quot;Oh my god!</li>
            <li> Only clean your hair every three days, but I always raise my hair everyday because I workout.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I have curley hair that can be dry and this works really well for frizz and does not dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; There is no Fig package offered on the commercial, it&#x27;s pushing Sweet Almond Mint, the package I ordered - which smells a little mediciny, like menthol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long natural frizzy hair that I highlight, color and straighten!!</li>
            <li> and she had heard other positive comments.  </li>
            <li> Great if you like your hair feeling dirty and greasy all day long</li>
            <li> got the mint almond featured in the one time shipment and was worried the mint would be overpowering (generally don&#x27;t like mint in anything but my mojitos for that reason.)  </li>
            <li> only use a small amount and my my colored hair combs out smooth and</li>
            <li> and I think the problem was that she didn&#x27;t really rinse like she should have--or she didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.  </li>
            <li> went from being a total skeptic to a complete kool-aid drinking convert.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going to keep checking them out since I&#x27;ve only used them once so far.  </li>
            <li> I barely leave reviews</li>
            <li> (I have natural african w/</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair done by a professional and even with the color treated shampoo it still gets brassy.</li>
            <li> Believe me I know, it happened the 2nd time I used it after I thought I had completely rinsed the product out of my hair.</li>
            <li> so far I am not totally sold on the product..</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised to experience just the opposite of nightmare.  </li>
            <li> Same story, my natural curls started to frizz up</li>
            <li> Finally after I finished the bottle I used my old humectress</li>
            <li> Returned to regular shanpoo use, now my hair has kept the soft, and manageable style for weeks without the Wen products.</li>
            <li> conditions\\&quot; everyone checks off on, i apparently agreed for them to send me continuous packages and be charged.</li>
            <li> Not only had an account been set up in my name, with my payment information, but all of the contact information as far as phone number and email had been made up.  </li>
            <li> It was like this thing put back my hair to it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li> I said no and told him what happened and how I shipped my old product back</li>
            <li> My hair was definitely softer than before, but completely out of control.&lt;br</li>
            <li> did start out with the 5 piece set and so far have only used the cleansing cream and the comb.  </li>
            <li> After she used the product once, she commented how soft her hair became, considering she didn&#x27;t use a \\&quot;traditional shampoo and conditioner\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About 10 days later, after using the recommended amount of product, I was ready to open my next bottle.</li>
            <li> Be careful how much you use and unless you have long hair, do NOT use as much as directed on the back.</li>
            <li> If I wanted this I would have bought it directly from the TV commercial.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and have naturally wavy course/thick hair at med/long length.</li>
            <li> The product definitely made my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> and I will NOT be reordering and will be going back to my old John Freida products.  </li>
            <li> My wife wanted to return this sub-par product which did the complete opposite of what they claimed...</li>
            <li> just goes to show that you have to know what you are buying and do your research, especially if your hair is sensitive to the two alcohols used in the Guthy-Renker version.</li>
            <li> Wen left her hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It takes just as long to use wen as it does to apply normal shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> used the included styling cream to blow-dry my hair and honestly can say I was not impressed with it, at all.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried the product yet, but after being rubbed the wrong way, even if I liked it, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I am sorry, but what kind of logic is that??  </li>
            <li> I am hispanic and have long thick hair, even Head and shoulders worked better for me than WEN products!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the anti dandruff shampoos made it worse, I love the Wen for my hair</li>
            <li> and it seem to get worse the more time I used it</li>
            <li> I have dark red color in my hair and red fades so quick</li>
            <li> following week I switched to the fig, and the results were much better, and dramatic: Super-glossy (not oily), soft, and ZERO</li>
            <li> After my hair was dry, I used the texture balm and styled normally.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t normal blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently viewed the new Wen infomercial which introduces a new product, Six-Thirteen - which is supposed to instantly hydrate damaged, dry, and chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical because I always thought you HAD to shampoo to get your hair &amp; scalp really clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much use for the other products.</li>
            <li> The other problem is that you are supposed to use so much of it that the bottle that comes in the kit (I think it&#x27;s 12oz) lasted me 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> However, after happening on the Wen infomercial while channel surfing; I was immediately pulled in because I have EXTREMELY fussy straight hair and</li>
            <li> reading all other reviews, this product really doesn&#x27;t seem to be for everyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tonight, I used Wen cleansing conditioner and styling creme on my hair for the first time, carefully following the directions: thoroughly wet your hair; use the proper amount of pumps</li>
            <li> The comb is a bust (too bulky and thick to slide through thinner hair), but the rest is worth it!</li>
            <li> styling creme was very helpful for when I wanted to blow dry and flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice to try a sample it made my hair greasy, limp &amp; dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fencepost as far as any big drastic changes from how my hair was with regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> After using a few more times made my hair oily and heavy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t afford to spend that kind of money on daily hair care...especially since it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair!  </li>
            <li> The conditioner helps great with keeping my hair less oily and flaky as long as I wash it at least every other day.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, my sister used it on me, in combination with several other products she uses, back in April of 2013.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After calling back again and waiting an hour again to speak to a live individual I was finally informed by a \\&quot;supervisor\\&quot; the account would finally be canceled and I would receive my refund.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair that can be difficult to manage but with this product I was able to comb thru and work with my hair much easier and within less time,  </li>
            <li> Apparently I didn&#x27;t b/c it left my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I used Wen today for the first time and my hair is limp &amp; looks greasy.</li>
            <li> The product dried out my hair from the first use.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because of the cheesiness of the infomercials (nothing can be that good) and the cost.  </li>
            <li> Oh, I also live in a very dry climate (in the desert).  </li>
            <li> i live in a very dry climate</li>
            <li> I have long (down to the middle of my back), coarse, full and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> But I can understand if you have straight and/or thinner hair how this stuff might weigh your hair down and make it seem oily/dirty.</li>
            <li> right before I started using it, and usually I start seeing split ends in a month</li>
            <li> and I have dry hair because it is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> I have dry course hair and there is no othee product that helps my natural hair retain moisture...</li>
            <li> My dry course hair is now soft, silky, and manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good product at all, if you want something natural or sulfate-free use a L&#x27;oreal product that&#x27;s worth 5$</li>
            <li> I have to confess that I was very doubtful after seeing the infomercials, too good to be true</li>
            <li> I have used Ouidad for the last few years and even that has not been able to manage it this past year.</li>
            <li> I have mostly straight, thick, long hair, and my hair doesn&#x27;t take curl very well, however with just a nickel size amount of styling creme in it, when I curl my hair, it lasts 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I normally need a diffuser and a few products to get curls that look any where near the results from today (and it was a humid 85 degrees when I left the salon).</li>
            <li> Two handfuls of hair and a 40 minute shower later I dried my hair only to find it looked and felt exactly the same as before using Wen.</li>
            <li> My hair was SO soft and manageble, no longer dry and frizzy!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser was so worried my fine, thin hair would not hold up to this aggressive treatment.</li>
            <li> for my baby fine, thin, oily-prone medium length hair, it worked wonders after one use.</li>
            <li> The product came with a little informational pamphlet from Wen, which did not tell me to use quite as much product as I see is suggested on the Wen website.</li>
            <li> In other word, it doesn&#x27;t matter how much you return, as long as it is in one box, it can only count as one!  </li>
            <li> I did a fast wash and looked a little greasy mid day.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have long, straight, oily hair and this product did not make my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> I went to Michigan to visit family during the past heatwave, and came back to the western part of the country with my hair looking/feeling like a rat&#x27;s nest, super dry.</li>
            <li> (&amp; the other products it came with), it definitely made my hair soft &amp; shiny like</li>
            <li> I checked the ingredients on the container of both the \\&quot;Sweet Almond Mint\\&quot; cleansing conditioner &amp; the \\&quot;Spring Gardenia Green Tea\\&quot; cleansing conditioner, it appears they are formulated a little differently.</li>
            <li> It may take you a couple of times of using this product to get your new routine down</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;deep conditioning treatment\\&quot; has to be left in for 20-30 minutes, you have to scrub your hair for a really long time, and then leave the product in for several minutes, and then rinse for several minutes)</li>
            <li> My hair goes through extreme shrinkage but the combination of these 2 seem to help my hair stay a little more stretched out and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> I tried it out of curiosity, and I may just be hooked enough to give up normal shampoo and conditioner, though it is a little pricy.</li>
            <li> I had to wash with regular shampoo a few times just to get my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li> in conclusion if you love your long thick hair don&#x27;t waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> Normally coloring and highlighting my hair results in straw that I will have to deep condition for days following a color just to get some softness back and to help tame my hair.  </li>
            <li> I felt like it was to much work because you have to wet your hair than put the wen product in your hair starting from the roots down to the ends</li>
            <li> Having seen the commercials I was very excited to try this product very disappointing as well as not being aware when I purchased it with my Credit card I had automatically signed up for auto renewal</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it leaves it a greasy, limp mess - almost like it looks wet.</li>
            <li> all potential buyers of this product know they will be subject to the same regulations Wen places on those who buy directly from them.</li>
            <li> I switched back to shampoo for a month or so (and back to that &#x27;dry&#x27; look that I don&#x27;t like), and since then, I alternate between WEN and Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shiny Shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I also had to give up because one bottle is only enough for 8 days when you have long hair.</li>
            <li> I used as directed, left on as long as possible.</li>
            <li> like the company said or do I return it and get my money back &amp; how long do they think it would be for them to put my money back to my card...</li>
            <li> but it was not enough to last because I have long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly after good results the first few times, it left my normally dry hair very greasy, and nasty.</li>
            <li> I ran a quick flat iron through my dried hair and went about my day - again assuming my hair/scalp would be oily by the end of the day or my hair would be a mess of frizz.  </li>
            <li> gives you a false sense of clean.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Wen kits twice before and returned them, feeling guilty about the cost since I am on a limited budget, and also because I did not want to get locked into some sort of recurring mail program that would most likely end up costing lots of money.</li>
            <li> This seemed like alot to trouble especially if you have limited time for getting ready for work etc.</li>
            <li> My down my back medium length hair is so soft that it will not hold a curl, and nor will it hold an up do without tons of hair spray and lots of hair pins--see photo.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent of it and everything it does to make my hair less frizzy....but wouldn&#x27;t recommend to someone with thin hair.....</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair very soft, but a poufy mess of undefined curls.  </li>
            <li> But other than that as long as you use the amount your supposed to &amp; rinse it out completely, it works</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to try this product, it looked promising.</li>
            <li> But then, it started getting really greasy and it made my hair go limp and stringy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;In closing, thank you WEN for ripping me off, producing a horrible product, and most importantly, providing me with such crappy service!</li>
            <li> used the product for two months and my hair color changed from a soft dark brown to a brassy auburn, so I thought.  </li>
            <li> it is damage by the flat irions blowdryin ext.</li>
            <li> I USED THE FLAT IRON AFTERWARDS</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the effects could last so long, but they have.</li>
            <li> These products last a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair was flat and not manageable.  </li>
            <li> so my supply actually lasts, but this won&#x27;t be the case for people with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hair is not &#x27;moist enough&#x27;, too long (45 mins)</li>
            <li> For long hair it will last two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have long (shoulder length), coarse, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I thought for this price it had to be good, but Im disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> The wen looks very promising but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations, its weighing my hair down, it looks not clean</li>
            <li> Of course I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t read the fine print that they planned to charge me $98 dollars per month for the rest of eternity and send more of their horrible product.</li>
            <li> So after I washed with this it was so soft and shinny, not weigh down or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Nearly 60 days have gone by, numerous customer service reps have been called, and I am still due a credit from one of the shipments!!</li>
            <li> , I have very long hair and use this product on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I told her, coarse, dry, a bit damaged.  </li>
            <li> It left the hair at my scalp so greasy that when i would comb through it you could see the comb tracks ( my hair was DRY when doing this).</li>
            <li> I used to break combs, sad to say, the density alone was too much for a comb and too much for me.</li>
            <li> My 2nd use of WEN it was not as dry.  </li>
            <li> If I neeed extra mositure and/or volume or for weekend when I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> next morning my scalp was oily but not more than normal.  </li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, my hair had natural curl back.</li>
            <li> But when I did finally get it, the bottles were a lot smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see the charge show up within the next few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen hair care since early 2012 as I have thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally be able to try WEN and ended up being very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> 50 bucks, on a product they apparently shipped out, without me truly authorizing it, to now a balance due of $130 without even having products on hand?  </li>
            <li> I dried my hair and WOW!  </li>
            <li> Not quite as miraculous as they make it sound on TV, but it does noticeably improve the quality and softness of your hair without the harsh chemical drying or the heavy residue that weighs your hair down.  </li>
            <li> pricing is pretty ridiculous</li>
            <li> tried the other items that come in the kit once--the deep conditioner I left on overnight and that stick.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, I decided to give Wen a try, possibly because the product was so different than any other shampoo with</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product through Amazon due to I only wanted to try it without the automatic order fulfillment Wen currently does with their customers.</li>
            <li> I ONLY WASH MY HAIR EVERY OTHER DAY, THE MONTH SUPPLY ONLY LASTED ME</li>
            <li> and she told me that she had several other clients that started using Wen and ended up with the same result.  </li>
            <li> applied a dime-sized amount of styling creme, combed out my hair easily--important to me due to my sensitive scalp, and combing out wet hair is always something I dread--and started drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many other customers, my hair began to hold greasy build-up and the smell of my scalp became unpleasant from my natural oiliness</li>
            <li> It did make my hair a little soft</li>
            <li> I did rinse completely, used as little as I could to get it on all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I USE A FLAT IRON EVERY WEEK, AND OCCASIONALY BLOW DRY</li>
            <li> It is very drying, and leaves your hair EXTREMELY DULL and Feeling</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to tell how much you are using with the delivery system</li>
            <li> I liked the idea and have been using other less expensive products (that don&#x27;t put me on their auto ship list) successfully.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wen hair care system really works, at least on my hair.</li>
            <li> but this, and sorry to sound cliche but it has changed a lot.</li>
            <li> I have long hair also</li>
            <li> This stuff is far too heavy and greasy and in addition the company KEPT charging my card for months after I cancelled it.</li>
            <li> I spent $100 on Wen Hair Care products with the peace of mind that if I didn&#x27;t like it I could return it and get my money back.</li>
            <li> that came with this bundle because I still use them and they go a long way.</li>
            <li> For 2 consecutive days I used this product package and followed the instructions, but after my hair dried each time it was completely parched and frizzy.</li>
            <li> If I did that, I don&#x27;t know how long it would&#x27;ve took to rinse it out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair that has frizz.  </li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this hydrated in a long time but its come at a cost.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 2 weeks because thats how long the 16oz bottle lasted because I have a head of hair that is about for 3-4 people.  </li>
            <li> I  have really long hair</li>
            <li> I had a long weekend and tried it.</li>
            <li> Because I am not a fan of wet hair on me in the shower, (it actually grosses me out)</li>
            <li> My routine takes about 3-5 minutes, and that&#x27;s how long it stayed on my hair.</li>
            <li> The back says to use 10-15 pumps, but if you use that much on short hair its a total waste of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I have long hair to my shoulders and its makes me hair greasy looking.</li>
            <li> My wife has curly long hair.  </li>
            <li> (otherwise, with my \\&quot;too soft\\&quot; hair -it tends to be limp - and not as \\&quot;curly\\&quot;  nor wild -</li>
            <li> and if you have long hair it will break the bank.</li>
            <li> and i used to use this a long time ago...</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The grey has stopped being unmanageable and the color lasts.  </li>
            <li> I have spent alot of money sending them back.  </li>
            <li> Who knows how long it will take to recover.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a long trial - almost 4 months.  </li>
            <li> I add a bit to my hair after I use a pump of the cleansing conditioner and my hair was staying soft and fluffy and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> This product took quite a long time to arrive.  </li>
            <li> and she likes just about everything she tries and stopped using it shortly after.</li>
            <li> when i ordered it on amazon the description of the size was not clear.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and very curly.</li>
            <li> down side it that you use so much product that I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, and at $38.00 a pop</li>
            <li> I had shiny, managable hair, and it was soft, if a little dry (this even after using the hydrating mask overnight)</li>
            <li> They want you to use so much product but give you so little products they want to use 12 pumps for one time and when you do that you&#x27;ve used half the bottle</li>
            <li> so the bottle did not last very long at all for the amount of money that I spent.</li>
            <li> , I used half the pumps it called for, rinsed it really well and put my hair in a towel for about an hour then dried it with blow dryer.</li>
            <li> From Long, and sort of dry &amp; stiff looking to Long, and lustrous (and not heavy).  </li>
            <li> I wake up looking like a LION every morning now and have to re-cleanse daily (instead of every other like my long hair</li>
            <li> The price as I said before you use half the bottle on one use so you&#x27;ve paid 30 to 40 dollars on a product that you really can only use a couple of time I guess for the celebrity spokesmodel this is not a problem but for the everyday normal customer this is ridiculous</li>
            <li> and i only will use when i run out of my other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for my curly hair and this is the worse one yet!!</li>
            <li> Once I received the product and read the packaging I learned that there is a host of other chemicals such as endochrine-disruptors that are harmful to our bodies.</li>
            <li> It is different from other products you would buy from the store.</li>
            <li> so the next day I decided to see what happened if I just put the product in my hair, combed it through, went on with my other shower routine, and then rinsed it off when I was finished.</li>
            <li> So of course, I was excited to buy it, because I know the product line is expensive.</li>
            <li> you order Wen, there are two boxes you can check to opt out of receiving additional mailings of the product, and the other allows them to release your info to third parties.  </li>
            <li> The cheaper product is made by Guthy-Renker and is offered for the SAME price has the other version.  </li>
            <li> I have also used many different shampoo and conditioner combinations, and always end up with dry ends and my hair looking awful toward the end of the first day I shower.  </li>
            <li> I use 2 pumps - one for each side of my hair split down the middle - rub in all over then wet enough to get a creamy texture</li>
            <li> I have very long curly hair</li>
            <li> They claim you can just let it air dry</li>
            <li> However, I did notice my hair was easier to dry andhad</li>
            <li> It looks and feels dry.  </li>
            <li> if I let it air dry...</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry and nothing seemed to help.  </li>
            <li> I can blow dry it without all the frizzy dryness I got with shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair felt either greasy or dry.  </li>
            <li> Well my hair ended up looking greasy at the roots and the rest of the 3/4 of my hair looked dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a lot softer and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be as dry as it was before but lets continue to wait and see.</li>
            <li> I have wavy dry hair / frizzy and this product was supposed eliminate all my issues.  </li>
            <li> It dose reduce my hair fuzzy, and dry end.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had dry scalp issues.  </li>
            <li> and I have not had any dry scalp issues.  </li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my dry hair..</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry that it was uncontrollable.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and fly-away from years of coloring.</li>
            <li> After a hair color my hair was unusually dry</li>
            <li> I needed something for my scalp it was so dry and flaky and</li>
            <li> My 1st use of WEN:  my hair was still dry.  </li>
            <li> It tends to get frizzy and dry</li>
            <li> When I blow dry and add volumizing spray or mouse</li>
            <li> My hair was immediately dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I start out initially with a few pumps on concentrate solely on getting product into my roots (especially crown), around my hairline and at the nape of my neck.</li>
            <li> A few months later they sent me another package I wrote return to sender and sent it back.</li>
            <li> I am African American with relaxed hair, and after my hair dried, it was sooo tangled.</li>
            <li> I have really thick and coarse hair that is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re not new hair, it&#x27;s hair that&#x27;s still breaking off.  </li>
            <li> and it did not live up to what they advertise it to be.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I can overlook that for hair I don&#x27;t have to wash every single day that feels fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you\\&quot;re looking for a product to remove every single wave, this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> I am an african american woman with type 3c hair, so my hair is very tightly coiled and gets EXTREMELY dry and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> It is not a normal business practice.</li>
            <li> Overall not worth it for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I know because I had to cancel due to not being able to temporarily work, and my being unhappy with the results of the product.</li>
            <li> left the cleansing conditioner on for at least five minutes while I finished my cleansing routine, then thoroughly rinsed it out, using slightly warm water--not cold, not hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, I have wavy, thick long hair, it made my hair greasy and it felt heavy.</li>
            <li> The product itself isn&#x27;t terrible - I simply had way too much of it and wanted to cancel my membership until I needed more.</li>
            <li> , that all being said, bare in mind there are a few things to consider before buying/trying Wen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started to loose hair around my hair line...</li>
            <li> Only then to I move on to working it in to the length down the hair shaft and to the ends.</li>
            <li> I separate my hair into two sections (part down the middle)</li>
            <li> Had I not called when I received it, I wouldn&#x27;t have known until I had a bigger headache down the road.  </li>
            <li> This product works well to weigh it down, but I am noticing that every 3rd or 4th time I wash it, I need to use a clarifying shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It is just kinda pricy to be washing all the extra product down the drain if it is not needed.</li>
            <li> Wash/shave the rest of yourself, then put your hair back down and comb through again, then rinse.  </li>
            <li> I realized the extras the send like the replenishing treatment and mist spray are either watered down shampoo or actual shampoo (the cleansing shampoo</li>
            <li> mine: thick, wavy, long, oily at scalp but dry on ends, not heavily processed -</li>
            <li> I have relaxed african american had, and im very skeptical about using new products in my hair, All ive known is olive oil and natural organic products.</li>
            <li> Unless you want greasy or dry hair - do not order these products!</li>
            <li> The tangles both wet and dry</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s been past 6 weeks, I have been calling to check the process of my refund, and finally, they said I cannot get my money back becasue</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same product but for $12.00 (less if you get the Sally Card for $5)</li>
            <li> and I have about half left.  </li>
            <li> the Black person on the infomercial is mixed heritage and does not have traditional Black hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not for traditional Black hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen from other customer reviews on the web that this same thing has happened to other people.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that I bought a one month supply and used it in less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The few products I have bought from TV in the past turned out to be absolute duds.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about ordering it, but now that I have; regular shampoo will never touch my hair again!!  </li>
            <li> Its a bit different than using typical shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t lather and sud up.</li>
            <li> I continued to use it for about a week and a half and still had the same results.</li>
            <li> The proof is in the post pictures, that I am not bold enough to share online, and</li>
            <li> When I tried it, it left my hair really dry feeling &amp; not clean.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the Wen products when ordering,yet quickly became disappointed after using.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course, straight, and dry auburn hair.</li>
            <li> Wen products are all they advertised them to be, my hair is natural curly and has always been dry and hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> However,once I use the shampoo and conditioner my hair still is very dry.</li>
            <li> My head broke out in an itchy rash and my hair was very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, course hair.  </li>
            <li> When I opened my second bottle I put half the product in the empty bottle and mixed in about half a bottle of purified water.</li>
            <li> I have naturally blonde, naturally wavy, VERY thick and VERY long hair.  </li>
            <li> Do not try to put it on quickly and haphazardly like regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Obviously, to get them to blend with the grey they were quit light, using a lot of that nasty peroxide that can really take a toll on your hair.</li>
            <li> and it makes your hair feel greasy and gross not clean.</li>
            <li> I have used Wen and seriously didn&#x27;t have high hopes because I have found so many bad products out there.  </li>
            <li> I have found that I need to use a regular shampoo/conditioner about once a week because my hair feels a little too oily.</li>
            <li> This NOT normal!  </li>
            <li> I usually go every other day Shampooing, but my hair looked greasy later the same day</li>
            <li> The only thing that she doesn&#x27;t care for is that it a minty smell and tingles her scalp a little.</li>
            <li> The top of my hair was greasy and weird, while the rest of my hair was dried out and a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> I added the one in the round flat bottle after i had rinsed my hair and decided to let it dry.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bother me is that when you call to cancel the next shipment so your credit card can&#x27;t be charge the operators seem to give you a hard time and attitude about why you can&#x27;t cancel.</li>
            <li> Those people who are having a hard time with it making their hair feel dirty are using it wrong because this stuff is awesome.  </li>
            <li> The dry feeling was completely lacking this time around, and about the only complaint I could even think of is that my hair was so tame it seemed a little flat</li>
            <li> My wife got a bad perm, she tried many products and nothing was helping.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, my hair was so bad my boyfriend agreed and stopped future payments on his card.</li>
            <li> I was so desperate to get smooth, silky hair, that I kept hoping it would stop, and even rationalized that stress from a job was causing it, and not the product.</li>
            <li> The texture balm really helped keep my hair georgous the entire day (which with my wavy hair is difficult to do).  </li>
            <li> Purchased the product, it came quicker than expected</li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune on hair products that don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> use it for a couple of days, then switch back to an everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am not really going to cut off all my hair</li>
            <li> This product is really not for my hair texture.</li>
            <li> The same thing happened to my mother, who started using it a few days after me</li>
            <li> I was left with this halo-like effect around my head from the short strands of hair left behind from the rest of my hair breaking off.</li>
            <li> Like this one a lot, but still partial to the lavender one.</li>
            <li> Be careful is all I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> and then wet again</li>
            <li> and I felt that my hair was harder to work with.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered this 5 piece set of wen hair care products I expected to receive what was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Its suck that they dont ship to Military addresses though.</li>
            <li> I would really not believe them.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring for years, and like to be careful about what products I use and how often I use them.</li>
            <li> careful before ordering a product..examine the return rules...</li>
            <li> the bottles are microscopic and you may have enough shampoo for one round.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s worth the price because it&#x27;s definitesly expensive</li>
            <li> Well now I have received a shipment I was not ready to pay for.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use until the bottles are empty to determine if this product is for me.</li>
            <li> only work for a few days and then show no difference.  </li>
            <li> Comb it through with wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> That was really not the case.</li>
            <li> so I just used this onefor combing out my hair while it&#x27;s wet after I applied my leave-ins.  </li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I naturally have thick hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling dirty and dry and left it frizzier than normal.  </li>
            <li> At first I was not impressed my hair came out so frizzy, I thought maybe because I didn&#x27;t blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I have hair half way down my back, so I have to use 20ish.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and has a slight wave to it</li>
            <li> I would rather them be dry and on my pillow and clothes rather than sliding down my bottom in the shower.</li>
            <li> The first two times I washed my hair with it, I was obviously doing it wrong because it felt heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> It was heavy and just laid flat.</li>
            <li> : On the Wen website you can see a black woman getting her wet hair straightened with only a hairdryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> do have long thick hair so the 12 oz bottle lasted only about 5 uses</li>
            <li> It works well for a selective few, but for the vast majority it is just money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I do find that the results vary depending on how long I leave it &#x27;soak&#x27; in the shower (too little (3 mins)</li>
            <li> Mask- left my hair feeling extremely dull and dry</li>
            <li> The only negative was that it makes for a very long shower.</li>
            <li> No desire to try any other brand again.</li>
            <li> Since coloring, I&#x27;ve been washing my hair every other day and using the re-moist mask once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like other&#x27;s said, it leaves your hair somewhat brittle</li>
            <li> The other product it comes with....</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy any of this stuff again unless it&#x27;s the conditioner and styling creme, can&#x27;t say anything about the other one I haven&#x27;t used yet</li>
            <li> No lye, no hot comb, and no grease.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I purchased this product online on the WEN website, thinking it was like any other online purchase.</li>
            <li> Does any other company do that?</li>
            <li> I normall shampoo every other day, but with this product I could not skip a day.</li>
            <li> and the effects don&#x27;t fade like with other hair products because this stuff is BOMB.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product does nothing different than an ordinary conditioner and you have to use a ton of it for every application ...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use any other product now.</li>
            <li> As the other reviews for this product state, it does require a lot of product each time you use it, so I don&#x27;t use it every day.  </li>
            <li> No problems with greasiness like other reviews that I have read.  </li>
            <li> Some other products make my hair look thicker, however, I don&#x27;t know if over time they would also make it look dryer.</li>
            <li> other points in regard to other things posted in reviews.</li>
            <li> All the other products that came in my Wen</li>
            <li> my hair is oily on top and frizzy on the bottom. :(</li>
            <li> and I had extreme breaking...</li>
            <li> The other day my youngest was playing with my hair...</li>
            <li> All of the other Wen hair styling products reminded me of the time I forgot to rinse the conditioner out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One other \\&quot;complaint\\&quot;:  the pump for the conditioning rinse bottle doesn&#x27;t close, so</li>
            <li> The rude man was slurring and speaking super-fast, I could barely understand him.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the starter pack for $29.95 which only came with a small bottle of the cleansing conditioner and a bunch of other products.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other products in my hair.</li>
            <li> After I got the sample I wanted to try the other products but didn&#x27;t want the autoship.</li>
            <li> Can anyone give me any feedback on the other fragrances?</li>
            <li> Wash every other day.</li>
            <li> due of $130 without even having products on hand?  </li>
            <li> Third use: Oil slick, even when i rinsed for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I think Wen is like any other informercial product.</li>
            <li> How anyone can buy a hair care product whose name means \\&quot;a boil or other swelling or growth on the skin, esp.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other shampoo, and buy this by the gallon.</li>
            <li> unruly.&lt;br /&gt;it is heavy, weighs my hair down flat and over conditions it.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little dry</li>
            <li> My fingers could glide through my wet hair with ease, but as I looked down, my hair was coming out in chunks.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> So its oily at the roots have to wash everyday and dry</li>
            <li> During winters, my scalp gets dry while my hair still gets oily (oiliness buildup happens year round).</li>
            <li> I was left with heavy, limp hair with zero volume.</li>
            <li> This is a weird, no lather type shampoo, and it is odd to use for the first week.</li>
            <li> I have permed hair that is fine and frizzes bad with humid weather.</li>
            <li> I have a bi-racial wavy texture (asian/black) and thought that this would tame my dry hair</li>
            <li> how long will it be for me to receive my money back or get another set...at least an estimate?!?</li>
            <li> I re-ordered the Wen products when I found that the Wen shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment left my hair feeling softer, not as coarse and not as dry as the expensive salon products.  </li>
            <li> I use a different shampoo on my scalp though because it can make your hair look greasy if you have hard water.</li>
            <li> My hair is bleached the to max as I am naturally dark.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, abt 5 inches past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> This is a common problem for any chemically treated blonde</li>
            <li> After using it for a month I have decided that it is not worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint though is that i dont see a difference in smoothness.</li>
            <li> and I was definitely skeptical and wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> If only I could give this product negative stars....</li>
            <li> WELL about a week later, my account was debited about 39$. when i called to complain they said i called too late and the shipment was already in process.</li>
            <li> All in all, definitely NOT worth my money.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about the retailer that I purchased this from was that they had this listed as a ONE time purchase which was why I used this site to purchase</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again to much work and expensive.</li>
            <li> It is not worth it.</li>
            <li> but given my past experience when I did not use shine/sealants, I was not surprised.</li>
            <li> Having long hair past her shoulders also requires quite a bit a product.</li>
            <li> At that time, I decided that my hair is not worth risking and decided not to order it.</li>
            <li> Its not worth 40bucks to 100 dollars a month.</li>
            <li> The cleansing conditioner is satisfactory but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Its no secret that this is an expensive shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a lot of moisture, which my hair needs because it&#x27;s so thick and curly.</li>
            <li> This happened slowly over the next 5 months.</li>
            <li> She loves the fact I have no issues with split ends or &amp;#34;dead ends&amp;#34; and she only thins out my hair as its quite thick, and I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I WILL USE THIS PRODUCT WHEN MY HAIR BECOMES EXTREMELY DRY AGAIN, BUT WILL STICK WITH MY REGULAR SHAMPOO IN THE MEAN TIME BECAUSE IT CANT AFFORD TO BUY 4 BOTTLES A MONTH!</li>
            <li> The infomercial states that every supply is by month or two months, etc, but I have talked to a few girls with very long hair who have used it, and they say that their \\&quot;monthly\\&quot; supply was gone in just a few uses.</li>
            <li> But if you have crazy curly dry hair...not so much.</li>
            <li> I wrote down the deadline date in case</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s a down side to this product.</li>
            <li> I use a purple shampoo and conditioner to tone it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a bit frizzy but it toned it down a notch or two.</li>
            <li> It dosn&#x27;t wiegh my hair down</li>
            <li> my hair lost it&#x27;s bounce - felt weighed down and greasy - it literally started sticking to face.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always looking for products that will give me frizz control without weighing my hair down or making it crunchy.  </li>
            <li> and it seemed to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Well, it made my hair weighed down and still frizzed.</li>
            <li> I could literally run my fingers down a lock of hair and feel a layer of oil between my fingers.</li>
            <li> It weighed my hair down and made it look greasy just after a day.</li>
            <li> After using WEN my hair was weighed down at the roots but still tangled with frizz on the ends.</li>
            <li> I do like the other products that come with the shampoo too!</li>
            <li> I cant wiat to try the other ones!</li>
            <li> ALSO-I was just reading some of the other reviews and someone mentioned scalp break outs!  </li>
            <li> Shampoos like Suave or Dove dry out my hair to the point where it looks like straw, and leave in conditioners make my hair look like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> I can not stress enough to stay away from this company and their products, it is expensive and not worth the postage to send it back!</li>
            <li> I have talked to a few other people that have used it, and just like all shampoos; it works for some and not others.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price for how little you get in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, and never really had a problem with dandruff, but about day 3 post shampoo, dandruff flakes were falling off my head like an avalanche!</li>
            <li> An extra $20 is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> but not super curly</li>
            <li> much less frizz than I was used to.  </li>
            <li> never the less...</li>
            <li> If I flip my hair it is typically in tangles, but with WEN it&#x27;s like I have someone else hair on my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done trying now after going through another bottle in half the recommended time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m forced to waste my time and theirs asking a million questions that could be answered if they took the 10 minutes to put the script on the website next to a picture of the product.</li>
            <li> I can tell that it has made my hair stronger and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It took almost a month and a half before I could get the product.</li>
            <li> I use less than the recommended amount</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thoroughly convinced that they&#x27;re here to scam people and take their money and could care less about anything else.</li>
            <li> I thought it was odd that when i called they talked and talked and just wouldn&#x27;t shut up.  </li>
            <li> My hair is softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I used half the number of the diluted stuff on my hair, washed it out when I was finished</li>
            <li> In fact, some time back a very evil ex friend of mine had over 80 as-seen-on-tv items sent to my address, many coming from GR.</li>
            <li> That is how the price is manageable for me; I tend to use less than two diluted bottles a month and get shipments every 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Styling cream&#x3D; (smells like motor oil), it does work fine on hair</li>
            <li> defanitly have body and less friz.</li>
            <li> , I know they&#x27;re lying to me like they lied to me the previous three times</li>
            <li> /&gt;They also sell another product which is you are supposed to use less of</li>
            <li> It makes hair a greasy mess, even when you follow all of the directions to the T.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that my hair is not a tangled mess since the cleanser is a conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> BUT THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT I HAVE LONG THICK HAIR AND</li>
            <li> Dry, not shiny, lifeless, dull.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry, brittle, hard.  </li>
            <li> When I called to voice a complaint regarding this poor corporate practice, I was rudely spoken to by a supervisor named Rachel who was condescending, sarcastic, and unhelpful.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THEIR PRODUCT UNLESS YOU&#x27;RE WILLING TO WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!</li>
            <li> and when I got a little older my thyroid straightened the crap out of my natural curl.</li>
            <li> NOT worth it, too stiff on hair</li>
            <li> My hair is waive and a lot,  thick and  very long ( to my butt in layers ) and it didn&#x27;t work for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I have very long semi thick wavy/frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Could this 613 be the missing link in the Wen line of products that I so desperately needed the first time I tried Wen?</li>
            <li> This product does not clean hair.  </li>
            <li> Slowly my hair started getting really dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Then it started to weigh my hair down, then dried out my scalp, then dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> As my hair is a little longer than shoulder length I haven&#x27;t used the texture stick.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE OVER A WEEK USING THE RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I do have to say that it did take a little trial and error.  </li>
            <li> Please do not make any purchase from Chaz Dean and save yourself time by doing a little google search \\&quot;Chaz Dean scam\\&quot; before you want to make any order with them.</li>
            <li> but when I do wash it, my hair looks like it did when I was little.</li>
            <li> it is not worth it!  </li>
            <li> I had so little product.</li>
            <li> still after it dried I was a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I had all kinds of little sores on my scalp that I have never had before.  </li>
            <li> I probably do leave it on a little longer than directed.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s the little things.)  </li>
            <li> The product was terrible and made my hair even more dry and brittle after two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, blonde hair and found the almond products too heavy, weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> It may seem a little pricey if you get it from Sephora or the likes, but you will soon find that you do not need to use it everyday</li>
            <li> I followed rules to the T and my hair seems a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> so be careful!!!)  </li>
            <li> I bought this product becuase my colored and naturally wavy hair was starting to look really bad.  </li>
            <li> my scalp felt a bit dirty even after a very thorough wash.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking dirty, scraggly, and gross.</li>
            <li> i tried my mom&#x27;s Wen Shampoo its stinks really badk.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle and my experience was that my hair was dirty by the end of the day and the texture was different too.  </li>
            <li> , I was very skeptical at first because #1</li>
            <li> (as if I hadn&#x27;t washed it in a few days).</li>
            <li> and I wasted the money</li>
            <li> can\\&quot; is a scam in my humble opinion.  </li>
            <li> I dare any women to try it and not instantly become addicted to washing your hair.  </li>
            <li> it says then it will leave your hair looking &amp; feeling greasy &amp; heavy.</li>
            <li> On my bottle (Green Apple scent), it states that it&#x27;s ph balanced for everyday use even on colored or permed hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on these products.....</li>
            <li> It may take a few months of continued use to get your hair into shape.</li>
            <li> I do not use a curling iron, but a metal round brush as Chaz does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always had baby thin hair, shed like a dog and anyone could tell what the humidity outside is by looking at my hair.  </li>
            <li> I will tell you a few things.</li>
            <li> and my hair and scalp dried up.</li>
            <li> Wen haircare made my hair limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using it I started noticing dandruff.</li>
            <li> Though after using it a week i realized that it was just way too heavy for my hair type</li>
            <li> I have nothing to say except, don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> heavy greasy feel or look.</li>
            <li> I use WEN products everyday on my hair</li>
            <li> It is mega heavy and with my slim hands that just does not work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been crying everyday for weeks.</li>
            <li> I used it to cleanse my hair, and after a few times I noticed that my hair felt heavier.  </li>
            <li> I have to shampoo everyday.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention, aside from the knots, it completely dried up my hair...</li>
            <li> Worse than if I had just used regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I received this kit a few days ago and used it today.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I dried my hair sleek and shiny and manageable (no poofiness).</li>
            <li> Please save yourself from all the trouble this Chaz Dean company will do to you.</li>
            <li> this is a waste of money and a fraud.</li>
            <li> and you could tell the difference it made before she even cut off the three inches of dead hair at the end.</li>
            <li> However it did have lightness and movement, and lacked the heavy sticky feeling alot of the olive-oil based conditioners can leave.</li>
            <li> I rinse for a few minutes until I feel like combing my fingers through my hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about the product since I have long wavy hair which at times can be difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> First off, let me tell you that I am a person who is very skeptical about infomercial items.</li>
            <li> Even salon shampoos like the Paul Mitchell line make my hair look limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> a few things to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> I called them, had to answer a few question to a computerized voice and that was it.</li>
            <li> Wen made my hair dense and heavy.  </li>
            <li> However, after a few uses, my head began to itch</li>
            <li> I started using this product about three weeks ago everyday</li>
            <li> and it was so heavy that I couldn&#x27;t even style it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money like I did, don&#x27;t bother with this product or this company.</li>
            <li> but i tried again and again my hair seems heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> A few days into the product, my hair did get softer but I never got it to look like the infomercial models, you&#x27;d need extensions and a pro stylist to get your hair rocking like that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the balm as well because it is really heavy.</li>
            <li> Do not smooth it all over your hair if you want to keep your volume bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> JUST PLEASE, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will probably use the conditioner every few shampoos rather than every time I shower</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t get taken advantage of but that happens everyday.</li>
            <li> However, I had to pay the $10.40/per box shipping charges and waste my gas to travel to and from the post office to return the mailings I didn&#x27;t order.  </li>
            <li> and i have to wash it everyday because my hair is oily</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really a heavy duty conditioner, not a cleanser.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time.</li>
            <li> I mean I never really registered on the website.</li>
            <li> I have learned that the intensive repair should be used in small amounts and no more that every other week or hair will feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying the texture balm everyday to tame the frizz</li>
            <li> I actually hate it my hair and my head don&#x27;t feel clean</li>
            <li> me, if that was on the order page, it was not easy to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is common sense, that the average consumer, once a product is ordered, they glance at their statement.  </li>
            <li> shipment\\&quot; didnt even arrive for another few weeks, way past my 30 day trial.</li>
            <li> Unless you want to be forced to pay for hundreds of dollars of product that you don&#x27;t even want, and thats definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overpriced, not very effective and a nightmare to deal with the company.</li>
            <li> The woman said,  &#x27;oh, your credit card information is missing and your package was just sent with a bill in it, but ill cancel for future&#x27;.</li>
            <li> /heavy/greasier when I use very little product.  </li>
            <li> guess it wouldn&#x27;t be that bad if you never use styling products in your hair so there isn&#x27;t much to wash out.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always really tangled, but it wasn&#x27;t NEARLY as bad</li>
            <li> My friend gave me a small tub of cucumber and the smell</li>
            <li> Not sure what that means but wanted to let people know.  </li>
            <li> Usually leave it on 10 minutes per wash.  </li>
            <li> In the past every time I would go to brush my hair</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the alchohol)</li>
            <li> My credit card company has even been involved for the past three months in trying to keep them from charging me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s past the 60 day return.  </li>
            <li> Although my hair was softer it was not more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how I feel about the product...</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would order this again</li>
            <li> (just past my shoulder blades.)</li>
            <li> but it was no better.</li>
            <li> and then I receive another \\&quot;past due\\&quot; notice.</li>
            <li> Usually I wash my hair twice and then condition it, so to have one step</li>
            <li> My head is small</li>
            <li> The worst part is I purchased it off the WEN website and made sure to not check off the box for \\&quot;auto order\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It is no better than any hair product that you can buy off the shelves in your drugstore or supermarket, only this one is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> just want to return it because they are so not confident about their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And believe me it is not cheap!  </li>
            <li> On top of that the product is horrible.</li>
            <li> I started using Wen this past Monday.</li>
            <li> They were all anxious to see how it worked.  </li>
            <li> They do offer a customized order that I have found to be expensive since you pay for all products you want individually.</li>
            <li> She thinks I have biotic hair, which was never the case in the past.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a 5 star, but its troubling to me that the instructions are so complicated and the recommended amounts such overkill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a pessimist.</li>
            <li> So needless to say; I&#x27;m not a big TV shopper, or a believer of infomercial items.</li>
            <li> Rinsed that out, used a dime-sized amount of the styling creme, and blow-dried my hair as usual.</li>
            <li> sometimes when you get a trial or small kit</li>
            <li> No more shampoo and conditioner just a one step cleanse.</li>
            <li> My hair did not feelflat, greasy, limp, or any negative.</li>
            <li> usually lose a bit of hair with each wash, and I still lost some hair this time.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  </li>
            <li> Usually there is something in the package like a reciept or business card with contact info.  </li>
            <li> When they tried to claim that one never showed up, I knew it was pointless.</li>
            <li> As usual, I did my research and read the reviews.</li>
            <li> NEVER ok&#x27;d</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUY WEN FROM WEN or risk getting auto-enrolled in a plan you never ok&#x27;d and getting a surprise bill in the coming months.</li>
            <li> then these small bottles...</li>
            <li> not sure what that was about</li>
            <li> 3 months past</li>
            <li> But I just can&#x27;t get past how greasy Wen makes my hair.</li>
            <li> Wen was expensive, and the amount that is required to put in long thick hair is a half a bottle per time.</li>
            <li> the color flakes sold by other manufactures and my poor bald scalp is no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> I bought this expensive product to see if it really made a difference, especially with prolonging my hair color, but was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t the worst part, I have not been using it for 5 months now and my hair has just started to really get its life back.</li>
            <li> I like to shower ever two days, and hate that my hair starts feeling gross with regular shampoo/conditioner so soon.  </li>
            <li> My hair is down to my waist, is very hard to deal with</li>
            <li> The product is not very good; I used it for a while and thought it was</li>
            <li> IT is a mess and definitely not worth the hassle!!!!</li>
            <li> After working in the garden, sweating in the 90 + degree heat, not having the lather effect while washing her hair is hard to get past.</li>
            <li> I was sick and in the hospital for over a week my hair became very dried out and was breaking off and brittle, I thought I would try this product to see if it would help, after trying several other products.</li>
            <li> It felt dirty within a few hours and it was very flat.</li>
            <li> I have what they call \\&quot;course\\&quot; hair...really dry and difficult.</li>
            <li> I have hard water (no water softener unit in home)</li>
            <li> Hard to imagine whose hair this works with.</li>
            <li> hard to explain.</li>
            <li> The product bottle is hard to use, the pump didn&#x27;t always work, and it was slippery to use.</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to \\&quot;no suds\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way...</li>
            <li> hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> This product has not helped with the frizz, maybe even made it a little worse.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but was extremely disappointed by this product</li>
            <li> I even developed bad dandruff which i have never suffered from before.</li>
            <li> only disappointment was that it took forever to get to me</li>
            <li> and it left my hair dirty.</li>
            <li> some negative reviews I read, and #3 my mom</li>
            <li> Did you read those negative reviews about Wen leaving their hair greasy?</li>
            <li> but I was in desperate need for something that would bring my hair back to life.</li>
            <li> The next day I used the styling cream and it definately helped with my crazy hair.  </li>
            <li> I did decide to return it so that I wouldn&#x27;t be late.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced and left my hair looking dirty.</li>
            <li> I have never had one complaint with the customer service.</li>
            <li> I know they say they have a guarantee, but I thought I would just eat my loses.  </li>
            <li> least once</li>
            <li> I was rude and abrut when I called they&#x27;re operators.  </li>
            <li> but if they aren&#x27;t going to refund my money or at least contact me</li>
            <li> see a lot of suggestions for Sally&#x27;s \\&quot;Hair One\\&quot;, but it is not nearly as nice as Wen.  </li>
            <li> Wen is what we had in common.  </li>
            <li> But for those blessed with crazy curls, I definitely recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> This was confusing for me but the seller contacted me via email and explained it.  </li>
            <li> WEN customer service is rude and unhelpful when you call.  </li>
            <li> The product absolutely sucks.  </li>
            <li> The cleansing conditioner has left my hair feeling dirty - don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I have read some of these reviewes, especial all the negative ones.</li>
            <li> BUT after only a day, my hair would look dirty and oily.</li>
            <li> After only a day, my scalp would get a bit itchy and my hair looked and felt dirty once again.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions which left my hair feeling dirty.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t rinse enough, your hair will feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I would give this product at least month before I&#x27;d give up on it.</li>
            <li> I know that everyone loses approx.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF SUCKS.</li>
            <li> It was late at night</li>
            <li> I contacted WEN and boy what a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is not customer service in the least.  </li>
            <li> and they were rude.</li>
            <li> NEGATIVE EFFECT ON HAIR AND MOOD.</li>
            <li> On a scale of 1:5, I rate it a NEGATIVE 10.</li>
            <li> I figured, well at least she cancelled it for me,</li>
            <li> If I could do a negative rating I would.</li>
            <li> I thought I would like at least one of the products</li>
            <li> It made my hair terribly oily at the roots and dry dry dry from midshaft to the ends.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve rated the Wen kit 4 stars, while I really like the Conditioner, the re-moist mask and the included comb, Wen&#x27;s texture balm is worthless for me as is the styling</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and thought this might be the answer.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, course, Afro hair.</li>
            <li> The website does NOT list all of their products and I&#x27;m forced to call and have someone read off a list of products.</li>
            <li> My hair looked greasy as soon as it dried and worse yet, it was frizzy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> I will admit that the conditioner was a bit thick but nothing that would turn me off.</li>
            <li> I ordered it thinking it would solve my hair issues being that I have thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Shook it up for a while and it regained a thick texture.</li>
            <li> She started slowly and every time she was finished she stood stunned at how sturdy my hair was.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick any fuzzy</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS TOO THICK</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> the product is so thick that when i rubbed it through my hair</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy about the results of my order.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but being as I was so desperate for a product that would make my hair look halfway decent; I went ahead and took the risk...</li>
            <li> I mean Alysia Milano wouldnt lie to me,</li>
            <li> AND THEN THE MASK INTENSIVE TREATMENT WAS UNBELIEVABLE !</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that about any other expensive volumizing shampoo or product I&#x27;ve tried before</li>
            <li> I was running out before they sent a new supply and too expensive!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this system and after the first time I tried it, I gave it to my sister who also hated it</li>
            <li> I received my kit for Christmas and was very anxious to use it.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that while my hair is softer and it saves one step in the shower, my hair holds curl even less than it did before.  </li>
            <li> I then paid the ridiculous price for this hair care system and it feels as if it keeps drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> I might also try Hair One bc its less expensive.</li>
            <li> After my scalp became ridiculously itchy</li>
            <li> After some serious conditioning work.</li>
            <li> In addition -- my husband suffers from a dry scalp, and he likes how Wen has relieved the itching &amp; tightness</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s being serious</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The change in my hair was subtle but they may be because.</li>
            <li> This is like the worst supermarket shampoo without conditioner, had trouble with tangling which never, ever occurs with the real one.  </li>
            <li> And like I said, after a several washes with wen, I would have to use a regular shampoo to remove the coating that that felt disgusting on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, far too expensive for what it is!!</li>
            <li> I was bring my lawsuit forward, and had a bad review written by a reporter friend; than they gave me back some of my money.</li>
            <li> Now if it wasn&#x27;t bad enough that i had to spend an hour doing a run around with Clueless customer service because they couldn&#x27;t find my account (even though they had billed my credit card?!?)</li>
            <li> So I personally cannot agree with the bad reviews about the company.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money, way too expensive.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a fair comparison to the \\&quot;before\\</li>
            <li> Big painful zit&#x27;s ;(&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> This was not good considering</li>
            <li> I opted not to bring mine with me, because I didn&#x27;t want it to accidentally pump out in my suitcase in the belly of the plane, and waste that expensive product.</li>
            <li> The customer service is appalling.</li>
            <li> and then my hair being hard to manage all day and looking like crap sold me back onto Wen.  </li>
            <li> Usually by this time my hair is in a state of matted frizziness and im usually dreading having to wash it and desperately trying to revive it.</li>
            <li> After the first use I realized it was crap!  </li>
            <li> If I could give it negative stars I would have!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Texture balm- use very little!!</li>
            <li> but I was not very impressed.</li>
            <li> When I called to complain, the customer service person was very rude, stating, \\&quot;Well,</li>
            <li> I called and asked why I should pay and the very rude woman told me eben though the product was returned</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy/curly Caucasian hair, so I was hoping that Wen would be the answer to my frizz issues.  </li>
            <li> product itself made my hair look very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> i can see it working if your hair is severly damaged and VERY thick and</li>
            <li> I was noticing lots of split ends and my hair felt horrible and the color faded really fast.</li>
            <li> It can be frustrating if it&#x27;s not working for you; but it may be because you&#x27;re not using it correctly.  </li>
            <li> Absolute worst customer service.</li>
            <li> the worse it looked.  </li>
            <li> I immediately called to cancel and now have to spend my money to ship the crap back.  </li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t be mislead, if you have thin hair you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> hairdressers are worse than bills.  </li>
            <li> So I guess you can say I am a bit disappointed with the long use effect of the products.  </li>
            <li> They took my information and enrolled me for a &#x27;continuous membership&#x27; behind my back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the customer service support team .  </li>
            <li> , even worse customer service, it&#x27;s basically a scam.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I still deal with how thin my hair got from using this product and</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, frizzy and I die it a lot.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERYDRY THIN HAIR FRIZZY</li>
            <li> Not happy with results</li>
            <li> I was miserable for several days with the itching until I massaged plain yogurt into my scalp on my husband&#x27;s suggestion and got relief.  </li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> PATHETIC AND DISGUSTING, THE ONLY THING WORTH</li>
            <li> All the other products come in the almond scent which I don&#x27;t like.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is horrible, left my hair looking weighed down and dirty looking.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money, my hair never looked so ugly as it did after using Wen.</li>
            <li> I received erroneous information from an associate at the Wen organization and have found myself obligated to pay approximately $100 for what they call a three month supply.</li>
            <li> the costumer service lady got so mad because I didn&#x27;t agree with her plan and she was rude and hung up the phone.</li>
            <li> Down side: it&#x27;s expensive!!</li>
            <li> I have long frizzy thin curly hair; I&#x27;ve tried a million products saw WEN on TV, gave WEN product a try and did NOT work for me very disappointed!</li>
            <li> It worked the same as my suave almond and shea butter n was alot cheaper very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hated how my hair looked every single time!  </li>
            <li> While watching the infomercials on tv, I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive but as with everything, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The comb is useless.</li>
            <li> Thought about trying the tea tree, but hate to waste my money again.  </li>
            <li> so now I have a bunch of expensive products I don&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You watch info commercials and are skeptical, but I am so amazed with WEN.  </li>
            <li> I was unfortunately hoping for a miracle for my flyaway hair and</li>
            <li> I would buy expensive protein conditioners, but nothing was helping.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really difficult to cancel.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, the intensive hair treatment left a nasty film on my hair</li>
            <li> AND UNFORTUNATELY I HAD TO FIGHT WITH ALL THE REDNESS AND ITCHINESS WHERE THE PRODUCT TOUCHED MY SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sorry wen</li>
            <li> My mom randomly sent me this</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and still my hair looked lousy.  </li>
            <li> It is also difficult to rinse out.</li>
            <li> It is so complicated to use</li>
            <li> -sorry</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong-</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was also one of the unfortunate ones that got sucked into an infomercial haze ...</li>
            <li> I looked and sad...</li>
            <li> They told me sorry for the confusion</li>
            <li> I politely declined his offer and insisted on cancelling.&lt;br /&gt;However, my next shipment still arrived and now I have two boxes of this horrible product that I didn&#x27;t want.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and was not impressed by the way it worked in my hair.</li>
            <li> wanted to try the product, very hopeful that it might work, but it&#x27;s the scamming nature of the company that has outraged me - and it is doubtful that I am going to get my money</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will just continue to buy hair one.</li>
            <li> and then ill just order from qvc or amazon (both who i trust).</li>
            <li> &#x27;oh, so sorry, its cancelled now, we&#x27;ll send a return label, so sorry.&#x27;.....</li>
            <li> Im tired of it!  </li>
            <li> the only thing worst than the nut on tv and the people who are paid to lie for them are the nuts who buy their product.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical about buying products seen on infovisions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Costumer service is terrible keep sending me stuff and charge me before I did actually arrive, after cancel the subscription I still had a charge that had to dispute with my credit card.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for it, you&#x27;ll be sorry if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Moral of the story - Useless product</li>
            <li> The actual product&#x27;s texture is awful</li>
            <li> My hair was not impressed with this product at all.  </li>
            <li> I went from having to put on pounds of useless product, to washing my hair, brushing it, and walking out the door.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s really hard to find a product that works well with my crazy hair!  </li>
            <li> I had no body and my hair looked dull :(  </li>
            <li> BAD product, Worse customer service!!!&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I have thin ugly hair.</li>
            <li> I was sick and tired of my hair and all</li>
            <li> The other products are terrible!</li>
            <li> A little irritated I told them to go ahead and cancel because I was threw with the horrible customer service.</li>

            <li> This product does not do what the infomercial said but I am so desperate to find a product that will work -- I tried it.  </li>
            <li> Soo basically it came when I had already given up hope and was about to get on dirty with the company to return my money.</li>
            <li> Frizzle would&#x27;ve been envious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUCH a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to get some moisture into it.</li>
            <li> Cold showers.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, be prepared for some chilly mornings.  </li>

            <li> This product made my hair look like it was dirty,</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel dirty</li>
            <li> , my hair looked dirty within 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> It also started to make my hair smell dirty as if I had just worked out and not showered.  </li>
            <li> It seems crazy.</li>
            <li> leaves roots feeling dirty and weighed-down.</li>
            <li> Disappointing-</li>
            <li> I was so mad</li>
            <li> Sorry Wen!</li>
            <li> WTF?!</li>
            <li> And I WOULD reffer my clients to this prodcut if it weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> so mad</li>
            <li> was wrong!  </li>
            <li> Seriously I find ways to dirty my hair just to wash it!!  </li>
            <li> Instead of helping me, the man on the phone made me feel stupid and was trying to convince me that I was using the product wrong...</li>
            <li> My two biggest complaints with this product are: it is very expensive and you can&#x27;t buy it in stores.  </li>
            <li> It is very expensive and after a period of time</li>
            <li> I also use some very expensive salon products.  </li>
            <li> I bought for my daughter who is very skeptical of anything from an infomercial.</li>
            <li> my hair feeling very very thin!</li>
            <li> This product is NOT what it claims to be, it just bad.</li>
            <li> and I feel bad if others were.</li>
            <li> Too bad I don&#x27;t have someplace to go!&lt;br</li>
            <li> So at this point I am truly amazed,distressed and I was shocked beyond disbelief.</li>
            <li> Was home sick watching infomercials.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a below average product with an outrageous price and horrible customer service.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> But sometimes things don&#x27;t work for everyone, so I gave it to my sister, and unfortunately she hated it also!!</li>

            <li> Terrible product!</li>
            <li> The worst part of buying these products has been the inability to get refunds from Wen!</li>
            <li> Wen return service is horrible and they automatically set you up for \\&quot;auto-replenish\\&quot; when you place your order, which is something you have to cancel!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with, ever!</li>
            <li> Customer service  is horrible with helping you cancel and get refunded!</li>

            <li> and it was terrible.  </li>
            <li> The worst thing of all is that they LIE because it is not a one time shipment it is a membership that charges you per delivery after each consecutive shipment.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I alternate between this and my regular shampoo and my hair feels healthier, so I am happy with this product and it smell good too.</li>
            <li> this is horrible, left my hair looking weighed down and dirty looking. I recieved automatic delivers I did not sign up for, and cancelling the deliveries was a nightmare, customer service is a joke... I wish I never heard of Wen. I can not stress enough to stay away from this company and their products, it is expensive and not worth the postage to send it back!</li>
            <li> loved the product would buy it again and recommended it to my friends also.smells wonderful makes my hair shine and clean</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for it. My lil sister found it satisfactory. She didn&#x27;t request anymore. She probably went for something else.</li>
            <li> Not something I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair feel greasy after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a product to use if you do not have time to style your hair after, leaves it greasy feeling and left waves in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended up putting different products in after using.</li>
            <li> I have long frizzy thin curly hair; I&#x27;ve tried a million products saw WEN on TV, gave WEN product a try and did NOT work for me very disappointed!</li>
            <li> if you are looking to just try it out&lt;br /&gt;and not joing a club with your ccard hit every 3 months&lt;br /&gt;i spent a little more. I havent used shampoo since receiving&lt;br /&gt;and I notice a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend and if you can afford join for the $29.95</li>
            <li> Loved the Shampoo and comb, haven&#x27;t had to use any type of conditioner afterwards. It does come with a hair treatment that says to either leave on for 24 hrs or rinse out in 30 mins. This seemed like alot to trouble especially if you have limited time for getting ready for work etc. Or just a normal daily routine. As my hair is a little longer than shoulder length I haven&#x27;t used the texture stick. Think next time will just buy shampoo and skip \\&quot;extra\\&quot; products</li>
            <li> I have found my hair wizard! No desire to try any other brand again. My hair has never looked so good with so little effort. It is very soft (my son keeps petting it) and manageable. Products are easy to use. Cost seems a bit excessive at first glance but well worth it and I expect it will even out with the cost of similar products over time.</li>
            <li> I used Wen today for the first time and my hair is limp &amp; looks greasy. I followed the directions exactly as it says on the bottle, yet my hair looks blah. Save your money and buy yourself a bottle of Pantene. Don&#x27;t fall into the trap of the hype like I did! This product is a SCAM.</li>
            <li> This product is much better than I anticipated.  I used it just once and noticed a difference in my hair.  I have natural hair that can be difficult to manage but with this product I was able to comb thru and work with my hair much easier and within less time,  I strongly recommend this product for anyone looking to achieve healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed the results within my first use.  The main thing that stood out, what that my hair was no longer falling out while I combed it, wet or dry. My hair is bleached the to max as I am naturally dark.  My hair was incredibly damaged before using this product and nothing else worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The styling creme was very helpful for when I wanted to blow dry and flat iron my hair.  The mask was great for a deep conditioning treatment and the texturizing stick is hardly needed, unless you want to tame a fly away piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place I ordered it from was okay since it took so long to get to me they sent me a refund of 15%.  I appreciate their willingness to keep a customer satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;But you may never want to return to a traditional shampoo ever again and its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment was that it took forever to get to me and I thought I was getting the 16oz bottle.  It did not last me but only 3 weeks and that was only because I used 6 to 8 pumps totall since I have short hair.</li>
            <li> I agree with the rater below. I just went directly to wenhaircare.com and bought it for 29.95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable to buy from Amazon, but some folks are making a HUGE profit from the markup. An extra $20 is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> While Chaz Dean promises beautiful with wen hair care it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I washed my hair with it followed the directions and it left my hair dirty. It didn&#x27;t feel clean and after a day my hair was begging to be washed again. I even developed bad dandruff which i have never suffered from before. Take it from me don&#x27;t buy it. Its a waist of money. Plus if you do you&#x27;re research you&#x27;ll learn his product isn&#x27;t completely natural it has a chemical which is supposed to be a nerve toxin. While it may not affect you now I&#x27;m not taking any chances. I&#x27;d rather use Organix from the pharmacy it give me better results, especially the coconut milk one.</li>
            <li> Great product made my hair really soft and shiny added volume and bounce and would recommend to family and friends</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for Wen but was not that impressed. It did make my hair a little soft but I get the same results with Nexxus for colored hair. I have long hair also so the bottle did not last very long at all for the amount of money that I spent.</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of Wen By Chaz Dean Sweet Almond 5 piece set from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I love the products and will continue to purchase them on Amazon for always. Thanks Chaz Dean and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be great and I was so excited to receive the product, but it wasn&#x27;t even close to being great. First of all, I have wavy, thick long hair, it made my hair greasy and it felt heavy. That wasn&#x27;t the biggest problem, I broke out all over my face and neck and body from it, and on top of that it did not get rid of the frizziness, it made my hair more frizzy and gave it this weird fro from the top. I never break out from shampoo products so I was extremely surprised. I didn&#x27;t want to blame WEN but after I stopped using it, I stopped breaking out. It&#x27;s not a good product at all, if you want something natural or sulfate-free use a L&#x27;oreal product that&#x27;s worth 5$ it&#x27;s a hundred times better than Wen. When I called customer service to discontinue they tried to convince me that I was using it wrong, and I told them that a Wal-mart brand shampoo was better. I ended up giving the second bottle to one of my friends and the same happened with her, she broke out from it. I think they have something in the ingredient that irritates the skin. So if you have sensitive skin that breaks out easily I would advise you not to use purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is far too heavy and greasy and in addition the company KEPT charging my card for months after I cancelled it. I&#x27;ve had to call 4 times to cancel this and every time they try to charge me my &#x27;final charge&#x27; even when I send the stuff back. I even had one of the representatives cuss at me after asking me to &#x27;change my order preferences&#x27; etc. Just let me cancel....I know what I want to do with my money. I ended up wasting so much money that they wouldn&#x27;t refund. Don&#x27;t order it!!</li>
            <li> I was given the Wen kit as a gift by my mom who raved about it. I have to say, I was very skeptical at first because #1 it&#x27;s an informercial, #2 some negative reviews I read, and #3 my mom and I have totally different hair (hers: fine, straight, dry, shoulder length, processed. mine: thick, wavy, long, oily at scalp but dry on ends, not heavily processed - only highlighted now and then). But I tried it anyway. After the first time, I thought eh, it&#x27;s o.k. but I don&#x27;t see the big deal. But I used it a few more times anyway. After the 3rd usage, I started to see a very noticable differenc in shine, softness and overall health. Now, after about 2 months of using Wen (with some trial and error) I have to say that I&#x27;m a total convert! I LOVE IT SO MUCH that I have thrown out my old shampoos and conditioners. For those thinking about trying it, DO IT. But, I have to say that there are some things that no one told me that I had to learn on my own:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Did you read those negative reviews about Wen leaving their hair greasy? Me too. And it made me nervous. I did have a day in the beginning where my crown seemed a tiny bit greasy (as if I hadn&#x27;t washed it in a few days). Here&#x27;s what I learned that made all the difference. Do not try to put it on quickly and haphazardly like regular shampoo. You really have to work it in, and you really have to wash it out. I start out initially with a few pumps on concentrate solely on getting product into my roots (especially crown), around my hairline and at the nape of my neck. I really massage it in there making sure it&#x27;s all the way to the roots and no hair is left uncoated. Only then to I move on to working it in to the length down the hair shaft and to the ends. I really feel like the Wen comb (or a good wide tooth comb) is essential. And then I leave it on through out the rest of my shower. Rinsing it out is the last thing I do. BE SURE to work on the rinse out as much as you did on the work in. Once again, make sure it&#x27;s rinsed out of the crown and roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The different scents are not just about smell. Go to Chaz Dean&#x27;s site. They explain what type of hair each scent is meant to treat. I have tried Sweet Almond Mint, Pomegranate, Lavender, and Fig. Pomegranate is my favorite by far. Just moisturizing enough without loss of body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from being a total skeptic to a complete kool-aid drinking convert. I hope this review has left you with some tips that I had to discover on my own.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT what it claims to be, it just bad. It smells great and it feels refreshing but in my opinion it docent clean your scalp and because of it you will develop Dandruff. It made my hair very very soft but very very frizzy so overall this product do not deliver what claims to do.  I already have gorgeous hair but I have to use lots of products depending if it&#x27;s curly or straight and also depending the temperature and even thought my hair it&#x27;s beautiful it is damage by the flat irions blowdryin ext. I recommend don&#x27;t spend your money on this product you could find other products that could be better to your hair and hair type. Wen just Doesn&#x27;t Deliver What It Promise. My hair is waive and a lot,  thick and  very long ( to my butt in layers ) and it didn&#x27;t work for my hair type. I actually hate it my hair and my head don&#x27;t feel clean and I wasted the money</li>
            <li> This is a weird, no lather type shampoo, and it is odd to use for the first week. I couldn&#x27;t make up my mind about it but now in the third week, I like it. I have curly, very dry, very frizzy hair. I have used Ouidad for the last few years and even that has not been able to manage it this past year. I almost gave up on the Wen, but since I paid for it, I decided to use it to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, it has a VERY STRONG scent. My friend gave me a small tub of cucumber and the smell nearly drove me to my knees. This scent is almost all mint and no almond. If you read the reviews of fig, some love it and some call it &#x27;rotting fruit&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go to the Wen website, it is cheaper BUT you have no choice but to sign up for monthly shipments. THIS seller is a one time deal and had the best price of all. Plus you could try out this scent.</li>
            <li> Was home sick watching infomercials. Alyssa Milano was on with Chaz Dean raving about the product.  Since I think it&#x27;s always a great idea to make impulsive purchases based solely on celebrity endorsements I decided to order some. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this one time shipment is DEFINITELY the way to go if you just want to try out the product! The official website has you set up with continued shipments and considering I am so po&#x27; I can&#x27;t even afford the \\&quot;or\\&quot; in poor I wanted a fairly cheap, one time shipment to check the stuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since originally writing this I went from ordering the one time shipment to signing up with QVC for ongoing shipments.  I can&#x27;t really afford getting them too often and QVC does let you adjust how often you receive shipments.  I did some comparison shopping and they were the cheapest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DISCOVERED there is a difference in ingredients in the formula from the 1 time shipment and the products I received from QVC.  Not sure what that means but wanted to let people know.  It looks like the newer QVC formulas begin with more plant extracts vs the one time shipment which had a few alcohols listed as the first three ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product in the mail from the 1 time shipment, I noticed the invoice had my name on it and said I would continue to receive shipments.  I wrote to the seller to clarify since the profile states it&#x27;s a one time shipment.  They wrote me back almost immediately to say that it is def. a one time shipment and to look closely at the invoice and it shows their credit card not mine, which was true.  (It also shows they only paid $10.00 for the pack?!?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve been using the product for about one-two weeks.  The whole \\&quot;use as many pumps as you can\\&quot; is a scam in my humble opinion.  I have long hair, abt 5 inches past my shoulders.  And my hair is fine.  I separate my hair into two sections (part down the middle) do one pump per each side then add 1/2 to 1 more pump to my scalp.  Sometimes just using two pumps total (one for each side) and combing it through then pinning it up and letting it sit for 5 mins seems like enough.  I say try using less, comb it thru and add more if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on amount used: I do realize that my hair is not as clean/heavy/greasier when I use very little product.  So I think they emphasize more! more! more! to ensure your hair gets clean.  Despite that, I still do not use the recommended number of pumps and just work it through from scalp to ends until there is a decent amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My concern was that my hair wouldn&#x27;t actually get clean.  I run and get pretty sweaty.  My hair definitely gets clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that my hair is really soft and manageable.  I&#x27;ve tried all shampoos and conditioners from natural/herbal stuff to salon to everything in between.  I always needed a de-tangler after shampoo and conditioner and even with a detangler I still had to work to brush my hair out.  With this product my brush smoothly goes through my hair when wet and then while dry as I brush it throughout the day--even the next day.  That has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see why some give it okay reviews.  I haven&#x27;t seen much shine or extra body like the product claims and I still don&#x27;t look like Alyssa Milano ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the other items that come in the kit once--the deep conditioner I left on overnight and that stick.  Didn&#x27;t really see any results.  Seemed to work the same as the shampoo, same effects noted above.  Have used the hair gel and haven&#x27;t noticed anything spectacular but I&#x27;m going to keep checking them out since I&#x27;ve only used them once so far.  Oh and then there is the fancy ultra super comb ;-)  I use that in the shower to comb it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall you may be better off spending the 30 bucks for one of the 16 oz bottles instead of spending 30 bucks for a 12 oz (in this package) and other products that so far seemso-so (but there is that comb! ;-)  After going through this one time kit I went on line and signed up with QVC and paid $50.00 for 32 ounces (two 16oz bottles) so ultimately that is the best buy but you may want to go in on it with a friend if you are just trying it out (and you&#x27;d still be paying cheaper-- $25 vs. $30 for this one time shipment.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the mint almond featured in the one time shipment and was worried the mint would be overpowering (generally don&#x27;t like mint in anything but my mojitos for that reason.)  Was pleasantly surprised that it added a slight refreshing tingle and wasn&#x27;t overpowering in scent or sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review seems more negative than I thought it would be.  So far, based on the ease of managing my hair, I&#x27;m thinking I will continue to use the product.  They claim the hair continues to improve as you continue to use it so we shall see if that&#x27;s true and I&#x27;ll write another review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: SO I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a month now and I have to say, I am hooked.  I changed the amount I used--was using 3 pumps total--now I use about 10 pumps total per wash. Usually leave it on 10 minutes per wash.  They claimed if you use the right amount you get better results.  I thought it was a scam but decided to try it for one was.  Did notice more improvements doing this over time.  My hair does have improved shine, very manageable.  In the past every time I would go to brush my hair it would be yet another battle.  Now my hair is tangle free even into the next day.  And my hair seems cleaner.  Some days I don&#x27;t even wash it the next day (which saves on product.) I read this on his website but didn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had my hair washed recently a couple of times with regular shampoo (away for weekend) or salon formula (just got my hair cut.)  The tangles both wet and dry and then my hair being hard to manage all day and looking like crap sold me back onto Wen.  For me the cleansing conditioner hasreplaced my shampoo, conditioner and de-tanglers and I use my Aveda styling gel a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t liked that styling balm stick (still have used it twice) and the hair gel seems so so.  Still haven&#x27;t made up my mind about the intensive hair mask.  Used it once.  I did find if you look around you can just buy the cleansing conditioner.  Now that I&#x27;m hooked I found it on QVC two 16oz bottles for a total of 32oz for $40.00.  If you look around this site you&#x27;ll see a 32oz bottle is big bucks so you may want to check out this option if you are hooked.</li>
            <li> While watching the infomercials on tv, I was skeptical but I was in desperate need for something that would bring my hair back to life. When I found this deal online I couldnt believe it! All of these products are so underpriced! My hair feels amazing! And the conditioner is so tingly! It feels great long after my hair has dried! I will never go back to regular shampoo again! Thank you Chaz Dean!</li>
            <li> is it true that it really works because i have oily hair that i can.t get rid of i try  every shampoo in all stores and it didn.t work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003PXZI2O WEN BY CHAZ DEAN SWEET ALMOND CONDITIONER,STYLING CREME, RE-MOIST MASK INTENSIVE HAIR TREATMENT,TEXTURE BALM,WIDE TOOTH SHOWER COMB,5 PIECE SET]]</li>
            <li> Once you Wen, you&#x27;ll never go back!! Was professionally packaged-like I&#x27;d ordered it from one of the TV commercials.  I dare any women to try it and not instantly become addicted to washing your hair.  Seriously I find ways to dirty my hair just to wash it!!  NO JOKE!! 100 stars</li>
            <li> I bought this product becuase my colored and naturally wavy hair was starting to look really bad.  I was noticing lots of split ends and my hair felt horrible and the color faded really fast. I bought Wen and tried it.  In the shower the menthol in the product really smelled wonderful!  It makes your head feel cold and it made my hair soo silky in the shower. I was SURE I was going to be pleasantly surprised. (note: this HURTS when it gets in your eyes so be careful!!!)  When I got out of the shower I didnt put the styling cream in it.  I wanted to see how just the cleanser alone did.  I dried my hair and WOW!  My hair was soft but the wow came from how out of control my hair was.  Not silky and beautiful but HUGE mess!  They claim you can just let it air dry and it is beautiful... uhhh no. I had to do a lot of work to get my hair to go silky and straight.  MY hair is wavy.. but not super curly so I didnt expect this.  I think it was because it made my hair soo soft it had nothing to weigh it down to make it smooth.  But once I used the flat iron it was smooth and shiny and SOOOOO soft.  The next day I used the styling cream and it definately helped with my crazy hair.  The texture balm really helped keep my hair georgous the entire day (which with my wavy hair is difficult to do).  SO over all.. I do like the product.  SMells great, makes my hair soft, like the styling products for when I wear my hair straight.  I havent curled my hair yet though.</li>
            <li> I have what is arguably the most difficult hair to deal with.  My shoulder length hair is naturally curly with the tendency to frizz and as anyone with curly hair knows it is super sensitive and normally dry.  But my hair goes a step further, while my hair is dry, I deal with a very oily scalp.  To achieve a clean scalp, I&#x27;m often left with the choice of drying my hair out even more or go with an oily scalp to save some moisture in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most people I had seen the infomercials for Wen and honestly thought, like all television products, this one would be a dud; either it would never clean my scalp or would leave my hair so oily looking I&#x27;d never walk out of the house.  For some reason, I decided to give Wen a try, possibly because the product was so different than any other shampoo with it&#x27;s no lather cleaning.  I&#x27;d also read most of the reviews on Amazon and found either people loved it or absolutely hated it.  The only way I would know was to try it for myself.  I would not buy it off of television or the Wen website having heard they would sign me up for automatic delivery.  I found Wen on Amazon and after making sure I would not receive additional orders, went ahead and bought the 5 piece set.  I expected to be completely disappointed with the products and like so many others in my continual search for the perfect hair products, find it being dropped into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the kit a few days after placing my order (very quick shipping) and decided to give it a try immediately.  I followed the directions to the letter and was amazed to find after use my hair felt clean, including my scalp.  Too good to be true I thought and figured my hair would be oily by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the included styling cream to blow-dry my hair and honestly can say I was not impressed with it, at all.  Other products I have for blowing curly hair straight seemed to work much better.  However, I did notice my hair was easier to dry andhad much less frizz than I was used to.  I ran a quick flat iron through my dried hair and went about my day - again assuming my hair/scalp would be oily by the end of the day or my hair would be a mess of frizz.  Neither happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That evening my hair looked just as clean as when it was first washed and the little bit of frizz I did have was nothing compared to my normal frizz factor.  After all, I live outside of Miami Florida, the hair frizz capital of the world.  Normally my hair will stay down until maybe lunch time, on a good day, before it&#x27;s so out of control from frizz, I give up and put it into a bun or ponytail.  Amazingly, with the Wen I kept it down all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning my scalp was oily but not more than normal.  Again I used the Wen Sweet Almond Conditioner but followed it up with my own styling products.  Again, I had a good hair day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the big test was coming up.  I&#x27;ve been in need of hair color and highlights and went in two weeks ago.  Normally coloring and highlighting my hair results in straw that I will have to deep condition for days following a color just to get some softness back and to help tame my hair.  I always wait two days after receiving color to wash my hair and on the second day I decided to try the Wen.  If this product was really going to work, this was the ultimate test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I again followed the instructions and after washing my hair I followed it up with the re-moist mask, leaving it on for about an hour and rinsed very well.  My hair did not feel like straw at all, the color had not faded one bit and once again, using my own straightening products, I was able to blow-dry my hair in about 1/2 the time and without battling as much frizz.  Since coloring, I&#x27;ve been washing my hair every other day and using the re-moist mask once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had two weeks to evaluate the product and have to admit I&#x27;ve gone from skeptical to very happy.  I have found once a week I do needto use a regular shampoo just to remove some buildup on my scalp that Wen does seem to leave.  I use Alterna Caviar or Alterna-10 shampoo for that, also a non-sulfate shampoo and follow that up with the Wen Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more of the Conditioning Shampoo and Wen re-moist mask.  I do wish Wen would devise a Conditioning Shampoo that would work better for those of us with oily hair but using normal shampoo from time to time isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend Wen for those with curly, frizzy hair as it does seem to do wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve rated the Wen kit 4 stars, while I really like the Conditioner, the re-moist mask and the included comb, Wen&#x27;s texture balm is worthless for me as is the styling cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> great product too much when i can go on wen and get it for 29.95</li>
            <li> WEN has made me love my hair again. I thought it was too dry to ever look good but WEN makes it look and feel wonderful again! It&#x27;s so easy and so effective it&#x27;s even more than I hope for.</li>
            <li> I am so pissed off! I spent $100 on Wen Hair Care products with the peace of mind that if I didn&#x27;t like it I could return it and get my money back. I wrote down the deadline date in case I did decide to return it so that I wouldn&#x27;t be late. Well, I didn&#x27;t like it. Terrible product! Way overpriced and left my hair looking dirty. I even added a shower filter thinking I would make sure I did all I could to make it work. SCAM. That&#x27;s all I have to say. Then, when I did decide I had to return it, I called to get all of the information I needed, mailed it - got a delivery confirmation and they said it would take 4-6 weeks to get my money back. Well, it&#x27;s been past 6 weeks, I have been calling to check the process of my refund, and finally, they said I cannot get my money back becasue it wasnt returned on time. That is such BULL$#@!.  DONT BUY THEIR PRODUCT UNLESS YOU&#x27;RE WILLING TO WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!! THAT WHOLE 60 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE IS A LIE!!!!!!! I AM SO PISSED OFF!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE PRODUCTS! THEY DON&#x27;T WORK.</li>
            <li> I just washed my hair for the first time today.  I loved how it felt.  I have long thick hair.  It was like washing it in conditioner. It&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I am African American. This product is great. I use it as a leave on conditioner. It makes my hair so soft. I have natural non relaxed hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that&#x27;s fine/normal and I&#x27;ve been searching high and low to find a product that allows me to maximize my beautiful curls, but not let it be frizzy or crunchy.  I love beachy hair, but I had yet to find something to get me that desired affect...until I met Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wen is amazing.  The first two times I washed my hair with it, I was obviously doing it wrong because it felt heavy and greasy.  After watching the instructional videos on Chaz Dean&#x27;s website, I tried again and the results have been so phenomenal I&#x27;m not going to use anything else on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a short time, I even tried the cheaper version/knock-off: Hair One.  Yeah, it didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to Wen and I am so grateful for a product that gives my hair beautiful shine, is sulfate free, keeps my hair smooth but my curls looking and feeling amazing.  My hair really has gotten softer and silkier the longer I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE WEN! This works!  It can be frustrating if it&#x27;s not working for you; but it may be because you&#x27;re not using it correctly.  Check out Chaz Dean&#x27;s website and follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also different kinds of Wen conditioning shampoos based on your hair type, and details about what kind of conditioning shampoo works for which kind of hair is very informative and helpful.</li>
            <li> I barely leave reviews but I was really happy with Wen!  I was watching it one morning and I had been thinking about getting a new hair product.  I ordered it and the woman asked me what my hair type was.  I told her, coarse, dry, a bit damaged.  I got my kit and boy was i WOWed when i used it.  I followed the instructions exactly and it really felt great in my hair and I could immediately feel the difference.  My hair has never felt this good and it was sooo easy to comb through. (I have natural african w/ a a bit of keratin treatment). It even brought out some curls and waves.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and surprised a product does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> Purchased the product, it came quicker than expected that was the good part. Me being an african american with pretty basic relaxed hair could not use the product as a \\&quot;conditioning cleanser\\&quot; it made my hair very flaky almost like sand from the beach but I used it as a after shampoo conditioner and it worked ok, still a little too greasy for my taste. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love what this product does for my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks.  Once a week I use a clarifier shampoo and KIWI conditioner.  My hair is not as contollable those days.  It looks and feels dry.  I have very fine shoulder length+ hair.  I have tried a lot of hair care to make my hair look thick and healthy, for the most part it weighed my hair down so much that there was no way for it to look full and healthy.  Some say it makes their hair feel greasy.  It feels different that is for sure, it feels healthy, not at all greasy.  I use about 3-4 pumps and let it sit while I shower, I then rinse it for about 2-3 minutes.  I like the way my hair feels and it looks so much healthier.  I plan to buy more.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this and washing my hair with any old conditioner in place of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp wasn&#x27;t very cleansed, still had some residue from my hair products when I used it. After washing twice, I gave up and used my regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am african american, but tend to have better results with mainstream shampoos due to my hair texture being more that of a mixed person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;let&#x27;s just say Herbal Essence left my hair more moisturized that this. So, I&#x27;ll go back to my Giovanni Line of organic haircare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it wouldn&#x27;t be that bad if you never use styling products in your hair so there isn&#x27;t much to wash out. But, if you style your hair with gels, spritz&#x27;s etc. it won&#x27;t exactly give you the comfortable clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And like other&#x27;s said, it leaves your hair somewhat brittle (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the alchohol)</li>
            <li> Know that when you go online and order this product that the first time it is the $29.95 but they will automatically ship you another order in under 30 days. This second order is $94 dollars and when you return the product you refund will be docked $10 for shipping and handling even though you did not request the shipping of the 3 month supply.  I found mane and tail to be a better product than this garbage! Seriously!</li>
            <li> I JUST RECIEVED MY WEN SWEET ALMOND MINT STARTER KIT TODAY AND COULDNT WAIT TO TRY IT OUT. WELL, I LOVE IT. IT CONDITIONS REALLY WELL, SMELLS WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;AS YOUR CLEANSING YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THE COOLING, FRESH SENSATION FROM THE ALMOND MINT.ALSO I USE A FLAT IRON EVERY WEEK, AND OCCASIONALY BLOW DRY AND AS SOON AS SOON AS I WAS DONE WITH THE BLOW DRYER I COULD FEEL THE SMOOTHNES AND NO FRIZZ. I USED THE FLAT IRON AFTERWARDS AND IT WAS SOO MUCH EASIER AND QUICKER TO GET A REALLY BEAUTIFUL SMOOTH, HEALTHY STYLE. I ALREADY RECCOMENDED IT TO MY FRIENDS AND SISTERS. IF YOUVE NEVER TRIED IT LIKE ME, YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A SHOT, YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I received my order very fast. My wife uses this and it made her hair beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love Wen products.  The sweet almond mint has a great smell and works wonderfully on my hair (AA with a tendency to be dry).  This makes my hair more managable and it also dries faster!</li>
            <li> I saw the infomercial so many time I decided I needed to try this product for myself. You definitely need to have time in the morning to apply the shampoo. Following the directions and separating the hair into four sections and using the comb keeps my hair looking clean all day. I did a fast wash and looked a little greasy mid day.  I have long hair, almost to the middle of my back, so I use more product. You also need to have good water pressure in your shower. I have hard water (no water softener unit in home) I could tell a difference when I went to a home with a softener, my hair looked better and I didn&#x27;t use as much product. I didn&#x27;t find that my hair was anything like the infomercial but I didn&#x27;t have a stylist doing it either! My hair did have a shine and was soft and silky. I am not a person who can go without washing their hair for days so I think it&#x27;s a down side to this product. I have blonde hair done by a professional and even with the color treated shampoo it still gets brassy. I use a purple shampoo and conditioner to tone it down. This is a common problem for any chemically treated blonde so I&#x27;m not dissapointed with that aspect of Wen. I use the styling tools and hair mask and I think they work great. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase another Wen refill because it is very costly. I&#x27;m happy I got all the \\&quot;extras\\&quot; that came with this bundle because I still use them and they go a long way. I found a great alternative at Sally Beauty called \\&quot;One Hair\\&quot;. It&#x27;s the same product but for $12.00 (less if you get the Sally Card for $5) It gives the same results without emptying your pocket book.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as directed for one month.  It does help hold my color in for sure.  My hair is soft and clean.  I&#x27;m on the fencepost as far as any big drastic changes from how my hair was with regular shampoo.  I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s in marginally better shape.  It&#x27;s quite possible I just need more time.  The initial bottle has lasted a whole month and I have about half left.  I have short hair which is colored every 6 weeks.  I think it&#x27;s one of these products that works differently for everybody depending on the condition of your hair to begin with.  I always used better quality salon products so my hair was in good shape when I started.  I would recommend giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> I have never had one complaint with the customer service. They have been very flexible with me and ship the products I want out when I want it. They never were pushy with me or bullshi**ed me and I feel bad if others were. The product itself is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m a Huge HUGE skeptic when it comes to buying ANYTHING off tv. I don&#x27;t have curly hair so I don&#x27;t personally know what it does or doesn&#x27;t do but i have processed hair and it makes my hair silky, shiny and strong! And I noticed a difference after the first use! I even gave it to family members to try and they lived it. Yes it is expensive but as with everything, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!  I have thick hair and thought this might be the answer.  The product was terrible and made my hair even more dry and brittle after two weeks of use.  I know they say they have a guarantee, but I thought I would just eat my loses.  However, even though I denied auto refill shipment, they continue to send it to me EVERY month and charge my credit card.  THEY ARE CROOKS!!!!  I have called and continually asked they not put me on auto refill, but it just keeps charging.  My credit card company has even been involved for the past three months in trying to keep them from charging me.  IT is a mess and definitely not worth the hassle!!!!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I have thing hair and this product made my hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> This item was great because I could try the product without committing to monthly mailings if I didn&#x27;t want it. I am thinking I will tho, because I now know it is a wonderful product! Thanks</li>
            <li> I have finally ended my search for a hair product for me. I&#x27;m the girl with bottles and bottles of half-used products under the sink that I thought would save my hair.  I have spent a fortune on hair products that don&#x27;t work but, hope springs eternal, and I bought Wen. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT... it has changed my hair. I have what they call \\&quot;course\\&quot; hair...really dry and difficult. My course hair is finally soft and managable. From the first day my hair was soft and shiny. I have received many compliments from people at work, asking if I&#x27;ve changed my color or cut my hair. I won&#x27;t be without it now.I will stay a Wen user for life!  One practical suggestion, use a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo once a week to remove build-up.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo. I don&#x27;t have much use for the other products. The comb is useless. I liked trying it without being enrolled in \\&quot;the club\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I ordered this pack off of their website &amp; I have to say I really liked the cleansing conditioner (&amp; the other products it came with), it definitely made my hair soft &amp; shiny like it is supposed to but if you don&#x27;t follow the directions EXACTLY like it says then it will leave your hair looking &amp; feeling greasy &amp; heavy. Believe me I know, it happened the 2nd time I used it after I thought I had completely rinsed the product out of my hair. Apparently I didn&#x27;t b/c it left my hair greasy. But other than that as long as you use the amount your supposed to &amp; rinse it out completely, it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons I gave it only 3 stars is because it goes so fast b/c of how much product you have to use each time in order for it to work and b/c I would find twice as much hair in my drain than I normally find after I washed it with Wen(which I didn&#x27;t like one bit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have long thick hair so the 12 oz bottle lasted only about 5 uses &amp; I definitely wash my hair more than 5 times a month (it&#x27;s supposed to last 30 days)! So I ended up cancelling my future orders because there is no way I would be able to afford this stuff... I&#x27;d have to order a bunch of it in order for it to last &amp; be worth my while. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth trying @ least once but if you order from their website, just make sure you call &amp; cancel if you don&#x27;t want anymore shipments b/c they will charge your card &amp; send more if you don&#x27;t cancel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m now back to my regular shampoo/conditioner Garnier, which does the job at a much lower price. Soooo, I would definitely recommend Wen IF...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You can afford it&lt;br /&gt;2. You have shorter length hair&lt;br /&gt;3. You have high water pressure (mine is low so it would take forever to rinse the conditioner out, making my shower time seem like forever).</li>
            <li> Well....the conditioner works pretty good and make&#x27;s your hair amazingly soft. I have thick naturally curly hair and I have never felt my hair that soft before. The styling creme is 2nd best. I&#x27;ve only used once but I like the results, better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and I don&#x27;t necessarily have to put product in my hair with this (mousse, hairspray, etc.) It&#x27;s still a bit frizzy but it toned it down a notch or two. Do NOT use the texture balm, it just makes your hair greasy feeling and I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t do anything really. The other product it comes with....I haven&#x27;t used yet, but once I try it out I will let everyone know on here. The comb is a pretty good comb I&#x27;d say. I ALWAYS have to use a brush and it&#x27;s always really tangled, but it wasn&#x27;t NEARLY as bad and I could actually use the comb! I wouldn&#x27;t buy any of this stuff again unless it&#x27;s the conditioner and styling creme, can&#x27;t say anything about the other one I haven&#x27;t used yet but I hope it works! NO TEXTURE BALM!</li>
            <li> After watching the infomercial, I was SO EXCITED to try this new Wen product. I mean Alysia Milano wouldnt lie to me, right? I put it on my wishlist and my husband, being the amazing man he is, bought it as a gift for me. The product arrived 3 weeks later than expected, but hey, they call it snail mail for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;The first week my naturally curly hair looked amazing and felt GREAT! I felt just like the commercial. After that not so much. I looked like i dipped my head into a bucket of lard. It left the hair at my scalp so greasy that when i would comb through it you could see the comb tracks ( my hair was DRY when doing this). If i scratched my hair i would have residue under my nails. I&#x27;m not kidding this actually happened.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for a once in a while product. use it for a couple of days, then switch back to an everyday shampoo. But i would not recommend this product as a daily use...I would not recommend this product really at all. I gave it one star because that first week it was great but every day after it was aweful.</li>
            <li> The WEN products are quite amazing.  I have been using this product for about a year and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  I am always trying to find a \\&quot;deal\\&quot; on the cleansing conditioner as its the mostly used product for me.  No other compares.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> The cleansing conditioner and Re-Moist hair mask workes as advertised.  I dont think much for the texture balm, the comb, and the styling creme.  The trick for using the product however is to follow the directions as stated. The comb is too heavy for my fine hair. The texture balm is a no-go.  The styling creme is fair. I will definitely re-order the Conditioning Cleanser. I like ordering with Amazon because I don&#x27;t have to order products that I don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> Its OK as a conditioner or even a leave in but that&#x27;s about it, its doesn&#x27;t clean well and it leaves my hair a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li> I saw the Try Wen infomercial, ordered, and am now convinced that a person or the ordering software should be specifically asking, \\&quot;What hair type are you?\\&quot; in order to receive the right Wen for your hair. For 2 consecutive days I used this product package and followed the instructions, but after my hair dried each time it was completely parched and frizzy. I have thick, course, Afro hair. I need moisture!!! Especially, with a curly, comb-through texturizer in my hair. From what I understand now, I should have tried the Wen, Fig formula but how was I to know when the TV sellers push that \\&quot;this product is good for all hair types?\\&quot; There is no Fig package offered on the commercial, it&#x27;s pushing Sweet Almond Mint, the package I ordered - which smells a little mediciny, like menthol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great News!&lt;br /&gt;While researching, I learned that Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply has their own, much cheaper version of Wen called Hair One - also found right here on Amazon. Here again, you must get the right formula for your hair! I&#x27;m going to try the dry-hair formula with Olive Oil, which now, sounds about right for me. If this doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s back to using oils or grease or styling gels, and most definitely shampoo, while I wait for the next big thing that will greatly aid in ethic hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been informed: Both \\&quot;Wen\\&quot; and \\&quot;Hair One\\&quot; are mainly conditioners. If treating and washing your hair and scalp without shampoo is all you&#x27;re after, either Suave Conditioner or Alberto Vo5 Conditioner will do a better job because of an added cleaning ingredient. Both are under $3 each and both are found right here on Amazon, but neither contains the added ingredients which target specific hair-type needs. I do hope this is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 2013 Updates - February&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must revisit this review because I want to be fare to Wen. Now that I&#x27;ve thought about it, I love putting comb-thru texturizers in my hair which leave it in a state of not really permed but notreally natural either (and without a moisturizer it is highly dry), which is probably why neither Wen or Hair One worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;SIDE BAR: On the Wen website you can see a black woman getting her wet hair straightened with only a hairdryer and a round brush. No lye, no hot comb, and no grease. Fascinating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still disagree with Wen&#x27;s statement against all shampoos which was something to the effect of, \\&quot;If it&#x27;s lathering it&#x27;s damaging.\\&quot; I must give some high marks to my 2012 discovery, Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo - also available here on Amazon. It attacks dandruff, works to prevent breakage, and promotes hair and scalp health. On my bottle (Green Apple scent), it states that it&#x27;s ph balanced for everyday use even on colored or permed hair. I love the silky feel of my hair during and after cleaning. My hair and scalp are healthier. This stuff rocks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lastly, my favorite comb-thru texturizer, Elasta QP was discontinued late 2012 but The S Curl texturizer continues to give me the waves and curls I desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- New Wen Ad - October 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently viewed the new Wen infomercial which introduces a new product, Six-Thirteen - which is supposed to instantly hydrate damaged, dry, and chemically treated hair. As I mentioned above, I love comb-thru texturizers but they leave me extremely dry. Could this 613 be the missing link in the Wen line of products that I so desperately needed the first time I tried Wen? I&#x27;ll bet so. There is definitely a need for this new product! It made me excited about trying Wen again or maybe just trying 613.</li>
            <li> This product is a rip of. I bought thinking my hair will chane. it didn&#x27;t and I didn&#x27;t realize that they will send me the product every three month. I called the costumer service and I asked me to cancel the every three month shipment since my Wen lasted more than three month. I thought I was done with them. Three months passed and I saw a Wen charged my credit card for another shipment. I called the costumer service again and told them that I have canceled my membership three months ago. the rep at the costumer service told me that since the reason that I canceled was because the product lasted more than 3 moths so they decided to send it to me every five months. I was so mad and I told the lady what part of English you guys didn&#x27;t understand that I don&#x27;t want the product and I canceled it five months ago. the costumer service was so idiot she said&amp;#34; do you want us to send it every six months instead&amp;#34; I told her more than once I don&#x27;t want the product at all. the costumer service lady got so mad because I didn&#x27;t agree with her plan and she was rude and hung up the phone. bad product, stupid costumer service, and Rude costumer service. they just want your money and the trick you in so many ways to get your money.</li>
            <li> I am so very thankful for the reviews!  I definitely will NOT order this product.  The &#x27;membership fee&#x27; for cancellation was the deciding point!!!!</li>
            <li> I used Wen the first day and noticed an incrediable difference in my hair! My hair continues to look great! Great stuff I recomend Wen to everybody</li>
            <li> I love it,the product did every thay promised and more.my hair has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love WEN. I used it for 2 months...loved it for the first month but then noticed a lot of hair in the drain...then noticed my hair was looking thinner and thinner...then noticed LOTS of dandruff that I have NEVER had before in my life. Decided to get some natural Mercola shampoo and the almost immediately the hair loss stopped and the dandruff went away. This stuff does not let your scalp breathe.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the Wen products when ordering,yet quickly became disappointed after using. I have thin, blonde hair and found the almond products too heavy, weighing my hair down. Called back and was advised to try the Aloe products instead. Those, too, were less than spectacular. The worst part of buying these products has been the inability to get refunds from Wen! Nearly 60 days have gone by, numerous customer service reps have been called, and I am still due a credit from one of the shipments!! Don&#x27;t waste your time on these products.....they don&#x27;t work. Wen return service is horrible and they automatically set you up for \\&quot;auto-replenish\\&quot; when you place your order, which is something you have to cancel!</li>
            <li> I liked the wen just fine and my hair looks good, but I wasn&#x27;t informed that it would be a repeat order. . I never placed a repeat order cause wen is exspensive and I really couldn&#x27;t afford to. Now thou, my tax return will be paying for it instead of bills that need to get payed. Not wens fault. I don&#x27;t get my mail but once a month or not for three months like in this case.  It&#x27;s past the 60 day return.  I was rude and abrut when I called they&#x27;re operators.  It wasn&#x27;t they&#x27;re fault. They offered to give me grace period and ship product back today but I won&#x27;t make the post office before it closes, so the discounted.  I like wen, but didn&#x27;t plan for this and it wasn&#x27;t in my budget.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping it would solve some of my hair problems. I was disappointed.  Although my hair was softer it was not more manageable.  After using it for a month I have decided that it is not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would revisit this review.  I have continued to use the Wen products.  I have tried the lavender and also the pomegranate. I have come to really like the Wen cleansing conditioner shampoos.  I would highly recommend them.  It may take a few months of continued use to get your hair into shape.</li>
            <li> I got this product after seeing it on TV. I thought I would try it because I have fizzy hair. I did what I was suppose to do. After 30 days it worked but made my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> This product lives up to everything it claims.  My hair feels silky and manageable. Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I feel about the product... yet...I think it is  hit and miss...I ordered the ten ounce size to start..and everyone including the creator says the more you use the better..so I decided to order three more bottles, 16 oz size..different scents...so far I am not totally sold on the product..if I style my hair it looks great...if I let it air dry...not so much...I think that I was thinking from the first shampoo a miracle would occur...My hair is damaged from highlights and heat damage..I think if I cut it all off and start over with no products and no heat ever...it would be perfect!!!! never the less...I am not really going to cut off all my hair and I will order the bigger size so I can just use a handfull every time....and I guess we will see if the more the better is really true.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, pin straight hair.  I had really high hopes for this product after watching the infomercial.  I ordered the special package for $29.95.  In the end, I paid $110 for two bottles of the conditioner and styling products. If you use the amount they tell you to there is no way it will last 90 days til the next shipment.  I am sorry to say that while my hair is softer and it saves one step in the shower, my hair holds curl even less than it did before.  I do not use a curling iron, but a metal round brush as Chaz does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked forward to buying the gallon in June, but I can&#x27;t say the product worked.  I used the lavendar.  Thought about trying the tea tree, but hate to waste my money again.  All the other products come in the almond scent which I don&#x27;t like.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you DO purchase this product, be very aware of the 60 return policy.  I missed the deadline so now I have a bunch of expensive products I don&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comb is nice, though</li>
            <li> I give 2 stars because it was ok in the beginning. I then paid the ridiculous price for this hair care system and it feels as if it keeps drying out my hair. I cancelled my order and I didnt have any issues cancelling but it was still a rip off. I bought this product MONTHS ago and i only will use when i run out of my other shampoo. Every time it dries out my hair. I have dry, colored, medium length, frizzy hair not curly or stick straight.... \\&quot;works on all hair types\\&quot;... I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;m sitting here watching their infomercial now and that is why im on here reviewing so others don&#x27;t get ripped off too. Maybe it&#x27;ll work for some but not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN for 5 years now, and NOTHING, and I mean, NOTHING makes my hair look and feel soft &amp; healthy like Chaz&#x27;s products. When I&#x27;m running low on the cleansing conditioner, I&#x27;ll use a drug-store sulfate/sodium-free brand, but my hair ends up feeling like straw afterwards. Dry, not shiny, lifeless, dull. While I admit I do use a shampoo every now and then on my roots, I really only use the cleansing conditioner AND the styling creme. I have mostly straight, thick, long hair, and my hair doesn&#x27;t take curl very well, however with just a nickel size amount of styling creme in it, when I curl my hair, it lasts 48 hours. It&#x27;s incredible. I also use the cleansing conditioner to bathe my 2 cats, it&#x27;s animal-friendly, and they smell amazing when they come out!</li>
            <li> i saw an infomercial for this on tv so i decided to try it. i have been searching for some new kind of shampoo and conditioner, ive used organic and sulfate free, hopeing to undo the damage i regularly do to my hair. being that i get very greasy hair, these shampoos didnt work for me because they did not remove the grease, and i ended up getting more acne then i already have. wen works very well! you dont see the difference right away, and being that it doesnt lather and has a more conditioner feel, i was nervous that it would leave my hair greasy. but it didnt! it rinses out clean and leaves my hair fairly soft and not tangly. i usualy have to put some kind of oil in my hair after i shower because my hair is so damaged that it tangles easily, but so far i have not had to with this product. also since i started useing it my hair looks healthier, feels healthier, and has ALOT more body to it. and it also started to curl a little bit when it dries, which i dont know hwere that came from because i have pretty straight lifeless hair. if you are thinknig about buying this product i suggest you get this starter kit with everything.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift. First time i used it i immediately noticed how soft my hair was! It has never been so soft and i even noticed my hair was shinny. I also have colored hair and noticed it actually getting brighter! After using the mask (overnight) my hair had more volume and body. My only complaint though is that i dont see a difference in smoothness. my hair has always been frizzy and i really havent seen improvemnt in that area. im just starting out so i am going to give it more time. The smell is nice, seems like alot of product to use (according to the instructions) and feels reall thick. Still debating on whether i should keep using it or not, if you have the chance JUST to try it out at a cheap price i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> You watch info commercials and are skeptical, but I am so amazed with WEN.  I have always had baby thin hair, shed like a dog and anyone could tell what the humidity outside is by looking at my hair.  After using Wen for over 3 mos now, my hair feels silkier, stronger and my color lasts longer.  I was worried about the price because the bottle isn&#x27;t too big, I bought this product several months ago and have about 1/4 of the bottle left - it goes along way.  Wonderful product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> at first i loved this shampoo but after a few months my hair stated to look dull and flat. so i talked to my teacher at my school (hair school) and they told me to stop using this that the last client we had that used  this  came in for a perm that she had got many times before that but after using this all of her hair fell out. so i stop using it  went back to normal shampoo and my hair is not dull or flat anymore.</li>
            <li> I got caught up in the darn infomercial. I admit it. I wanted to try the Wen system but did not want to get caught up in the automatic shipment system. Actually this is a great way to try the product before you get stuck. I am not sure if I would order this again but it was good to be able to try it and I must say the supplier was FANTASTIC (the unusual UPS to USPS shipping method sent it to the east coast first when I am in Alaska - weird - but the supplier helped me and went out of her way to make sure I got it! That is customer service!) The \\&quot;shampoo/conditioner\\&quot; for my hair, which is fine and thick, made my hair a bit too soft and fly away; the texture balm calmed it down. If your hair is normal or coarse it would work better. I find that I do not need to use as much as is recommended -- it does feel divine on my hair in the shower! I am glad that I tried it in this way and would recommend anyone who is curious about the Wen system to try it first before they order it with the automatic shipment requirement directly from Wen.</li>
            <li> THESE WEN HAIR CARE PRODUCTS ARE THE ABSOLUTELY BEST THAT I HAVE EVER USED. MY HAIR IS HIGHLIGHTED AND BLEACHED AND THE SHINE LEFT AFTER USING THE SHAMPOO AND THEN THE MASK INTENSIVE TREATMENT WAS UNBELIEVABLE ! I DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT TO SHAMPOO MY HAIR WITHOUT THEM.</li>
            <li> This is not for me, Im almost done with the bottle and I&#x27;ve yet to see a change. I don&#x27;t normally have lost of time to do my hair and was hoping this would help save some time... not the case. My hair still gets tons of friz and hadly any control.</li>
            <li> The comb and the deep hair repair are my favorite parts. I was unfortunately hoping for a miracle for my flyaway hair and while it did help, it didnt give me the SHINE I wanted - which is the real reason I&#x27;ve been shopping around for new hair products. Smells ok, not really into mint hair stuff though. I wouldnt spend the money again.</li>
            <li> I have found that I need to use a regular shampoo/conditioner about once a week because my hair feels a little too oily. I do like the other products that come with the shampoo too! I will continue to purchase the WEN shampoo and use it.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product through Amazon due to I only wanted to try it without the automatic order fulfillment Wen currently does with their customers. I realize it is pushed as a \\&quot;convenience\\&quot; but how convenient is it when you are only interested in trying the product? You should let any and all potential buyers of this product know they will be subject to the same regulations Wen places on those who buy directly from them.</li>
            <li> I experienced excellent customer service.  After reading the nightmare stories about trying to cancel the product, I was loaded for bear when I called.  I was totally surprised to experience just the opposite of nightmare.  The agent handled my request efficiently and pleasantly.  I&#x27;ll definitely do business again w/ them</li>
            <li> This product really does work!! :) I have naturally curly hair and when I got a little older my thyroid straightened the crap out of my natural curl. It was no longer healthy, but it was dry and had split ends and was extremely damaged.  I was devastated. My hair stylist and I did everything we could do. I would buy expensive protein conditioners, but nothing was helping. I saw the commercial for the Wen but like most things you see on t.v. they are  &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34;. But my hair stylist wanted to see if it worked. She ordered some and had me try it. Within a few weeks, my hair had natural curl back. It&#x27;s taken me about 4 months to get it back to it&#x27;s full natural curl state, but after I had been using the product for about 3 weeks I could wear my hair curly. It really was such a miracle!!!! I really would recommend this product. It&#x27;s a good started kit if you are not sure it will work for you. It&#x27;s a good price as well. I really would recommend it! I use nothing else!</li>
            <li> This product is really not for my hair texture. I can only say that it didn&#x27;t work for me. Can&#x27;t speak for anyone else.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from an info-mercial and absolutely love it.  My hair was so dry and nothing seemed to help.  I ordered WEN and saw a difference.  I love the Cleansing Conditioner, Re-Moist Intensive Hair Treatment, and the comb.  I recently canceled future orders (because of the price) and changed my hair-care regimen to get the same effect.</li>
            <li> I received what was left of a bottle my grandmother had purchased. I am completely in love! It does take a bit longer to use than normal shampoo. I have very thick, course, straight, and dry auburn hair. My hair looks silky and sleek every time I use it. If I flip my hair it is typically in tangles, but with WEN it&#x27;s like I have someone else hair on my head. I LOVE IT. I will tell you a few things. #1 You have to research your hair type to find the write one for you. #2 Anytime you sign up for an auto ship it&#x27;s really difficult to cancel. This is why I purchase from AMAZON or directly from Chaz Dean&#x27;s site. #2 this is a good shampoo to use only a few days a week and then alternate with another normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> Well i heard about this product and decided to try it and i was very pleased with it, great for the hair and reasonably priced and i dont have auto shipments, yea!!!  would definately buy again</li>
            <li> Maybe I just didn&#x27;t give it enough time, but I think Wen is just ok...&lt;br /&gt;I felt like by the end of the first week my head was itchy &amp; didn&#x27;t really smell all that great (it didn&#x27;t stink, just didn&#x27;t smell fresh &amp; clean).</li>
            <li> Through Wen&#x27;s website when you purchase at $29.95 it automatically enrolls you to receive more each month at $29.95 + $7.95 S&amp;H; for someone like me who forgets to cancel those kinds of programs and get a surprise charge to my credit card, it&#x27;s worth the extra $20 to try it out the first time.</li>
            <li> I used this and saw results immediately. I followed directions in guide,and the end result was super soft hair with tons of volume. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, expecting it to work! Unfortunately it was HORRIBLE! But sometimes things don&#x27;t work for everyone, so I gave it to my sister, and unfortunately she hated it also!! It is very drying, and leaves your hair EXTREMELY DULL and Feeling Like you need intensive hair repair! the re-moist mask intensive hair treatment was intensive hair destruction disaster! I will never buy this product again, and will discourage everyone I Love and care about not to waste their time nor money! PATHETIC AND DISGUSTING, THE ONLY THING WORTH HAVING IS THE COMB! I Wonder do the people who advertise using this really use it? GOOD RIDDENS</li>
            <li> This product does not perform as claimed. After a couple of weeks my hair was greasy and unmanageable. Hard to imagine whose hair this works with. Also, far too expensive for what it is!!</li>
            <li> Followed the directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and used the styling products. After giving this a go for 8 days i had given up. My hair did have twice the volume but that was mostly because my natural curls were frizzing up and my hair was drying out. I also had to give up because one bottle is only enough for 8 days when you have long hair. (just past my shoulder blades.) I would never recommend this to a friend and i have nothing good to say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Some how I got suckered in to trying this again! I&#x27;m done trying now after going through another bottle in half the recommended time. Same story, my natural curls started to frizz up and my hair and scalp dried up. 4 days back on my Organix Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner and my hair and scalp are healthy again.</li>
            <li> Wen products are all they advertised them to be, my hair is natural curly and has always been dry and hard to manage.  Love the Wen products, my hair is soft and much easier to deal with than before. My adult girls talked me into using Wen and I&#x27;m glad I took their advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Bev</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with, ever! They take your money; if you do not like the product, they remain to take out \\&quot;39.99\\&quot; every month. I had to file a law suit in order to stop them from taking my money. I was bring my lawsuit forward, and had a bad review written by a reporter friend; than they gave me back some of my money. They still owe me about 70 bucks. \\&quot;Guthy Renker\\&quot; is the company that takes money and will not give it back; and when you call Chaz he does nothing! DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is good in cleansing my curly hair as well as not hindering my curl pattern. However,once I use the shampoo and conditioner my hair still is very dry. I find I must put something in my hair to soften and moisturize my very curly ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I saw this infommercial at 3 am and thought this would be a great system for my wavy but unruly hair. I ordered this system and after the first time I tried it, I gave it to my sister who also hated it and then we sent it back to the company. It did absolutely nothing for my hair. As a matter of fact, the intensive hair treatment left a nasty film on my hair and I only left it on for 20 minutes...and they say you can leave it on overnight! If I did that, I don&#x27;t know how long it would&#x27;ve took to rinse it out of my hair. I can&#x27;t believe all the hype surrounding Wen products. What a joke!!</li>
            <li> As of today 1/25/12 I have not received the product. I do not know what else to say. I hope to receive it soon since it has been paid for.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to store bought shampoo! Try this once and you will see how great it works!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I love the way the products work on my hair. The customer service when I call is fantastic. My issue is with the website and any email contact I have with the company. Every email I have sent has resulted in a form letter that has NOTHING to do with my question. The website does NOT list all of their products and I&#x27;m forced to call and have someone read off a list of products. This is very similar to a waiter reading a list of 10 specials, I&#x27;m not going to remember all of them and I&#x27;m forced to waste my time and theirs asking a million questions that could be answered if they took the 10 minutes to put the script on the website next to a picture of the product. I&#x27;m getting more and more frustrated with this company.</li>
            <li> Wen haircare made my hair limp and greasy. After a few weeks of using it I started noticing dandruff. I&#x27;ve never had dandruff in my life! Customer service  is horrible with helping you cancel and get refunded! I&#x27;ve gone back to my shampoo. Do not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this about a month ago and have yet to reciece it nor any info on how to recieve my money back.  I think AMAZON has put this all on the MOM &amp; TOT SHOP but if they aren&#x27;t going to refund my money or at least contact me then Amazon should do something.  I AM SO VERY UNHAPPY~</li>
            <li> I think I must be sensitive to the ingredients.  My head broke out in an itchy rash and my hair was very dry.  Tried this product after a raving review from my mom.  So it just goes to show - you should always try new things because what works for you may not work for someone else and vice versa.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for just over a month now. I absolutely love it!! My hair had been feeling limp and fine for the last several years and now it is full and has amazing body! I love the feel and the fact that it is now shinny and easy to control. I have learned that the intensive repair should be used in small amounts and no more that every other week or hair will feel greasy. I have found that the conitioner/ cleanser works very well all alone!!  I will continue to use Wen as long as I am able to get it!!!</li>
            <li> A couple of girls at work talked me into it.  Their hair looks great, like movie stars.  Mine, not so much.</li>
            <li> I have naturally blonde, naturally wavy, VERY thick and VERY long hair.  My hair is down to my waist, is very hard to deal with and I have cowlicks every wich way!  Oh, I also live in a very dry climate (in the desert).  So, it&#x27;s really hard to find a product that works well with my crazy hair!  I have used Wen and seriously didn&#x27;t have high hopes because I have found so many bad products out there.  Partly, because I really do have pretty  unmanageable hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have to say that this product was great!  I was not able to comb through my hair as easily as the infomercial showed, yeah they would never dare have someone with my kind of hair as their hair model!  Instead, I used a brush, which worked better than my attempt with the wide tooth comb.  My hair was really soft, fell nicely in place and didn&#x27;t seem to tangle nearly as much as when I used other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of suggestions for Sally&#x27;s \\&quot;Hair One\\&quot;, but it is not nearly as nice as Wen.  Sure, it&#x27;s cheaper and I do use it once in a while, but it does not work nearly as well as Wen.  My two biggest complaints with this product are: it is very expensive and you can&#x27;t buy it in stores.  I would give it 5 stars if it was more reasonably priced.  Other than that, I do like this product a lot!</li>
            <li> I just finished my bottle and I am still waiting to see my hair shine like when I use pantene. What a waste of money, way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have the world&#x27;s frizziest hair.  There is no such thing as wash and go hair in my vocabulary.  When I read all the wonders WEN had to offer I was automatically drawn to it.  I excitedly ordered it and eagerly awaited it.  Finally it came and I was so excited to try it!  For some reason or another I wasn&#x27;t able to start it until 2 weeks after I got it.  After the first use I realized it was crap!  My hair looked greasy as soon as it dried and worse yet, it was frizzy and greasy.  I know I couldn&#x27;t give up after one try so I hung in there for a month until I finished the bottle.  I hated how my hair looked every single time!  I really tried to hang in there hoping that with time, more use, more pumps, something would change but it never did.  Finally after I finished the bottle I used my old humectress and my hair is finally clean and not greasy looking.  Knowing full well that I am already outside of the 30-day trial period, I still want to send it back with a letter telling them that I am not interested in a refund but I want them to know their product is crap anyways!!</li>
            <li> I got sucked in with the incessant infomercials.  How I wish I could take back that decision to buy this scam of a product.  If I had looked more closely, I would see that 1) All the \\&quot;after\\&quot; photos have hair that is cut and curled so it&#x27;s not a fair comparison to the \\&quot;before\\&quot; photos and 2) the Black person on the infomercial is mixed heritage and does not have traditional Black hair.  I used this product ONE time and that was one time too many.  My hair was dry, brittle, hard.  Just gross all the way around.  I just sent back the product to meet the 60-day guarantee window, and I will have to do a lot of reconstruction on my hair to get it back healthy.  In just one week, I feel like months of progress have been compromised by using this Wen nonsenese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not for traditional Black hair.  It&#x27;s just not.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try WEN for several years and I finally did.  I have long, curly hair that has frizz.  I just want my hair to look shiny with the natural curl and controlled frizz.  I was so excited to finally be able to try WEN and ended up being very disappointed.  I did not like it at all!!  It made my hair feel greasy and dirty and I have dry hair because it is naturally curly.  I tried it about 3 times to give it a chance and that was enough for me.  I gave it to my daughter and her friend tried it and she had the same opinion that I did.  This product does not do what the infomercial said but I am so desperate to find a product that will work -- I tried it.  I have tried many products for my curly hair and this is the worse one yet!!</li>
            <li> Upon initial use, made my hair beautiful, soft and manageable. But very time consuming. After using a few more times made my hair oily and heavy. Returned to regular shanpoo use, now my hair has kept the soft, and manageable style for weeks without the Wen products.</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS PRODUCT, IT REALLY DID MAKE MY HAIR FEEL SOFT, LIKE IT NEVER HAS. BUT THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT I HAVE LONG THICK HAIR AND EVEN THOUGH I ONLY WASH MY HAIR EVERY OTHER DAY, THE MONTH SUPPLY ONLY LASTED ME A LITTLE OVER A WEEK USING THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT.SO I WILL USE THIS PRODUCT WHEN MY HAIR BECOMES EXTREMELY DRY AGAIN, BUT WILL STICK WITH MY REGULAR SHAMPOO IN THE MEAN TIME BECAUSE IT CANT AFFORD TO BUY 4 BOTTLES A MONTH!</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that I did not like the products, I feel very strongly that the company is trying to take advantage of customers. You know the deals where you order a product and then if YOU don&#x27;t cancel in the appropriate time period, you are automatically enrolled in their membership program? This is one of those. If you aren&#x27;t on your toes and paying attention, be prepared to pay a LOT for this product. I received erroneous information from an associate at the Wen organization and have found myself obligated to pay approximately $100 for what they call a three month supply. The charges kept coming, the refund has never been given and I&#x27;m out over $100 for something I didn&#x27;t even like. I returned the first box but because I did not return (and pay postage) for the second unwanted box in time, my membership was set in stone. I have spoken to three people at the organization and nothing has been resolved. Because I do not want them to ding my credit rating - I gave up and paid the money. I do NOT recommend the product. If you try it - pay attention!!! Read all the literature!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product online on the WEN website, thinking it was like any other online purchase. However it was not - somewhere in the \\&quot;terms and conditions\\&quot; everyone checks off on, i apparently agreed for them to send me continuous packages and be charged. When I called to complain they of course said that I had agreed to this, which I suppose is true. But why would I assume that that&#x27;s what I was signing up for. Does any other company do that? If you were you to order mascara from Sephora.com, would Sephora continuously charge you and send you multiple packages? I don&#x27;t think so. It is not a normal business practice. When I called to voice a complaint regarding this poor corporate practice, I was rudely spoken to by a supervisor named Rachel who was condescending, sarcastic, and unhelpful. Oh and by the way...the product stinks! DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> Product worked okay, however was signed up with WEN for autoshipments even though the detail on this product stated that you would not be joining any memebership.  Had to call to cancel. Crossing my fingers that no auto ship will happen and my card will not be charged.</li>
            <li> Absolute worst customer service. The staff do not know their products and they all say something different about their guarantee. I would highly recommend NOT using their products or services. The only reason I did was because a good friend of mine did Chaz&#x27; first infomercial so I gave it a try. The worst experience ever! Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of a infomercial I saw on tv. It did make my hair soft, shiny and easy to brush through. I like the smell and i like how you only need to use one product in the shower. Unfortunately, I have long, straight, oily hair and this product did not make my hair feel clean. It felt dirty within a few hours and it was very flat. I do still use the hair mask once in a while and I am pleased with the results. I can tell that it has made my hair stronger and less frizzy. I will not be buying the cleanser again, simply because it does not work well for me.</li>
            <li> disappointed I have to say I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.  My hair was no different then when I use Pantene.  I&#x27;m just glad I used a gift card to purchase this and didn&#x27;t waste my money.  I had high hopes and even made sure I used a lot in my hair.  I used almost the whole bottle, thinking it would get better the more I used it but it was no better.</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS PRODUCT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT IS HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;MY SKIN GOT IRRITATED BY THE PRODUCT AND UNFORTUNATELY I HAD TO FIGHT WITH ALL THE REDNESS AND ITCHINESS WHERE THE PRODUCT TOUCHED MY SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THE STAFF MEMBERS ARE NOT POLITE AND NOT PROFESSIONAL.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NEVER EVER USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I thought Wen products were amazing when I first started to use it. My hair looked beautiful and shiny, and I already had really great hair. About a 3-4 weeks into using the product, I noticed clumps and clumps of hair clogging the drain. The same thing happened to my mother, who started using it a few days after me (I used the almond one and used the cucumber one). We&#x27;re both white, she&#x27;s a brunette and I&#x27;m a redhead.  She and I have very different hair types as well.  We don&#x27;t live together, have different diets. etc. Wen is what we had in common.  I lost about 1/3 the thickness of my hair; I was devastated. I was left with this halo-like effect around my head from the short strands of hair left behind from the rest of my hair breaking off. I quit using it and though my hair stopped falling out, my hair is not the same. Ever after 8 months after not using Wen my hair was not as vibrant and strong as it used to be.  After using hair vitamins and some oil treatments, I&#x27;ve got my shine back, but my hair is still not as strong as it used to be.  When I part my hair, I still have the halo affect of short strands of hair sticking up and they&#x27;re not new hair, it&#x27;s hair that&#x27;s still breaking off.  I used to be able to floss with my hair - no joke! Now, it snaps at the lightest pull. Tons of flyaways, even though I used to have very smooth hair. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did. I don&#x27;t know how the effects could last so long, but they have. I&#x27;ve gotten blood tests to rule out thyroid and hormone problems, and I am healthy, not pregnant, etc. It&#x27;s too much of a coincidence and I have seen from other customer reviews on the web that this same thing has happened to other people.</li>
            <li> Love these products! They really make my hair nice,soft and moisturized.My only complain are the sizes of conditioner and hair treatment,wish they were bigger.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy/curly Caucasian hair, so I was hoping that Wen would be the answer to my frizz issues.  The cleansing conditioner feels wonderful, it is very thick and creamy.  The problem is that no matter how much or how little I tried using, it didn&#x27;t do anything good for my hair.  After Wen, it was actually a bit frizzier! The other problem is that you are supposed to use so much of it that the bottle that comes in the kit (I think it&#x27;s 12oz) lasted me 2 weeks.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t afford to spend that kind of money on daily hair care...especially since it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair!  Sorry Wen!</li>
            <li> I was not too impressed with the cleansing conditioner as a shampoo. While it did condition my hair and made it easier to comb out, my hair and scalp always felt unclean before the end of the day.  I normall shampoo every other day, but with this product I could not skip a day.</li>
            <li> So I have been using Wen for a week now and I am not seeing the results I hoped for. I thought for this price it had to be good, but Im disappointed. A lot of people have talked about their hair feeling greasy, but mine feels more waxy....hard to explain. You cant tell just by looking but I can feel it. I have very long curly hair and I live in FL so frizz and humidity is my biggest problem. This product has not helped with the frizz, maybe even made it a little worse. I am going to use up everything I have but I dont think that I will continue getting it. I might also try Hair One bc its less expensive. I just cant justify spending so much on something that really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. I also thought perhaps this hair care is designed more for people who really style their hair like straighten or blow dry it, but I just air dry my hair so I thought that might make a difference bc all the &#x27;Wen Girls\\&quot; are deff being styled by Chaz. Overall not worth it for me anyway. Hopefully it will get better by the time I finish the bottle, but that will probably be very soon since you have to use so much in one shower! It feels like its such a waste, but I wanted to make sure I am doing it right to get the best results! If you are going to try this I suggest doing it through Chaz Deans website bc then you can get your money back!</li>
            <li> You better hope you LOVE the product, because if you ever try to cancel your membership, you&#x27;re hooped. I&#x27;ve called and cancelled more than once, but of course they have no record of my call. I&#x27;ve sent product back - more keeps coming. I settled my account, called and confirmed that it was settled and they would not send me any more products or bills - and then I receive another \\&quot;past due\\&quot; notice. Who knows if this is affecting my credit. The product itself isn&#x27;t terrible - I simply had way too much of it and wanted to cancel my membership until I needed more. But I will never, ever, buy any products from this company again. And I would advise everyone else out there to do the same. Unless you want to be forced to pay for hundreds of dollars of product that you don&#x27;t even want, and thats definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on line and after one shipment, I found my credit card had a $106.00 balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as it turns out, after the first shipment, they send you 3 MONTHS of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;believe me, if that was on the order page, it was not easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now I have to pay for return shipping because it is in process - even though it has not actually shipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;read the fine print before you order this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and my hair does not look any different.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I thought since I ordered thru amazon that I would be avoiding the continuing orders. I had to call the company and cancel future deliveries. It is a very good product though. Works wonders on damaged hair.....thick/thin. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to try this product, it looked promising. I liked the things it came with the balm, comb, hair treatment. It smells really nice. I used as directed, left on as long as possible. I tried it out the first week i did notice my hair shiny BUT it also made my hair super puffy. I have alot of hair and it gave my hair volume that it just does not need. The worst part of it is it gave me BAD dandruff. It was very noticeable my family commented on it asking me what happened to my hair. I literally had patches of dandruff on my scalp on my forehead! I immediatley stopped using it and went back to my good ol&#x27; reliable shapmoo and conditioner. Felt my hair and scalp squeaky clean soon after. Sorry wen but you did not work for me...</li>
            <li> Great if you like your hair feeling dirty and greasy all day long...don&#x27;t bother, just another late night commercial scam packed nice but product s^&amp;t!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!!  Those people who are having a hard time with it making their hair feel dirty are using it wrong because this stuff is awesome.  I saw a difference after the first time using it and more people have commented on my hair in the last week than ever before!!  I ordered mine from QVC</li>
            <li> This is a nice set. Comes with the comb that actually does make a difference. I don&#x27;t really use the &amp;#34;Stick&amp;#34; balm but the other three products work beautifully. I&#x27;m a believer in the WEN products. Actually does what it says will do. I sometimes use an off brand basic shampoo just to &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean once a week or so. But indeed the products are awesome!  I have used four &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; the Sweet Almond Mint is my favorite as my hair responds best to this particular formula. I have normal hair that has become more &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; as I&#x27;ve gotten into my 50&#x27;s. WEN sure does help!</li>
            <li> I liked this product, altho not enough to spend the money on it again but it does what it claims to do, nice soft hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for about 1 week now. I have fine and oily hair and also exercise regularly so its important for my hair to look and feel clean however Wen doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel clean. I scrub my scalp as instructed however it doesn&#x27;t feel clean and by the end of the day it looks matted and oily. I like that moisturizes my hair deeply. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this hydrated in a long time but its come at a cost. I will continue to use it and see if it gets better I will probably not order it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN Hair care products for over a year now and my hair has never been in better condition and it&#x27;s grown about 6 inches! No Lie. I only wish I had before &amp; after pictures to show. At first, I was skeptical because I always thought you HAD to shampoo to get your hair &amp; scalp really clean. But with WEN, not only is my hair &amp; scalp super clean I can blow dry it without all the frizzy dryness I got with shampoo. I have used the Fig &amp; The Lavender and Now Sweet Almont Mint. These products last a long time. Definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> After watching all of the commercials i was excited to try wen so I Ordered the starter kit... Upon trying it the first time i thought it smelled great and my hair was shiny and smelled good. Though after using it a week i realized that it was just way too heavy for my hair type so i decided to CXL my subscription... Now if it wasn&#x27;t bad enough that i had to spend an hour doing a run around with Clueless customer service because they couldn&#x27;t find my account (even though they had billed my credit card?!?) they also kept disconnecting me and i had to keep calling back.... Than i also still had a bunch of product left and i dident want to pay more $ for return shipping So i continued to use it But THAN CAME THE BREAK OUTS Yes after using wen My scalp started breaking out in a sort of acne type break out with TON&#x27;S OF ZITS ALL OVER MY SCALP and around my hairline... so i stooped using it. Soon my scalp started to clear up and Than just out of curiosity i Used WEN again just twice and BAM The break out came back...Big painful zit&#x27;s ;(&lt;br /&gt;Now As far as I&#x27;m concerned WEN HAIR CARE IS OVERPRICED &amp; NOTHING MORE THAN GOOD MARKETING.. PERIOD!</li>
            <li> When I used after a shampoo it made your hair nice.  I just tried to use ti alone and it makes your hair feel greasy and gross not clean. It&#x27;s great for people with dry hair will halp damaged hair but I don&#x27;t know about using it on its own. It&#x27;s does make your hair soft but I fopund only after I used regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I pretty much never write reviews, but I have to write one for this stuff because its awesome. My mom randomly sent me this and I was definitely skeptical and wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I am mixed, black and white, so my hair is curly and gets frizzy pretty easily. Usually my hair looks great the day I wash it, and then quickly deteriorates from there. However I&#x27;m on day 4 after washing my hair, and my hair is definitely gotten frizzier, but it still looks really good, especially compared to how it usually is. Usually by this time my hair is in a state of matted frizziness and im usually dreading having to wash it and desperately trying to revive it. Instead, my hair is still soft and most of my ringlets are still intact! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I&#x27;ve been applying the texture balm everyday to tame the frizz and it actually helps! I also loved that it was a once-step process in the shower. Usually I wash my hair twice and then condition it, so to have one step do all 3 steps and BETTER is wonderful. I&#x27;m really hoping it keeps working this well and the effects don&#x27;t fade like with other hair products because this stuff is BOMB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do think it depends on your hair type. It&#x27;s definitely a lot of moisture, which my hair needs because it&#x27;s so thick and curly. But I can understand if you have straight and/or thinner hair how this stuff might weigh your hair down and make it seem oily/dirty. But for those blessed with crazy curls, I definitely recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> All products were delivered quickly. It works as advertised. Like this one a lot, but still partial to the lavender one.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I got out of this was a comb and the texturizing balm. The more I cleansed my hair (I don&#x27;t want to say shampooed as this is not shampoo) the worse it looked.  It was dull,filmy, and I could not style it. For the price I really expected more.  I followed the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and still my hair looked lousy.  I used it for 8 weeks thinking this would be a good test, but this stuff just doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard!  The product bottle is hard to use, the pump didn&#x27;t always work, and it was slippery to use. I have nothing to say except, don&#x27;t waste your money.  I didn&#x27;t return it, I&#x27;ll just have to suck up the monetary loss.  It did have a nice fragrance however!</li>
            <li> This product is set for auto-renewal.  If you purchase the first month they bill you for the next 2 months with no notice.  I ordered once, and received a bill for over $100!! Not to mention, this product is awful!!  It makes your hair greasy and burns your scalp.  It gives the appearance that you haven&#x27;t showered for days, right after use. If I could report to the better business bureau, I would.</li>
            <li> I just loved the product.&lt;br /&gt;I only use a small amount and my my colored hair combs out smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;No heavy greasy feel or look.</li>
            <li> I received the Wen sweet almond 5 piece kit as a mother&#x27;s day gift.  I had used the styling creme and loved it.  I started using the cleansing conditioner, and was disappointed in the results.  I used for 4 or 5 cleanings.  My hair was flat and not manageable.  I have short, curly,color treated hair. It did feel very soft, but I decided to go back to using my regular, sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  I still like the styling creme and will probably order that.</li>
            <li> This is a great package to buy if you want to try the WEN product line, however, they are samples and not the full size versions.  I use WEN products everyday on my hair and I love it.  All the products are great and my hair is always soft, manageable, and my color last longer.  When you get your package the shipping invoice indicates that you are enrolled in an auto-shipment program, but you are not.  Don&#x27;t worry about that.  Somehow the seller works it out so you will get the package directly from WEN so it appears as if you are enrolled.  This was confusing for me but the seller contacted me via email and explained it.  I recommend that the seller indicate this somewhere on their page that the buyer will get an invoice that appears to be a auto-shipment but it is not.</li>
            <li> First things first. I ordered this particular item combo because it says in caps: NO AUTO SHIP, ONE TIME SHIPMENT! I repeat, I ONLY ordered it because that is what it said on the description. When I opened the invoice, what do I see? You will be getting your next shipment in July!\\&quot;\\&quot; I called the number to cancel the auto ship and I had to spend 5 minutes telling the rep that I didn&#x27;t want auto ship and I also didn&#x27;t want my account \\&quot;frozen\\&quot; until november. I was very unhappy with having to call and go through all of that and I&#x27;m wondering if they will send another shipment next month anyway... If I based this review on that alone, I&#x27;d give one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product was pretty good. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t clean very well but it does. The cleanser smells really good and feels good on your hands-not slimey. The only negative was that it makes for a very long shower. Next time I&#x27;m going to try turning off the water during the first step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they truly fix the auto ship deception, I will probably purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> No matter how you order this product it seems they will use your payment info to set up auto payments, regardless.  I ordered through Amazon so that I could try it and not be set up on auto pay and to my surprise when I received the package, there was autoship information in it!  When I called the 800 number to make sure that I hadn&#x27;t been enrolled, since it was NEVER authorized by me, I found that I had been.  Not only had an account been set up in my name, with my payment information, but all of the contact information as far as phone number and email had been made up.  We should all be very leary about a product that goes through a business run this way.  This is a huge scam and that must be why it&#x27;s not sold in stores. Had I not called when I received it, I wouldn&#x27;t have known until I had a bigger headache down the road.  I have not tried the product yet, but after being rubbed the wrong way, even if I liked it, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the product. I did not feel there was any difference between my regular salon products and this product. It is also difficult to rinse out. I ended up only using a fraction of the recommended amount of product and still had difficulty rinsing it out. I had to be very careful or it would leave my fine hair very greasy. If you want to try the product, make sure you order it where you do not get automatically added to \\&quot;auto ship\\&quot;. That was also a nightmare.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing this product on TV advertising for like...MONTHS. And I decided to order it. Before I did, I went on the website, read about it and so forth and so on. What I really liked about it are the amount of natural products used. I am mixed with Carib and my hair can be a struggle sometimes especially when it comes to washing. My head is small but I have SO MUCH HAIR!! So yea I went ahead and ordered the product. Somehow I never agreed with this auto shipment thing so I kind of rigged it? By that I mean I never really registered on the website. I just went straight into ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CON: It took almost a month and a half before I could get the product. Soo basically it came when I had already given up hope and was about to get on dirty with the company to return my money. [I don&#x27;t live in the US of A btw] But when I did finally get it, the bottles were a lot smaller than what I expected. And the comb is a killer to my scalp. It is mega heavy and with my slim hands that just does not work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PROS: I will admit that the conditioner was a bit thick but nothing that would turn me off. I like the fact that there was no foaming, because then I got the chance to actually handle my massive mound properly and gave it a good wash. I added the one in the round flat bottle after i had rinsed my hair and decided to let it dry. When I was ready to comb my hair I noticed a difference IMMEDIATELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW / WHY? My hair was looked and felt thicker and it&#x27;s like all my \\&quot;straightened\\&quot; ends just disappeared. It was like this thing put back my hair to it&#x27;s natural state. ** Whenever I go to the hairdresser to blow dry/flat iron my hair my ends take MONTHS almost a YEAR before they go back natural*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION\\&quot; [HAHA] So what I&#x27;m saying is, this product I completely dig. BUT this is a one month review, I haven&#x27;t washed my hair again yet but my hair feels soft and still feels and looks thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soo FOR ME THIS WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the wen hair care system after seeing an informercial.  It ruined my hair! I followed the instructions 100 percent and my hair has never been more dry.  The worst part is I purchased it off the WEN website and made sure to not check off the box for \\&quot;auto order\\&quot; however, i still received new shipments at my door.  WEN customer service is rude and unhelpful when you call.  DO NOT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TO RUIN YOUR HAIR!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is great ! I noticed a difference in my hair especially the frizz the first time I used it . Im looking forward to washing my hair with wen soon. Im anticipating improvement to healthy hair. thankyou</li>
            <li> I have really thick and coarse hair that is naturally curly.  This product works well to weigh it down, but I am noticing that every 3rd or 4th time I wash it, I need to use a clarifying shampoo and conditioner.  Love the scent of it and everything it does to make my hair less frizzy....but wouldn&#x27;t recommend to someone with thin hair.....</li>
            <li> If only I could give this product negative stars....I started using Wen at the end of April 2013 and my hair never felt or looked better/thicker/softer. It is now the end of July and I have lost more then 2/3 of my hair. Just started falling out by the handful. There is no medical reason why my hair would be falling out. Loved the extra trips to the docs and the extra money spent there. Then I did an internet search on Wen and hair loss.... Be careful is all I can say about this product. I have yet to find out if going back to a shampoo and hair care line I used before will grow my hair back. If I have to spend the rest of my life wearing hats I will be devastated by this. I have been crying everyday for weeks. What good is softer hair if it ends up all gone? Do an internet search before buying.</li>
            <li> I received breakage using this product...It&#x27;s not made for Africian Americian Hair and I&#x27;m natural...had to go back to weave...</li>
            <li> Pleased with product. Does exactly what it claims. Provides great moisture and I simply love the sweet almond conditioner works well as a pre-poo treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m compelled to write this review so that my fellow shoppers wont fall victims to these scam artists.  The product absolutely sucks.  And to top it all they charge your credit card month after month and would not acknowledge your returns. Stay away from it and do not fall for the commercials or the glitzy pictures.  I lost over $100.00 for a product thats not even worth $10.00.  It is no better than any hair product that you can buy off the shelves in your drugstore or supermarket, only this one is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> If you have already purchased Wen and don&#x27;t like it, before you toss it in the garbage, try using it in conjunction with regular shampoo as a leave-in conditioner.  I used it to cleanse my hair, and after a few times I noticed that my hair felt heavier.  I went back to using regular shampoo, and now use the Wen Cleanser to condition it. That works well for me. Best of luck.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me, I have medium length fine colored hair that tends to get dry and oily. The conditioner helps great with keeping my hair less oily and flaky as long as I wash it at least every other day. I have dark red color in my hair and red fades so quick and it really helps keep the color longer. The re-moisture intensive hair cream is my favorite part because it just makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t sleep one night and got sucked in to this infomercial... Could this really be the wonder product for my frizzy, curly hair? After much personal debate I decided to give it a try. The cleansing conditioner has left my hair feeling dirty - don&#x27;t like it. I only tried the Intensive Hair Treatment once and shampooed prior to using it. It did leave my hair very soft, but a poufy mess of undefined curls.  I LOVE the Styling Cr&amp;egrave;me and the Texture Balm! I would reorder both if it weren&#x27;t for the expense and trap awaiting anyone who dares to order from Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where you need to beware! When you order from Wen your visa number is saved and you will automatically be shipped a new supply of product after 30 days or 3 months (depending on what you order). Ouch! Thank goodness I read the fine print in the letter that accompanied my Introductory Kit. I felt like I was 16 again, getting sucked in to one of those music or book club scams. Shame on you Mr. Dean. If you believe in your product so much it might be wiser to give the option of automatically restocking your customers as opposed to forcing it on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more research I&#x27;ve found that the concept of not using traditional shampoo - instead using conditioners or sulfate free cleansers - is not a new one. I liked the idea and have been using other less expensive products (that don&#x27;t put me on their auto ship list) successfully.&lt;br /&gt;Do your research and be aware!!!</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using this for about 30 days and love it.  I just bought more.  My hair has never looked so good.  I do have to say that it did take a little trial and error.  So this is what I have learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Only clean your hair every three days, but I always raise my hair everyday because I workout.&lt;br /&gt;2. Only use a quarter size of the styling cream, otherwise it will be gross&lt;br /&gt;3. Stop aggressively towel drying hair, just blot.  This will stop frizzness&lt;br /&gt;4. You have to use a lot of the conditioner, I have short hair and I use 8 pumps, 3 to the top, 3 to the underside, 2 to the sides.  If you don&#x27;t use enough then your hair will be greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use the hair one, but it was not the same.  It was good , but not s good as the Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for Christmas and I just cleansed my hair with it. Okay, so I was thinking that this was going to weigh my hair down and it was going to be really greasy because it did not lather.  But I was surprised on how well it cleaned my hair.  I live in New Mexico where the weather is very dry.  On top of that we have a water softener, so you can imagine how damaged my hair is.  So after I washed with this it was so soft and shinny, not weigh down or greasy.  It smells so good too.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One down side it that you use so much product that I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, and at $38.00 a pop I don&#x27;t know if I will continue to use it.  I have heard that the hair One at Sally&#x27;s is comparable.  I will try it and see.</li>
            <li> After years of being tempted by the informercials, I asked for and got this as a Christmas present from my husband.  I have blonde highlighted shoulder length light brown hair which is naturally wavy/curly.  My hair is fine, but there&#x27;s a lot of it and tends to be oily at the scalp and dry on the ends.  I have to shampoo everyday.  I noticed since I got my highlights, I&#x27;ve had a lot of strands falling out in the shower and while blowdrying.  I was so excited to try Wen and the first five days I used it, I was disappointed.  My hair felt either greasy or dry.  However, I didn&#x27;t give up and played around with the number of pumps until I found a magic number, which for me is 8-9 pumps.  I use less than the recommended amount and I have to say I love the product now.  My hair is shiny, super soft, and there&#x27;s much less hair loss in the shower and while blowdrying. Today, there were no strands at all in the sink after blowdrying!  I used to use a mousse, frizz control creme (thanks to Florida), and hairspray.  I stopped using the mousse and frizz control creme and now only use the Wen styling creme and it works really well.  No matter how straight I blowdry my hair, Florida&#x27;s humidity wreaks havoc with my curls.  However, now when the humidity hits my hair, it turns into soft curls and waves instead of looking frizzy and out-of-control.  My hair is actually bouncy, which I never thought I could say about it, and way more manageable.  The remoist mask is fantastic as a deep conditioner.  I will say I&#x27;m not crazy about the texture balm because no matter how little I use, it makes my hair feel greasy. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up on it and just ordered the pomegranate cleaning conditioner and can&#x27;t wait to try that formula!!</li>
            <li> DO not buy this product !!!!! It is a cheat !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They told me I can not cancel the first order, but only future orders!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this information is not stated on the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to return it because they are so not confident about their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very bad company, I do not trust at all !!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the product. We have several hair types in our household and it did not seem to work well on any type. I did find it makes a great conditioner to use with a shampoo product. Otherwise, it leaves your hair very greasy and/oil feeling. I followed the instructions word by word, but would not purchase the item again.</li>
            <li> I must first say that I am on my 2nd bottle of Wen, because I originally thought I LOVED this product. However, after about 2 months of use now I am having an issue I haven&#x27;t seen addressed here yet. My scalp!! When I \\&quot;scratch\\&quot; my head, there is residue &amp; skin left in my nails! I have NEVER had any type of problem with dandruff or anything of the nature. But after using this, I am getting CHUNKS &amp; FLAKES of skin in my hair. I have used the included comb to practically scrape off my scalp in the shower, with no sign of any improvement. So, for the last 4 or 5 washings I have used my \\&quot;other\\&quot; shampoo. And what do you know - my scalp looks much, much better (&amp; feels cleaner)! So, I am done with this product. I guess I will use the remainder as a leave-in conditioner, because I will give it credit for that one thing. But I will not be buying again!!</li>
            <li> I bought this from Sephora after one of the employees strongly recommended it for my hair--I used it the next day, and came out of the shower with my hair in knots. I&#x27;ll admit, my hair tangles easily, but it&#x27;s usually nothing that some leave-in conditioner, detangler, and oil can&#x27;t fix. I had my mom, my sister help me try to brush out/undo the knots in my hair for over two hours, and no product or brush would get these quarter-sized tangles in my hair. I tried undoing it for three days straight--I just had to suck it up and make a hair appointment, where they had to cut through them (including five inches of hair), which I really didn&#x27;t want to do. Not to mention, aside from the knots, it completely dried up my hair...Mrs. Frizzle would&#x27;ve been envious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUCH a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have a bi-racial wavy texture (asian/black) and thought that this would tame my dry hair and I prefer to wash and go in the summer. I applied it the way the instructions said and my hair didn&#x27;t look or feel anything like the commercial at all. I ultimately gave it to another family member who styles hair and they didn&#x27;t have good result either.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I never do reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I will now start out by telling you that I DO love wen.  I have baby fine hair, and this stuff made my hair soooooooo bouncy, manageable and healthy.  However, after using for about two months - I started to notice a HUGE amount of my hair falling out!!!! I&#x27;m not talking a the normal ten strands, I&#x27;m talking triple that - and not just when I washed - when I slept - on my shoulders during the day. I finally attributed it to WEN, as NOTHING ELSE in my routine had changed... People said thyroid, this that, but ALL of that was fine.... I did a search and turns out alot of people have this issue!!! It could be an allergy to Menthol - but who knows!!!!!! The good news is after about 4 months after having stopped using wen, my hair stopped falling out... It started growing back, thank god.  Its TOOOOO BADDDDDDDDDD, because Wen realllly works on whatever hair it actually leaves on your head, lol!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Wen Hair system thinking it was going to do wonders for my hair and it did not live up to what they advertise it to be.  PLUS un be knownce to me was by ordering I was then signed up to get monthly shippments of the product.  I did not like that one bit!!!  Amazon should put a disclaimer on this product so that people know when they purchase it that unless you call to tell them you do not want to be in their hair club that you will continue to get monthly shipments of this product.  And believe me it is not cheap!  I got an invoice for $97 for my next box of product.  I immediately called to cancel and now have to spend my money to ship the crap back.  Buyer beware Wen is not all it touts to be.</li>
            <li> Definitely a different way of cleansing your hair and I absolutely love it. I first heard of Wen through one of those beauty guru ladies on YouTube and then my younger sister was buying the product, so then I decided to try it. I&#x27;m overall pleased with Wen and I highly recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on the $29.99 \\&quot;special\\&quot; offer.  Of course I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t read the fine print that they planned to charge me $98 dollars per month for the rest of eternity and send more of their horrible product. When I called to complain, the customer service person was very rude, stating, \\&quot;Well, some people just don&#x27;t read now, do they?\\&quot;  OK, admittedly, I did not read the fine print but that does not mean I have to like their sneaky business practices.  On top of that the product is horrible. I have fine hair and it leaves it a greasy, limp mess - almost like it looks wet. I am very unhappy with both the products and the business practices of this company. I highly discourage anyone from using it.</li>
            <li> I would not waste the money or the effort buying this product.  I ordered it thinking it would solve my hair issues being that I have thick wavy hair.  I followed the instructions and even putting it on at the beginning of my shower and not rinsing it out till the end because they say on the commercials the longer it is on the better.  Well my hair ended up looking greasy at the roots and the rest of the 3/4 of my hair looked dry and frizzy.  Worse than if I had just used regular shampoo.  So I called up to cancel my order the guy said thats fine and he would change my frequency to 6 mos so that I would not get charged again before my account cancellation was finalized.  So I thought great this is getting taken care of so easily and not like the horror stories I was finally reading when I decided to cancel and I sent back the remainder of my original products.  Well it has now been 6 months and I just got charged again.  I called up and the guy originally told me that I didn&#x27;t cancel my account I just changed the frequency to 6 months.  I said no and told him what happened and how I shipped my old product back and then he says oh yeah I do actually see that in your account now.  So now he said that my account is being cancelled and that I will receive my refund in 3 to 5 business days, but they already sent out another shipment so I am going to have to send that back as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do order this product I really hope that you have the right hair conditions where it will work for you otherwise good luck trying to cancel.  I wish I went online to read the reviews before I ordered it instead of when I wanted to cancel it, or so I thought, the first time.</li>
            <li> I received this kit a few days ago and used it today. I&#x27;m very impressed with the results. My hair is a lot softer and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be as dry as it was before but lets continue to wait and see. :) Thanks Wen.</li>
            <li> I have read some of these reviewes, especial all the negative ones. Apparently they didn&#x27;t use this product correctly, I have used this product for three years &amp;&amp; let me tell yhu it works beautifully. My hair is more fuller than usual, even as wavy. I haven&#x27;t had my hair wavy since I was an infant, I appreciate what ths product has done for me &amp;&amp; that&#x27;s bringing life back into my hair!!</li>
            <li> Hair feels good after using this product but it also weighs the hair down and makes it hard to style. Hard to get used to \\&quot;no suds\\&quot; product. Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product through Wen website. BIG MISTAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself made my hair look very thick and greasy. I have very long semi thick wavy/frizzy hair and i can honestly say at first I was impressed. BUT after only a day, my hair would look dirty and oily. I figured maybe i should give it a few more tries before quitting on it.. well guess what?, it didnt work. my scalp felt a bit dirty even after a very thorough wash. After only a day, my scalp would get a bit itchy and my hair looked and felt dirty once again. Wen did absolutely nothing for me. I hate it and its way too pricey if ya ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH AND, Did I mention i bought my product through the website? I called to cancel my subscription well before my 30 day trial and they assured me I wouldn&#x27;t be charged anymore; even gave me a confirmation number. WELL about a week later, my account was debited about 39$. when i called to complain they said i called too late and the shipment was already in process. WTF?! \\&quot;my shipment\\&quot; didnt even arrive for another few weeks, way past my 30 day trial. keep in mind, i would eventually have to pay about 100$ on two bottles that surely wont last me but 2  months because i said my hair is very long.Anyway, I told them i wanted my money back and they asked me to return the product and it would take 1 to 3 months for my refund to process. WOW NEVER doing that again. All in all, definitely NOT worth my money. BOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! had to give them 1 star because 0 wasnt an option.</li>
            <li> I received the shipment yesterday and tried the Sweet Almond Conditioner right away. I LOVE how it made my hair feel right away! No tangles at all (my hair is long and fine and tangels very easily).&lt;br /&gt;After I dried my hair sleek and shiny and manageable (no poofiness). I cannot stop touching my hair - it is so soft! Very happy I tried this. I haven&#x27;t used the rest of the products yet, but I am already very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Wen hair care is a scam ... The product does nothing different than an ordinary conditioner and you have to use a ton of it for every application ... They will also continue to ship and charge you for products even after you cancel your account ... Total scam ... Avoid avoid!</li>
            <li> I really like Wen but, with the economy the way it is I needed a cheaper way to get Wen, so I went to Amazon. I found a cheaper route, thinking it was cheaper, First the bottle was an 12 OZ. not 16 OZ. Second on the ad where I purchased Wen it said 1 time shipment.....Great don&#x27;t have to deal with monthly shipments. Well I get the products and the bill says welcome to Wen your next shipment will be sent out Sept 16 and you will be billed sometime after that.....really what happened to the 1 time shipment. I WILL NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN.... It said 1 time, then I&#x27;m going to get monthly shipments. Boy I guess I really need to talk to someone before believing what they put in their ads....P.S I do love Wen though it has given me my hair back....From flat to full.!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEN!!! The only complaint I have about the retailer that I purchased this from was that they had this listed as a ONE time purchase which was why I used this site to purchase so I wouldn&#x27;t have to continue to be billed for it on an auto pay basis but this was UNTRUE &amp; MISLEADING because I was signed up for automatic recurring shipments and had to actually call the WEN company to cancel. I now purchase my WEN products when I need them thru Sephora where they do NOT auto bill or ship!!!</li>
            <li> Was excited to use the product because my mom was telling me how she loved this product.  I ordered it from amazon but it was sent from a third party.  Once I received it I started using it and everything came which was the starter kit.  I used it for about 2 weeks because thats how long the 16oz bottle lasted because I have a head of hair that is about for 3-4 people.  I felt like it was to much work because you have to wet your hair than put the wen product in your hair starting from the roots down to the ends and then wet again massage into hair really good and than wrap it up and leave in for 3-5 mins.  After that you can rinse it out.  I feel like it is kind of a process to use especially if your in a hurry.  I have very curly hair and I felt that my hair was harder to work with.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again to much work and expensive. [[ASIN:B003PXZI2O WEN BY CHAZ DEAN SWEET ALMOND CONDITONER, STYLING CREME, RE MOIST MASK INTENSIVE HAIR TREATMENT, TEXTURE BALM, WIDE TOOTH SHOWER COMB, 5 PIECE SET, 1 TIME SHIPMENT]]</li>
            <li> Love everything about the Shampoo! instant softness while your washing, the longer it is on the better! I have pretty thick hair I have tried a lot of products from the salon. Then a friend of mine let me use some of her&#x27;s she said she had been using it for 2 years  and liked the results. wow was she right! my daughter even noticed a change in my hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love the product, the information that comes withthe product advises to use Too much product. I  have really long hair I would have ran out in a very short Period of time. I only use 3 pumps of the clensing conditioner each time I wash my hair. I have had my starter kit for a month now, and do not need to reorder at this time, but I do love the product. It is just kinda pricy to be washing all the extra product down the drain if it is not needed. It dosn&#x27;t wiegh my hair down, I have very fine long hair it is hard to find a good product what will not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible system. It is so complicated to use and it made my hair so greasy. They have horrible customer service. I purchased this product and was not told that I had to pay $40 for 3 months. I tried to cancel and after sending back all the product they still kept charging me. This whole thing is a huge sham. I want to warn everyone not to get involved with this company. It is not worth it.</li>
            <li> The wen hair care system really works, at least on my hair. I was sick and in the hospital for over a week my hair became very dried out and was breaking off and brittle, I thought I would try this product to see if it would help, after trying several other products. The wen almond mint shampoo/cond. worked so well, I also the first night I got it used the re moist sweet almond mint intensive hair treatment, I left that on for several hours for a deep conditioner. I was so happy, my hair was so soft, and much healthier and looked great. I am now stuck loving this product! I won&#x27;t go back to anything else!! It also helps my highlighted hair color stay in longer and looking great!</li>
            <li> If u have watched the infromercials. .. those girls alteady have good hair.look at them.  I purchased the 1 month trial.  Low and behold a chs rge on my card the next month shows up for over 50 dollars.  I called them they told me they would temove fee.  It still had not happenef.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the commerials about the product, I was sure it would be a hit with my hair.. Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;It was just the opposite..</li>
            <li> Hello everyone. When I first used this product-I loved it!! Two months later my hair began shedding and has continued. I was one of the lucky ones who had beautiful dark hair my entire life. Now I have scalp issues, thinning hair and rogaine to look forward to each day. The product clogged and destroyed my hair follicles. Stick with what works...shampoo!! -sorry CHAZ DEAN- your product is garbage and if I can save one person from losing their money, their hair and their self esteem from hair loss then I will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> love the product, leaves  my hair silky, comms down the freezes and my hair is more manageable, my hair feels and looks thicker now,  I&#x27;m not ashamed of the way my hair looks any more,  because of Wen I have more confident in myself because of my  hair is looking more like it did in my younger years, Praise God for small miracles,  I don&#x27;t want to use any other product now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product online because it looked like a wonderful product. I have very frizzy unmanageable hair and was hoping this product would help. Needless to say this product was terrible!! All it did was make my hair incredibly greasy and not to mention doesn&#x27;t smell the best. I used the first bottle sure I would never buy the product again. A few months later they sent me another package I wrote return to sender and sent it back. A month later the same thing. Only this time after I sent it back I called and told them I no longer wanted the product. I kept getting bills in the mail. I called again and told them I didn&#x27;t want their product. Today I got a bill from a collection agency saying I owe 100.00 for a product I neither wanted nor used. I called and asked why I should pay and the very rude woman told me eben though the product was returned I still owe. Are you kidding me!!!??? This product is terrible and they screw you. Don&#x27;t Buy!!!!</li>
            <li> The first couple of weeks I used this stuff, my hair was so soft! But then, it started getting really greasy and it made my hair go limp and stringy! This was not good considering I naturally have thick hair. I had to wash with regular shampoo a few times just to get my hair back to normal. It was a good try at it, but I won&#x27;t be buying this product anymore.</li>
            <li> For the first few months it was great! Kept my color longer and made my hair feel great. However, that only lasted for about 4months. Then it started to weigh my hair down, then dried out my scalp, then dried out my hair. This happened slowly over the next 5 months. After my scalp became ridiculously itchy I stopped using it. That wasn&#x27;t the worst part, I have not been using it for 5 months now and my hair has just started to really get its life back. After some serious conditioning work. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I have always had very strong thick healthy hair, that I am just starting to see again for the first time in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally their customer service is awful when you do decide you no longer want to use their product.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Even use it on my grand children&#x27;s long hair and now their Mom wants to too!  Love the smell of it too.</li>
            <li> After using Wen for a abt. a week (during which I was very happy with the product) my hair lost it&#x27;s bounce - felt weighed down and greasy - it literally started sticking to face.  YUCK.  I have wavy dry hair / frizzy and this product was supposed eliminate all my issues.  NOT  Do NOT waste your money!!</li>
            <li> this is a legitimate wen, I bought another wen from another seller and it turned out to be counterfeit. but this one is the real thing because it comes with a wen booklet, i was pleased with this order ... it made my hair so silky soft, and my daughter&#x27;s .. unreal.. the smell is beautiful ..</li>
            <li> Its a good product. My hair felt very soft, although it still wasn&#x27;t enough to fight the humidity frizz of Austin, TX weather.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using the WEN products. I have natural hair and they do a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in the product. Had high hopes but my hair was frizzy.  Didnt like the scent either.  Went back to using Pantene.</li>
            <li> I started using Wen this past Monday. Here it is only 4 days later and my hair is totaly different. It is sooooo soft and looks soooo much better. I already had a couple of friends tell me my hair looks different and asked what I did...I will NEVER use anything else....I Love it! I cant wiat to try the other ones!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this 5 piece set of wen hair care products I expected to receive what was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;1 cleansing conditioner&lt;br /&gt;2 styling cream&lt;br /&gt;3 re-moist mask intensive hair treatment&lt;br /&gt;4 texture balm&lt;br /&gt;5 shower comb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I actually received was:&lt;br /&gt;1 cleansing conditioner&lt;br /&gt;2 styling cream&lt;br /&gt;3 sixthirteen cleansing treatment&lt;br /&gt;4 replenishing treatment mist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exactly angry about the order, but I expected to receive what I ordered, especially since I ended up a whole item short. I was looking forward to using the texture balm and I ordered this set because it specifically contained this item. I also never wanted the sixthirteen. I&#x27;m not very happy about the results of my order.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the products. The texture and moisture level of my hair and scalp are much improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is the only styling instrument I use now.</li>
            <li> I have blonde medium-thick straight to light wavy hair.. And I own the Pomegranate scented Wen product with pump. However, I would definitely not consider re-purchasing. Don&#x27;t get me wrong- the scent smells AMAZING. As much as I wanted this product to work, I was the farthest from impressed. I took the time, followed the instructions precisely and washed my hair with this product several times in order for my hair to \\&quot;get used\\&quot; to the product. I found that my hair felt thinner and more breakage was present. I was beyond excited when my hair felt like silk when washing out.. Although the silk and shine did not follow through throughout the blow-drying process. Not to mention the price! Oh my goodness.. In addition to the cost my product was gone in no time. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people with my hair type. Even though Wen claims to have all of the essentials needed to restore your natural oils.. Don&#x27;t fall in to the \\&quot;healthy silky and soft\\&quot; hair trap!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought Wen for me as a thoughtful gift - that was my ONLY positive experience with Wen. It left my hair looking dirty, scraggly, and gross. If I was going to play the part of a schizophrenic homeless woman in a movie, I would use Wen. Otherwise, I would rather rock a bald head than have another Wen-hair day. When I called to stop future orders and inquire about a return, they tried to sell me yet another product to address my complaints. Fortunately, my hair was so bad my boyfriend agreed and stopped future payments on his card. In addition, the advertisement brags about no petroleum-based ingredients. Once I received the product and read the packaging I learned that there is a host of other chemicals such as endochrine-disruptors that are harmful to our bodies. Do yourself a favor, save your money and find a good stylist and a product with a solid reputation - you deserve better than Wen.</li>
            <li> Please save yourself from all the trouble this Chaz Dean company will do to you. They made fraudulent charged to my credit card even I didn&#x27;t make any order from them. I disputed the charged with my credit card company and they credit me back the money but 3 months later on I received a letter from a collection company (SKO Brenner American) that I owed 128.79 from Chaz Dean. Please do not make any purchase from Chaz Dean and save yourself time by doing a little google search \\&quot;Chaz Dean scam\\&quot; before you want to make any order with them.</li>
            <li> The product does work the way it says it should.  It makes your hair shiny and silky. It is different from other products you would buy from the store. So I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was a  pleasure to deal with this com.This product  exited my expectation&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;description was correct.So I give this product an A+.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Wen to anybody!! I started using this set because I have frizzy hair with split ends. I had seen the infomercials and was looking forward to using this. I followed the directions and was left with greasy frizzy hair immediately after showering. Normally I go a couple days between shampoos but it was greasy looking right away. I did rinse completely, used as little as I could to get it on all of my hair. I tried using more, I tried changing the routine but nothing. I tried it a month or so just hoping it would eventually even out and start working. I couldn&#x27;t do it anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered on their website so I wrote Wen for help with the supposed 90 day guarantee but of course got no response. After using it I started looking online and found that every other website is full of the same warnings and very low ratings. Everyone says that not only does it kill hair and cause it to fall out that they don&#x27;t respond to phone calls or emails and keep taking money after ending service to the point that most have said they&#x27;ve had to cancel their cards (a good reason to try it on Amazon instead of the website!). It&#x27;s pretty suspicious to me that you don&#x27;t see much of that on the reviews on the Wen site. I&#x27;m thoroughly convinced that they&#x27;re here to scam people and take their money and could care less about anything else.</li>
            <li> I got this product from an infomercial.  I tried it but 30 days really isn&#x27;t enough time to see if it works.  I actually decided to give 60 days to see any improvement.  I followed the instructions which left my hair feeling dirty.  My friends, family or even hair dresser didn&#x27;t see any difference.  They were all anxious to see how it worked.  The product was reasonable in the infomercial; however they neglect to tell you that if you cancel the order which is automatically sent they charge you a membership fee(It&#x27;s not a cheap fee either).  I know because I had to cancel due to not being able to temporarily work, and my being unhappy with the results of the product. I was told oh well I will be charged a membership fee anyway.  I&#x27;ve ordered stuff before like this that had auto shipping and cancelled for whatever reason and never got charged a membership fee.  I have reordered some of those other products because I really liked them.  This is one site or product I would never get again.  In fact I use Dove Hair care which costs a fraction of this product and works better.  People see the difference in my hair.  In fact they did after a week of using Dove.  My opinion this is a waste of money and a fraud.</li>
            <li> Sweet almond conditioner is a great product. It dose reduce my hair fuzzy, and dry end. It dose have mint ingredent so it helps your scaple feels fresh. but I only like conditioner, hair treatment, texture blam, and style cream I did not use often.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product after watching the infomercial.  I have naturally curly hair and I&#x27;m always looking for products that will give me frizz control without weighing my hair down or making it crunchy.  This product smells great, but it made my hair look greasy even without using it as a leave-in conditioner (and I don&#x27;t have oily hair).  It also left it twice as frizzy, regardless of which products I used after washing.  My hair was definitely softer than before, but completely out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The styling cream seems like it could be a decent product on its own, but beware of using with any other products as it will congeal and leave you with little gelatinous chunks in your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that for someone with straight hair, this would probably be a decent product.  It smells great all day, make your hair soft, but it just doesn&#x27;t control the frizz.  I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> As the other reviews for this product state, it does require a lot of product each time you use it, so I don&#x27;t use it every day.  When I do use it though, this product makes my hair look and feel like silk!  I have naturally straight, silky hair anyway, but this product gives me off the charts shine.  I leave it in my hair while I&#x27;m finishing my shower and rinse it completely out before I get out.  I told my hairdresser about it and she had heard other positive comments.  I plan to take the bottle with me on my next visit so she can analyze the ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all in how much you RINSE your hair after cleansing. If you don&#x27;t rinse enough, your hair will feel dirty. Once you figure out how much rinsing is just right, you have it made. My hair looks and feels great. I&#x27;m over 50 and have received compliments on how shiny and nice my hair looks. Down side: it&#x27;s expensive!!</li>
            <li> So I havent purchased this system yet, though I plan to do so as this conditioner made my hair so soft and shiny and it smells sooo good. I had my hair cut and when I mentioned to my hairstylist that I had been shampoo free for a couple months she automatically started raving about Wen. It felt great as she washed my hair, which was tangle free (something no other shampoo or condtioner has ever been able to pull off) and you could tell the difference it made before she even cut off the three inches of dead hair at the end. After she finished my cut she just put a little oil in my hair and it dried naturally into perfect frizz free and soft curls all over. I normally need a diffuser and a few products to get curls that look any where near the results from today (and it was a humid 85 degrees when I left the salon). I cannot believe the results after just one use, how could I not buy it. I would recommend buying straight from the Wen website as the system is cheaper and they have a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I have to confess that I was very doubtful after seeing the infomercials, too good to be true, you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I got it and tried it out and it works EXACTLY as it is described, I was simply, simply amazed.</li>
            <li> Chaz Dean will not stop billing after being told 4 times to cancel.  Had to cancel credit card to stop billing!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased both the sweet almond mint and the fig through amazon so that I could avoid being enrolled in the auto-renewal and have an opportunity to sample the product. Both of them have given me very satisfactory results. As a way of describing my hair type: I&#x27;m of mixed african american and caucasian heritage, and have sort of fine, naturally curly (so frizzy) hair that tends to be dry and heat-stressed although it&#x27;s not chemically relaxed. My scalp is pretty normal, although it can get flaky, which could be oil or dry or from the heat I use. I prefer to style with a straightening iron so I have been looking for cleansing products that will treat it more gently than the traditional sulfate-based shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the sweet almond mint first, and was happy with the results. I had shiny, managable hair, and it was soft, if a little dry (this even after using the hydrating mask overnight) but given my past experience when I did not use shine/sealants, I was not surprised. My hair needs alot of love. However it did have lightness and movement, and lacked the heavy sticky feeling alot of the olive-oil based conditioners can leave. I also avoided the buildup on my scalp that I usually get with lots of style products, so even with just the first treatment I was showing a reduced tendacy for flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following week I switched to the fig, and the results were much better, and dramatic: Super-glossy (not oily), soft, and ZERO frizz. The dry feeling was completely lacking this time around, and about the only complaint I could even think of is that my hair was so tame it seemed a little flat (I do torture my hair into submission, so I really shouldn&#x27;t complain when I get what I want).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried any of the other wen products, but since fig, and sweet almond mint are considered to be the most moisturizing, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll stick to the fig from here out, with maybe the sweet almond mint as a scalp treatment from time to time. While the wen products are more expensive than most of the store bought cleansers, if you look into salon products, you&#x27;ll find you have a comparable price point with the best brands and you&#x27;re getting your shampoo and conditioner in one bottle with this one. I consider it a good buy for the results it produces, and anticipate saving money on trips to the salon for trims since there is less splitting now as well. If you get a relaxer in particular, the fig can help you with breakage by keeping it in better condition as it grows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, while I have not had the problem of any sticky or oily issues, I did read on another blog that one issue with this could be the amount of time spent rinsing, especially afterward, which should be several minutes. Another suggestion was a second wash after the first rinse, or using tea tree oil or the cucumber for your scalp and the fig or sweet almond mint for the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I have used a lot of hair product trying to find the right thing, none of them gave me the results that I got from Wen.  I have long (down to the middle of my back), coarse, full and curly hair.  It is frizzy and very dry most of the time.  This really is a wonderful product and I really wish I could keep using it.  My only problem is that I bought a one month supply and used it in less than two weeks.  It would cost me $90 a month just to clean my hair and I just can&#x27;t spend $1000 a year on shampoo just for me.  Really if you have been searching for a product and you don&#x27;t have hair like mine or you have the money, you really need to try this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product without having to purchase additional items monthly.  I really love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have course curly hair. Most products leave my hair either really dry or extremely oily. I bought the kit from the WEN website and fell in love with it. The smell is wonderful and it works better then anything I have ever tried before. My curls are bouncy instead of droop, full instead of flat. While the product seems to go fast, you dont have to use it every single day for results. I use it about three to four times a week the re-moist maybe once or twice. And even with out using it every single day my hair smells great and looks great. My hair isnt nearly as fuzzy as it use to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pricing is pretty ridiculous but I save more because I dont use a ton of gel and other hair care stuff.</li>
            <li> You are a scammer. I could have ordered the product directly from the retailer much CHEAPER but I decided to order it from you so I would not be enrolled into a membership. Instead you used my information to order the product directly from the retailer and I was enrolled anyways. Thanks for the violation!</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying that I regularly color my hair, I have very thick, fine, straight, blondish hair .  I love trying new products and have tried the off brand \\&quot;One\\&quot; from Sally Beauty and it was terrible.  I have also used many different shampoo and conditioner combinations, and always end up with dry ends and my hair looking awful toward the end of the first day I shower.  I like to shower ever two days, and hate that my hair starts feeling gross with regular shampoo/conditioner so soon.  So I decided to give Wen a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say that you must follow the directions.  By that, I mean use warm (not HOT) water, make sure you rinse your hair for a few (two or so) minutes prior to application.  Be sure to massage the scalp for a few minutes, make sure your hair is saturated with the cream, then add a bit of water and massage more.  Comb through, and what I do is use a hair tie or clip to put my hair up during the rest of the shower.  Wash/shave the rest of yourself, then put your hair back down and comb through again, then rinse.  You&#x27;ll notice already when you rinse that your hair feels silky.  I rinse for a few minutes until I feel like combing my fingers through my hair stick a tiny bit, then put it up in a towel turban and when I brush it out it is so much easier to do that with regular products!  My hair stays soft and smells great, and looks great for at least two days afterward!  I love Wen and though it costs a little more it is SO worth it!  Color your hair at home if you need to save money, then spend the excess on Wen.  I purchased mine through eBay at first, then you really get the best deals through QVC if you&#x27;re looking to get a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did start out with the 5 piece set and so far have only used the cleansing cream and the comb.  But I LOVE this product so much.  I&#x27;ve purchased the body cleansing cream and will try that next, and the pomegranate scent as well.  Hope I love them as much as the sweet almond mint!</li>
            <li> Soo awesome and its worth the try.  Don&#x27;t follow directions on the bottle because everyone is different. I have shoulder length hair.  I use 2 pumps - one for each side of my hair split down the middle - rub in all over then wet enough to get a creamy texture then I add one more.  Great results for me.  41 years old and loosing hair - after 1 week of use acutally 3 uses I have notice a drastic change.  My set style with sponge rollers stays for 2 days looking great in the deep south humidity.  Loving it!!!</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that the texture and appearance of my has improved drastically.  I am so glad I took a chance and tried it.</li>
            <li> I took a year debating to buy this product. Finally took the plunge and it is everything and more. It is the best product and it does everything it claims. I love it.  It took getting used to the fact that it \\&quot;DOES NOT\\&quot; make suds. But after three washings I never went back. A defined diffference in my hair and I love love love the product.  It is all the \\&quot;infomercial\\&quot; says and more. Don&#x27;t wait like me \\&quot;just do it\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00188IFHS WEN® Lavender Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]]</li>
            <li> The product description states the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;NO CONTRACT! NO MEMBERSHIP! NO BILLS! NO AUTO-SHIPMENTS!&lt;br /&gt;ORDER IS FULFILLED USING OUR AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT!&lt;br /&gt;NO RISK! HASSLE FREE! \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item thinking it is a one time shipment and no membership but I was very WRONG! I received all the paper work with the product, from WEN, and not from \\&quot;Exquisit Emporium\\&quot;. It stated I only paid $9.95 for the product, when my credit card was charged the full price of $32.00 + S&amp;H. I called to only find out that Iam signed up for a 90 day automated shipment option.  These people are scam artists that buy the product under the buyers name throught Wen, for a much cheaper price, and keep the profit.  The worst thing of all is that they LIE because it is not a one time shipment it is a membership that charges you per delivery after each consecutive shipment.</li>
            <li> This product made my  hair stronger and extremely soft. I have relaxed african american had, and im very skeptical about using new products in my hair, All ive known is olive oil and natural organic products. My roommate got the WEN system and had me try it, and after the first day, I saw the difference, there was an immediate shine to my hair, Ive only used the Sweet Almond Mint, and it works perfectly, that i dnt even want to try anything different . This product really works. Its suck that they dont ship to Military addresses though.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very straight hair that is always flat.  I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is a miracle worker but I will say I definitely see an improvement. I wouldn&#x27;t say that about any other expensive volumizing shampoo or product I&#x27;ve tried before and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 weeks now and at first my hair did get very sticking and oily but after about a month it went away. I would give this product at least month before I&#x27;d give up on it. I wouldn&#x27;t follow the directions with the number of pumps. I think it depends on your hair. As for reading the reviews about women losing their hair form the product. I would really not believe them.</li>
            <li> I called to order this product on the infomercial because I wanted to get it for my daughter for xmas.  I thought it was odd that when i called they talked and talked and just wouldn&#x27;t shut up.  I&#x27;m thinking- ok- you&#x27;ve already hooked me - I&#x27;m calling to order the product so why the hardsell.  Well after five minutes of bull- and after getting my credit card number- they inform me that they will keep sending me the product monthly and i will have to call to cancel.  I told them it was a ripoff and a scam and that they had better cancel right away, I no longer want the product and I had better not see it on my charge bill.  He just kept talking and selling so we&#x27;ll see what happens.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see the charge show up within the next few days and I for sure wish I had looked it up on amazon before calling in an order.</li>
            <li> i love wen i use it on my hair and my 2 year old grandaughter.it is the best stuff for someone so young.no suds to irritate her eyes and her hair is so easy to comb out after words.and our hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered this product from Amazon instead of the Wen website to avoid the auto-enroll feature.  When I received it, I opened the packaging envelope and found out that I was enrolled unless I called to cancel my membership.  I really resent this mis-representation and canceled the membership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product - I do like it, but I don&#x27;t want to be sent it and charged for it when the manufacturer says I need it.  I don&#x27;t use the full amount recommended and only wash my hair 3 times a week - I don&#x27;t need to purchase as much as they think I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be working my way around this auto-enroll by ordering from Sephora instead.</li>
            <li> Wen products made my hair feel silky smooth and shiney.  It is a great product and I would recommend it to all my friends. I like to order through Amazon because they always follow-up on products and deliveries.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product, but my 16 yr old has.  She absolutely LOVES it because her hair is wavy and gets dry in the summer, but this stuff smooths out the dryness/frizzies.  She still leaves her hair wavy and it holds the curls well.  No problems with greasiness like other reviews that I have read.  All in all a good product that in this case works well!</li>
            <li> I was at first sketical about this product but co-worker kept swearing about how wonderful it was.  I gave in and now I wouldn&#x27;t go without.  My hair is much more manageable and healthy looking and it cuts down on my shower time as well as styling time which is perfect especially since i am 7 months pregnant and have a 5 year old son.</li>
            <li> Bought Wen after a coworker was telling me about it. My hair is softer and less frizzy. It even does a better job at controlling my dandruff than Selson Blue did. It is a little expensive but definitely worth it. I have also read that some people were having there hair get thinner but that has not been the case for me. If anything my hair does not fall out as much.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my wife who watched the infomercials time after time. After she used the product once, she commented how soft her hair became, considering she didn&#x27;t use a \\&quot;traditional shampoo and conditioner\\&quot;. Thing is, she is so used to the lather a normal shampoo produces, she just can&#x27;t convince herself her hair is clean. Having long hair past her shoulders also requires quite a bit a product. After working in the garden, sweating in the 90 + degree heat, not having the lather effect while washing her hair is hard to get past. She feels her normal shampoo and conditioner, Garnier Fructis does a better job at a lesser cost.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about the product since I have long wavy hair which at times can be difficult to manage. However, after using the product, I was hooked!! My hair looked and felt great, and I received wonderful comments about it. The price however is something to be desired, and might off set me from purchasing it in the future, since I require more product than most people, but nonetheless a good product overall.</li>
            <li> I am, and always have been, very picky about my hair care products. I have been coloring for years, and like to be careful about what products I use and how often I use them. Like most, I saw this infomercial and did my research. I saw numerous posts about this making your hair fall out, and saw even more that loved it. At that time, I decided that my hair is not worth risking and decided not to order it. My mother-in-law ordered it, and just like any auto ship purchase, received her second one before she knew what hit her. (She wasn&#x27;t knowledgable of these types of things at the time). Nonetheless, she gave her second shipment to me. I told her about the reviews that I read and how \\&quot;it can make your hair fall out\\&quot; and she was discouraged from using it. I am still apologizing to this day. I had a long weekend and tried it. I was amazed. Because I am not a fan of wet hair on me in the shower, (it actually grosses me out) I did not use the comb while washing. I know that everyone loses approx. 100 hairs a day, and to be honest I would rather them be dry and on my pillow and clothes rather than sliding down my bottom in the shower. Nonetheless, it has transformed my hair. It may seem a little pricey if you get it from Sephora or the likes, but you will soon find that you do not need to use it everyday so money wise it&#x27;s kind of a wash. (No pun intended). I continue to order online and have to be responsible about the auto ship. They do offer a customized order that I have found to be expensive since you pay for all products you want individually. If you&#x27;re willing to spend a little extra time keeping track of your orders/order dates, then I feel certain you will be more than pleased. ALSO, it has been my experience with my fine/baby hair that making sure there is not too much on the crown and scalp yields the best results. Again, coming from someone that does not use the comb while washing. Directions say 10-15 pumps, but obviously that is a general suggestion and youshould use an amount that best benefits your hair type and length. (Mine is long and fine and I like 12 pumps.) Hope this helps those in doubt!</li>
            <li> I actually just wanted to try it but ended up giving it to a coworker in need of a pick me up. Little did I know I was enrolled in a club in which they sent me MORE WEN!! charging my card almost 100.00&lt;br /&gt;I didnt ask to be in a club!! I bought a sample packege from AMAZON NEVER AGAIN I absolutley HATE situations like that!!</li>
            <li> I purchased Wen about five years ago for my daughter. She didn&#x27;t like it because she said it made her hair look greasy. She has thick, straight, very full hair. I had the product there and figured I&#x27;d give it a try before sending it back. The instructions almost put me over the edge... sectioning off your hair, putting gads of the goop on each section, leaving on forever and then rinsing forever more. Frankly, the INSTRUCTIONS alone almost made me return it. I tried following them the first day and the outcome was pretty good. It did not make my hair look greasy (which is more likely to happen with me than my daughter because my hair is fine, thin and long). I knew the application procedure was way to high maintenance for me so the next day I decided to see what happened if I just put the product in my hair, combed it through, went on with my other shower routine, and then rinsed it off when I was finished. My routine takes about 3-5 minutes, and that&#x27;s how long it stayed on my hair. The results were indistinguishable from the high-maintenance routine, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 10 days later, after using the recommended amount of product, I was ready to open my next bottle. The entire time I was using the recommended number of pumps I wondered why. There was just goop everywhere. When I opened my second bottle I put half the product in the empty bottle and mixed in about half a bottle of purified water. Shook it up for a while and it regained a thick texture. I used half the number of the diluted stuff on my hair, washed it out when I was finished as I would any other product (rather than using the longer time frames for both washing and rinsing suggested) and my hair turned out great. I have continued with this procedure since and the product is working well enough for me to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here is some anecdotal information about \\&quot;performance\\&quot;. I am not sure I would say that I see a huge difference between the outcome of my hair with this product vs. using shampoo and conditioner. My hair looks shiny and healthy, but when I have used other products because I was traveling or something, it also looked good. Some other products make my hair look thicker, however, I don&#x27;t know if over time they would also make it look dryer. I haven&#x27;t tested it because I am pretty happy with the Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I WILL say this. About two years ago I decided to begin blending the increasing amount of grey hair on my head using more highlights. Obviously, to get them to blend with the grey they were quit light, using a lot of that nasty peroxide that can really take a toll on your hair. My hairdresser was so worried my fine, thin hair would not hold up to this aggressive treatment. She started slowly and every time she was finished she stood stunned at how sturdy my hair was. When we finally got to the full treatment of highlights which would typically cause a lot of damage, she was just amazed at how healthy my hair continued to be. She thinks I have biotic hair, which was never the case in the past. My hair was prone to being dull and easily damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for me, having a single product that is conveniently delivered to my door for less cost as the other products I had been using is a good thing. Knowing that my hair can withstand the harsh coloring treatments I get and still look healthy and shiny is a huge plus. Thus, the 4 star rating. I would have given it a 5 star, but its troubling to me that the instructions are so complicated and the recommended amounts such overkill. I even called the company and asked about the amounts (they say that the best results come from using a lot of product and leaving it on a long time, neither of which have proven true for me) and the CSR told me that others have found it to be true that they get better results with less product. This smells to me of a means of getting customers to use more product than they need so they can order more. I think thata business should have more integrity than that, and getting a customer like me who uses less but orders religiously should be good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other points in regard to other things posted in reviews. First, dealing with GR has been an unusually POSITIVE experience for me. Their CSR have been accommodating, tending to err to my favor, and refunds or adjustments were handled without any grief. In fact, some time back a very evil ex friend of mine had over 80 as-seen-on-tv items sent to my address, many coming from GR. They were very helpful in getting these charges off my credit cards and did not require me to return a single product. I have written a more detailed review about this which you can find if you look for all my reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, about the cost. The original $39 a month was just too much for me to spend, even when diluting the product. I called and discussed this with them because I was going to cancel. They reduced my monthly shipment to $24 a month. I have found this to be the case for almost every company I have used for auto-ship. That is how the price is manageable for me; I tend to use less than two diluted bottles a month and get shipments every 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> I love these products. I noticed improvement in my hair in just 1 use. I feel my hair has gotten much stronger and softer after using this.</li>
            <li> First off, let me tell you that I am a person who is very skeptical about infomercial items. When it comes to items advertised on television I&#x27;m usually a pessimist. The few products I have bought from TV in the past turned out to be absolute duds. So needless to say; I&#x27;m not a big TV shopper, or a believer of infomercial items. However, after happening on the Wen infomercial while channel surfing; I was immediately pulled in because I have EXTREMELY fussy straight hair and no shampoo or hair product EVER works quite right for me. Shampoos like Suave or Dove dry out my hair to the point where it looks like straw, and leave in conditioners make my hair look like an oil slick. Even salon shampoos like the Paul Mitchell line make my hair look limp and lifeless. So yeah I admit, when I saw the Wen infomercial I was a bit skeptical, but being as I was so desperate for a product that would make my hair look halfway decent; I went ahead and took the risk... and oh wow am I happy I did! My husband kept laughing at me when I blow dried my hair out after the first time of using this product, because I kept shouting; \\&quot;Oh my god! Wow!\\&quot; from the bathroom. My hair has NEVER looked this healthy, clean, vibrant, or full of body. I got instant and visible results, just like in the infomercial. The product smells wonderful and it makes my usually dry hair so soft to the touch. I am so happy with this product and highly recommend it to others who have fussy hair and have also never been able to find the right product. For me, Wen is worth every penny! Two thumbs way up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, that all being said, bare in mind there are a few things to consider before buying/trying Wen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Despite what the commercial says, like all things, it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. I have talked to a few other people that have used it, and just like all shampoos; it works for some and not others. I happen to be one of the hair types it works great on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) The longer and thicker yourhair is, the more this will cost you. The infomercial states that every supply is by month or two months, etc, but I have talked to a few girls with very long hair who have used it, and they say that their \\&quot;monthly\\&quot; supply was gone in just a few uses. I happen to have short hair so my supply actually lasts, but this won&#x27;t be the case for people with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Be careful how much you use and unless you have long hair, do NOT use as much as directed on the back. My hair is chin length and 6-8 pumps works great from me. The back says to use 10-15 pumps, but if you use that much on short hair its a total waste of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) If you have hair that&#x27;s easily weighed down or easily becomes oily; avoid using the texture balm. All the other products that came in my Wen set worked great, expect for the balm. Just a tiny bit of it made my hair look chunky, oily, and weighed down, which pretty much counteracted the fabulous results I got from the Wen shampoo itself. I&#x27;m sure the texture balm would work great for people who have thicker hair, but for people who have baby fine hair like me, its not all that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few things to keep in mind. I really do hope the Wen system will work for you as well as it did for me.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever review, but I am a long time Amazon customer....I went to Michigan to visit family during the past heatwave, and came back to the western part of the country with my hair looking/feeling like a rat&#x27;s nest, super dry. I was desperate to get some moisture into it. Luckily I saw the WEN infomercial and, as I was ready to try anything, I ordered it from Amazon. Delivery was SUPER fast, and I did not specify expedited. The product came with a little informational pamphlet from Wen, which did not tell me to use quite as much product as I see is suggested on the Wen website. (I use 4 pumps per section, total 16). I used the cleansing conditioner, and afterwards immediately used the re-moist mask intensive hair treatment--left that in my hair for 30 minutes. Rinsed that out, used a dime-sized amount of the styling creme, and blow-dried my hair as usual. After my hair was dry, I used the texture balm and styled normally. WOW! It made a HUGE difference with my hair! I will be a long-time customer after these results! My hair was SO soft and manageble, no longer dry and frizzy! I also want to mention that I wasn&#x27;t too excited about getting a comb, as I have never been a comb user, because I&#x27;ve never really been able to get one through my hair. Boy has that changed! I can even run my fingers through my hair without getting them snagged! I am completely blown away! You have to try this stuff!</li>
            <li> i was hoping that it would be amazing, now after 4 washes every time the next day, i have oily hair. whats the deal. regular shampoo i can go for 3 days with out being oily. my hair is oily on top and frizzy on the bottom. :( very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I saw instant results -- after the first wash my hair was smooth &amp; glossy and felt like silk.  I do find that the results vary depending on how long I leave it &#x27;soak&#x27; in the shower (too little (3 mins) and my hair is not &#x27;moist enough&#x27;, too long (45 mins) and my hair is heavier, though very smooth).  I prefer the way it looks after about 5-6 minutes.  Also rinsing your head with cool water when you first get in the shower does indeed make a difference.  I haven&#x27;t had problems with not rinsing it out well-enough, though I usually turn down the temp on the shower so that its between &#x27;cool&#x27; and the temp I normally bathe at (so warmer than luke warm, but not hot).  I have a lot of very fine, dishwater blonde hair that I have peroxide highlights put in every few months.  The difference between how my hair looks now and before I became a &#x27;Wen Girl&#x27; is JUST LIKE the infomercial... From Long, and sort of dry &amp; stiff looking to Long, and lustrous (and not heavy).  And my &#x27;color-treated&#x27; hair normally looks much better than most anyways (even without the Wen) because I never blowdry or use styling products on it, so its not like I was starting out with &#x27;straw&#x27; to begin with.  I just air dry &amp; wear it straight... and with Wen I pick through it after a shower with ease... much, much nicer than when I used to use shampoo &amp; conditioner.  In addition -- my husband suffers from a dry scalp, and he likes how Wen has relieved the itching &amp; tightness he used to feel.  His hair is even more fine than mine -- and with Wen he actually has &#x27;body&#x27; now, hehe. :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE -- I am still rating this product 5 stars because I really like it, but after prolonged use on my fine hair, I found that my hair got heavy and greasy looking after awhile.  I switched back to shampoo for a month or so (and back to that &#x27;dry&#x27; look that I don&#x27;t like), and since then, I alternate between WEN and Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shiny Shampoo &amp; conditioner.  This seems to be the perfect combo for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Wen is a great product when it comes down to leaving the hair soft and smelling great but it does absolutely nothing for people with naturally curly hair. I was looking forward to a low-maintenance product that will do the same things for my hair as a bottle of shampoo for $40 but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t. Maybe if I had straight to wavy hair it would work but not for curly. Go with Ouidad products instead. They&#x27;re created for specifically curly hair and work so much better!</li>
            <li> After you receive your order you will receive a monthly shipment and your credit card will be charged.  If I wanted this I would have bought it directly from the TV commercial.  I bought from Amazon specifically because I DID NOT want anymore of this  product.  Anyway, the company agreed to send me a return shipping label and they say they will credit my account after they receive the product which will take weeks.  AND..I have to pay the $$$$$ shipping!  Oh I am so mad!</li>
            <li> I received my kit for Christmas and was very anxious to use it.  On my first use it stripped my hair color that was less than a week old.  It left my hair feeling dirty and dry and left it frizzier than normal.  I&#x27;m going to use it once more but I have a feeling that I&#x27;ll be returning the kit for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I orderd this product on Dec. 3rd it finally got here yesterday on the 27th.  The paperwork says my card is set up for auto bill pay for the product and will resend the next batch out in Jan.  I ordered this on here so it wouldn&#x27;t be an auto pay like on the infomercial.  I will be sending this product back if it can not be set up as a one time transaction.</li>
            <li> I tried the Wen hair products a few months ago, I think it has good ingredients but is over priced. It did not make my hair better than regular shampoo. But I liked the Styling Creme and Replenishing Treatment. I would buy that if I saw it in a store for a decent price. Since the shampoo didn&#x27;t make my hair any better I decided to cancel. I called them, had to answer a few question to a computerized voice and that was it. Cancellation done. Super easy.&lt;br /&gt;I say it is worth to try it if you&#x27;re curious, maybe it works well for you.&lt;br /&gt;Guthy Renker also works with Proactive which I used for a few years, I never had a problem and customer service is good. So I personally cannot agree with the bad reviews about the company. They always did a great job and cancellation was always easy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product for the longest time.  I liked the cleanser, hair treatment and stying cream  I didn&#x27;t like the balm and the comb.  The balm dried out my hair more than what it all ready was and the comb was horrid.  My hair is softer. I&#x27;m using as directed.  The texture of my hair is course, relaxed.  i live in a very dry climate and I had extreme breaking...no I had two huge bald spots.I am currently using three items to help re-grow my hair.  I started using the Wen hair care system around Christmas and it is now February.  It has done a very nice job to clean my hair.  I haven&#x27;t had dry scalp issues.  I started using Wen for  a month with no other products, I can honestly say that it hasn&#x27;t helped with regrow but it does clean my hair well and I have not had any dry scalp issues.  In the second month I started using a a variety of oils to help. So far almond oil has help tremendously.  I have one more item that I purchased through Amazon and I just recieved it today so I&#x27;ll keep you all posted!</li>
            <li> Good morning, I purchased wen hair care about two weeks ago. First off it took over 3 weeks to get my product in the mail. I was more than excited when I finaly got it. I went straight up stairs to use it. At first I was not impressed my hair came out so frizzy, I thought maybe because I didn&#x27;t blow dry it. I have very thick curly hair so I don&#x27;t normal blow dry it. The next day I decided to wash it again with wen and then blow it out straight. I got pissed at first because my hair was so frizzy and poofy. I. Thought ok well that&#x27;s the body it gives you however my hair type I didn&#x27;t need it. Anyway I finished and it looked great and soft. I decided to use it on my. 3 daughters as well. The other day my youngest was playing with my hair... she says mom you have a bald spot... I laughed thinking she was just playing as she is always joking. My 9 year old got up to look and said no mo she&#x27;s being serious you have a huge bald spot.&lt;br /&gt;I got nervious right away and went and checked my whole head to find more bald spots.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a healthy 34 year old woman and have never had any issues with my hair or health, and haven&#x27;t changed anything in my diet or routing besideds the wen hair product.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to google wen hair loss.... found out their are numerous people losing their hair from this product.&lt;br /&gt;Please people be very cautious of this. I am seeking legal help, contacting the fda, QVC,WEN and anyone else that is connected to this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the price for the items received and the comb other than that; the product itself is not that great!&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner&#x3D; Doesn&#x27;t leave the hear like a real conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Styling cream&#x3D; (smells like motor oil), it does work fine on hair&lt;br /&gt;RE Moist mask intensive hair&#x3D; NOT worth it, too stiff on hair&lt;br /&gt;Texture Balm&#x3D; The worst thing ever invented&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If these items were worth buying, I would buy them again...that is not the case for me.</li>
            <li> I was also one of the unfortunate ones that got sucked into an infomercial haze ... After I got it I thought that the product was overpriced.  These scammers sent me more (billed me over $100) and now I have to send the unwanted product back.  Stay away from these scammers. Disappointed with Guthy-Renker, and will spread the word to all I know.</li>
            <li> My first &amp; last purchase from this company. I bought this Miniature Wen set thinking I was going to the normal size set of Wen that I once purchased before(from the original WEN Company)for the same price this company is selling it for. Wen the set came OMG, it was a miniature set. I looked and sad...no no this is not almost $40 worth of products! So I contacted the phone number in my box and customer service told me I received a SAMPLE set worth $9.99 and what for what I paid I should have received the Normal size set...You know the one you see on TV. OK so I contacted this company and told them this is the wrong set. They told me sorry for the confusion and I was not to get the $9.99 set if I&#x27;d like I could return it &amp; they would send a return label. I asked them should I send it back &amp; they send the normal set like the company said or do I return it and get my money back &amp; how long do they think it would be for them to put my money back to my card... NO ANSWER to my question...they only sent an address to send the items back to and then said you received exactly what you ordered &amp; they do not send out return labels. So at this point I am truly amazed,distressed and I was shocked beyond disbelief. I&#x27;m thinking I may not get my full refund or get any justice. I am here to warn all DO NOT DO ANY BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!! I am done...NEVER...much more should be left unsaid....It took almost a month for it to get to me so that is why I asked... how long will it be for me to receive my money back or get another set...at least an estimate?!? Say Something...I just will be ordering directly from WEN where I will get my monies worth because now as I see the price suddenly went up right after this and the description is totally different. The only thing with WEN is just try the set they are offering and if you do not want any more shipments, just tell them...that&#x27;s it...nothing more!! No stars for this company.</li>
            <li> Wen made my hair dense and heavy.  All of the other Wen hair styling products reminded me of the time I forgot to rinse the conditioner out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you made the mistake of signing up with Wen directly and decide to cancel automatic-auto-renewal, be sure to cancel ALL of your memberships as they break-up the product lines into different accounts. I cancelled my memberships, they continue to bill me, and supposedly send more products, although I haven&#x27;t received anything other than my bank stating I paid Wen, again.</li>
            <li> If I had known that I could have ordered thru Amazon I would have never tried the WEN Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product (after I figured out which shampoo was right for my hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try canceling your account.  They take out money then and then a month later&lt;br /&gt;they take out more money.&lt;br /&gt;I could not figure out what was going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy from Amazon!!</li>
            <li> It specifically says \\&quot;No autoship program\\&quot; yet when it arrived my bill said I had 90 days to cancel or would be on an autoship. Deceptive.</li>
            <li> The Wen haircare system is great.  It really helped my hair (curly, wavy, fine and frizzy) be more manageable.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I can overlook that for hair I don&#x27;t have to wash every single day that feels fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside?  Cold showers.  You have to wash and rinse in cool/cold water and frankly, in the winter, I&#x27;m not down with that.  If you have a detachable showerhead, then this product is great and you won&#x27;t care.  If you don&#x27;t, be prepared for some chilly mornings.  Or wash your hair in the kitchen sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the extras that come with your initial purchase are great.  One other \\&quot;complaint\\&quot;:  the pump for the conditioning rinse bottle doesn&#x27;t close, so it&#x27;s awful for traveling.  Either baggy that thing or don&#x27;t bring it.  I opted not to bring mine with me, because I didn&#x27;t want it to accidentally pump out in my suitcase in the belly of the plane, and waste that expensive product.</li>
            <li> i tried my mom&#x27;s Wen Shampoo its stinks really badk. I don;t recommend anyone to buy it. Its not worth 40bucks to 100 dollars a month. thats a rip off to be honest. I have long hair to my shoulders and its makes me hair greasy looking. Espeically i have oliy skin. I don;t recommened anyone to use it . its a rip off shampoo that don&#x27;t do jack crap.</li>
            <li> I would have loved to try this product, however the WEN company never sent it. Ever. No tracking number or anything. They didn&#x27;t respond timely to the distributor who, in turn, had no information for me. I waited well over a month for this product that was supposedly shipped via UPS.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be spreading the good word for WEN unfortunately.</li>
            <li> BAD product, Worse customer service!!!&lt;br /&gt;Like many of you, I saw the infomercial about WEN and decided to give it try.  When I received my package, I realized that it didn&#x27;t contain all the free gifts described on TV; but I was not deterred since I was so excited to try the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product...&lt;br /&gt;The first experience was quite nice, my head felt minty and the hair was softer than before.  However, after a few uses, my head began to itch and it does not seem to wash away all the dirt and my hair felt greasy.&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I called customer service and told them I wanted to cancel my account and planning to return the product.  Instead of helping me, the man on the phone made me feel stupid and was trying to convince me that I was using the product wrong...he said that I was not using enough pumps and I should try their other line which will be more moisturizing.  I politely declined his offer and insisted on cancelling.&lt;br /&gt;However, my next shipment still arrived and now I have two boxes of this horrible product that I didn&#x27;t want.  By the way, when I told my hair dresser that I tried WEN, her exactly words were, \\&quot;I hate that stuff!!!\\&quot;  Yet, I digress.  So I went to the post office trying to return everything, and bought a priority box big enough for the 2 boxes and made sure I got a delivery confirmation number.&lt;br /&gt;A week later, I check my bank account and only found a refund for one of my shipments.  Naturally, I called customer service.  The rude man was slurring and speaking super-fast, I could barely understand him.  When I explained my situation he asked me if I have proof of 2 deliveries.  He said that I must return the boxes separately or it only counts as 1 return.  I am sorry, but what kind of logic is that??  In other word, it doesn&#x27;t matter how much you return, as long as it is in one box, it can only count as one!  It didn&#x27;t make sense to me then, and it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me now...&lt;br /&gt;In closing, thank you WEN for ripping me off, producing a horrible product, and most importantly, providing me with such crappy service!</li>
            <li> I love how I could just apply it and leave it in and then rinse it out the next day. If I wanted to brush my hair, I had to wash it instead. When I used WEN for the first time, I could actually brush my hair. It&#x27;s a miracle. It&#x27;s like GOD gave me this wonderful gift. It doesn&#x27;t say how often you should wash your hair but when I do wash it, my hair looks like it did when I was little. I cried for joy over how great it it made my hair. It actually feels stronger. The natural curls are still there. Thank you so much Chaz.</li>
            <li> I had debated, back and forth whether to try WEN for quite a while, but I finally bit the bullet and bought it.  I must say, I am glad I finally did it!  It took the itch out of my scalp for the first time in about 3 years...going to a natural (Sulfate free, no parabens, no proplylene butylene glcols, petroleum, sulfates, alcohol, PEGs, TEA, DEA, NPE, phthalates, (GMO), silicones, triclosan (pesticides) artificial dyes or fragrances.  Gluten free hair product alone, had not done the trick, but one use of WEN and the itch was gone!  I AM A BELIEVER.  Wen girl forever......&lt;br /&gt;Hemel Lass</li>
            <li> I saw the infomercial and decided to try it. The shipment arrived quickly. I tried it and was not impressed by the way it worked in my hair. This product may work great for others but, it didn&#x27;t deliver was I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my dry hair..in fact after the treatment my hair was dryer than when I began..I paid $49 for this kit and I could not return it..because the containers were used..well, how else can you determine how well a product works unless you try it.. Very unhappy with the result of this purchase..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful before ordering a product..examine the return rules...I learned the hard way...</li>
            <li> So I tried this new product and I love it. I use on my natural hair and I can actually comb it.</li>
            <li> Daughter wanted this for her birthday.  Miscommunications on delivery but turned out alright.  She loves it!  She will probably order more.</li>
            <li> I have curley hair that can be dry and this works really well for frizz and does not dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> Beware, ethics are a problem for this company.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try the product, very hopeful that it might work, but it&#x27;s the scamming nature of the company that has outraged me - and it is doubtful that I am going to get my money back!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t mind the product. I alternated it with shampoo as I found that it irritated my scalp, but they refuse to refund my money and that&#x27;s the problem. If it continues I may have to see a lawyer about it.</li>
            <li> Basically, wen is a really big scam. The product is not very good; I used it for a while and thought it was but then I used a generic conditioner in the same way I used wen and I got better results. Customer service is horrible. I was told I was paying for 3 shipments at $19.95 each, but I learned today (the day I canceled) that I was actually paying for 1 shipment at 3 different times all at $19.95 making the package a total of $59.85. I never heard any mention of that price when I was on the phone customizing my kit. It&#x27;s a below average product with an outrageous price and horrible customer service. Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very smooth after using Wen. I don&#x27;t use the amount the direction said, but it worked perfect.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product at first. It left my hair soft and manageable. Didn&#x27;t feel like I was stripping its oils. AND so much easier than washing and conditioning.  After about a year or two of using it, my hair became noticeably thinner. When I washed it, clumps of hair would fall out.  I told my hairdresser and she told me that she had several other clients that started using Wen and ended up with the same result.  I had to cut my hair short and use hair thinning product to reverse the effects. Now it is back to its normal thickness. My hairdresser said something about there being too much protein in the product.</li>
            <li> I have not seem much difference in my hair.  I wash my hair 2-3 times a week and have been using Wen for about a month.  I haven&#x27;t seen much change. I am really looking for something to add shine and volume to my hair, as well as keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> This product was good for conditioning, but left my hair without body. Didnt like smell. I would have rather had different scent.</li>
            <li> I used most of the product but I was not very impressed. The best item is the wide tooth styling comb. I have very fine, flyaway hair and it seemed to weigh it down. I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I always heard from my friends on how wonderful Wen is so after hearing it for about 2 yrs I decided to try it myself. This little kit is great and the portions of the product are wonderful. sometimes when you get a trial or small kit the bottles are microscopic and you may have enough shampoo for one round. Definatly not here, this is a wonderful kit and wonderful product and you even get a nice picture of Chaz--cutie</li>
            <li> The people that come out on that commercial must have been paid to say what they say. I tried it one time and it didnt do what they said. I tried it twice, then I thought Ok enough.  This product made my hair look like it was dirty, no shine and it was terrible to manage. I actually had to cut my hair, no kidding.  I gave the unused product to my sister who hated also. So much for this product, I went back to Pantene and my hair shines, shines, shines.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair feels so healthy. I had gotten a perm and&lt;br /&gt;my hair was so fried. This product has healed my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, but coarse, hair, naturally curly, and a lot of it.  This makes my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I initially ordered WEN trial products only, it contained the styling gel, conditioner, comb and texture balm, it says it&#x27;s a one time shipment, BUT hold on! i kept getting random products every month, and to make it worse, I didn&#x27;t like the product!!!!! I am hispanic and have long thick hair, even Head and shoulders worked better for me than WEN products!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, each time i got a box (which I gave to salvation army), without me ordering it, I got charged more. Today i called to see why I was getting so many orders and the salesperson told me they send the product each month , but if you dont call to cancel, they will continue sending and charging for the stuff. The box I just received apparently is for 59.00!!!! why on earth would I pay that amount for a prodcut I didnt like and I am not using, when I can buy Pantene for 7.00dls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be careful what you are signing up for, they are very tricky!!</li>
            <li> I had watched the info-mercial so many times and wanted to try this. I have permed hair that is fine and frizzes bad with humid weather. Thought this might help. I also cannot spend alot of time on my hair with a baby and do not wash it often. Well, it made my hair weighed down and still frizzed. Only thing I noticed was softer hair. So, I do not recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and smooth looking.  I started using this product about three weeks ago everyday my hair looks like I just stepped out of the salon. Thank you for developing something that works.</li>
            <li> My wife has curly long hair.  She didn&#x27;t like the product.  It states a 30 day supply but that is if you short hair.  For long hair it will last two weeks.  They automatically send you new products.  When you try to return the product unused they will not give you your money back.  I do not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Wen is AWESOME!!  My hair has never been better.  I was skeptical at first about ordering it, but now that I have; regular shampoo will never touch my hair again!!  Thank you Chaz Dean!  Without a doubt hands down the best hair care product out there.</li>
            <li> The product made my hair start shedding. And a lot of it came out in the shower. Would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but amazing things to say about wen! My hair is softer and more manageable, but I must alternate my normal shampoo because my hair becomes weighed down after too many uses. The texture balm doesn&#x27;t do much for me, but the leave in is great in my daughters hair. My favorite product is the Re-moist Mask intensive hair treatment I absolutely love it. I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s worth the price because it&#x27;s definitesly expensive but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product.  I really liked it the first few times I used it, but then it started to make my blonde hair look brassy.  I stopped using it and went back to purple shampoo.  I will not order this product again.</li>
            <li> I really love the Wen products. This is a great value pack and worth purchasing to try the product. I highly recommend the Almond Mint!!</li>
            <li> I have thin ugly hair. When I started using this product people actully said to me...&amp;#34;wow you hair looks so healthy, what are you doing?&amp;#34; I even have new hair growth. Now don&#x27;t be mislead, if you have thin hair you have thin hair. This is not going to give you this head of hair like a sheep dog but it is nice and makes your hair feel so good. It give you a fighthing chance. I use this with the color flakes sold by other manufactures and my poor bald scalp is no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  Wish that it was cheaper thou.  Works well, I have very long hair and use this product on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Received as ordered and have used product three times and find my hair to be more soft and silky with less flyaway hair. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Okay, too many reviews on here are too lengthy and honestly too boring to read. So, I&#x27;m going to be straight up. This product is awful. It doesn&#x27;t clean my hair properly, and it makes it greasy at the roots and dry and brittle at the ends. I feel so bad for my hair because the wen product ruined it! Do not buy this product... ever. Don&#x27;t fall for the infomercials, either. THIS STUFF SUCKS.</li>
            <li> I had watched the Wen with Chaz Dean commercial so many times before I bought the wen sweet almond mint..I have long natural frizzy hair that I highlight, color and straighten!! So its oily at the roots have to wash everyday and dry everyehere else..I finally to the plunge and ordered it 8 months ago and I loved it right away. No more shampoo and conditioner just a one step cleanse. It makes my hair so much more managable smells so good and no longer breaking off like before. I no longer buy my Wen thru the the automatic send out I was running out before they sent a new supply and too expensive!! I order thru amazon and save time and money. Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> I do like the products - especially the styling balm.  It gets some getting used to - (the \\&quot;way\\&quot; you are supposed to use the products) - and - even for me (who has naturally curly hair -which tends to be dry)&lt;br /&gt;my hair was \\&quot;too\\&quot; soft!  I use the shampoo(it&#x27;s really conditioner) - mixed with my regular salon shampoo (otherwise, with my \\&quot;too soft\\&quot; hair -it tends to be limp - and not as \\&quot;curly\\&quot;  nor wild - which is how I like to wear it.  If you want to wear your hair straight - then it&#x27;s perfect for you.  I also mix the \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; (which is also the \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; - same bottle) - with my normal salon conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Wen kits twice before and returned them, feeling guilty about the cost since I am on a limited budget, and also because I did not want to get locked into some sort of recurring mail program that would most likely end up costing lots of money. I don&#x27;t like pressure like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally decided to try the original formula, Sweet Almond Mint, in a one-time kit shipment from a seller on Amazon. The price was right, and I wanted to try the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003PXZI2O WEN BY CHAZ DEAN SWEET ALMOND CONDITONER, STYLING CREME, RE MOIST MASK INTENSIVE HAIR TREATMENT, TEXTURE BALM, WIDE TOOTH SHOWER COMB, 5 PIECE SET, 1 TIME SHIPMENT]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight, I used Wen cleansing conditioner and styling creme on my hair for the first time, carefully following the directions: thoroughly wet your hair; use the proper amount of pumps (I have medium length hair, so I used four pumps on each of the four sections of hair); and make sure the cleansing conditioner is spread thoroughly throughout your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitive scalp, by the way, so I massaged the cleansing conditioner into my scalp as well as combed it through my hair, and my scalp felt instantly soothed, moisturized and comfortable. No stinging feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the cleansing conditioner on for at least five minutes while I finished my cleansing routine, then thoroughly rinsed it out, using slightly warm water--not cold, not hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt clean and light. The Sweet Almond Mint scent was calming and yet sophisticated, not overpowering at all. Just a clean smell overall. But the real test would come after I blew it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied a dime-sized amount of styling creme, combed out my hair easily--important to me due to my sensitive scalp, and combing out wet hair is always something I dread--and started drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finished, my hair felt luxuriously clean, with more body and less frizz, with gentle movement. My hair did not feelflat, greasy, limp, or any negative. But as I said, I followed the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually lose a bit of hair with each wash, and I still lost some hair this time. But I will keep using my Wen products each time I clean my hair, and hopefully, over time, there will be less hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there is a hot debate about this product, with some people loving it and others claiming it causes hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me, after one use, I give Wen five stars for living up to the hype. My hair is difficult--baby fine, tending to be oily, easily frizzy and just wavy enough to look messy--but tonight it looks great. Too bad I don&#x27;t have someplace to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those trying to decide whether or not to try this product, I suggest ordering a one-time starter kit from Amazon. It&#x27;s affordable, with no long-term obligations and money-sucking regular deliveries. If you don&#x27;t like it, you don&#x27;t have to worry about cancelling. Perhaps Wen works differently on various hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for my baby fine, thin, oily-prone medium length hair, it worked wonders after one use.</li>
            <li> I was extemely disappointed with this product.  It made my hair feel dirty and it was so heavy that I couldn&#x27;t even style it.  Besides all that, it smells like old lady shampoo.  Save your money!!!</li>
            <li> Made my hair greasy and flat not full and beautiful. I tried Dove damage repair after I tried Wen and it was 100 times better.</li>
            <li> i love wen it help me out so much my hair look so good now with me using wen you have to get it.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by friend. I ordered the starter pack for $29.95 which only came with a small bottle of the cleansing conditioner and a bunch of other products. The cleansing conditioner is satisfactory but not worth the money. The other products are terrible! After the first shipment the charge shipping and $90 for a three month supply which is a complete rip off. The customer service is appalling. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money like I did, don&#x27;t bother with this product or this company.</li>
            <li> After using this product...my hair started coming out in clumps during wash and after.  I will never recommend using this product.  I have natural afro-textured hair and yes it made my hair extremely soft and loosened my curls which leave me to wonder what really is in it but after using, I noticed so much of my hair coming out when I combed it and in 3 years I have never had that problem...After I stopped using chaz dean product, my hair stopped shedding excessively but not before I lost a significant amount...DO NOT USE...it is not worth it!  I didn&#x27;t want to rate this item but I had to put something in it...it doesn&#x27;t deserve 1 star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen hair care since early 2012 as I have thick naturally curly hair. I love Wen shampoo/conditioner combo, as my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy in humid conditions. Especially since I&#x27;ve cut my hair just above my shoulders, to the nape of my neck. I also love that there&#x27;s no detergents to strip my hair. Even my hairdresser, who I&#x27;ve been using for 19 years loves Wen as well. She loves the fact I have no issues with split ends or &amp;#34;dead ends&amp;#34; and she only thins out my hair as its quite thick, and I have a lot of hair. I won&#x27;t use any other products in my hair. 5 stars isn&#x27;t easy for me to give in the hair category, but this time it was easy.</li>
            <li> Wen was expensive, and the amount that is required to put in long thick hair is a half a bottle per time. So it runs out fast if you have any amount of hair. It does work tho.  Back when I tried it the smell was mint almond and it smelled medicated. Customer service is a hit and miss if you need something. If one person won&#x27;t help, hang up and call back.</li>
            <li> I followed rules to the T and my hair seems a little heavy.  I thought at first maybe i didnt get it all out but i tried again and again my hair seems heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> I bought this expensive product to see if it really made a difference, especially with prolonging my hair color, but was disappointed.  I have been using for 2 weeks now and am at the end of the bottle.  My color is fading just as it normally does with regular shampoo.  Initially my hair felt drier so I did re read the instructions and adjusted stuck to the exact amount of product and did leave in some for as a leave in conditioner.  My hair looks ok, no big difference from regular shampoo.  Certainly nothing like the results advertised.  Going back to regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I ordered Wen because of all the hype.  It is very expensive and after a period of time makes your hair very gummy.  DO NOT DO REORDER!  It comes out to $45.00 per bottle of cleanser.  They add some products in the \\&quot;kit\\&quot; but what you really use is the cleanser.  Ridiculous.  Do not buy</li>
            <li> Everyone should try this product.  It is amazing that after just one washing you will find your hair softer, and healthier. I have recommended this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> After I got the sample I wanted to try the other products but didn&#x27;t want the autoship. Love this product!</li>
            <li> This product worked for me. The change in my hair was subtle but they may be because. I had so little product.</li>
            <li> I bought hair one ( knock off from wen ) from sallys for around $10. It worked so amazing, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to spend $40 dollars for wen. No difference for me. I am African American with relaxed hair, and after my hair dried, it was sooo tangled. The moist mask treatment worked really well though! Needless to say, I will just continue to buy hair one. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product does work good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed my hair with this 2x so far and it works for me! I&#x27;m excited to see how much it will affect my hair after numerous uses.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and have naturally wavy course/thick hair at med/long length. Without products and a flat/curling iron, my hair is just an unmanageable frizz of poof. During winters, my scalp gets dry while my hair still gets oily (oiliness buildup happens year round). This is what I learned to accept as part of the great DNA passed from my parents and that there are no permanent fix. The only semi-permanent fix would be a 4-6 hour Chi hair relaxing service at a salon that can cost up to $300 with touch-ups. No thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product on an infomercial like the majority of customers 18 months ago and decided to give it a whirl. My expectation was that this product should let me straighten my hair out easier if it can really soften the texture. For the first three weeks, I used this product solely (washing every other day). A few days into the product, my hair did get softer but I never got it to look like the infomercial models, you&#x27;d need extensions and a pro stylist to get your hair rocking like that. Like many other customers, my hair began to hold greasy build-up and the smell of my scalp became unpleasant from my natural oiliness - gross.(I even tried to wash my hair with different temperatures) I knew I couldn&#x27;t continue on like this. So, I re-introduced my normal shampoo (Pantene - Volume) and cleared all the build-up away before following it up with the the Wen cleansing conditioner. I used 3-4 pumps focused on my lower end of my hair length versus my scalp. This is the regime I&#x27;ve been following since and its been working very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the balm as well because it is really heavy. It is most useful when you use small dabs of it to tame the most stubborn strands. Do not smooth it all over your hair if you want to keep your volume bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many others, I&#x27;m not crazy about the menthol in the product and I think the tingling feeling it creates on your scalp gives you a false sense of clean. I started trying the new scents as they come out and so far I really like the Lavender and Cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They send you two large bottles with two styling creams/balms every three months (Charging $30 on your credit card per month) (4 items total). Each shipment lasts me about 5-6 months, believe it or not. I have Wen extend my shipment to 2 times a year (you can easily request this by e-mail, phone, or online chat and they will update your account immediately.) So I end up paying $180 per year to use this as a conditioner and another $20 for 2 large bottles of Pantene coming out to $17 per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I feel like this cleansing conditioner is the \\&quot;IT\\&quot; product for me? No. In the last couple of months, I&#x27;ve tried other conditioners and am open to replacing this one if I find one that would give me better results.&lt;br /&gt;Do I think this product works? Only as a conditioner and not a shampoo replacement. For this reason, I am taking 2 stars away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From reading all other reviews, this product really doesn&#x27;t seem to be for everyone. Hence, I decided to write a review on it with my specific experience as a case study for people looking to try this. Good luck to my fellow ladies!</li>
            <li> Decided I wanted to try wen in sept. 2012. I ordered, then realized they over send products, plus my hair started to get waxy and straw-like. I realized the extras the send like the replenishing treatment and mist spray are either watered down shampoo or actual shampoo (the cleansing shampoo u bought a bottle of) in a different casing. I both changed my order preference online, and by calling twice to cancel auto send. I am still being billed! I have called many times to cancel and continue to be charged without receiving the product! Don&#x27;t buy this!!! It&#x27;s a rip off and scam!</li>
            <li> Someone who loves your product gave me a bottle to try and I used the whole bottle and I am ordering the kit today I didn&#x27;y like the fact that it didn&#x27;t foam but after I used it and seen how great it is I love it that it dosen&#x27;t foam and I am a believer your product is Awesome&lt;br /&gt;  Cork</li>
            <li> Worst business I have ever dealt with. They trick you into signing up for extra product to be purchased by shoving some sort of agreement in the fine print. Never once was I notified of this until my card was charged. The business is full of deceit and lies, don&#x27;t fall in the trap.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again.  It leaves hair feeling oily also leaves hair looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used the Wen hair care products before, but I didn&#x27;t like dealing with their enrollment and monthly shipments. This was perfect for me...no enrollment, I still get the good products and I can re-order when I am ready.  I have long (shoulder length), coarse, color treated hair.  The first time I tried it, I thought it was so-so.  I also use some very expensive salon products.  I re-ordered the Wen products when I found that the Wen shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment left my hair feeling softer, not as coarse and not as dry as the expensive salon products.  The service was great from Ginger Lily Boutique. I received the products about a week before they said I would.  It was exactly as I ordered.  I have only used the Sweet Almond Mint &#x27;flavor&#x27;.  Can anyone give me any feedback on the other fragrances?</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of the almond mint. It helps with frizzing as well. I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. The package came on time and well packed.&lt;br /&gt;Wife loves it, swears its her favorite hair product.&lt;br /&gt;I used it. I liked it. I mostly use the styling cream and my wife uses the shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;We are going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this product. she said it really works on her.. so i will be getting some more for my other 2 daughters. thank you.</li>
            <li> I loved the product. but!!!!! when i ordered it on amazon the description of the size was not clear. I paid just under $50.00 for this and when I received this it had an invoice for 20.00 . don&#x27;t understand why.... but I feel i over paid.</li>
            <li> I liked it .It is different then my regular shampoo . defanitly have body and less friz. I do Recommend  it to my friends.</li>
            <li> At first I was like alright....this makes my hair feel really nice,sleek and clean...then....the second time my hair was soooo greasy after washing and drying it....so then the third time I only massaged it in for one min. Then rinsed it out....still after it dried I was a greasy mess.I&#x27;m done with this crap.....yuckkkk</li>
            <li> I Love this product. After the first wash, you need to let it settle in. Then your hair will look Great! Wash every other day.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product. I have normal to dry hair. I gave it my best shot for one month before I gave up and returned to previously used products. I was left with heavy, limp hair with zero volume.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed. This works just wonderfully on my hair, and I got everyone in my family using it. I am of African decent, living in the Caribbean, the heat alone will kill the stability of one&#x27;s hair. but this, and sorry to sound cliche but it has changed a lot. I was relaxing my hair to avoid the difficulty of combing my natural hair. I used to break combs, sad to say, the density alone was too much for a comb and too much for me. I used to get major headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a friend had gotten it and said it did nothing to her hair. I saw the infomercial and thought i&#x27;d give it a try, After a month there is a major difference. I can pass a comb through without hurting my arm, head or breaking a comb. Hell, I can pass a fine tooth comb my natural hair. This has encouraged me to grow out my natural hair and save some money. lol. hairdressers are worse than bills.  It is softer, it is VERY easy to comb, it is THICKER than before and I actually never thought I would say it let alone think it.... I love my hair now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Wen girl.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, my sister used it on me, in combination with several other products she uses, back in April of 2013.  My hair looked great when she finished, but I also had mistreated my hair prior to that, so let&#x27;s just assume that anything I would do to it, would do wonders for my hair.  Then fast forward to August of 2013.  It was late at night and I was watching TV and low and behold, the commercial for the WEN product line comes out on television.  I start watching the infomercial and and listening \\&quot;CAREFULLY\\&quot; to the product line sale on the television. They had this amazing deal for 30 bucks and for 40 bucks, bringing several different items, including a free travel kit for making the purchase.  So of course, I was excited to buy it, because I know the product line is expensive. So I go ahead and purchase the product line, for the promotion.  After purchasing, you have to create a profile on their website, so if you decide to purchase again in the future from WEN, you can access it and what not.  Well, 2 weeks later I get the products and immediately use it.  I did however, do the exact same thing my sister did back in April, which was dye my hair prior to using the product, so my hair looked so shiny and beautiful.  To my surprise, I used the product again, and my hair did not have the same result as the initial use.  After a day, my hair lost it&#x27;s wave, became flat and honestly, a bit greasy.  I used the product to the exact instructions, the first time, as in the second time and the results were not the same. So I guess you can say I am a bit disappointed with the long use effect of the products.  NOWWWWW, the kicker.  A month after my initial purchase, I get an account alert from my bank on transactions, when I log in to check, to my surprise, I see a charge from WEN for close to 50 bucks. I called my bank immediately and disputed the charge, because I did not authorize any purchases of product since my initial purchase.  So my bank placed a note on my account and asked me to contact WEN about the issue.  I contacted WEN and boy what a total disappointment. Between the response from customer service, which pretty much summed it up that the whole thing is a marketing gimmick, to literally being cut off by the customer service representative as I was stating my dissatisfaction with everything. It seems that once you purchase the \\&quot;AMAZING DEAL\\&quot; you see advertised, you are actually binding yourself to a membership, which is why it&#x27;s so cheap at the initial purchase. When while being advertised at no point is it disclosed that your entering a membership with WEN.  The customer service representative stated that when I received my initial product, in the documents enclosed it talked about the membership commitment.  Really????  You want a customer service to know that after the fact, instead of at the initial purchase?  It is common sense, that the average consumer, once a product is ordered, they glance at their statement.  What you mainly look at are the charges.  If you are being charged what you know, and it states that, you don&#x27;t read on.  I believe their marketing team is fully aware of it, which is why it is done in the way they do it.  So as I am expressing to the customer service representative on how I think their whole concept is a gimmick to rob money from consumers, the customer service representative literally begins to speak over me, while I am talking, just trying to cut me off, telling me that I just need to return the items, and I will be refunded the charges and hung up.  This is not customer service in the least.  I just received last night two emails from WEN. One if for cancellation of the membership, which is also showing a balance of $130 or so and the second email is to provide feedback on my customer service experience.  Please explain to me, how I was just charged by their company 50 bucks, on a product they apparently shipped out, without me truly authorizing it, to now a balance due of $130 without even having products on hand?  I stated all of my experiences and concerns on my feedback for this company.  I am going to see if in fact I do receive the products they sent me.  If I do, I will be sending them back, with the accompaniment of a letter expressing everything again in detail and see how they handle.  If they continue to pursue me for an amount, that I did not agree with and wasn&#x27;t initially disclosed to me at the time of purchase, then I will report this entire transaction and the product line to consumer reports and whoever else I need to.  This is not the way business is handled.  BUYER BEWARE!!!ance due of $130 without even having products on hand?  I stated all of my experiences and concerns on my feedback for this company.  I am going to see if in fact I do receive the products they sent me.  If I do, I will be sending them back, with the accompaniment of a letter expressing everything again in detail and see how they handle.  If they continue to pursue me for an amount, that I did not agree with and wasn&#x27;t initially disclosed to me at the time of purchase, then I will report this entire transaction and the product line to consumer reports and whoever else I need to.  This is not the way business is handled.  BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> The real product that comes from the site WEN.com (own pain there but excellent product), has the first three ingredients as Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Camomilla Recutita flower extract... The FAKE version which, as many reviews state, makes your hair fall out!  I don&#x27;t know how, but it does, each time you use it!  This NOT normal!  Hair comes out drier than a broomstick!  So dissatisfied.  This is like the worst supermarket shampoo without conditioner, had trouble with tangling which never, ever occurs with the real one.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  I have tried to contact Amazon and the seller, BeautySupply, to no avail.  Usually there is something in the package like a reciept or business card with contact info.  This didn&#x27;t happen and I have paid 65.00 for a product I knew was good to get a fake and can&#x27;t seem to return it. My hair looks atrocious!</li>
            <li> This was the worst product that I have ever bought. My hair had never felt so nasty. It does nothing they promise. I called to complain to company and they were rude. Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> The product is great for my long hair.  Only thing is you do NOT need the amount of squirts stated on the bottle.  I use half the amount and it works great!</li>
            <li> This product does not clean hair.  It makes hair a greasy mess, even when you follow all of the directions to the T.  It has taken 3 washes to get my hair to not look greasy.  If I could give it negative stars I would have!</li>
            <li> You must follow the directions completely. I have short hair so I didn&#x27;t use as much product.  My hair after just a blow dry was very manageable and straight. Take your time applying and I found the results were great. My only complaint is the price for how little you get in the bottle. My hair type is fine and oily at the scalp and dry on the ends.  Hope this helps others.</li>
            <li> It brought everything that its showed. Leaves the hair soft and with shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trajo todo lo que se muestra en el dibujo. Deja el cabello suave y con brillo. El cabello de mi hija es ahora mucho mas facil para desenredar.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen since Feb. 2010 and it works wonders on my hair. I did not want a membership so it was great to see that I have the option of a one time shipment. I do not use the product as often as they send it so it is nice to have that option.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and stay away of Wen. I wasted my money, my hair never looked so ugly as it did after using Wen. It went back to Loreal and Garnier, even though they aren&#x27;t that expensive the quality is superior. Wen is a scam. Went destroyed my hair. There is no money back guarantee. I rate this product: zero starts. The delivery was also awful, it took over a month to get home....Avoid Wen or you regret it :(</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that is fine in consistency so it tends to frizz.  I used the product as per the directions and found that it really didn&#x27;t work on my hair.  I ended up giving it to a friend who had better luck with it.  If you have easy-to-deal-with hair, I think that Wen would work well for you.  But if you have crazy curly dry hair...not so much.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products. WEN leaves my hair soft and manageable. Its a bit different than using typical shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t lather and sud up. But it leaves my scalp and hair clean and smelling fresh. I am an african american woman with type 3c hair, so my hair is very tightly coiled and gets EXTREMELY dry and prone to breakage. Since using this shampoo, I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore. My hair is so moisturized that it doesn&#x27;t shrink and bunch up like it used to. If your looking for a great product that will clean and moisturize your hair without damaging it, this is a great choice! Also the shipper had it sent VERY quickly. I will definitely be reordering.</li>
            <li> OK, so \\&quot;washing\\&quot; your hair with conditioner?? This should have been my first indicator that this was not for me but I had to try it. Well I should have kept my $30 and gone with my gut instincts because \\&quot;after just one use\\&quot; my hair was as oily as if I hadn&#x27;t washed it in two weeks. I could literally run my fingers down a lock of hair and feel a layer of oil between my fingers. I have naturally curly hair and used the tea tree Wen. I would rather spend $50 on a 32oz bottle of the best shampoo on earth than spend even $5 more dollars on any size bottle of Wen. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Unless you want greasy or dry hair - do not order these products! I am so disappointed! I tried it....I really did!!  I still have the crap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEN by CHAZ DEAN &#x3D; NEGATIVE EFFECT ON HAIR AND MOOD. CALLED AND CANCELLED ORDER, AND JUST RECEIVED ANOTHER BATCH! AWESOME! JUST PLEASE, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO A FRIEND!</li>
            <li> While house sitting for a friend, I got to try Wen. My hair is a little dry and I have split ends. I used it one time and my hair was shiny, healthy and even my color was more vibrant. I then brought it home to my soon to be mother in law who used it and she loved it too. We will now use nothing but Wen on our hair for ever and ever! Thank you for such a wonderful product! It&#x27;s great having movie star hair too at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> The product definitely made my hair soft.  It also was easy to syle and gave me lots of volume. However, my hair is just as soft and managable with products I&#x27;ve bought at a drug store.  Also, I prefer those products because I could go a day in between without washing my hair and it would look fine - with the Wen product, my hair looked dirty within 24 hours.  Not wasting my money again.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be great on my hair since some times the ends seem to dry out, but no it only made my hair look greasy and unwashed. Smells great but the end result not so great</li>
            <li> Dec 2012 -- Suave is BETTER. Wen products does NOT produce ANY results advertised. Used Wen during a 2-month period. Large amounts of cleansing conditioner needed for even SHORT hair! On a scale of 1:5, I rate it a NEGATIVE 10. If you MUST try this product, DON&#x27;T buy it, find someone who has it and get samples. Keep your $$ -- Suave is MUCH better. (Suave produces good, consistent results.) Ciao.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone with any hair type.  It makes your hair feel silky smooth and manageable!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think it&#x27;s the best ever!</li>
            <li> First use: My hair was very, very dry. Second use: Ok, no better than my normal Organix shampoo. Third use: Oil slick, even when i rinsed for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also has a dimethicone derivative in it, so eventually there will be build up. It is billed as being SO natural...but if you just read the ingredients you will see that that is not the case at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: You have to have a lot of time on your hands to use this product (the \\&quot;deep conditioning treatment\\&quot; has to be left in for 20-30 minutes, you have to scrub your hair for a really long time, and then leave the product in for several minutes, and then rinse for several minutes) and if you have long hair it will break the bank. I used my bottle up in 2 weeks, even with going several days between washings like the instructions said (yuck).</li>
            <li> I bought for my daughter who is very skeptical of anything from an infomercial. After using the products, she&lt;br /&gt;raved about the products and her hair. Definitely 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it is the only thing I can use now everything else dries my hair out too much</li>
            <li> I used wen for two weeks on the trial. I called and cancelled future shipments. Received another, my card debited, and called again. This went on.....and on.... Until I changed my card number. Didn&#x27;t matter, they just sent shipments and billed me. I sent them back, the claimed they didn&#x27;t receive them. I was calling several times a month, wrote letters, etc. then they sent me to collections. Keep in mind I sent the shipments back. My mistake was not getting signed delivery confirmation until the last time. When they tried to claim that one never showed up, I knew it was pointless. There is a class action lawsuit underway. Everyone who has gone through this needs to look into it. I lost a lot of money and now let me explain why I TRIED canceling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly after good results the first few times, it left my normally dry hair very greasy, and nasty. I have great very thick, very long hair. I am very grateful for my hair actually, but this stuff ruined it. Seriously, using cheap suave is way better on my hair this this. I would not have minded paying the cost a bit had it worked and I actually kept the product.  Paying for it while sending it back as package refusal so I didn&#x27;t pay return shipping, or sending with delivery confirmation ended up with the same \\&quot; we didn&#x27;t receive it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so dissappointed in a product in my life.  I used it exactly per directions and it set my scalp to itching unbearably and did absolutely nothing for my hair.  I was miserable for several days with the itching until I massaged plain yogurt into my scalp on my husband&#x27;s suggestion and got relief.  The yogurt did my hair more good too.</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars because of the amount of money. Chaz Dean....this product is awesome, but NOT WORTH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU ARE CHARGING. It needs to be in a MUCH bigger bottle to get away with this price. Please know, that you must use 10-15 pumps for medium length hair....I have hair half way down my back, so I have to use 20ish. This bottle only lasted me 2 1/2 weeks! I am a professional hairdresser, and I do love how my hair glows as a result of these products. And I WOULD reffer my clients to this prodcut if it weren&#x27;t so expensive! Love it though.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all. As usual, I did my research and read the reviews. Not all good but I still wanted to give it a try. I read the directions and watched the video on how to use this product. I knew there wouldn&#x27;t be any foam, part your hair into sections, apply to ponytail, etc. Right away my hair did feel soft. However, by mid day my hair was already looking greasy. By the evening it looked as if I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair for days. I continued to use it for about a week and a half and still had the same results. Also, the suggested amount to use for each section of your hair is way too much in my opinion.If you divided your hair in four sections, each section needed about 3 to 5 pumps!! That means 12 to 20 pumps for your entire head, every wash. Thats crazy! I tried different amounts every time I washed, and each time I was dissatisfied. What I ended up doing was use regular shampoo for my scalp and used wen for my ends. I did that because I wanted to use it somehow. All in all, this product did not work for me and I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what all of the hype is about.  If you actually use the amount that they recommend on the Wen website, you&#x27;ll use the entire bottle in 3 washes! It makes your hair super greasy too.  Yes, I followed the directions.  I certainly don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered WEN from Amazon [Exquisite Emporium/ab-bookshop] because it said [ 1 TIME SHIPMENT - NO CONTRACT! NO MEMBERSHIP! NO BILLS! NO AUTO-SHIPMENTS! ]. I paid through Amazon and 5 months later got a 98.84 bill from Wen saying that I am enrolled in getting Wen products every 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I NEVER ok&#x27;d this. The only reason I bought from Amazon [Exquisite Emporium/ab-bookshop] is because it said ONE TIME SHIPMENT. They took my information and enrolled me for a &#x27;continuous membership&#x27; behind my back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LUCKLIY the customer service at WEN is excellent. I did not get charged the $98.84 AND they even sent me free products for my troubles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY WEN FROM WEN or risk getting auto-enrolled in a plan you never ok&#x27;d and getting a surprise bill in the coming months.</li>
            <li> Do not believe the Product Description.  It is a bold faced CAPITALIZED LIE!  They will auto enroll you in a recurring shipment at a price of over $100 every quarter.  Trying to get this canceled through their customer service is like talking to a brick wall, because they say they cannot help you since you didn&#x27;t order it through their website.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> FIRST off...The SELLER was no problem at all (thank you!) and this was a great way to order a \\&quot;one time shipment\\&quot; of the Wen system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen the informercial and I really wanted to love this product.  My hair is long and has a slight wave to it (I straighten it) and thought this might be the magic product for my hair.  NOPE!!!!  It feels great while using it, but even after a blowout, it&#x27;s FRIZZY and looks parched!  I wake up looking like a LION every morning now and have to re-cleanse daily (instead of every other like my long hair is used to).  I even tried using the \\&quot;intensive mask conditioner\\&quot; that came with it and I think it made my hair worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it three weeks and I will NOT be reordering and will be going back to my old John Freida products.  Glad I tried it, but this is NOT for me (or anyone with the tendency to be frizzy).&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0048O2R1E WEN® Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]]</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am the mother of three girls, with four heads of different hair types. Wen is the only product that works well on all four of us. My hair is thick and very curly. Wen was able to get all the way to the root and fix the damgage that had beeen done by previous non-wen products. I feel confidant now to rock my curls in all their fuffy fullness. Thanks Wen!</li>
            <li> i just got it and i used to use this a long time ago...id order it str8 from chaz dean and not on here cause they have the same trail pack thing like this but its alot more product this set is really tiny and for the same price you can get it alot bigger then these small bottles...they said they shipped it and there was NO TRACKING and then i got a 2nd message saying they shipped it again 3 days later and sent me a tracking...not sure what that was about</li>
            <li> I received my product in a timely fashion, but was furious that I had been enrolled in an unauthorized autoship program with Gunthy Renker! I had gone to great lengths just to avoid that very issue and this seller specifically states \\&quot;1 time shipment\\&quot;.  I had to call Gunthy Renker to cancel the autoship and was told that regardless of who you order this product from, it comes from them and you get enrolled. I will not order from this seller again simply because of their misleading statement of a one time shipment.  If I like the product then I will simply order directly through Gunthy Renker!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  I used the entire bottle and my experience was that my hair was dirty by the end of the day and the texture was different too.  I love the comb and use the hair smoother daily--its terrific.  I will not purchase the conditioning cleaner again.</li>
            <li> It did wonders for my hair. I also used this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair too.  If you used right, it will work.</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEN!!! ITS WONDERFUL, CHANGED MY HAIR!  that being said, do not order from guthy renker!!&lt;br /&gt; I was so excited to order wen through the infomercial, when i got it I loved it. My second month did not come. I waited for my shipment and still another month passed and did not recieve it. So I called and the guy told me it had shipped the day before. So finally excited again I waited. Nothing came, and I was not charged, so I knew something was up. When I called again, I was told nothing shipped, therefor I was lied to. A little irritated I told them to go ahead and cancel because I was threw with the horrible customer service. The woman said,  &#x27;oh, your credit card information is missing and your package was just sent with a bill in it, but ill cancel for future&#x27;. I said that was fine. Oh yay, some Wen on the way and then ill just order from qvc or amazon (both who i trust). Well....nothing came!!!! no bill, no nothing! I figured, well at least she cancelled it for me, thank goodness.  Well....2 months later a huge box arrives with a 6 month supply of wen!! what???!!! Now Im really mad! they charged me double for something I didnt want. and what happened to the fact that they did not have my credit card information???? Lied to again! I called and they apologized of course, sent me a return label and \\&quot;cancelled my order\\&quot;! yea, right?!!!  3 months past and my order was paid off (i decided to keep it). again, i thought I was done with it. Well...today I got another shipment... Im so mad im shaking!!!!!! I cant stand being treated like this! These people have my credit card info and wont stop will they??!! I had the same coversation this morning...&#x27;oh, so sorry, its cancelled now, we&#x27;ll send a return label, so sorry.&#x27;.....blahblahblah! Im tired of it!  I love the product, but this stuff is not cheap..I recently went to college and im in between jobs...im broke...cant afford this irresponsible customer service! I dont know what to do, I will be calling though, alot,to make sure its cancelled! Its really sad since its such a great product. ORDER FROM AMAZON OR QVC....NOT GUTHY RENKER!!</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and i wasnt impressed i followed the directions and i didnt see a difference. It worked the same as my suave almond and shea butter n was alot cheaper very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been debating this purchase for 3 years..haha, that&#x27;s a long time to build up hype. I finally got this as a birthday present. If you order from Wen ( even if it&#x27;s a present) READ THE FINE PRINT! They automatically sign you up for the auto delivery, so you have to call and cancel that. I was excited to say the least for the first use, so after a month- here&#x27;s what I came up with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;Lots of products to try&lt;br /&gt;Controlled flyaways better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Had a haircut right before I started using it, and usually I start seeing split ends in a month but I haven&#x27;t noticed any&lt;br /&gt;Hair seemed shinier and softer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Confusing instructions, the bottle says one thing and the insert says another. I think they just want you to use a lot and run out quickly&lt;br /&gt;The comb smells like formaldehyde. As soon as I opened the packaging, the stench was overwhelming. I let it air out and it got better, but if I tried to use it in the shower or on wet hair, the smell came back. I ended up throwing the comb in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;Moisture Mask- left my hair feeling extremely dull and dry&lt;br /&gt;Texture balm- use very little!! Can make hair look very oily and I don&#x27;t like the applicable form of this because it&#x27;s a solid wax column in push-pop container and it&#x27;s hard to tell how much you are using with the delivery system&lt;br /&gt;Styling Creme- I used it for a couple days, my hair didn&#x27;t look any different with or without it, so I quit using it since it was just more product&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff- I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, and never really had a problem with dandruff, but about day 3 post shampoo, dandruff flakes were falling off my head like an avalanche! and I was constantly itching my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Left my hair feeling very very thin! I love my thick hair, but since I started using Wen, I noticed that it started losing body and kind of lifeless and thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried it, but it&#x27;s not for my hair needs.I think any product that has more negative reviews than positive ones is definitely not worth the money to experiment with, but if you need to fill up a birthday or christmas wish list, then get some family member to buy it for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I think Wen is like any other informercial product. It works well for a selective few, but for the vast majority it is just money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I will be ordering more! I am absolutely amazed with this product and its incredible with curly hair! Thank you</li>
            <li> My wife really love. and asking me to buy more of this product. She highly recommended it to her fellow women.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  I followed the directions exactly as stated. The product dried out my hair from the first use. My hair was so dry that it was uncontrollable. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff it makes my hair soft and eay to comb and my scalp fills clean as wells as my hair</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product. I was interested in the &#x27;no laurel sulfate&#x27; and wanted to try a more healthy product without harsh chemicals.  This WEN stuff made my hair feel greasy, yes i rinsed it throughly. I had no body and my hair looked dull :(  I am sticking with biolage, TIGI, and my Rusk shampoos. I have very fine hair that is very smooth, and already has a nice sheen- but when just made it very greasy. I usually go every other day Shampooing, but my hair looked greasy later the same day I washed it :( boo.</li>
            <li> When I first started using Wen I really liked it.  It seemed to moisturize my hair and really bring out the curl.  Slowly my hair started getting really dry and frizzy.  Unfortunately, I thought the solution was to use more Wen and more often.  My hair reacted by becoming so dry and frizzy that it was starting to feel like hay and was breaking all of the time.  I started to get really scared and wondered what was causing it.  I started to do a lot of research online on my hair loss and found other reviews about people who had experienced hair loss after using Wen. I got off Wen and switched to the Body Shop shampoo and conditioner which contains no hard chemicals.  It took about 1 to 2 weeks but eventually my hair stopped breaking and feels really soft again.  I pitched all that I had left of Wen and will never go back to using it.</li>
            <li> My wife got a bad perm, she tried many products and nothing was helping. I bought her this and her hair became more healthier. She is happy so I am happy. Thanks Wen. :)</li>
            <li> My hair is thick any fuzzy so I was hoping wen would help with that.  The sweet almond mint smells good but the cleansing conditioner made my hair fall out!  It leaves a waxy coating on your hair, it took about a month for my hair to get back to normal.  I started to loose hair around my hair line... So I threw the whole thing in the garbage. I didn&#x27;t want to deal with returning it.  Don&#x27;t wast your money, go to a salon and buy something good from your hairdresser!</li>
            <li> my wife&#x27;s hair smells great and she loves this product. The only thing that she doesn&#x27;t care for is that it a minty smell and tingles her scalp a little.</li>
            <li> Receieved quickly. Only used once but my hair felt thicker and more manageable. At this point I feel I need to use more before I make a more informed suggestion.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful... I have dry course hair and there is no othee product that helps my natural hair retain moisture...</li>
            <li> I have to say that the Wen is really worth it.  My fine blonde dyed hair with gray is youthful again.  The grey has stopped being unmanageable and the color lasts.  It does appear thicker and doesn&#x27;t break off in my comb and brush as it did before.  I am using it since March of 2012.  The lavender for fine hair can be a little too much but the Pomegrante and Almond are perfect.  I only use 3 pumps for my chin level hair.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> As i first started using this (the first few days) my hair was super shiny and soft.  However, my hair never got as clean as I would have liked.  It also started to make my hair smell dirty as if I had just worked out and not showered.  The styling cream is awesome though! I will keep using it.  I will probably use the conditioner every few shampoos rather than every time I shower</li>
            <li> Nice to try a sample it made my hair greasy, limp &amp; dull. Having seen the commercials I was very excited to try this product very disappointing as well as not being aware when I purchased it with my Credit card I had automatically signed up for auto renewal I don&#x27;t like the sneakiness of that move. Had I not read every scrap of paper that come with the box I wouldn&#x27;t have known. There is an 800 number to call to cancel but I shouldn&#x27;t have had to in the first place!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I will not go back to regular shampoo. I had a friend who tried for months to get me to try WEN. I wish now I had listened to her months ago.</li>
            <li> For years I wanted to try this product, but was leery that it was just another infomercial advertising ploy that a lot of people got sucked into.  \\&quot;Surely my childhood favorite, Melissa Gilbert (Laura Ingalls), wouldn&#x27;t be a spokesperson for a bad product\\&quot; I thought.  I read up on it and saw that many people talked about hair loss. Despite that information, I bought a multi-pack with several samples.  Well, almost immediately I started losing large amounts of hair while washing it in the shower.I&#x27;m talking about a large handful of hair! This was happening every time I washed my hair.  Plus, with my long hair, I had to use so much of the product that I figured the bottle wouldn&#x27;t last more than one or two weeks.  The hair loss didn&#x27;t stop. I was so desperate to get smooth, silky hair, that I kept hoping it would stop, and even rationalized that stress from a job was causing it, and not the product. Then I thought maybe I had an iron deficiency that was causing it.  If this was the case, why did the hair loss start with the first use of Wen? I just didn&#x27;t want to believe that this product would really make me lose my hair. It seems crazy. If this happens to you, do not keep using it, with the hope that it will soon stop!It&#x27;s not going to. In two weeks of product use, I lost a noticeable amount of hair that is finally growing back after four months.  My hairdresser admitted that my hair felt much thinner. I have short little fly aways all over my head. I actually  had to do some different styling to camouflage the hair loss.  After I finally came to the conclusion that it was the product, I stopped using it and started using my regular product. Immediately, I would only lose the normal amount of hair that a person would expect. Maybe this won&#x27;t happen to you, but it did to me,and it has happened to many other people (do some online research) and I did not think it would.  Also--if you have longer hair, you are not going to believe how much of the product they recommendthat you use--several pumps (like 6) on each section of hair. Even if you don&#x27;t lose your hair, you are going to need to replenish this product very often, and it is not cheap.ALSO-I was just reading some of the other reviews and someone mentioned scalp break outs!  I had forgotten about this. This happened to me too!  I had all kinds of little sores on my scalp that I have never had before.  This product is not for everyone--be aware and stop using if you have these problems because I don&#x27;t believe they will get better eventually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost the entire bottle of product and I don&#x27;t see much result. I do like the Hair Creme. It does work well on flyaways.</li>
            <li> My hair color is not fading after using this product, it definitely is shinier, has a thickier feel and has more body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used Wen about three times and I just can&#x27;t stand how greasy it makes my hair. I am a natural red-head with fine-medium hair (like Jessica Chastain and Amy Adams). I decided to darken my hair and heard that one of the benefits of Wen is that it makes your color last longer (and if you&#x27;ve ever died your hair red, you know how fast it fades!). But I just can&#x27;t get past how greasy Wen makes my hair. My hair is greasy at the scalp and lifeless at the ends. Even if it does hold up my color better, I&#x27;ll stick to my normal shampoo/conditioner routine and take more trips to the salon!</li>
            <li> Once again I fell for the ole witch oil trick&#x3D; from now on I will turn the channels when I see these nuts on tv. the only thing worst than the nut on tv and the people who are paid to lie for them are the nuts who buy their product. Shame on me</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical about buying products seen on infovisions. But Wen by Chaz Dean really works! My hair was dry and fly-away from years of coloring. After one use, I could actually see and feel a dfference!! Now, my hair has body and shine! Another great thing about this product is if you color your hair, this product doesn&#x27;t strip your color so your color lasts longer. Depending on the length of your hair, you will have to adjust the recommended usage. It may take you a couple of times of using this product to get your new routine down but it&#x27;s well worth your time. And the sweet almond mint fragrance is very nice, not over powering at all. Once you use this product, you will never go back to regular shampoo again.</li>
            <li> I used this product four times, each time following the directions exactly.  The top of my hair was greasy and weird, while the rest of my hair was dried out and a frizzy mess.  I wouldn&#x27;t wash our pet lab with this stuff!  In addition to that, after I cancelled my account, a return label was to be sent so that I could send back the remaining product.  That label was never sent, so I requested a second label.  It&#x27;s been over a week and the second request label still hasn&#x27;t arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t bother with this stuff.  I&#x27;m amazed that Guthy-Renker still promotes the line.</li>
            <li> hard to rinse out. will not use again. the deep weekly conditioner is like grease, and the comb would not go thru my hair..</li>
            <li> Wen is a great product, but it is not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I liked that Wen had a pleasant aroma and had a very creamy texture which felt great when FIRST applied to my soaking wet hair. My fingers could glide through my wet hair with ease, but as I looked down, my hair was coming out in chunks. Two handfuls of hair and a 40 minute shower later I dried my hair only to find it looked and felt exactly the same as before using Wen. The only difference was the day proceeding my first use of Wen, I had never seen my hair so matted and tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I just wish I was one of the people Wen actually worked on!</li>
            <li> Bought it and it sat on a shelf for six months. After a hair color my hair was unusually dry so I reached for the wen, I used half the pumps it called for, rinsed it really well and put my hair in a towel for about an hour then dried it with blow dryer. It looked and felt great. Brought the color back and my kinky hair was smooth like when my stylist does it, saving me $30.00. Trick is go easy on how much you apply and go easy on any other product you use for styling. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS TOO THICK IF I DON&#x27;T WASH MY HAIR FOR A DAY IT BECOMES GREASY WHEN JUST USING THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO LIKE THE CONDITIONER IT COMES WITH IT DOES WONDERS FOR MY HAIR!</li>
            <li> I can say this product didn&#x27;t work for me, or my daughter, didn&#x27;t see any good change, only got grease and with a built up, I used small amounts and it never feel clean, when I used more it was worse!&lt;br /&gt;Costumer service is terrible keep sending me stuff and charge me before I did actually arrive, after cancel the subscription I still had a charge that had to dispute with my credit card.&lt;br /&gt;I will advice people to first read the reviews before making a purchase,!</li>
            <li> I love this product i noticed the difference on the first use. I would purchase again and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but it was not enough to last because I have long hair. I wish there was more</li>
            <li> I would never order this again! It&#x27;s fine if you want to use it in addition to your shampoo as a conditioner but it really doesn&#x27;t clean your hair....leaves roots feeling dirty and weighed-down. Also you might as well buy it directly from the Chaz Dean website because this seller (Exquisite Emporium is a scam). They will enroll you in the auto-ship and the product comes directly from Chaz Dean charging you another $9.95 for shipping in addition to what I paid on Amazon......I had to call the Chaz Dean company and have them cancel my auto ship or they would have sent me more product every 90 days......</li>
            <li> My hair is better moisturized and my scalp does not itch after using this product. I like the fact that my hair is not a tangled mess since the cleanser is a conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthier, smoother and fewer trimming (no spit ends).  Many compliments on the healthiness and shine of my hair.</li>
            <li> I needed something for my scalp it was so dry and flaky and the anti dandruff shampoos made it worse, I love the Wen for my hair it was shiny and smooth, the shampoo is like conditioner it don&#x27;t lather and the longer you leave it in the better it is for your hair, if it were cheaper I would still use it.  It helped my scalp a little, the best thing that works for me is Suave for Men, peppermint.</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged from over-processing, coloring, bleaching...the works.  My hair is also very fine.&lt;br /&gt;After my sister recommended Wen and watching the infomercials, I decided to order the kit from HSN.&lt;br /&gt;I got it last Saturday and used it for the first time.  I was expecting some positive results but nothing really huge.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong!  My hair was immediately at least 90% better: softer, shinier, so easy to comb through!  My hair felt almost as good as it did before I started messing with it.  Last night (Tuesday) I washed it with the Wen products for the second time.  This time my hair was even better!!!  I am so completely surprised and happy with the results!  My hair is pretty again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends that I talked to about this told me she tried it and it didn&#x27;t work well for her.  I asked her how she used the products and I think the problem was that she didn&#x27;t really rinse like she should have--or she didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.  I feel that the longer you leave it on the better it will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked.  I can&#x27;t imagine how I could ever go back to regular shampoo.  And if you get it though HSN or something like that, you get it way cheaper and the price is locked in.  Yes!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been a customer of Wen for 1 year.  This has been a complete fiasco. I would advise their products are not that good. They make your hair greasy and leave a build up of product on your hair.  I have tried of scents and they have a medicine smell to them all.  I am not happy with the customer service support team .  They had me in as 2 accounts .  I had  recieved 4 extra sets of the two set large orders.  That is HUGE amount of product.  I have spent alot of money sending them back.  I was never reimbursed for shipping them back for their screw up.  Now I just received another and I had called them telling them I wasn&#x27;t ready for a shipment in April.  May 1 is when i would need another shipment.  I told the customer service agent again before we hung up. I DO NOT want an order in April.  You have that corrected in my account.  She said Yes Maam.  May 1, 2013.  I said good. Thank you.  Well now I have received a shipment I was not ready to pay for.  I had money in my account for my childs school lunch and now that my account is over drawn almost $300.00. The company can put the amount through 2 times and with the overdraft fees. My goodness this is what I was trying to avoid.  Then I had given  my child a check for  school lunch money. Well that bounced too. Well I guess you figure you won&#x27;t get taken advantage of but that happens everyday. Who is going to stand up to a corporation. Well I am sure I am not the only person this happened too.  Then when you call the customer service for  help, this company service agent laughs at you on the phone. Actually I was helping to pay your salary . I said,\\&quot; really is this funny to you.\\&quot; He didn&#x27;t say a word.  How can an American company get away with this.  I will be contacting the BBB for this matter.  I as an American consumer and  do not feel we should be able to take advantage of one another.  Where is the respect for one another?</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed, but it could just be my hair type. The leave in products seem to work fine, but the cleansing conditioners gave me dandruff. I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was cleaning my hair very well, either.</li>
            <li> I am still enjoying the benefits of these products.  The deep conditioner is wonderful and I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This company is owned by the same parent company, Guthy Renker,  that owns ProActiv. So anyone who has dealt with them and their business practices know exactly what I am talking about. They pull you in and then you find out they charge exorbidant amounts on your credit card for further shipments. And trying to get them to stop or get your money back is a nightmare. Don&#x27;t fall for it, you&#x27;ll be sorry if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced, not very effective and a nightmare to deal with the company. If I could do a negative rating I would.</li>
            <li> great product works better then shampoo.I wood recommend this product to any body who wants better looking hair that feels great.</li>
            <li> I love the comb and the texture bald.  The cleaner does straighten your hair.  However, for me, it left my hair feeling kind of tacking.  So I discontinue using the product.  However, the comb is great for detangling.  The texture bald is great for hold hair in place without the hard-fix that hair spray does.</li>
            <li> Motivation for Ordering:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After viewing the infomercial for some years, I decided to order the Wen Sweet Almond Mint hair care kit. I wanted a product that was gentle on my multi-racial fine and soft hair (African American/European American).  My down my back medium length hair is so soft that it will not hold a curl, and nor will it hold an up do without tons of hair spray and lots of hair pins--see photo.  The kit contained all the products pictured here: Sweet Almond Mint Conditioner (12 oz.), Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment (2 oz.), Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cream (2 oz.), Sweet Mint Texture Balm (.35 oz.), and a black wide-tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product for two months and my hair color changed from a soft dark brown to a brassy auburn, so I thought.  The texture of my hair changed from soft and smooth to a wooly, brittle, frizzy, and wiry texture.  I went to my stylist to see what we could do to change my hair texture and color back to its original glamorous condition.  She stated, \\&quot;Your hair is fried, we will have to cut it all off, what have you been using!\\&quot; I told her that I had ordered Wen because I watched the TV commercials, and it implied that Wen was much more gentle than regular shampoo.  The lovely head of gorgeous hair in the photo is all gone.  My stylist had to cut my hair to within an inch of my scalp.  It is gradually growing back with the aid of vitamins and my regular hair care products. Friends, family members, and persons at my house of faith were astonished at the transformation.  I told them of my experience with Wen.  The proof is in the post pictures, that I am not bold enough to share online, and the astonished looks on their faces. I&#x27;ve heard whispers, \\&quot;What happened to her hair!\\&quot;  No, I&#x27;m not taking chemo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Mailings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you order Wen, there are two boxes you can check to opt out of receiving additional mailings of the product, and the other allows them to release your info to third parties.  I selected no for both boxes.  Wen put me on the list anyway even though I had opted out of receiving additional products.  When I called, I spoke to someone in Asia (India) they said that they didn&#x27;t want me to run out. \\&quot;I told them I checked the no box.  They then proceeded to ask why I wanted to cancel, and I told them that the color and texture of my hair changed and my stylist had to cut away the damaged hair.  They said, \\&quot;We have a product especially for ethnic hair.\\&quot;  I declined.  However, I had to pay the $10.40/per box shipping charges and waste my gas to travel to and from the post office to return the mailings I didn&#x27;t order.  The post office does not accept &#x27;return to sender&#x27; for the Wen products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t do enough research before ordering this product.  I should have read all the reviews prior to ordering this product.  My hair was my thing and now it&#x27;s all gone.  Who knows how long it will take to recover.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bother me is that when you call to cancel the next shipment so your credit card can&#x27;t be charge the operators seem to give you a hard time and attitude about why you can&#x27;t cancel. I had to keep telling them that i can cancel at anytime.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. I have thick hair and It worked perfectly. I love the feel that the product left on my hair</li>
            <li> How anyone can buy a hair care product whose name means \\&quot;a boil or other swelling or growth on the skin, esp. a sebaceous cyst\\&quot; is beyond me.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, just google \\&quot;definition wen\\&quot; and see for yourself.  Maybe \\&quot;Chaz Dean\\&quot; is really some Chinese entrepreneur who didn&#x27;t go to the trouble of looking up the word.</li>
            <li> I am surre Chaz is an outstanding hairdresser, but his products left my hair feeling heavy and a wee bit greasy.  Oh, like you I have seen the commercial and was so excited I could get it for less on amazon, but the only things I liked were the excitment of getting started and the sweet scent.  God bless you and good luck.</li>
            <li> If you\\&quot;re looking for a product to remove every single wave, this is the product for you.  I prefer some wave in my hair.  However, this formula is better than the \\&quot;Spring Gardenia Green Tea\\&quot; formula, which left my hair dry &amp; lifeless.  I checked the ingredients on the container of both the \\&quot;Sweet Almond Mint\\&quot; cleansing conditioner &amp; the \\&quot;Spring Gardenia Green Tea\\&quot; cleansing conditioner, it appears they are formulated a little differently. The \\&quot;Sweet Almond Mint\\&quot; formula appeared to have ingredients that are beneficial for hair that isn&#x27;t naturally oily.</li>
            <li> I too, at first, felt my hair was still greasy after shampooing.  The trick for me with my fine, medium length, wavy hair, was to use less than 1/2 the amount, spread the shampoo evenly, and rinse a great deal more than you think it needs. That way, the product works, will not fade your color, and your hair will be healthy. I believe most people use too much, saturate the crown of the head too much, and do not rinse well. I will not use any other shampoo, and buy this by the gallon. I&#x27;ve tried sweet almond and fig. Fig works better for my lightened, fine hair.</li>
            <li> i bought these products for my girl and everytime she uses it i notice a difference in my girls hair...but u have to use it frequently to reap the benefits....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps...</li>
            <li> Loving what this is doing for my hair!!  Convenient way to try this product without signing up for auto delivery through wen&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to return this sub-par product which did the complete opposite of what they claimed...aka makes your hair nice and greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling to cancel the remaining shipments through their automated answering service we were told our account was canceled and we wouldn&#x27;t be charged or sent anymore product...Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next month we received another shipment and were billed again :0 So we called and cancelled again using their automated answering service. (SPOILER: their automated answer service obviously doesn&#x27;t work because we got billed again!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to stay on until I spoke with a REAL PERSON (I recommend getting a good book to read while you wait.) and I eventually had the pleasure of speaking with \\&quot;Darius\\&quot; who informed me if I returned the product I would get a refund.  I fedex&#x27;d them back their product and mistakenly assumed I was done with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.  Next we received a collection letter from the wonderful people over at Wen.  Funny, I assumed canceling THREE times would be enough to have them get the hint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling back again and waiting an hour again to speak to a live individual I was finally informed by a \\&quot;supervisor\\&quot; the account would finally be canceled and I would receive my refund. (Never do business with a company that refuses to EMAIL you a confirmation the account is canceled...they would only send it by mail.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know they&#x27;re lying to me like they lied to me the previous three times but I&#x27;m sure at some point the Better Business Bureau will get to the bottom of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story - Useless product, even worse customer service, it&#x27;s basically a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the same mistake we did...don&#x27;t order it in the first place!!!</li>
            <li> I think this is terribly overrated. Got the set and to be honest I can&#x27;t tell the difference between using WEN and head &amp; shoulders! Disappointing- most def not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I luv this product! It brightened up my color treated hair and made it feel oh so soft. I am almost ready to reorder and I think this time I&#x27;ll try the Lavender.</li>
            <li> My 1st use of WEN:  my hair was still dry.  My 2nd use of WEN it was not as dry.  I will continue to use until the bottles are empty to determine if this product is for me.</li>
            <li> Its no secret that this is an expensive shampoo.  I did think it was an effective cleanser, and my hair was moist after its use, but I would only re-purchase it if the price came WAY down.  I did not like the wooden comb or the texture balm that came with my set.  There are other sulfate free shampoos that I feel do exactly what when does for less money.</li>
            <li> I was sick and tired of my hair and all it&#x27;s breakage.  It tends to get frizzy and dry and I thought I&#x27;d give Wen a try.  I really expected it to be mostly hype and/or only work for a few days and then show no difference.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about a month and wow has my hair changed.  Almost no breakage in the shower and it&#x27;s stronger, softer and healthier than ever before.  Seriously this stuff is really good and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  I can&#x27;t get over the difference it has made in my hair.  I will definitely keep using it and would recommend it!!</li>
            <li> The wen looks very promising but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations, its weighing my hair down, it looks not clean and i have to wash it everyday because my hair is oily, i will never buy it again</li>
            <li> I gave this product a long trial - almost 4 months.  I have very dry, course hair.  I found the product left an almost greasy residue on my hair and had to use regular shampoo to remove it.  I thought maybe I needed to use it long-term to get the result they claimed, however after using the shampoo and conditioner for almost 4 months, my hair is no different whatsoever.  And like I said, after a several washes with wen, I would have to use a regular shampoo to remove the coating that that felt disgusting on my hair.  Not a product that is worth the money at all.  You are better off using homemade, natural remedies that moisturize your hair.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but was extremely disappointed by this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They want you to use so much product but give you so little products they want to use 12 pumps for one time and when you do that you&#x27;ve used half the bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The price as I said before you use half the bottle on one use so you&#x27;ve paid 30 to 40 dollars on a product that you really can only use a couple of time I guess for the celebrity spokesmodel this is not a problem but for the everyday normal customer this is ridiculous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The actual product&#x27;s texture is awful the product is so thick that when i rubbed it through my hair i remember having my hand full of hair and it seem to get worse the more time I used it and I still deal with how thin my hair got from using this product and it seemed like to me instead of my making my hair better it just made it more greasier&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion if you love your long thick hair don&#x27;t waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> BEWARE!  The product is fine, but if you order from the WEN company they will sign you up for future orders without clearly stating it as such.  I ordered the shampoo and when they asked, \\&quot;would you like a free trial of Endless Youth Vitamins?\\&quot;  I said sure.  Once I learned that the company mails products regularly, I cancelled.  BUT, they still kept sending stuff AND billing me.  What a nightmare!  The products are fine, but not worth the hassle.  My advice, AVOID THIS COMPANY.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, frizzy and I die it a lot. I have only used WEN for 2 weeks and I love the way my hair looks and feels. The more I use it the better my hair gets. I have body and it does not look frizzy. I have high lights in my hair and they stand out more, it brings the color in your hair out and does not fade it.  I can&#x27;t say I use as much as it requires, or I rinse it out all the way, and my hair is still 100% better than what it was.  I do recommend adding a little water to your hair when putting it in, the cleanser is thick and the water helps smooth it into your hair, and also the longer you leave it in the better, you can feel it working on your scalpel.</li>
            <li> SHIPPING WAS FAST COSTUMER SERVICE WAS PROMPT AND VERY HELPFULL I WOULD MOST DEF RECOMAND THE SELLER AND PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;FIRST TIME USE SILKIER SOFTER A LOT SHINER AND BOUNCIER HAIR ..I HAVE VERYDRY THIN HAIR FRIZZY ALSO SO FAR 4 STARS FOR THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled...it says that there is no membership or auto shipments but they are lying. When you purchase this you are automatically signed up for the auto shipments and auto billing without ever agreeing to it. However, it is extremely easy to cancel and there are no fees. I have thick wavy/curly hair and I would say the product works but not any better than Bedhead, Redken, etc. It takes just as long to use wen as it does to apply normal shampoo and conditioner. Overall indifferent about wen.</li>
            <li> Hi Wen is not for everyone but it can be a great product but you really have to follow the instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Each product is for a differnt hair type go to the Wen Website to find what is right for you. Fig is for thicker, curly or color treated hair, Sweet Almond Mint and Pomegrante are universal formulas, Tea Tree for Scalp issues, Lavender for fine hair provides volume, Cucumber Aloe fine hair that tends to have oily scalp and dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) You neeed to use the right amount of product for your hair length. My hair is fine and color treated a few inches below my shoulders. They say to apply in 4 sections your crown, underneath and back of head and each side. I use 8-9 pumps for each section. If I use less my hair does not come out as good. Comb it through with wide tooth comb this is important. Then clip it up and leave on 3-5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) the most important step rinse with as cold as water as you can stand and rinse really well. Warm water will not rinse it out totally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) You can mix types also. For every day I use Cucumber Aloe followed above and after shower use 1-2 pump as leave in conditions on my ends. If I neeed extra mositure and/or volume or for weekend when I blow dry my hair I use Lavendar on crown and fig everywhere. This give me volume at crown and extra moisture on ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I air dry my air and its thicker, more volume and shiny. When I blow dry and add volumizing spray or mouse it&#x27;s smooth with volume and thicker and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also sell another product which is you are supposed to use less of and it&#x27;s suppossed to be even better called six Thirteen which I will be trying next.</li>
            <li> I figured let&#x27;s try this product and maybe, just maybe my hair will get better. That was really not the case. It weighed my hair down and made it look greasy just after a day. And I cannot see a difference in my hair. Considering the amount of money you pay for one bottle, I can buy 2-4 bottles of cheap shampoo and it cleans and repairs my hair better than this product. Please do not waste your money and their customer service will argue with you on why you do not want automatic shipment.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be the worst and I rarely give into informercials. BUt after seeing this over hundred times on tv, i decided to give it a try. The conditioner smells good but does NOTHING for my hair. My hair was immediately dry afterwards. The balm, cream also did nothing for my hair. I really had high hopes for this.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe because I have Natural african american hair which is why I had no positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was pretty quick although they provided no tracking number. Packaging was good. I give it 2 stars for smelling good, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> im disappointed by this product. i can see it working if your hair is severly damaged and VERY thick and unruly.&lt;br /&gt;it is heavy, weighs my hair down flat and over conditions it. not sure my scalp felt clean either....it&#x27;s really a heavy duty conditioner, not a cleanser.</li>
            <li> Even with no lather the product leaves my hair clean longer. I recommend this product. The only drawback is you need to use a lot of product for longer hair.</li>
            <li> My hair color seems like it is lasting longer and my hair doesn&#x27;t require conditioner. I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Easy to comb hair out, but hair is oily next day. And I have tried to use it different ways. Not happy with results</li>
            <li> I was totally unimpressed with all products. I thought I would like at least one of the products but none if them did anything special for my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time.</li>
            <li> My impression of this product is that it is a Brazilian Blow Out in a bottle.  I did not find that to be the case.  I think the product is heavy and requires a multi-step application process, but it did not leave my hair any more sleek than my normal product. After using WEN my hair was weighed down at the roots but still tangled with frizz on the ends.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was not convinced that this product was the end-all, be-all when I first tried it. My hair was silky and light, yes, but it wasn&#x27;t clear how AMAZING this product was until I tried using shampoo again! Wow... what a difference! I am definitely sticking to it! I have really long hair, and I only have to use about 6-7 pumps each use even though the label says that I should use much more. The comb is a bust (too bulky and thick to slide through thinner hair), but the rest is worth it!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend ordered this set for me last year.  I was very skeptical because of the cheesiness of the infomercials (nothing can be that good) and the cost.  He got me the set that came with 2 bottles of the cleansing conditioner and I just finished the last of it.  I have natural 4z afro-textured hair, dense with fine to wiry strands (meaning there is a mixture of strand types on this one little head of mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing conditioner.  Yes, this product works best when you follow the directions.  I make sure my hair is thoroughly WET - all the way to my scalp.  So, nothing but running water for several moments.  Then, 3-4 pumps per quadrant but then I use another 3-4 pumps for all over my head with a little running water to help it spread throughout my hair and the full length.  I probably do leave it on a little longer than directed.  With this product, more really does seem to be better.  After rinsing, I use one pump worked through damp hair as a leave-in.  As long as my hair likes it, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intensive hair treatment.  My hair was not impressed with this product at all.  I&#x27;m going to play with it to use it up but I will not get any more of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture balm.  I really have no use for this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The styling creme.  My hair loves this product, as well.  I add a bit to my hair after I use a pump of the cleansing conditioner and my hair was staying soft and fluffy and moisturized all day.  My hair goes through extreme shrinkage but the combination of these 2 seem to help my hair stay a little more stretched out and fluffy.  I do not blowdry or use heat on my hair.  This item was also a hit with my teen daughter who took it from me and used it up.  So, I may try to order more of the styling creme if I can catch it reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shohwer comb.  Maybe if it had a hook on it to hang in the shower I&#x27;d have used it as a shower comb.  I already have a shower comb so I just used this onefor combing out my hair while it&#x27;s wet after I applied my leave-ins.  It&#x27;s a nice comb and added to the value of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall...I think I&#x27;d like to try Sally&#x27;s HairOne product to see how it compares on performance.  It was nice to have had the experience with the original, authentic product so I&#x27;d have a basis of comparison with Sally&#x27;s knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad my boyfriend didn&#x27;t listen to me and ordered this for me anyway.  He&#x27;s great!  Love him!</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I both tried this system. It made my daughters hair super greasy. And yes, she used it just as directed and used the correct amount of product. When I tried it, it left my hair really dry feeling &amp; not clean. I know many people claim this stuff is the best, but around our house, Chaz Dean&#x27;s name is mud. For what we paid for this, it was a total rip off. After doing more research online and seeing how many people reported major hair loss after using this product, I&#x27;m not even tempted to try this product again. The only thing I liked and continue to use is the comb.</li>
            <li> not for me. i like the comb but with my curly hair i dont need it feeling like its always a giant mound of grease.</li>
            <li> I like the shine the product provided to my hair but it was gone my day two.  I would say this product is not for all types of ethnic groups.</li>
            <li> Buy Loreal EverCreme Cleansing Conditioner instead. Cheaper,and smells wonderful. Just make sure you use a generous amount and leave it on at least 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> It was simply amazing! I went from having to put on pounds of useless product, to washing my hair, brushing it, and walking out the door. I recommend this for everyone out there. My dry course hair is now soft, silky, and manageable. I feel so confident.&lt;br /&gt;Chaz Dean is an artist and hair is his canvas. I am proud to say that I am a Wen girl. :)</li>
            <li> Was supposed to work within 3 washes, I didn&#x27;t notice a positive change in my hair. The accessories that come with it work really well, and the Wen conditioner works well as just that, a conditioner. They suggest that you don&#x27;t use a shampoo, just use the Wen as both - it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Great product, wish I could afford to purchase this all the time. It is worth the money, just not in my budget.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair have no life. It was heavy and just laid flat. My hair typically is oily and does better with cheap products like herbal essences. I went back to the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> Please beware, this product has TWO very different versions.  Chaz Dean&#x27;s version from his website [...] [[ASIN:B0048O2R1E WEN® Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]] has a DIFFERENT and in my opinion gentler ingredient list than the one on wenhaircare.com!  The cheaper product is made by Guthy-Renker and is offered for the SAME price has the other version.  Shameful business practices, but just goes to show that you have to know what you are buying and do your research, especially if your hair is sensitive to the two alcohols used in the Guthy-Renker version.</li>
            <li> When something is advertised on a 30 minute TV infomercial, it&#x27;s easy to be dubious about the claims made.  However, this product works pretty well.  Not quite as miraculous as they make it sound on TV, but it does noticeably improve the quality and softness of your hair without the harsh chemical drying or the heavy residue that weighs your hair down.  I tried it out of curiosity, and I may just be hooked enough to give up normal shampoo and conditioner, though it is a little pricy.</li>
            <li> This product took quite a long time to arrive.  As I am accustomed to the Amazon Prime 2 day schedule, it felt like forever.  Also, when on the Wen website, there is a push to enroll in the auto fill program.  So, the product arrived and I was already suspicious of an &amp;#34;over marketed&amp;#34; product.  NOT AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of fine hair and products weigh it down, so there&#x27;s always the balance between dry ends and over treated, lifeless hair.  The Wen shampoo is unlike anything I have tried.  It is fantastic.  My hair was immediately calm, smooth, soft and shiny but with body.  My scalp has never felt so clean and refreshed.  Just an amazing product.  Also, when I e mailed Customer Service about the autofill issue, they replied immediately and answered my questions clearly and with a positive, customer oriented mindset.  As a beauty product junkie, I am rarely this pleased.  Congratulations, Wen Hair Products and Guthy Renker for such great execution.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try Wen, especially after watching the glorified infomercials and hearing reviews.  The packaging was very nice and the comb I received was fabulous (it&#x27;s the little things.)  When I used the product for the first time, I had a good feeling about it, but nearly halfway through the day my hair was oily, shiny and flat.  I never experienced the bouncy, beautiful hair that I saw in the infomercial.  I have since used it several times just to see if the first time was a fluke, but I keep experiencing the same results.  I called the service center to request a cancellation of my shipment and the girl was so pleasant and polite, offering to send me sample of another product.  I&#x27;m not mad that the product didn&#x27;t work and I have no ill will towards Wen...I just wish I had bouncy hair! First world problems.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo for the most part. It makes my hair soft and shiny. I use a different shampoo on my scalp though because it can make your hair look greasy if you have hard water.</li>
            <li> it was a good size kit, it worked well but not anything special for the cost that I paid, I like it but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this stuff but I am a believer...wish I could afford it on a regular basis...when I have a couple of bucks I&#x27;ll get more.</li>
            <li> My hair is still recovering from the abuse I put it through a.k.a Wen. It made my hair terribly oily at the roots and dry dry dry from midshaft to the ends.  My mom even tried it too and she likes just about everything she tries and stopped using it shortly after. Maybe it&#x27;s not meant for my hair type ( super thick and very long) and maybe others had a better experience using it but I certainly did not.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair. It worked very well. I can definitely tell the difference from washing with regular shampoo. Wen left her hair soft and manageable. I was able to comb through her hair without any tears or &amp;#34;ouchies&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the entire 4 step process and am very impressed at the results. I will continue to use Wen.</li>
