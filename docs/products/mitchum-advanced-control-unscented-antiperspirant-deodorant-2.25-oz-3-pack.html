    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>having the unscented gel is just perfect!</li>
            <li>so I was so happy to find it here!</li>
            <li>Arrived in perfect condition!!</li>
            <li>very effective</li>
            <li>This is a great antiperspirant love the Unscented.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t honestly call it a gel any more, it runs out of the container.</li>
            <li>Great price, worth it.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love it.</li>
            <li>They changed the formulation and the dispenser top.  </li>
            <li>Love *</li>
            <li>Have used for years and love the product.</li>
            <li>Great product, but this HIGH price warrants just 1 Star.</li>
            <li>and I have to use more to get the result I was used to for a zillion years as a loyal customer.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the consistency of the original formula</li>
            <li>Bought the new kind and had to throw it away.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that I cant get more than one at a time.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to think I may have found a product that had my old favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always payed $12 to $15 per 6-pak on Amazon for this exact product!</li>
            <li>Yet it has a distinct MUSK scent to it, which makes me... and my wife... nauseous.  </li>
            <li>It is much more liquid that the old formula</li>
            <li>so they changed up to make you have to buy it more frequently.</li>
            <li>The order was received on time and the product is exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find that I could get at LEAST 3 more containers of the old type!  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well once it dries, make sure you&#x27;re not letting it dry by holding your arms up, let it work itself in or else</li>
            <li>fast shipping, product as described</li>
            <li>Can always depend on Mitchum to really work....</li>
            <li>Bring back the original.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the power gel, this &amp;#34;oxygenated&amp;#34; formula is more liquid than gel and runs down my armpits and gets all over the sink.</li>
            <li>It actually works great once applied, but it leaves such a mess on the container and everything near it, that it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>it did not happen that way with the older product.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably why the formula was changed and the original is no longer made: they realized that it lasted too long</li>
            <li>Why would Mitchum discontinue a great product (SmartSolid) that I have used for 15 years and now make a product (Oxygen) that appears to be messy, expensive, and  &amp;#34;lasts 24 hours&amp;#34; when most people take a shower every day ???</li>
            <li>Runny,watery and messy like most of the reviews point out.</li>
            <li>Mitchum has switched the deodorant to a new type with the word &amp;#34;Oxygen&amp;#34; in the title.  </li>
            <li>Looking for a new product after over 20 years as a Mitchum user.</li>
            <li>I got the new formula deodorant, not the one shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>Old Review:</li>
            <li>antiperspirant is the only one that really provides the protection I need.  </li>
            <li>love it, hard to find locally</li>
            <li>Also, the new formula claims to be unscented but H2O2 definitely has a smell!</li>
            <li>It appears that the old formula Mitchum that I had originally purchased through this listing has been changed to the new, runny, sloppy mess Mitchum.</li>

            <li> Old Review:</li>
            <li> antiperspirant is the only one that really provides the protection I need.  </li>
            <li> love it, hard to find locally</li>

            <li> It appears that the old formula Mitchum that I had originally purchased through this listing has been changed to the new, runny, sloppy mess Mitchum.</li>
            <li> New formula melts and makes a mess all over.</li>
            <li> As a deodorant it works well, I don&#x27;t sweat or smell, but the fact that it melts means that it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> The new formula is watered down and runny, and leaves a mess everywhere.</li>
            <li> Thought I was the only one: this a watery mess since they chanted the formula and added the word, &amp;#34;Oxygenated&amp;#34; to the title.</li>
            <li> The new Mitchum is terrible, so order at your own risk.  </li>
            <li> Not a very pleasant experience so far, but at $8 for 3 of them I&#x27;ll make it work.</li>
            <li> It is just too wet.</li>
            <li> I have always had very active sweat glands, and I have tried other products.  </li>
            <li> The review has been edited down to one star from five.</li>
            <li> Half of the can ends up in your sink.</li>
            <li> It was a mess.  </li>
            <li> it is no longer a gel, but a watery mess.  </li>
            <li> Did not say this was the new useless formula</li>
            <li> Very sad to find the new active ingredient and disappointing formula.</li>
            <li> The new type is AWFUL!  </li>
            <li> New formula is awful!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This deodorant claims to be UNSCENTED.... Yet it has a distinct MUSK scent to it, which makes me... and my wife... nauseous.  I cannot fathom how anyone could consider this product to be UNSCENTED.... because it is NOT.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love it.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula - the photo here is not what was sent. The new formula is watered down and runny, and leaves a mess everywhere. It actually works great once applied, but it leaves such a mess on the container and everything near it, that it isn&#x27;t worth it. It makes you wonder if they did any internal testing before releasing this.</li>
            <li> The order was received on time and the product is exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in any store now!!!  Mitchum has switched the deodorant to a new type with the word &amp;#34;Oxygen&amp;#34; in the title.  The new type is AWFUL!  Runny, gunky, sticky, yucky!!  I was thrilled to find that I could get at LEAST 3 more containers of the old type!  Please keep this in stock Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Runny,watery and messy like most of the reviews point out. I got some of the &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34; sticks in my order, looks like I got the short straw this time. Works pretty well once it dries, make sure you&#x27;re not letting it dry by holding your arms up, let it work itself in or else you&#x27;ll end up with sticky underarms like I did. Not a very pleasant experience so far, but at $8 for 3 of them I&#x27;ll make it work. Probably won&#x27;t recommend this brand for future purchases</li>
            <li> Edit 1/18/2017: It appears that the old formula Mitchum that I had originally purchased through this listing has been changed to the new, runny, sloppy mess Mitchum. The review has been edited down to one star from five. The new Mitchum is terrible, so order at your own risk.  Old Review: These are the old/&amp;#34;good&amp;#34; formula that isn&#x27;t sticky. Would buy again. Would only buy this actually. Bought the new kind and had to throw it away. I don&#x27;t like change.  Please bring this back in stores, I don&#x27;t mind buying online, but I would rather it be on the shelf.</li>
            <li> Product was not what was advertised</li>
            <li> They changed the formulation and the dispenser top.  It is much more liquid that the old formula and I have to use more to get the result I was used to for a zillion years as a loyal customer.  I dropped it in the bathroom and when it hit the tile a BUNCH of the product flew out it did not happen that way with the older product.  It was a mess.  It is just too wet. Looking for a new product after over 20 years as a Mitchum user.</li>
            <li> I have used Mitchum Antiperspirant for years.  I really like the fact that I cant get more than one at a time.  It saves me from having to remember when I go to the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This antiperspirant is the only one that really provides the protection I need.  I have always had very active sweat glands, and I have tried other products.  None works as well at this does for me.  I don&#x27;t like scented products, so having the unscented gel is just perfect!</li>
            <li> New formula is awful! Can&#x27;t honestly call it a gel any more, it runs out of the container. Sent feedback to the company and have not received a response.</li>
            <li> Thought I was the only one: this a watery mess since they chanted the formula and added the word, &amp;#34;Oxygenated&amp;#34; to the title. What a disaster of a product change.</li>
            <li> Love *this* formula.  Since they have changed to an &amp;#34;Oxygen&amp;#34; formula (the addition of hydrogen peroxide) it is no longer a gel, but a watery mess.  Also, the new formula claims to be unscented but H2O2 definitely has a smell!</li>
            <li> no flakes.  very effective</li>
            <li> Great price, worth it.</li>
            <li> The picture is misleading. I got the new formula deodorant, not the one shown in the picture. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, product as described</li>
            <li> Can always depend on Mitchum to really work....</li>
            <li> love it, hard to find locally</li>
            <li> Why would Mitchum discontinue a great product (SmartSolid) that I have used for 15 years and now make a product (Oxygen) that appears to be messy, expensive, and  &amp;#34;lasts 24 hours&amp;#34; when most people take a shower every day ???</li>
            <li> The picture of this item shows Power Gel. This is not what I was sold.</li>
            <li> Mitchum has been my sole anti-perspirant for over 20 years. But WHY the Hell has it suddenly doubled in Price to $12 for a 3-pak?!  I&#x27;ve always payed $12 to $15 per 6-pak on Amazon for this exact product! Great product, but this HIGH price warrants just 1 Star.</li>
            <li> I have used Mitchumfor years! I prefer the consistency of the original formula so I was so happy to find it here! Arrived in perfect condition!!</li>
            <li> New formula melts and makes a mess all over. This is NOT the power gel, this &amp;#34;oxygenated&amp;#34; formula is more liquid than gel and runs down my armpits and gets all over the sink. Bring back the original. As a deodorant it works well, I don&#x27;t sweat or smell, but the fact that it melts means that it doesn&#x27;t last as long. That&#x27;s probably why the formula was changed and the original is no longer made: they realized that it lasted too long so they changed up to make you have to buy it more frequently. Half of the can ends up in your sink.</li>
            <li> It keeps me from stinking, and it doesn&#x27;t make me itch.</li>
            <li> Have used for years and love the product.</li>
            <li> This is a great antiperspirant love the Unscented.</li>
            <li> My pits itch with this deo.</li>
            <li> Did not say this was the new useless formula so I was excited to think I may have found a product that had my old favorite. Very sad to find the new active ingredient and disappointing formula.</li>
