            <li>It lathers nicely and is moisturizing to the skin.  </li>

            <li>Looks good on any counter top, great lather and leaves your hands smelling fresh with no residue.</li>
            <li>just okay, does smell good, but i thought would be stronger more lingering, and i just dont think &amp;#34;the price is right&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Beautiful soaps, but beware, they are HIGHLY scented.</li>
            <li>, I have no idea how they can make them look so authentic.  </li>
            <li>I get so many comments from friends and family that have been to my home and have been using this soap that is in the guest bathroom</li>
            <li>would make a really lovely gift -</li>
            <li>I thought  \\&quot;OK</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.</li>
            <li>Have already bought more.</li>
            <li>The rock soap is the prettiest soap you can put out in your bathroom or in the kitchen, I love it.</li>
            <li>They are mostly now (now that it is May) still wrapped up but sitting on display in everyone&#x27;s bathrooms.</li>
            <li>I love to give them as gifts to special people.  </li>
            <li>beautiful, especially in sunlight</li>
            <li>The smell is so nice - not overpowering, but strong enough to have a lovely scent from.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s enough to confuse anyone but the weight is an important thing to know value wise.......</li>
            <li>This must be really fresh as the fragrance is astonishingly strong.</li>
            <li>Everyone really liked them out loud.</li>
            <li>but most interesting is that I could&#x27;ve sworn I simply went into my account/order history &amp; clicked the item and put a \\&quot;2\\</li>
            <li>I have 3 different ones and love them all!</li>
            <li>Some other soaps look good until you use them.  </li>
            <li>Best soap out there, just wish there were more deals, a little pricey but does last a long time..</li>
            <li>I first discovered soap rocks at a now defunct bedding store named Strouds.  </li>
            <li>this is most definitely smaller\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Will order more for next year.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a favorite and everyone gravitated toward different ones</li>
            <li>They really do look like real stones</li>
            <li>I have an admiration for real rocks that the Lord designed and I am very fond of these that are made of soap too.</li>
            <li>The price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li>I looked them up here, and was amazed at all the different varieties available.</li>
            <li>The soap is bigger than I expected, but that is a good thing ..</li>
            <li>Lovely, extremely well don.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell but the size is a little big to use comfortably in the shower.  </li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t leave them sitting in a puddle of water, they last a long time, making them a great value.</li>
            <li>They may seem pricey when buying them, but they last a very long time, which maked them more like a bargain.  </li>
            <li>than I&#x27;m used to and certainly even smaller than the one referenced in the first review above.</li>
            <li>After really looking this item&#x27;s information such as description etc.</li>
            <li>It is completely natural &amp; organic.</li>
            <li>I love it, the only thing is I wish it would have been smaller like cut in half</li>
            <li>Being a guy, I don&#x27;t generally concern myself with having the prettiest soap on the block, but me and my son noticed this at a relative&#x27;s house and thought it looked like a really neat rock/metiorite/whatever that we decided get one for ourselves.</li>
            <li>But te quality of the soap is every bit as high in it&#x27;s standard as the soap&#x27;s appearance.  </li>
            <li>Probably calm down over time.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> beautiful, especially in sunlight</li>
            <li> I first discovered soap rocks at a now defunct bedding store named Strouds.  I love to give them as gifts to special people.  Some other soaps look good until you use them.  These soaps look the same colorwise in a month, two months (except they&#x27;re smaller).  My favorites -- black opal, olivine, white opal, jade, lapis lazuli.  They&#x27;re all gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Looks good on any counter top, great lather and leaves your hands smelling fresh with no residue. Need a good soap dish to go with these wonderful soaps.</li>
            <li> I love all the soap rocks!  They&#x27;re so beautiful and smell awesome.  They really do look like real stones, I have no idea how they can make them look so authentic.  I have 3 different ones and love them all!</li>
            <li> just okay, does smell good, but i thought would be stronger more lingering, and i just dont think &amp;#34;the price is right&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love these soaps, they are absolutely beautiful, smell great, and very good for your skin - even your face!</li>
            <li> The smell is so nice - not overpowering, but strong enough to have a lovely scent from.  The soap is bigger than I expected, but that is a good thing .. I think this is going to last a long time!  I get so many comments from friends and family that have been to my home and have been using this soap that is in the guest bathroom - they love the look and the smell!  would make a really lovely gift - the colours are beautiful!</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin moisturized even in the Winter time.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but the size is a little big to use comfortably in the shower.  Since it is the shower it doesn&#x27;t appear to have the longevity that some have commented on.  It&#x27;s lasting about the same amount of time a dove bar would last for me.</li>
            <li> I love it, the only thing is I wish it would have been smaller like cut in half</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been hooked on this soap for years and years. I usually buy two so I&#x27;ll have a backup. Just received my order today and maybe it&#x27;s my brain playing tricks. Seems smaller tho I read the size as 14 point something oz. This must be really fresh as the fragrance is astonishingly strong. Probably calm down over time. Hope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added September 16th...After really looking this item&#x27;s information such as description etc. I see the shipping weight is 14.4oz. NOT the weight of the actual soap. I believe the soap rock itself should be 6oz verses the \\&quot;rocklet\\&quot; which is 4oz. I recently reordered this item. Or what I thought I was reordering. I ordered two this time and when I unpacked em I thought  \\&quot;OK this is most definitely smaller\\&quot; than I&#x27;m used to and certainly even smaller than the one referenced in the first review above. There&#x27;s no weight given here but most interesting is that I could&#x27;ve sworn I simply went into my account/order history &amp; clicked the item and put a \\&quot;2\\&quot;  in the quantity box and went on without a thought. Now I see the product I ordered was the soap \\&quot;rocklet\\&quot; which is of course smaller than this \\&quot;rock\\&quot;. The rocklet is 4oz and I paid about 13.89 per for them here amazon. It&#x27;s enough to confuse anyone but the weight is an important thing to know value wise.......so I hope the owner will consider adding that information dang it. [[ASIN:B000VZICUO Soap Rocklet - 4 oz. - Azurite Malachite]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing. The price I referenced above is for the amazon prime which includes shipping as everyone knows. Just sayin.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful and unique gift that is planned for Christmas stockings. Have already bought more.</li>
            <li> Being a guy, I don&#x27;t generally concern myself with having the prettiest soap on the block, but me and my son noticed this at a relative&#x27;s house and thought it looked like a really neat rock/metiorite/whatever that we decided get one for ourselves. It&#x27;s so big you can cut it in half and it&#x27;ll last a really long time, unless you drop half of it in the toilet by accident... as someone in our household did. Won&#x27;t blame anyone else, but I&#x27;ll give you a hint: it wasn&#x27;t me...</li>
            <li> Love this soap! It makes my skin so soft, and smells wonderful. Its not a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell so even my husband likes it! Will be buying more of these soap rocks!</li>
            <li> Love these saps they smell wonderful and look so pretty in a guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> They loved it..  A very popular gift for friends during the holiday season.  Will order more for next year.  Happy Holidays.</li>
            <li> Best soap out there, just wish there were more deals, a little pricey but does last a long time..</li>
            <li> I guess it was about four years ago when our family discovered Soap Rocks, made by a man who is a gemologist and made soaps that beautifully resemble their counterpart in nature. Lovely, extremely well don.  But te quality of the soap is every bit as high in it&#x27;s standard as the soap&#x27;s appearance.  It lathers nicely and is moisturizing to the skin.  They may seem pricey when buying them, but they last a very long time, which maked them more like a bargain.  I often give them as a gift to friends, pastors, people who help me with chores, even prizes to childlren at birthday parties.  I have an admiration for real rocks that the Lord designed and I am very fond of these that are made of soap too.</li>
            <li> This soap is not only beautiful but also has a wonderful aroma. It is completely natural &amp; organic. The price is also reasonable. I&#x27;m very happy that amazon carries soap rocks. They will make wonderful gifts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to be disappointed when purchasing soap rocks from T.S. Pink.</li>
            <li> I had been buying these soaps at a local boutique, but they&#x27;re often out of stock. I looked them up here, and was amazed at all the different varieties available. I like to keep them in the bathrooms and kitchen, with a few spares here and there. For little ones, I simply cut the soaps into two or three pieces, so they are easier for the kids to handle. The scents are great, and the feeling of softness after rinsing is wonderful. As long as you don&#x27;t leave them sitting in a puddle of water, they last a long time, making them a great value.</li>
            <li> The rock soap is the prettiest soap you can put out in your bathroom or in the kitchen, I love it. Beautiful !!!</li>
            <li> Gave these as holiday gifts to a group of my girlfriends. I don&#x27;t really have a favorite and everyone gravitated toward different ones (I let them choose). Everyone really liked them out loud. They are mostly now (now that it is May) still wrapped up but sitting on display in everyone&#x27;s bathrooms. So I would say it&#x27;s a good gift?</li>
            <li> Beautiful soaps, but beware, they are HIGHLY scented. I had to stop using it in the shower because it was so overpowering. Stuck it in the kitchen instead. Wish they&#x27;d make some with less scent, or even unscented.</li>
            <li> smells like heaven! Colors amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used this before  Best soap around Lasts forever</li>
