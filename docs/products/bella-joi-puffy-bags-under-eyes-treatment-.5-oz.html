            <li>It takes a little while to see the difference at first, but the longer I use it, the better the results!</li>
            <li>Actually, if I were honest with myself, and you, I have suffered from dark circles for a long time thanks to my glasses-which are great for seeing, but not so much for giving my under eye skin the treatment it deserves.&lt;br</li>

            <li>When I first starting using this</li>
            <li>An interesting thing I noticed a few days ago is that the fine lines on my left hand seem less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It has almost completely replaced my need to use concealer</li>
            <li>I look awake and alive</li>

            <li> I was amazed, Of course it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the dark circles completely</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see long term result .</li>
            <li> I have been using it every single day since it arrived (about a month) and have not seen any results at all.</li>
            <li> Got this after it was recommended by a friend and within a week i looked a whole lot less dead!</li>
            <li> A single drop takes care of both eyes, so this little tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> There are several things I like about the product: 1) A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Before, I had some ugly bags under my eyes and now it looks alot better.</li>
            <li> but this has not accomplished that</li>
            <li> A previous review noted you only need a little bit</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have tried other eye creams without luck as well.</li>
            <li> There are some days where my dark circles are reduced by a lot, however, there are other days where is looked like I got absolutely no sleep.</li>
            <li> Around day 4, I started to see a lighter appearance in the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product, I wanted to find something for my puffy eyes because i always look tired when im not!</li>
            <li> As a sleep-deprived mom of 3, I need all the help I can get with dark circles, bags, and crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> but I have chronic dark circles.</li>
            <li> Often I wake up and those dark circles and puffy eyes are all it takes for anyone to know</li>
            <li> My eyes are brighter looking and the dark circles are getting lighter by the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate the product, yet it is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I could buy something from Target that works just as well for less money.</li>
            <li> Since ive been working the graveyard shift at work lately, a lot of people have been commenting on the dark circles under my eyes from the change.</li>
            <li> It hadn&#x27;t caused any irritation as a few products have in the past me.  </li>
            <li> that means I get very (very, very) little sleep.</li>
            <li> It takes very little serum to dab under my eyes each day and I chose to use a cotton ball based on other reviews that stated it was very thin and would run down my fingers.</li>
            <li> I have really bad dark circle and decided to try this after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have noticed no difference after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the Dark Circles and Puffy Bags Treatment.</li>

            <li> , it reversed the nasty looking bags under my eyes from lack of sleep</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It did help with dark circles but as far as bag under my eyes - it didn&#x27;t really help much . I could buy something from Target that works just as well for less money.</li>
            <li> Did nothing but cause dehydrated wrinkled under eye area.</li>
            <li> 30 days later.....no difference....crap</li>
            <li> It really works! I can see an improvement after four days of use.</li>
            <li> I am seeing improvement to the dark circles under my eyes and the puffiness is better.  I use once at night.  I like the product.  A previous review noted you only need a little bit and they are right!  No stinging in the eyes either.  This product works for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the eye area yet, but I plan to keep using it.  I was expecting a difference in about 30 days, but apparently it can take longer to see results.    There are several things I like about the product: 1) A little goes a long way.  A single drop takes care of both eyes, so this little tube will last a long time. 2) It absorbs quickly into the skin and is not sticky or oily. 3) It came in an easy to use pump tube with professional looking packaging.  The pump is easy to control so you can dispense just the right amount.    An interesting thing I noticed a few days ago is that the fine lines on my left hand seem less noticeable.  I sometimes put a drop on the back of my hand and dab my finger in it to apply to the eye area and then rub the excess into the back of my hand if I happened to dispense 2 drops instead of one.  So while I haven&#x27;t noticed a facial difference, my left hand looks better.    UPDATE 2/4/2015:  I just changed my review from 4 stars to 5 stars.  I continued to use the product after leaving the initial review, but used it twice a day instead of once.  The extra time and extra application has made a difference.  I am using it for puffyness and lines and both have improved significantly.  Incidentally, I am still using from the same little pump bottle; it really does last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 days now. It really works.  Day 2 of use, the bags were significantly smaller. Around day 4, I started to see a lighter appearance in the dark circles.  It is a wonderful product.  A little bit goes a long way. I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> Really like this product, I wanted to find something for my puffy eyes because i always look tired when im not! found this product.Bella Joi Dark Circles and Puffy Bags Under Eyes Treatment,Goes on clear, so no white residue, light scent , not greasy and has vitamin c whic is a plus and dries in about 30 sec.This is a must have for all the night owls out  there.</li>
            <li> it did nothing for my under eye bags. used for over a month</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change at all</li>
            <li> This product has done miracles for my face. My face is much more clear after using this treatment. Before, I had some ugly bags under my eyes and now it looks alot better. Not to mention this also assisted with getting rid of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading the reviews.  Unfortunately, I have noticed no difference after using this product.  I&#x27;ll keep searching for a product that actually works.</li>
            <li> When I first starting using this I did&#x27;t really believe it would help at all, but it really did! I was amazed, Of course it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the dark circles completely but it has lightened them significantly. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent and absorbs very well into the skin without that yucky greasy feeling.  did receive it a discounted price to review.</li>
            <li> I really love it. That&#x27;s why i give this a 5 stars rating!! I couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere cheaper then this. I would totally recommend buying this if you are looking to buy it!</li>
            <li> More hype than anything.  I see NO difference.  have been using nightly and in the mornings.  Not a fan.</li>
            <li> I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I consider myself  somewhat an eye cream efficinado. I have deep set eyes naturally, 3 kid under 5 one isn&#x27;t a fan of sleep, and I&#x27;m in my 40s.  I try a lot of products and have for years.  This is a good one.  It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly, hard no real detectable oder, and did a decent job.  It diminished dark circles and puffiness pretty immediately.  It hadn&#x27;t caused any irritation as a few products have in the past me.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time, but am please . Can&#x27;t wait to see long term result .</li>
            <li> As a sleep-deprived mom of 3, I need all the help I can get with dark circles, bags, and crow&#x27;s feet. I love the fact that I can put something on that takes care of the problem for me. It takes a little while to see the difference at first, but the longer I use it, the better the results!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the Dark Circles and Puffy Bags Treatment. I have been using it every single day since it arrived (about a month) and have not seen any results at all. I do not get bags under my eyes but I have chronic dark circles. I have tried other eye creams without luck as well. I was hoping for something that just lightened them a little and make me feel more comfortable without make up but this has not accomplished that</li>
            <li> dries up the skin area</li>
            <li> I do like how it seems to help with the puffiness in the mornings. I may have to use more in the afternoons but I can tell a difference when I use it and when It don&#x27;t. Helps with some of the redness as well.</li>
            <li> Bella Joi Under Eyes Treatment makes me one happy lady. I am a mom of three under six-that means I get very (very, very) little sleep. Often I wake up and those dark circles and puffy eyes are all it takes for anyone to know I&#x27;m sleep deprived. Actually, if I were honest with myself, and you, I have suffered from dark circles for a long time thanks to my glasses-which are great for seeing, but not so much for giving my under eye skin the treatment it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Bella Joi Under Eye Treatment for a couple of weeks now and I absolutely love it! It has almost completely replaced my need to use concealer and my eyes look radiant and awake no matter how much sleep I get. My eyes are brighter looking and the dark circles are getting lighter by the day. Even after the first day I could see a slight difference. My bags and puffiness are diminishing and look so much better than before. I look awake and alive and I think that it helps me look more my age instead of older. My eyes feel hydrated and moisturized. I use a cotton ball and apply this twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. It is a thinner treatment than others, hence the cotton ball, but otherwise it is great! I really love this under eye treatment and that it is bringing back the youthful glow to my eyes that I haven&#x27;t seen in a very long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Seeing results within 1wk using it 2x a day.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about 3 weeks now. I have not noticed a dermatic (lol) change. It feels good around my eyes. It is a good size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes but I do have puffiness and so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It takes very little serum to dab under my eyes each day and I chose to use a cotton ball based on other reviews that stated it was very thin and would run down my fingers. This solution worked very well and none is wasted.  I&#x27;ve had good results in the few days I&#x27;ve been using so I plan on continuing the regimen.  It has a pleasant smell too!</li>
            <li> it did nothing.. then they would not let me get my money back..  scam</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for almost a month. Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in the dark circles and it does nothing for the puffiness. I ended up buying a different product by Garnier for that. Sorry too as the Customer Service lady was so nice.</li>
            <li> I have really bad dark circle and decided to try this after reading reviews. This product is alright. There are some days where my dark circles are reduced by a lot, however, there are other days where is looked like I got absolutely no sleep. I use it daily as the directions state. I don&#x27;t hate the product, yet it is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. I&#x27;ve read it may take up to 8 weeks to work, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping for.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> A very nice eye treatment. I ran out of eye treatment for 5 days and I have been using this for over a week now, it reversed the nasty looking bags under my eyes from lack of sleep and really they looked like big ole suit cases not bags lol. I do notice a much better look and more refresh look under my eyes. I only need a pea size amount, dont use more then that, why waste such good treatment? Over all this is very nice. ALSO its a wonderful eye make up remover! I got this for a discount for my honest feed back, the above is my own opinion.</li>
            <li> Since ive been working the graveyard shift at work lately, a lot of people have been commenting on the dark circles under my eyes from the change. Got this after it was recommended by a friend and within a week i looked a whole lot less dead! Works great!</li>
            <li> I dont really see a difference....yet.</li>
            <li> So far so good only been using it two weeks.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. No side effects and it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Saw no difference after several weeks of use.</li>
    </ol>
