            <li>Great quality cream at an Amazing price</li>
            <li>My skin felt GOOD.</li>
            <li>Then I tried this cream, as a nighttime moisturizer, and I&#x27;m delighted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sold, and I&#x27;m delighted to find it here on amazon.</li>
            <li>Initially, I LOVED the products</li>
            <li>I feel the cream I got from Amazon is not as good as Costco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>so I bought two and the price was so good</li>
            <li>Sebamed works for me and this was good price for my pocket.</li>
            <li>It literally feels GOOD on my skin.</li>
            <li>It has been really good for my son because it took away the scaliness.  </li>
            <li>creams and this one feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>Feels so good.</li>
            <li>and that is a good thing on me</li>
            <li>The Body Lotion has a wonderful light fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>I had also used cervae moisturizer which was good</li>
            <li>(maybe I didn&#x27;t give it a fair chance as the rest of my routine at the time was problematic) but does not compare to this.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moist and feeling good.  </li>
            <li>I use this after I clean my face with Sebamed Face and Body Wash &amp; this product is the perfect follow-up.</li>
            <li>awesome product, quick delivery</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Works well to keep my skin nice and moisture, good for your skin after shaving my face and head.</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>Love this cream!  </li>
            <li>I love this cream !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love all of their products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not greasy won&#x27;t make you break out!!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Too strong for the face, but great on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>perfume-y smells on my face and this stuff is great and easy to go on with no smell whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Another amazing product from Sebamed.</li>
            <li>She uses this along eith their cleansing foam for an amazing combination.</li>
            <li>For a month or two, it worked amazingly</li>
            <li>But found a great alternative,  from the Earth Science line, Clarifying cleansing lotion, Apricot night cream, Fragrance free moisturizing lotion etc.  </li>
            <li>great moisuturizing cream - free of dyes ect.</li>
            <li>Nice medium weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It absorbs, feels nice, seems to help ward off dryness and tightness - and no breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am hoping I will end up loving it,</li>
            <li>It absorbs really nicely into the skin without making my skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Good price too :)</li>
            <li>Tried it and liked it, but decided to switch to an organic brand.  </li>
            <li>I used Aveno before but used this when I was at my sisters house and forgot my own face cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky on the skin and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true; the smell isn&#x27;t great but the consistency is really nice.</li>
            <li>and when I opened it the smell was very strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oily, but it gets parched very easily.</li>
            <li>The best product...great for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>However, have now returned to Sebamed because it is light on my face, absorbs well and my skin looks and feel good.  </li>
            <li>This cream is the best so far in terms of cost and value.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic; Amazon has the best prices on this line, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for my sensitive, fair, acne-prone (chin) skin.</li>
            <li>This product is great for my skin and the cost is just right.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, light moisturizer with a pleasant, clean smell (in my opinion).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy , goes on very smooth  and stays on all day....</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent to it, not too strong.  </li>
            <li>, Sensitive Skin is very good</li>
            <li>I even have salespeople from Mary Kay and Avon ask what I do to have such a wonderful complexion.</li>
            <li>My skin is finally healthy.</li>
            <li>I immediatley fell in love with how Sebamed felt going on and how my skin glowed all day afterward.</li>
            <li>I love Sebamed.</li>
            <li>Both my daugther and I love this cream.</li>
            <li>My face feels softer for sure.</li>
            <li>Got it on time and up love this product</li>
            <li>I was leery of buying something I wasn&#x27;t sure of.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of product, you can always add more product if you need, but start out applying sparingly.</li>
            <li>Such a great skincare product!</li>
            <li>I really love this moisturizer and so does my husband.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>strangely more dirt fell out of the box along with the jar.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I also love their eye cream...</li>
            <li>/&gt;--people can buy this product without doubts :)</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I also introduced this product to my friends and they also love it.</li>
            <li>It is the best facial cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels with this product.</li>
            <li>repurchased it so many times.</li>
            <li>I came to Amazon to read reviews and pick a safe product to use while I was so irritated.  </li>
            <li>Skin, Fragrance Free, Perfect for Sensitive Skin, 2oz</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I may LOVE this product after my dermatitis reaction is gone -</li>
            <li>a LOT more, if it had NO SMELL AT ALL.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin feel smooth all day!  </li>
            <li>(I bought it though at Costco during a roadshow to get a better price.)  </li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer I have ever used, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li>Just try it:)</li>
            <li>It is a great product, not oily but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and I thought my skin looked better than it had in a while</li>
            <li>Overall, I think Sebamed makes some top-notch products.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cream I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm or a leg!</li>
            <li>After two more experiments, I trashed the container.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a cream before as most products clog my pores</li>
            <li>This my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So glad I can purchase it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>love this a lot of products break me out</li>
            <li>We love this moisturizer and have chosen it time and again.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years and this is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, it&#x27;s eat right and drink plenty of water, which is also good for the skin.</li>
            <li>The entire line is great; LOVE the Cleansing Shower Oil!    </li>
            <li>I have dry skin and this along with the night moisturizing cream are great!</li>
            <li>This is the best product on the market for dry skin....</li>
            <li>moisturizer is great b/c I have very sensitive skin and everything often leaves me irritated.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>My skin loves this product and I feel good about using it knowing that it is a pure product, PH balanced.</li>
            <li>product is very good for all the different skin types, we have with my family.</li>
            <li>This is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They have a great selection of skin care products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I say if you need a good moisturizer, I would highly recommend that you consider this!</li>
            <li>I used to just use it exclusively on my face, but now it apply it over my whole body because it&#x27;s so good.  </li>
            <li>I will try other Sebamed products since I&#x27;m truly very impressed.</li>
            <li>Compared to other moisturizing creams this is the best.  </li>
            <li>but this keeps skin smooth and smells great and its sensitive to my face</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to work into your skin.</li>
            <li>This is actually a good moisturizer and not just something you settle for because it is safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also the strong smell irritates the skin.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is Hypoallergenic and Non-comedogenic for sensitive skin works perfectly for my acne prone, oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Smooth feel and non oily.</li>
            <li>Manufacturer should try to make  this product fragrant free.</li>
            <li>They sent me a free handcream.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that my search is over finally</li>
            <li>moisturizer is also paraben free, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>This product is so light &amp; non greasy that you can&#x27;t even tell its on your face.</li>
            <li>its light, it moisturizes, and its not greasy.</li>
            <li>and this product moisturizes perfectly year round (it&#x27;s not too oily for mid-Atlantic summers).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times a day for years and it&#x27;s just marvelous.</li>
            <li>The jar comes filled to the brim.</li>
            <li>I love this cream so much because of its light consistency!</li>
            <li>No scent, feels good, inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t both my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin feeling very fresh and has helped keep my acne under control.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and creamy and the scent is clean.</li>
            <li>I live in Az, and I&#x27;ve tried face creams from Dior, Lancôme , Mario Badescu....and so on, but nothing got me so many compliments on my skin like the sebamed lotion!</li>
            <li>Love this cream - great for sensitive skin, absorbs quickly, moisturizes thoroughly but doesn&#x27;t promote breakouts, and a decent quantity for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth trying!</li>
            <li>This cream is great for the dry areas of my face.</li>
            <li>After applying it on my face, it has a light oily feel, but not sticky and it seemed to absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many dept. store creams and spent good money on all of them.  </li>
            <li>and my face turned bright red.  </li>
            <li>I figured she must know what she was talking about as she had modeled many years for Macy&#x27;s in the 1950&#x27;s, and was very conscientious about her looks.  </li>
            <li>Using a bunch of products really throws your ph off, causing more problems than not.</li>
            <li>While I liked that product, pairing with the acne wash actually dried out my skin and caused me to produce more sebum which led to more acne.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer, you really cannot beat it.</li>
            <li>This face cream is great and inexpensive in comparison to other brands.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and really can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>The first day, and then the first night, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!!</li>
            <li>When I ran out, I tried to find a new supply of my favorite Body Wash, Lotion and Cream.</li>
            <li>It has a very silky texture and is easy to apply and rub in if you wish.  </li>
            <li>It is not too oily and does a good job in preventing dry skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have major skin troubles so most moisturizers work okay with my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, rosacea, and most products have an adverse reaction with my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I like to switch my creams especially when is a more natural product:) I recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is hard to find in stores, but it is wonderful and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I silently swore I would find it on my own one day and began my search.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to see this cream finally on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>This product is used mostly for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is break out free, moisturized perfectly, smooth, soft, and radiant.</li>
            <li>/moisturizers I&#x27;m using, but this face cream helps keep my skin healthy and clear.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most creams either burn my eyes or make me itch.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and have never been able to find a product that won&#x27;t irritate or cause acne on my face; that is until now.</li>
            <li>Initially received this as a gift - liked the description on the packaging</li>
            <li>Love this skin cream, just as good as the more expensive creams.  </li>
            <li>Well worth trying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many face creams with my sensitive skin - this one seems to be working well.  </li>
            <li>Surely they would not adverise a product for sensitive skin that would do this to me.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend giving this moisturizer a shot if you&#x27;re experiencing dryness and break out easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong though- get ready to smell like grandma.</li>
            <li>Best yet, when I went to the grocer&#x27;s yesterday to pick up a few things with only lipstick on, no powder, foundations, anything, the checkout clerk asked for ID and was amazed at my true age.</li>
            <li>I have loved the face wash (see my other review) and tried the face cream today.</li>
            <li>I can honestly tell you my skin texture is nearly identical to what it was when I was in high school.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were right.</li>
            <li>It adds just the right amount of moisture without being greasy.</li>
            <li>But this product makes my skin soft and so clean!</li>
            <li>The fragrance of this moisturizer is too strong and decidedly masculine.</li>
            <li>However, I contacted Sebamed company and was assured that the product was the same great product I was used to just packaged differently for the US</li>
            <li>Mild product, works very well.</li>
            <li>I have very  sensitive skin, but I feel really  comfortable with this cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light &amp; non-greasy, yet it completely hydrates my skin &amp; makes my face feel super soft.</li>
            <li>Is light ,a little goes a long way ,plus is paraben free and smells good( I like the smell)I got mine at shoprite  </li>
            <li>Getting my second jar this week:)</li>
            <li>I REALLY do like this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>When i first started using this line, i used the liquid face and body soap plus the body lotion on my face.</li>
            <li>This product not only doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin but makes her feel better.</li>
            <li>I first bought this a Costco wholesale from a booth they had set up.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first about buying this product since it has petroleum as one ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I love this produce and have used it for several years.  </li>
            <li>I use this cream daily - love it.</li>
            <li>I love their brand of face wash; only their face wash doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li>Love all the Sebamed products especially the moisturizing face</li>
            <li>My skin really does well with this!  </li>
            <li>I first tried sebamed from a trunk show at Costco.</li>
            <li>(Not that I want a higher price</li>
            <li>I really do like this face cream!  </li>
            <li>I first tried Sebamed when looking for a lotion that didn&#x27;t aggravate my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>It then suddenly stopped working well for me - as many others have - and I have since stopped using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I finally found it!</li>
            <li>This seems to prevent the breakouts and is very soothing, no stinging!</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with acne lately and this product is great.</li>
            <li>I first sampled this at Costco when they had a roadshow.</li>
            <li>I love this product I would definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I use it every morning after I shower to give my face some much needed moisture!  </li>
            <li>This is what I call my first grown up moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The first time I wore this creme, the smell irritated my nose all day.</li>
            <li>A few days using this product you will see a good improvement on your skin.</li>
            <li>I formally used Clean and Clear moisturizer with sa in.  </li>
            <li>Very mild and low in scent, but makes skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Living many years here in an arid climate where the dryness and strong sunshine take a toll on our facial skin, I was always told by dermatologists to use moisturizers especially on the dryer areas of my</li>
            <li>My wife has extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use many products that are labeled for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>She swore up and down that this cream, which she applied religiously every morning and sometimes at night, was the reason her skin was still so beautiful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not always easy to find locally, but Amazon seems to be out of stock pretty often on this item as well.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised to find that it had an extremely sweet smell that got on everything I wore and touched.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The only product line i&#x27;ve found in the entire marketplace that is the actual ph of skin causing it to have vastly superior results to anything else available.</li>
            <li>The Sebamed has been awesome in doing a similar job to the two more expensive products!  </li>
            <li>The pH is balanced perfectly, I would highly recommend it especially with dry winter approaching for us up north!</li>
            <li>It is really good for sensitive skin and it calmed down my breakouts.</li>
            <li>Also have the added bonus of being quite cost effective when compared to other high quality products.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer isn&#x27;t heavily scented, it&#x27;s rather light and fresh and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Wow,  I have cleared up and my face seems soft and is smooth.  </li>
            <li>and she told me it was only available in Germany.</li>
            <li>This product may work, but I really couldn&#x27;t stand the horrendous</li>
            <li>my skin is very sensative.</li>
            <li>and I did not expect a very inexpensive product to solve my skin issues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soothing and calming...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what that meant or how it affected my skin.</li>
            <li>the root cause of the problem was the very medication prescribed.</li>
            <li>I really like it for a night cream.</li>
            <li>Not greasy but really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is on my Amazon subscription so I can have a continuous supply for my whole family.</li>
            <li>I have really picky skin.</li>
            <li>This cream never irritates my skin, and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion because it has absolutely no odor.  </li>
            <li>Then after 4 days, I didn&#x27;t notice it as much.</li>
            <li>My daugther has super sensitive skin, and we have been spending a fortune on special Clinique products (Redness Solutions series) since that was the only thing her skin would tolerate.</li>
            <li>To me it feels like an extreme moisturizing for preventing wrinkles, which I&#x27;m sure it does.</li>
            <li>and I like it better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>catch-22: My skin would either be so DRY even after applying the moisturizer that my skin would then produce lots MORE oil (there is nothing grosser than oily peely dried out skin), or the moisturizers would literally sit on top of my skin, like vegetable oil, and break me out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really creamy but not thick</li>
            <li>a month or two I will come back and do a patch test, and then full face if I can.  </li>
            <li>Consistently works well on my skin,not oily but leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Both of which are awesome and very expensive.  </li>
            <li>but as a basic moisturizer it&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li>I have tried many many face creams, but this is the only one that works with my sensitive skin and does not make my face turn red and dry.</li>
            <li>I ordered this cream for my son, who again has eczema, and I am older, but have a lot of allergies.  </li>
            <li>Will recommend highly both for quality and price.</li>
            <li>so I figured I&#x27;d give this highly rated cream a try</li>
            <li>Very lovely cream for the face, and other areas that are dry...  </li>
            <li>I now put on with dampish hands to thin out on my more oily patches and use straight around my eyes and smile areas.</li>
            <li>I love it, and use everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already on my 2nd bottle of it; the product is affordable and worth it.</li>
            <li>She has very limited choices when it comes to skin care product due to her highly sensitive skin, but she absolutely loved this too.  </li>
            <li>My monthly Subscribe and Save shipment of this cream got skipped AGAIN for this reason - right in the middle of winter!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to those with sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>Received it today, only need a small amount, which I mix with my St Ives Collagen Moisturizing Cream, sinks in fast , good on my sixty year old dry areas, feels comfortable also!</li>
            <li>At least I look and feel good on the outside.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think lotions for sensitive skin should have perfume as a main ingredient .</li>
            <li>Every winter having problems with my skin, getting super dry after what peeling and itching all over.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>But I feel I must warn others with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells and would like  </li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>In my estimation the Sebamed products are top shelf and a small price to pay to a cure.</li>
            <li>and I tried many facial creams that left me with lightly red skin and</li>
            <li>Anyway, whoever suffer from sensitive skin - don&#x27;t think, buy this product, you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
            <li>I normally use Oil of Olay Complete Defense, which was recommended years ago by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>But if you have normal to oily sensitive skin I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>live near 6000 feet and</li>
            <li>This keeps my dry skin feeling fresh and moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li>So far First Aid Beauty and Cetaphil seem to be the only products that work for me.</li>
            <li>People with sensitive skin are often sensitive to perfumes!</li>
            <li>I really cannot say enough about Sebamed&#x27;s products; they have completely changed the look &amp; feel of my skin!</li>
            <li>These products are a little cheaper and they are on Amazon, but if you look up the website for earth science, they offer FREE SHIPPING for orders over $25.  </li>
            <li>I use this in combo with the liquid face/body cleanser and the result is clear skin.</li>
            <li>My skin had just begun to clear up</li>
            <li>This is my second jar, and so far I think my skin seems to have a glow, and feels much softer.  </li>
            <li>I used their lotion and it helped clear her eczema up.</li>
            <li>When I was 16 years old, I was observing my Aunt(then in her 50&#x27;s)put on her morning face cream.  </li>
            <li>Your skin is so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>so far I am satisified with this product.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, you have to try this.</li>
            <li>Acne fighting creams dries out my skin and anti-aging creams for mature skin makes me break out.</li>
            <li>It make my skin feel soft and moisture.</li>
            <li>i guess my sensitive skin does not like this moisturizer</li>
            <li>I switched over from Aveeno as my skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>Think of the old Tupperware party pricing packages.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to someone with oily or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft, naturally looking.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I should preface this review with the statement that I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I feel I need to warn others that this item WILL AGGRAVATE AN ALREADY UPSET SENSITIVE SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cream.&lt;br /&gt;Really agrees with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty creamy and caused minor breakouts on my forehead which can be oily at times.  </li>
            <li>A product advertised as being for sensitive skin should be unscented.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face springy and soft and never greasy or irritated.</li>
            <li>Food for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive, adult acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks, but I really like it.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, run like your hair is on fire.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>Not heavy scented by any means.</li>
            <li>I order this brand of Moisturing Cream and body wash for my 6 year old grandson, who has eczema and</li>
            <li>it matches the pH of natural skin, which probably helps with my skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and some of the age spots are fading.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and non greasey and</li>
            <li>And not tight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very satisfy with this product although it is a little greasy, it did help my skin texture ;)</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t moisturizing as much as I had hoped, but my face stopped being overly dry.</li>
            <li>I have mature skin and am sensitive to ingredients and occasionally have rosacea.  </li>
            <li>The face and body cleanser is like no other I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li>My only wish is that they made a version with some SPF in it to help protect my sensitive skin from the sun!</li>
            <li>To my shock, by morning one was completely swollen shut and the other was very swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Oil of Olay, Neutrogena, biore, Clinique, Bare Escentuals, Boscia, Cerave, Eucerin, Aveeno, Shiseido, ...</li>
            <li>the years, I&#x27;ve tried countless moisturizers that are supposed to be hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, for sensitive skin, etc.</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and creamy and makes my skin feel and look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li>this is the only thing that works for my ultra sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The mice they used for the testing must not have had human sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sensitive, prone to breakouts, and very red sometimes.</li>
            <li>Decided to try this cream and have no regrets.</li>
            <li>Usually new, different, products (especially anti-aging ones)</li>
            <li>Since I was trying to protect my skin while not making my skin reaction worse, I applied the CARAPEX first with no serum r other products to be sure I was only evaluating one product at a time.  </li>
            <li>It made me so depressed especially since I also developed eczema particularly on very low humidity days in the valley.</li>
            <li>About two years ago I developed a flakey red facial rash and dandruff.</li>
            <li>I rarely use it twice a day anymore since my skin has been less dry since I&#x27;ve been using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My extremely sensitive, dry and acne prone skin began to worsen when I turned 41.</li>
            <li>my skin felt creamy sometimes (even though I never put too much - just slight amount of a cream).</li>
            <li>Carapex Natural Anti-aging Night Cream with Elastin &amp; Collagen, for Dry to Combination</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sold, and I&#x27;m delighted to find it here on amazon.</li>
            <li> Initially, I LOVED the products</li>
            <li> I feel the cream I got from Amazon is not as good as Costco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so I bought two and the price was so good</li>
            <li> Sebamed works for me and this was good price for my pocket.</li>
            <li> It literally feels GOOD on my skin.</li>
            <li> It has been really good for my son because it took away the scaliness.  </li>
            <li> creams and this one feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Feels so good.</li>
            <li> and that is a good thing on me</li>
            <li> The Body Lotion has a wonderful light fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> I had also used cervae moisturizer which was good</li>
            <li> (maybe I didn&#x27;t give it a fair chance as the rest of my routine at the time was problematic) but does not compare to this.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist and feeling good.  </li>
            <li> I use this after I clean my face with Sebamed Face and Body Wash &amp; this product is the perfect follow-up.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with this moisturizer.</li>

            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> I love this cream!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  </li>
            <li> I love this cream !</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love all of their products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not greasy won&#x27;t make you break out!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Too strong for the face, but great on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> perfume-y smells on my face and this stuff is great and easy to go on with no smell whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Another amazing product from Sebamed.</li>
            <li> She uses this along eith their cleansing foam for an amazing combination.</li>
            <li> For a month or two, it worked amazingly</li>
            <li> But found a great alternative,  from the Earth Science line, Clarifying cleansing lotion, Apricot night cream, Fragrance free moisturizing lotion etc.  </li>
            <li> great moisuturizing cream - free of dyes ect.</li>
            <li> Nice medium weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It absorbs, feels nice, seems to help ward off dryness and tightness - and no breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am hoping I will end up loving it,</li>
            <li> It absorbs really nicely into the skin without making my skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Good price too :)</li>
            <li> Tried it and liked it, but decided to switch to an organic brand.  </li>
            <li> I used Aveno before but used this when I was at my sisters house and forgot my own face cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky on the skin and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true; the smell isn&#x27;t great but the consistency is really nice.</li>
            <li> and when I opened it the smell was very strong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily, but it gets parched very easily.</li>
            <li> The best product...great for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> However, have now returned to Sebamed because it is light on my face, absorbs well and my skin looks and feel good.  </li>
            <li> This cream is the best so far in terms of cost and value.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic; Amazon has the best prices on this line, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for my sensitive, fair, acne-prone (chin) skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my skin and the cost is just right.</li>
            <li> It is a nice, light moisturizer with a pleasant, clean smell (in my opinion).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy , goes on very smooth  and stays on all day....</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent to it, not too strong.  </li>
            <li> , Sensitive Skin is very good</li>
            <li> I even have salespeople from Mary Kay and Avon ask what I do to have such a wonderful complexion.</li>
            <li> My skin is finally healthy.</li>
            <li> I immediatley fell in love with how Sebamed felt going on and how my skin glowed all day afterward.</li>
            <li> I love Sebamed.</li>
            <li> Both my daugther and I love this cream.</li>
            <li> My face feels softer for sure.</li>
            <li> Got it on time and up love this product</li>
            <li> I was leery of buying something I wasn&#x27;t sure of.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of product, you can always add more product if you need, but start out applying sparingly.</li>
            <li> Such a great skincare product!</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer and so does my husband.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> strangely more dirt fell out of the box along with the jar.</li>
            <li> and I still love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I also love their eye cream...</li>
            <li> /&gt;--people can buy this product without doubts :)</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I also introduced this product to my friends and they also love it.</li>
            <li> It is the best facial cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels with this product.</li>
            <li> repurchased it so many times.</li>
            <li> I came to Amazon to read reviews and pick a safe product to use while I was so irritated.  </li>
            <li> Skin, Fragrance Free, Perfect for Sensitive Skin, 2oz</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I may LOVE this product after my dermatitis reaction is gone -</li>
            <li> a LOT more, if it had NO SMELL AT ALL.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin feel smooth all day!  </li>
            <li> (I bought it though at Costco during a roadshow to get a better price.)  </li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> Just try it:)</li>
            <li> It is a great product, not oily but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and I thought my skin looked better than it had in a while</li>
            <li> Overall, I think Sebamed makes some top-notch products.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cream I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm or a leg!</li>
            <li> After two more experiments, I trashed the container.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is so much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a cream before as most products clog my pores</li>
            <li> This my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So glad I can purchase it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> love this a lot of products break me out</li>
            <li> We love this moisturizer and have chosen it time and again.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years and this is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, it&#x27;s eat right and drink plenty of water, which is also good for the skin.</li>
            <li> The entire line is great; LOVE the Cleansing Shower Oil!    </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this along with the night moisturizing cream are great!</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for dry skin....</li>
            <li> moisturizer is great b/c I have very sensitive skin and everything often leaves me irritated.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> My skin loves this product and I feel good about using it knowing that it is a pure product, PH balanced.</li>
            <li> product is very good for all the different skin types, we have with my family.</li>
            <li> This is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They have a great selection of skin care products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I say if you need a good moisturizer, I would highly recommend that you consider this!</li>
            <li> I used to just use it exclusively on my face, but now it apply it over my whole body because it&#x27;s so good.  </li>
            <li> I will try other Sebamed products since I&#x27;m truly very impressed.</li>
            <li> Compared to other moisturizing creams this is the best.  </li>
            <li> but this keeps skin smooth and smells great and its sensitive to my face</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to work into your skin.</li>
            <li> This is actually a good moisturizer and not just something you settle for because it is safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also the strong smell irritates the skin.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is Hypoallergenic and Non-comedogenic for sensitive skin works perfectly for my acne prone, oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth feel and non oily.</li>
            <li> Manufacturer should try to make  this product fragrant free.</li>
            <li> They sent me a free handcream.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that my search is over finally</li>
            <li> moisturizer is also paraben free, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> This product is so light &amp; non greasy that you can&#x27;t even tell its on your face.</li>
            <li> its light, it moisturizes, and its not greasy.</li>
            <li> and this product moisturizes perfectly year round (it&#x27;s not too oily for mid-Atlantic summers).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times a day for years and it&#x27;s just marvelous.</li>
            <li> The jar comes filled to the brim.</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much because of its light consistency!</li>
            <li> No scent, feels good, inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t both my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin feeling very fresh and has helped keep my acne under control.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and creamy and the scent is clean.</li>
            <li> I live in Az, and I&#x27;ve tried face creams from Dior, Lancôme , Mario Badescu....and so on, but nothing got me so many compliments on my skin like the sebamed lotion!</li>
            <li> Love this cream - great for sensitive skin, absorbs quickly, moisturizes thoroughly but doesn&#x27;t promote breakouts, and a decent quantity for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth trying!</li>
            <li> This cream is great for the dry areas of my face.</li>
            <li> After applying it on my face, it has a light oily feel, but not sticky and it seemed to absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many dept. store creams and spent good money on all of them.  </li>
            <li> and my face turned bright red.  </li>
            <li> I figured she must know what she was talking about as she had modeled many years for Macy&#x27;s in the 1950&#x27;s, and was very conscientious about her looks.  </li>
            <li> Using a bunch of products really throws your ph off, causing more problems than not.</li>
            <li> While I liked that product, pairing with the acne wash actually dried out my skin and caused me to produce more sebum which led to more acne.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer, you really cannot beat it.</li>
            <li> This face cream is great and inexpensive in comparison to other brands.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and really can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> The first day, and then the first night, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!!</li>
            <li> When I ran out, I tried to find a new supply of my favorite Body Wash, Lotion and Cream.</li>
            <li> It has a very silky texture and is easy to apply and rub in if you wish.  </li>
            <li> It is not too oily and does a good job in preventing dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have major skin troubles so most moisturizers work okay with my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, rosacea, and most products have an adverse reaction with my skin.  </li>
            <li> but I like to switch my creams especially when is a more natural product:) I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores, but it is wonderful and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I silently swore I would find it on my own one day and began my search.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to see this cream finally on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This product is used mostly for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is break out free, moisturized perfectly, smooth, soft, and radiant.</li>
            <li> /moisturizers I&#x27;m using, but this face cream helps keep my skin healthy and clear.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most creams either burn my eyes or make me itch.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and have never been able to find a product that won&#x27;t irritate or cause acne on my face; that is until now.</li>
            <li> Initially received this as a gift - liked the description on the packaging</li>
            <li> Love this skin cream, just as good as the more expensive creams.  </li>
            <li> Well worth trying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many face creams with my sensitive skin - this one seems to be working well.  </li>
            <li> Surely they would not adverise a product for sensitive skin that would do this to me.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend giving this moisturizer a shot if you&#x27;re experiencing dryness and break out easily.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong though- get ready to smell like grandma.</li>
            <li> Best yet, when I went to the grocer&#x27;s yesterday to pick up a few things with only lipstick on, no powder, foundations, anything, the checkout clerk asked for ID and was amazed at my true age.</li>
            <li> I have loved the face wash (see my other review) and tried the face cream today.</li>
            <li> I can honestly tell you my skin texture is nearly identical to what it was when I was in high school.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were right.</li>
            <li> It adds just the right amount of moisture without being greasy.</li>
            <li> But this product makes my skin soft and so clean!</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this moisturizer is too strong and decidedly masculine.</li>
            <li> However, I contacted Sebamed company and was assured that the product was the same great product I was used to just packaged differently for the US</li>
            <li> Mild product, works very well.</li>
            <li> I have very  sensitive skin, but I feel really  comfortable with this cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light &amp; non-greasy, yet it completely hydrates my skin &amp; makes my face feel super soft.</li>
            <li> Is light ,a little goes a long way ,plus is paraben free and smells good( I like the smell)I got mine at shoprite  </li>
            <li> Getting my second jar this week:)</li>
            <li> I REALLY do like this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> When i first started using this line, i used the liquid face and body soap plus the body lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> This product not only doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin but makes her feel better.</li>
            <li> I first bought this a Costco wholesale from a booth they had set up.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first about buying this product since it has petroleum as one ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I love this produce and have used it for several years.  </li>
            <li> I use this cream daily - love it.</li>
            <li> I love their brand of face wash; only their face wash doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li> Love all the Sebamed products especially the moisturizing face</li>
            <li> My skin really does well with this!  </li>
            <li> I first tried sebamed from a trunk show at Costco.</li>
            <li> (Not that I want a higher price</li>
            <li> I really do like this face cream!  </li>
            <li> I first tried Sebamed when looking for a lotion that didn&#x27;t aggravate my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> It then suddenly stopped working well for me - as many others have - and I have since stopped using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad I finally found it!</li>
            <li> This seems to prevent the breakouts and is very soothing, no stinging!</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne lately and this product is great.</li>
            <li> I first sampled this at Costco when they had a roadshow.</li>
            <li> I love this product I would definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I use it every morning after I shower to give my face some much needed moisture!  </li>
            <li> This is what I call my first grown up moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore this creme, the smell irritated my nose all day.</li>
            <li> A few days using this product you will see a good improvement on your skin.</li>
            <li> I formally used Clean and Clear moisturizer with sa in.  </li>
            <li> Very mild and low in scent, but makes skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Living many years here in an arid climate where the dryness and strong sunshine take a toll on our facial skin, I was always told by dermatologists to use moisturizers especially on the dryer areas of my</li>
            <li> My wife has extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use many products that are labeled for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> She swore up and down that this cream, which she applied religiously every morning and sometimes at night, was the reason her skin was still so beautiful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not always easy to find locally, but Amazon seems to be out of stock pretty often on this item as well.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to find that it had an extremely sweet smell that got on everything I wore and touched.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only product line i&#x27;ve found in the entire marketplace that is the actual ph of skin causing it to have vastly superior results to anything else available.</li>
            <li> The Sebamed has been awesome in doing a similar job to the two more expensive products!  </li>
            <li> The pH is balanced perfectly, I would highly recommend it especially with dry winter approaching for us up north!</li>
            <li> It is really good for sensitive skin and it calmed down my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Also have the added bonus of being quite cost effective when compared to other high quality products.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer isn&#x27;t heavily scented, it&#x27;s rather light and fresh and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Wow,  I have cleared up and my face seems soft and is smooth.  </li>
            <li> and she told me it was only available in Germany.</li>
            <li> This product may work, but I really couldn&#x27;t stand the horrendous</li>
            <li> my skin is very sensative.</li>
            <li> and I did not expect a very inexpensive product to solve my skin issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soothing and calming...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what that meant or how it affected my skin.</li>
            <li> the root cause of the problem was the very medication prescribed.</li>
            <li> I really like it for a night cream.</li>
            <li> Not greasy but really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is on my Amazon subscription so I can have a continuous supply for my whole family.</li>
            <li> I have really picky skin.</li>
            <li> This cream never irritates my skin, and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion because it has absolutely no odor.  </li>
            <li> Then after 4 days, I didn&#x27;t notice it as much.</li>
            <li> My daugther has super sensitive skin, and we have been spending a fortune on special Clinique products (Redness Solutions series) since that was the only thing her skin would tolerate.</li>
            <li> To me it feels like an extreme moisturizing for preventing wrinkles, which I&#x27;m sure it does.</li>
            <li> and I like it better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> catch-22: My skin would either be so DRY even after applying the moisturizer that my skin would then produce lots MORE oil (there is nothing grosser than oily peely dried out skin), or the moisturizers would literally sit on top of my skin, like vegetable oil, and break me out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really creamy but not thick</li>
            <li> a month or two I will come back and do a patch test, and then full face if I can.  </li>
            <li> Consistently works well on my skin,not oily but leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Both of which are awesome and very expensive.  </li>
            <li> but as a basic moisturizer it&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li> I have tried many many face creams, but this is the only one that works with my sensitive skin and does not make my face turn red and dry.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream for my son, who again has eczema, and I am older, but have a lot of allergies.  </li>
            <li> Will recommend highly both for quality and price.</li>
            <li> so I figured I&#x27;d give this highly rated cream a try</li>
            <li> Very lovely cream for the face, and other areas that are dry...  </li>
            <li> I now put on with dampish hands to thin out on my more oily patches and use straight around my eyes and smile areas.</li>
            <li> I love it, and use everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already on my 2nd bottle of it; the product is affordable and worth it.</li>
            <li> She has very limited choices when it comes to skin care product due to her highly sensitive skin, but she absolutely loved this too.  </li>
            <li> My monthly Subscribe and Save shipment of this cream got skipped AGAIN for this reason - right in the middle of winter!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to those with sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> Received it today, only need a small amount, which I mix with my St Ives Collagen Moisturizing Cream, sinks in fast , good on my sixty year old dry areas, feels comfortable also!</li>
            <li> At least I look and feel good on the outside.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think lotions for sensitive skin should have perfume as a main ingredient .</li>
            <li> Every winter having problems with my skin, getting super dry after what peeling and itching all over.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> But I feel I must warn others with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells and would like  </li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> In my estimation the Sebamed products are top shelf and a small price to pay to a cure.</li>
            <li> and I tried many facial creams that left me with lightly red skin and</li>
            <li> Anyway, whoever suffer from sensitive skin - don&#x27;t think, buy this product, you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
            <li> I normally use Oil of Olay Complete Defense, which was recommended years ago by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> But if you have normal to oily sensitive skin I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> live near 6000 feet and</li>
            <li> This keeps my dry skin feeling fresh and moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> So far First Aid Beauty and Cetaphil seem to be the only products that work for me.</li>
            <li> People with sensitive skin are often sensitive to perfumes!</li>
            <li> I really cannot say enough about Sebamed&#x27;s products; they have completely changed the look &amp; feel of my skin!</li>
            <li> These products are a little cheaper and they are on Amazon, but if you look up the website for earth science, they offer FREE SHIPPING for orders over $25.  </li>
            <li> I use this in combo with the liquid face/body cleanser and the result is clear skin.</li>
            <li> My skin had just begun to clear up</li>
            <li> This is my second jar, and so far I think my skin seems to have a glow, and feels much softer.  </li>
            <li> I used their lotion and it helped clear her eczema up.</li>
            <li> When I was 16 years old, I was observing my Aunt(then in her 50&#x27;s)put on her morning face cream.  </li>
            <li> Your skin is so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> so far I am satisified with this product.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, you have to try this.</li>
            <li> Acne fighting creams dries out my skin and anti-aging creams for mature skin makes me break out.</li>
            <li> It make my skin feel soft and moisture.</li>
            <li> i guess my sensitive skin does not like this moisturizer</li>
            <li> I switched over from Aveeno as my skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> Think of the old Tupperware party pricing packages.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to someone with oily or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft, naturally looking.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I should preface this review with the statement that I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I feel I need to warn others that this item WILL AGGRAVATE AN ALREADY UPSET SENSITIVE SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cream.&lt;br /&gt;Really agrees with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty creamy and caused minor breakouts on my forehead which can be oily at times.  </li>
            <li> A product advertised as being for sensitive skin should be unscented.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face springy and soft and never greasy or irritated.</li>
            <li> Food for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive, adult acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, run like your hair is on fire.</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> Not heavy scented by any means.</li>
            <li> I order this brand of Moisturing Cream and body wash for my 6 year old grandson, who has eczema and</li>
            <li> it matches the pH of natural skin, which probably helps with my skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and some of the age spots are fading.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and non greasey and</li>
            <li> And not tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very satisfy with this product although it is a little greasy, it did help my skin texture ;)</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t moisturizing as much as I had hoped, but my face stopped being overly dry.</li>
            <li> I have mature skin and am sensitive to ingredients and occasionally have rosacea.  </li>
            <li> The face and body cleanser is like no other I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li> My only wish is that they made a version with some SPF in it to help protect my sensitive skin from the sun!</li>
            <li> To my shock, by morning one was completely swollen shut and the other was very swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oil of Olay, Neutrogena, biore, Clinique, Bare Escentuals, Boscia, Cerave, Eucerin, Aveeno, Shiseido, ...</li>
            <li> the years, I&#x27;ve tried countless moisturizers that are supposed to be hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, for sensitive skin, etc.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and creamy and makes my skin feel and look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> this is the only thing that works for my ultra sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The mice they used for the testing must not have had human sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sensitive, prone to breakouts, and very red sometimes.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this cream and have no regrets.</li>
            <li> Usually new, different, products (especially anti-aging ones)</li>
            <li> Since I was trying to protect my skin while not making my skin reaction worse, I applied the CARAPEX first with no serum r other products to be sure I was only evaluating one product at a time.  </li>
            <li> It made me so depressed especially since I also developed eczema particularly on very low humidity days in the valley.</li>
            <li> About two years ago I developed a flakey red facial rash and dandruff.</li>
            <li> I rarely use it twice a day anymore since my skin has been less dry since I&#x27;ve been using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My extremely sensitive, dry and acne prone skin began to worsen when I turned 41.</li>
            <li> my skin felt creamy sometimes (even though I never put too much - just slight amount of a cream).</li>
            <li> Carapex Natural Anti-aging Night Cream with Elastin &amp; Collagen, for Dry to Combination</li>
            <li> I get tired of really smelly cremes, and this cream has a nice neutral smell that I don&#x27;t get tired from.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using many other expensive products but nothing suits my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar, and I rarely stick with one product for that long (and I do mean long, because one jar lasted me several months)!</li>
            <li> I tend to swing from oily to dry skin and back to oily depending on the kinds of acne products</li>
            <li> In less than two weeks of using Sebamed products my condition completely cleared up and has not returned.</li>
            <li> Face is less oily and leaves face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I confess I&#x27;m furious that I wasted my time and money, not to mention the embarrassment I suffered at the hands of a medical professional.</li>
            <li> Sebamed soap (green liquid) totally cleared up my adult acne.</li>
            <li> In the middle of the night my eye area was feeling very dry.  </li>
            <li> and she commented on the strange smell as well.</li>
            <li> Paula from Long Beach, CA</li>
            <li> Also, the minor wrinkles that have been developing</li>
            <li> Worth buying if you are still confused about face creams.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too dry.</li>
            <li> so if your skin is really dry this may not work that well.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is similar to Active Moist by Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also never liked a heavy night cream, and this one seems to be just right for me, and my son.  </li>
            <li> I went to a highly regarded skin doctor every six months to deal with the problem and it only got worse.</li>
            <li> I saw no such warning on this product, so I applied a very thin layer most delicately to my eye area.  </li>
            <li> I thought after a week or two that not having any SPF would be a problem, but I think now that my skin is healthier, it&#x27;s less likely to burn.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still wear my big sunglasses to cover my face, but I have noticed so much improvement in my skin that I almost never have to use concealer, and forget about foundation!</li>
            <li> only last about 1 or 2 weeks before my skin decides it isn&#x27;t working (small breakouts, etc).  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a fortune trying department store and internet moisturizers and anti-aging products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using only this cream for a few years now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great, didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li> The product is as expected from quality perspective.&lt;br /&gt;Received in time.</li>
            <li> I shared it with my mom during a recent visit to Chicago during the harsh winter.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive for the amount of product, but if you use it sparely, \\&quot;Mom\\&quot; says it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t sell it at pharmacies anymore, though on amazon is a bit cheaper, but I have to find a partner to buy a least two packs in order to safe on shipping charge.</li>
            <li> It surpasses other similar creams the rub off in little waxy particles.  </li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way, too.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little of it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The little tub lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> Have had NO breakouts or irritation like other creams have caused.</li>
            <li> If you have never used this brand, I suggest looking at their other products too.</li>
            <li> It does not necessarily battle wrinkles but at least I do not break out</li>
            <li> Dark spots are lighter and bumps have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would add to this one is sun protection at least 15 or 30.</li>
            <li> Very helpful with my troubled skin.</li>
            <li> the arid winters are the worst on our skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sebamed is a light and penetrating moisturizer we use year round on the sensitive, combination and dry skin in our household.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It can be dry at times and oily at times but is usually somewhere in between.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with Aveno lotion on my face, but it too has a subtle unpleasant odor, although it is described as \\&quot;fragrance free.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I typically used lotions from Dr. Perricone or Murad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li> It does have a slight odd, odor to it.  </li>
            <li> I asked what she was using and she showed me this little container with SEBAMED written on it.</li>
            <li> I was not able to apply the Carapex there due to</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;ll purchase another cream when I&#x27;m in Sephora and they always go to waste because nothing makes my skin feel the way Sebamed does.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few skin creams that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I just received this product a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly,without leaving a heavy feeling or residue.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years now</li>
            <li> I swim year round outdoors  - so my skin takes a beating.  </li>
            <li> If you have trouble skin and acne</li>
            <li> However, they were either worthless as moisturizers, or more commonly they caused my skin to break out in blemishes.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is about 25% less!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying it from my dermatologist, but no more.</li>
            <li> I have used Sebamed products for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> No more department store brands for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> If I feel like I need less moisture, I add a little water to it in my hands to thin it out.</li>
            <li> My face ended up looking worse and worse, I am not only battling wrinkles but acne, blotches, pockmarks, discoloration, dehydrated, reddish looking and scratchy skin.</li>
            <li> I used to use a lot of tough acne washes but have found changing my diet (less dairy) and products, has drastically helped.  </li>
            <li> I noticed she had hardly any lines on her face making her look about 40.</li>
            <li> I hardly even have to use powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a problem with moisturizers lately.</li>
            <li> The rating I gave it was due to the unfortunate condition of the jar when I received it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not buying anymore of it due to awkward accessibility plus zany point-value price levels.  </li>
            <li> I wash with Cetaphil or St. Ives Green Tea Scrub, use Dickinson&#x27;s toner (thought was unnecessary and drying but now realize how wrong I was), and follow up with this</li>
            <li> This item is very hard to find in retail locations.  </li>
            <li> But that one does not exist and I got tired of trying all these creams.</li>
            <li> It smelled terribly perfume-y, so much so that I ended up coughing.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased VERY expensive name brand creams, which I found where MUCH less moisturizing..</li>
            <li> The WORST aspect of buying SebaMed products is the lack of a specific PRICE . . .</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but nothing else was working.</li>
            <li> The box containing the jar of cream was dusty and dirty...</li>
            <li> So sad CVS discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> Does it smell weird?</li>
            <li> Due to a bad reaction with a product with SPF ingredient Oxybenzone, my face was having a bad Contact Dermatitis reaction.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sebamed has a very faint floral scent.  </li>
            <li> It was not as bad as some products I have tried</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> When I was 16 years old, I was observing my Aunt(then in her 50&#x27;s)put on her morning face cream.  I noticed she had hardly any lines on her face making her look about 40. I asked what she was using and she showed me this little container with SEBAMED written on it. She swore up and down that this cream, which she applied religiously every morning and sometimes at night, was the reason her skin was still so beautiful.  I figured she must know what she was talking about as she had modeled many years for Macy&#x27;s in the 1950&#x27;s, and was very conscientious about her looks.  I asked her where she got it from and she told me it was only available in Germany. I silently swore I would find it on my own one day and began my search. Several years later, with the coming of the internet, I found it at a Chicago apothocary that specialized in German imports. I have been using it ever since and am now in my thirties. Women &amp; men approach me all the time and ask what I use for a moisterizer. I even have salespeople from Mary Kay and Avon ask what I do to have such a wonderful complexion. I can honestly tell you my skin texture is nearly identical to what it was when I was in high school. No crow&#x27;s feet, no mouth lines, no nothing!! I am thrilled to see this cream finally on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> awesome product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this moisturizer. Smooth feel and non oily. Manufacturer should try to make  this product fragrant free. The fragrance of this moisturizer is too strong and decidedly masculine.</li>
            <li> A few days using this product you will see a good improvement on your skin. Your skin is so hydrated and soft. so far I am satisified with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works well to keep my skin nice and moisture, good for your skin after shaving my face and head.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything. I&#x27;ve used Oil of Olay, Neutrogena, biore, Clinique, Bare Escentuals, Boscia, Cerave, Eucerin, Aveeno, Shiseido, ... am I leaving some out? Probably. I kept encountering this catch-22: My skin would either be so DRY even after applying the moisturizer that my skin would then produce lots MORE oil (there is nothing grosser than oily peely dried out skin), or the moisturizers would literally sit on top of my skin, like vegetable oil, and break me out. And I&#x27;m not prone to break-outs. I just happened to see this Sebamed box one day at the store &amp; figured I&#x27;d try it. Holeeee schnikes. The first day, and then the first night, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!! My skin felt GOOD. And not oily. And not tight. I thought after a week or two that not having any SPF would be a problem, but I think now that my skin is healthier, it&#x27;s less likely to burn. Because it just doesn&#x27;t anymore. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still wear my big sunglasses to cover my face, but I have noticed so much improvement in my skin that I almost never have to use concealer, and forget about foundation! I hardly even have to use powder. My skin is finally healthy. If you have sensitive skin, you have to try this.</li>
            <li> My Mom introduced this to me about 7 years ago. I typically used lotions from Dr. Perricone or Murad. I immediatley fell in love with how Sebamed felt going on and how my skin glowed all day afterward. This lotion doesn&#x27;t make me break out which some can make me do. Every now and then I&#x27;ll purchase another cream when I&#x27;m in Sephora and they always go to waste because nothing makes my skin feel the way Sebamed does. At a fraction of the cost too1</li>
            <li> This product may work, but I really couldn&#x27;t stand the horrendous smell-- I ended up washing it off my face and hands before I could experience any benefits. I gave it to a friend to try and she commented on the strange smell as well.</li>
            <li> I tried so many face moisturizer, some of them expensive and some of them not. My face ended up looking worse and worse, I am not only battling wrinkles but acne, blotches, pockmarks, discoloration, dehydrated, reddish looking and scratchy skin. So basically I need a cream that can handle all these issues. But that one does not exist and I got tired of trying all these creams. Acne fighting creams dries out my skin and anti-aging creams for mature skin makes me break out. So I searched for something basic and ended up with this. It does not necessarily battle wrinkles but at least I do not break out and my face feels hydrated and moisturized. I use this in combo with the liquid face/body cleanser and the result is clear skin. Finally!! I love Sebamed.</li>
            <li> Both my daugther and I love this cream. My daugther has super sensitive skin, and we have been spending a fortune on special Clinique products (Redness Solutions series) since that was the only thing her skin would tolerate. Then we stumbled upon the Sebamed products and have used them ever since. Will recommend highly both for quality and price.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended me this along with the face wash. Very mild and low in scent, but makes skin so soft and smooth. Worth buying if you are still confused about face creams.</li>
            <li> Nice medium weight moisturizer. They sent me a free handcream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had oily-to-mixed, acne-prone skin all my life. Living many years here in an arid climate where the dryness and strong sunshine take a toll on our facial skin, I was always told by dermatologists to use moisturizers especially on the dryer areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried countless moisturizers that are supposed to be hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, for sensitive skin, etc. However, they were either worthless as moisturizers, or more commonly they caused my skin to break out in blemishes. Then I tried this cream, as a nighttime moisturizer, and I&#x27;m delighted. It absorbs, feels nice, seems to help ward off dryness and tightness - and no breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold, and I&#x27;m delighted to find it here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a month now. My face feels softer for sure. It has a nice scent to it, not too strong.  I read a lot of great reviews so I am hoping I will end up loving it, but it&#x27;s probably too soon to tell. I have no complaints though. A little seems to go a long way, too.</li>
            <li> This cream is great for the dry areas of my face. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Got it on time and up love this product</li>
            <li> This is the best mosturazier I used in years! I live in Az, and I&#x27;ve tried face creams from Dior, Lancôme , Mario Badescu....and so on, but nothing got me so many compliments on my skin like the sebamed lotion! It&#x27;s non greasy , goes on very smooth  and stays on all day.... The smell that everyone complains about doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit! Getting my second jar this week:)</li>
            <li> Very lovely cream for the face, and other areas that are dry...  I am very happy with this purchase.. I have purchased VERY expensive name brand creams, which I found where MUCH less moisturizing..</li>
            <li> I have very  sensitive skin, but I feel really  comfortable with this cream.It make my skin feel soft and moisture.</li>
            <li> i used this for 2-3 days and then on the 3rd day i got a burning sensation and had flushed red skin..  i guess my sensitive skin does not like this moisturizer</li>
            <li> I REALLY do like this moisturizer! One of the best I have ever tried!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22. It didn&#x27;t break me out, but made my skin shiny and oily, especially my forehead. This will work for Normal/Dry skin. That&#x27;s the only reason why I gave it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I use this after I clean my face with Sebamed Face and Body Wash &amp; this product is the perfect follow-up. It&#x27;s super light &amp; non-greasy, yet it completely hydrates my skin &amp; makes my face feel super soft. I really cannot say enough about Sebamed&#x27;s products; they have completely changed the look &amp; feel of my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying it from my dermatologist, but no more. Amazon&#x27;s price is about 25% less! The entire line is great; LOVE the Cleansing Shower Oil!    Paula from Long Beach, CA</li>
            <li> Cream has helped the dryness for my face without being greasy. Have had NO breakouts or irritation like other creams have caused. The smell is pretty strong though- get ready to smell like grandma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very satisfy with this product although it is a little greasy, it did help my skin texture ;)</li>
            <li> This product is used mostly for sensitive skin.  It is hard to find in stores, but it is wonderful and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is great for my sensitive skin. I switched over from Aveeno as my skin is extremely sensitive. This keeps my dry skin feeling fresh and moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> my skin is very sensative.</li>
            <li> When i first started using this line, i used the liquid face and body soap plus the body lotion on my face. I have since started using the bar soap and this jar of moisturizer and what a DIFFERENCE! NO ACNE! i love it! Will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> Wish it included sunscreen with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used Sebamed products for the past 7 years. I moved to the US a year ago and came with a supply of the products. When I ran out, I tried to find a new supply of my favorite Body Wash, Lotion and Cream. I found Sebamed here but the packaging was different. I was leery of buying something I wasn&#x27;t sure of. However, I contacted Sebamed company and was assured that the product was the same great product I was used to just packaged differently for the US market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were right. It even smells the same, so I will definitely buy again from Amazon when this runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a fortune trying department store and internet moisturizers and anti-aging products. I am so happy that my search is over finally and I did not expect a very inexpensive product to solve my skin issues. My extremely sensitive, dry and acne prone skin began to worsen when I turned 41. It made me so depressed especially since I also developed eczema particularly on very low humidity days in the valley. This product was a Godsend. I saw improvement after day 1 of use and I&#x27;m not exaggerating. I don&#x27;t typically write reviews on Amazon but I felt I owe something to the company that literally saved my skin and my wallet. I will try other Sebamed products since I&#x27;m truly very impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a problem with moisturizers lately. Either they break me out or they don&#x27;t moisturize enough. This moisturizer has changed everything! My skin is break out free, moisturized perfectly, smooth, soft, and radiant. It absorbs really nicely into the skin without making my skin feel greasy. You don&#x27;t need a lot of product, you can always add more product if you need, but start out applying sparingly. It&#x27;s really creamy but not thick and it&#x27;s easy to work into your skin. This moisturizer isn&#x27;t heavily scented, it&#x27;s rather light and fresh and dissipates quickly. It&#x27;s really soothing and calming...when I apply it I can almost hear my skin say &amp;#34;Ahhhh&amp;#34; in relief, lol.&lt;br /&gt;I use it nightly after cleansing my face with my Caudalie foaming cleanser. I rarely use it twice a day anymore since my skin has been less dry since I&#x27;ve been using this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s formulated to keep your skins ph balanced. Until I started using this I didn&#x27;t really know what that meant or how it affected my skin. Using a bunch of products really throws your ph off, causing more problems than not. I find when I keep my skin care simple, my skin looks and feels better.&lt;br /&gt;Thus moisturizer is also paraben free, which is a plus. I wish they would package it differently...jars are kinda cumbersome when traveling. Although the jar does make it easier to use all the product so you&#x27;re not left with a tube that has product in the bottom that you can&#x27;t get out.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend giving this moisturizer a shot if you&#x27;re experiencing dryness and break out easily.</li>
            <li> Such a great skincare product! I tend to swing from oily to dry skin and back to oily depending on the kinds of acne products/moisturizers I&#x27;m using, but this face cream helps keep my skin healthy and clear.</li>
            <li> Costco sells the SebaMed product in the USA (it&#x27;s a German product) on their ROADSHOW circuit.  That means that you have to wait until one of the local Costco stores has a temporary kiosk set-up for selling this product.  The WORST aspect of buying SebaMed products is the lack of a specific PRICE . . . all products are sold by a &amp;#34;point basis&amp;#34; system matched to preset prices for the group of items you want.  So, for example, at the $35.99 price you can buy up to 5-points but at the $49.99 price you can buy the 7-point grouping.  I never know what I&#x27;m paying for!  Initially, I LOVED the products but I&#x27;m not buying anymore of it due to awkward accessibility plus zany point-value price levels.  Think of the old Tupperware party pricing packages.</li>
            <li> Another amazing product from Sebamed. My wife has extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use many products that are labeled for sensitive skin. This product not only doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin but makes her feel better. She uses this along eith their cleansing foam for an amazing combination. We were wondering if we would ever find a product line that would work for her skin and we have finally found Sebamed products work for her.</li>
            <li> About two years ago I developed a flakey red facial rash and dandruff. I went to a highly regarded skin doctor every six months to deal with the problem and it only got worse. I couldn&#x27;t understand why the doctors treatment had no effect, the doctor seemed unconcerned or uninformed. In desperation I started researching the internet and ran across a form where people were experiencing the same problem. In a short time I began to understand the root cause of the problem was the very medication prescribed. On the forum people were mentioning Sebamed products and their use. I went to Amazon and found the products I was looking for. I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but nothing else was working. In less than two weeks of using Sebamed products my condition completely cleared up and has not returned. I confess I&#x27;m furious that I wasted my time and money, not to mention the embarrassment I suffered at the hands of a medical professional. In my estimation the Sebamed products are top shelf and a small price to pay to a cure.</li>
            <li> My skin had just begun to clear up so I figured I&#x27;d give this highly rated cream a try but it only resulted in breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about one week of use I began to notice I was breaking out again and my blackheads were only getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to someone with oily or sensitive skin. Also the strong smell irritates the skin.</li>
            <li> This is actually a good moisturizer and not just something you settle for because it is safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I brought one before from Costco. I feel the cream I got from Amazon is not as good as Costco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I first bought this a Costco wholesale from a booth they had set up. I was so happy to see it on Amazon so I bought two and the price was so good I was amazed, cheaper than the company. I really love this moisturizer and so does my husband.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too greasy for me,so still allergic</li>
            <li> Mild product, works very well. One of my favorites. My skin has a tendency to get red when irritated, but this creme doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite greasy so I would only ever use it at night. I cannot imagine applying makeup to it afterward for the daytime. To me it feels like an extreme moisturizing for preventing wrinkles, which I&#x27;m sure it does.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to find it again in my local drug store.  I couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered here online.&lt;br /&gt;The order was shipped and delivered so fast.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again for replenishment.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is great b/c I have very sensitive skin and everything often leaves me irritated.&lt;br /&gt;But not this one.  I get the moisture needed with added comfort of no burning sesation.&lt;br /&gt;A little of it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first about buying this product since it has petroleum as one ingredient.  After applying it on my face, it has a light oily feel, but not sticky and it seemed to absorb quickly.  I have very dry skin and it has helped me a lot.  I&#x27;ve used many dept. store creams and spent good money on all of them.  Sebamed works for me and this was good price for my pocket.</li>
            <li> The best product...great for sensitive skin!  Been using for over 5 years and loving it!!</li>
            <li> I love this produce and have used it for several years.  The rating I gave it was due to the unfortunate condition of the jar when I received it.  The box containing the jar of cream was dusty and dirty...which Was a concern. When I took the jar out of the box...strangely more dirt fell out of the box along with the jar. I would have sent it back if not for the inner safety seal on the jar itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sebamed for years and I still love it.  I have sensitive skin and most creams either burn my eyes or make me itch.  This does neither.  It isn&#x27;t a &#x27;wonder cream&#x27;.  It won&#x27;t make years fall off your appearance, but it is soothing without being greasy.  It literally feels GOOD on my skin.</li>
            <li> This item is very hard to find in retail locations.  Compared to other moisturizing creams this is the best.  Face is less oily and leaves face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream for my son, who again has eczema, and I am older, but have a lot of allergies.  I&#x27;ve also never liked a heavy night cream, and this one seems to be just right for me, and my son.  It has been really good for my son because it took away the scaliness.  I like the price point also.</li>
            <li> I use this cream daily - love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sebamed for about a year now.  It is a great, non-greasy moisturizing cream.  I use it morning and evening and my skin texture has improved.  Dark spots are lighter and bumps have disappeared.  I can&#x27;t stand heavy,&lt;br /&gt;oily creams and this one feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! Use it day and night, winter and summer. It adds just the right amount of moisture without being greasy. Good price too :)</li>
            <li> This face cream is great and inexpensive in comparison to other brands.  I have dry skin and this along with the night moisturizing cream are great!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and have never been able to find a product that won&#x27;t irritate or cause acne on my face; that is until now. This product is so light &amp; non greasy that you can&#x27;t even tell its on your face. This is the only moisturizer I will use from now on. I will definitely recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much because of its light consistency! It makes your skin soft, naturally looking. I have sensitive skin and I tried many facial creams that left me with lightly red skin and my skin felt creamy sometimes (even though I never put too much - just slight amount of a cream). The only thing I would add to this one is sun protection at least 15 or 30. Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t sell it at pharmacies anymore, though on amazon is a bit cheaper, but I have to find a partner to buy a least two packs in order to safe on shipping charge. Anyway, whoever suffer from sensitive skin - don&#x27;t think, buy this product, you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  It&#x27;s light and creamy and the scent is clean. This is one of the few skin creams that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> The best ever! I have very sensitive skin and I will no longer be using anything else but this. Feels so good. Not greasy and blends in wonderfully</li>
            <li> I love it. its light, it moisturizes, and its not greasy. I&#x27;ve been using only this cream for a few years now and I just bought more!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great, didn&#x27;t really see a difference but It didn&#x27;t brake me out or give me a rash and that is a good thing on me so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but as a basic moisturizer it&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li> I should preface this review with the statement that I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  This product might work for some people.  When I tried it my face got red and started to feel itchy.  It was not as bad as some products I have tried but I will definitely not be buying this again.  So far First Aid Beauty and Cetaphil seem to be the only products that work for me.</li>
            <li> I love their brand of face wash; only their face wash doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. I also love their eye cream...but this moisture doesn&#x27;t work for me...it irritated my face, so I have to put it aside.</li>
            <li> The product is as expected from quality perspective.&lt;br /&gt;Received in time. No allergic reactions so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--people can buy this product without doubts :)</li>
            <li> I love it.  I&#x27;ve been using many other expensive products but nothing suits my sensitive skin. This product is great for my skin and the cost is just right. I also introduced this product to my friends and they also love it.</li>
            <li> It is the best facial cream I have ever used.  It is so soft and creamy and makes my skin feel and look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> Received it today, only need a small amount, which I mix with my St Ives Collagen Moisturizing Cream, sinks in fast , good on my sixty year old dry areas, feels comfortable also!</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels with this product. If only Sebamed made something to keep me from aging from the inside. At least I look and feel good on the outside. In the meantime, it&#x27;s eat right and drink plenty of water, which is also good for the skin.</li>
            <li> The smell gives me and my husband a headache.  They need to fix the smell!</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> repurchased it so many times. this is the only thing that works for my ultra sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have mature skin and am sensitive to ingredients and occasionally have rosacea.  Due to a bad reaction with a product with SPF ingredient Oxybenzone, my face was having a bad Contact Dermatitis reaction.  I came to Amazon to read reviews and pick a safe product to use while I was so irritated.  I settled on this item and on [[ASIN:B00DSAFH16 Carapex Natural Anti-aging Night Cream with Elastin &amp; Collagen, for Dry to Combination Skin, Fragrance Free, Perfect for Sensitive Skin, 2oz 60ml]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebamed has a very faint floral scent.  It has a very silky texture and is easy to apply and rub in if you wish.  Since I was trying to protect my skin while not making my skin reaction worse, I applied the CARAPEX first with no serum r other products to be sure I was only evaluating one product at a time.  In the middle of the night my eye area was feeling very dry.  I was not able to apply the Carapex there due to it&#x27;s thickness and now I also see the label says not to use on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I saw no such warning on this product, so I applied a very thin layer most delicately to my eye area.  During the rest of the night my eyes swelled up.  I could feel it but did not want to get up again.  To my shock, by morning one was completely swollen shut and the other was very swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I may LOVE this product after my dermatitis reaction is gone - I feel I need to warn others that this item WILL AGGRAVATE AN ALREADY UPSET SENSITIVE SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a month or two I will come back and do a patch test, and then full face if I can.  If this reaction does no repeat _ I will raise my stars.  But I feel I must warn others with very sensitive skin.  I will try to post a picture - I do not like leaving negatives unless they are earned.  I would like to point out that I did NOT get his cream In my eye, only in the eye area.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this product moisturizes perfectly year round (it&#x27;s not too oily for mid-Atlantic summers). It&#x27;s great in the winter as well.</li>
            <li> I dont like the smell and it feels too greasy</li>
            <li> I just received this product a few days ago.  I like the feel of it on my face and it seems to work well.  It does have a slight odd, odor to it.  I am very sensitive to smells and would like  this face Moisturizing Cream a LOT more, if it had NO SMELL AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried their Body Lotion and it is great. The Body Lotion has a wonderful light fragrance to it. Too strong for the face, but great on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to people.</li>
            <li> Love all the Sebamed products especially the moisturizing face cream.&lt;br /&gt;Really agrees with my sensitive skin.  Actually prefer it to my more expensive&lt;br /&gt;moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Initially received this as a gift - liked the description on the packaging so gave it a try.  My skin really does well with this!  Usually new, different, products (especially anti-aging ones) only last about 1 or 2 weeks before my skin decides it isn&#x27;t working (small breakouts, etc).  This stuff is really nice!</li>
            <li> This is lightweight and works wonderfully!  I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.  My skin feel smooth all day!  Definitely will order again.</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by a family member last year.  Tried it and liked it, but decided to switch to an organic brand.  However, have now returned to Sebamed because it is light on my face, absorbs well and my skin looks and feel good.  Also have the added bonus of being quite cost effective when compared to other high quality products.</li>
            <li> I love this cream ! Is light ,a little goes a long way ,plus is paraben free and smells good( I like the smell)I got mine at shoprite  and I&#x27;m really happy that I purchase it. I was using the avenoo daily moisturizer (which I like too) but I like to switch my creams especially when is a more natural product:) I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to give Sebamed a try.  (I bought it though at Costco during a roadshow to get a better price.)  After using this cream for about three weeks my complexion has evened out.  I used to deal with some redness. That&#x27;s gone now.  Also, the minor wrinkles that have been developing - I&#x27;m 37 - have almost disappeared.  Best yet, when I went to the grocer&#x27;s yesterday to pick up a few things with only lipstick on, no powder, foundations, anything, the checkout clerk asked for ID and was amazed at my true age. Miracle stuff!!!    One caution - it&#x27;s pretty creamy and caused minor breakouts on my forehead which can be oily at times.  I now put on with dampish hands to thin out on my more oily patches and use straight around my eyes and smile areas.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this product and ordered the hand cream and body lotion also.  I was so surprised to find that it had an extremely sweet smell that got on everything I wore and touched.  A product advertised as being for sensitive skin should be unscented.  People with sensitive skin are often sensitive to perfumes!</li>
            <li> If you need any skin care product, buy sebamed instantly over anything else on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product line i&#x27;ve found in the entire marketplace that is the actual ph of skin causing it to have vastly superior results to anything else available.</li>
            <li> I first tried sebamed from a trunk show at Costco. Now I can&#x27;t get enough! It goes on smoothly,without leaving a heavy feeling or residue. I switched from using a Clinique face cream to sebamed and I haven&#x27;t gone back!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it is only about $10 with subscription. (Not that I want a higher price but it&#x27;s amazing!) This is the only facial cream I reorder again and again. I don&#x27;t really have major skin troubles so most moisturizers work okay with my skin. This cream is the best so far in terms of cost and value. Definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used, especially for the cost. No more department store brands for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took me a while to get used to the sort of organic scent because it contains no harmful fragrance, but now I don&#x27;t even notice it. Makes my face springy and soft and never greasy or irritated. Works well to layer with sunblock too. I&#x27;ve used it a few times a day for years and it&#x27;s just marvelous. The little tub lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I really do like this face cream!  I have been using it for a few years now and I like it better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product.I tried this product at Costco during a roadshow they had for Seba Med. One try was all I needed! The face and body cleanser is like no other I&#x27;ve tried before.  I have very sensitive skin, rosacea, and most products have an adverse reaction with my skin.  But this product makes my skin soft and so clean! Just try it:)</li>
            <li> Great for your skin!!!</li>
            <li> I normally use Oil of Olay Complete Defense, which was recommended years ago by my dermatologist. I continue using that during the day, but starting using Sebamed moisturizer at night. It is a great product, not oily but very moisturizing. All the Sebamed products I have used have been wonderful. Sebamed soap (green liquid) totally cleared up my adult acne. I was concerned this moisturizer might cause a flareup, but no problems. I really like it for a night cream.</li>
            <li> Food for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and this does not cause problems at all. It is my go-go moisturizer and works beautifully with the Sebamed cleanser.</li>
            <li> I get tired of really smelly cremes, and this cream has a nice neutral smell that I don&#x27;t get tired from. I also like how this cream moisturizes my face, it&#x27;s not to greasy and it&#x27;s not too dry. Good quality product!</li>
            <li> Love this skin cream, just as good as the more expensive creams.  This is my second jar, and so far I think my skin seems to have a glow, and feels much softer.  I am sold on the product.</li>
            <li> I first tried Sebamed when looking for a lotion that didn&#x27;t aggravate my daughter&#x27;s eczema. I used their lotion and it helped clear her eczema up. I have extremely sensitive, adult acne-prone skin so I thought I would give this a shot. For a month or two, it worked amazingly and I thought my skin looked better than it had in a while and I had fewer breakouts. It then suddenly stopped working well for me - as many others have - and I have since stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if that weren&#x27;t the case I would still be using it. It is a nice, light moisturizer with a pleasant, clean smell (in my opinion). It isn&#x27;t a heavy-duty moisturizer so if your skin is really dry this may not work that well. But if you have normal to oily sensitive skin I would give this a try. Overall, I think Sebamed makes some top-notch products.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and when I opened it the smell was very strong.  I did not even try it on my skin since mine reacts to any type of fragrance, had to return it for that reason alone.  But found a great alternative,  from the Earth Science line, Clarifying cleansing lotion, Apricot night cream, Fragrance free moisturizing lotion etc.  These products are a little cheaper and they are on Amazon, but if you look up the website for earth science, they offer FREE SHIPPING for orders over $25.  Well worth trying.  Or find the products at Fred Meyers.</li>
            <li> I bought this together with the body lotion. I didn&#x27;t care for the body lotion and he smell. The face cream is nicer. I&#x27;ll it a couple weeks. But I don&#x27;t think lotions for sensitive skin should have perfume as a main ingredient .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many face creams with my sensitive skin - this one seems to be working well.  It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cream I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm or a leg! I used Aveno before but used this when I was at my sisters house and forgot my own face cream. I immediately went online and b</li>
            <li> Very helpful with my troubled skin. Not greasy but really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love it! Glad I finally found it! Been searching every Drug store!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, run like your hair is on fire. Avoid this product.  I tried this and my face turned bright red.  I put it back on my shelf thinking it was because of something else I had done or eaten.  Surely they would not adverise a product for sensitive skin that would do this to me.  After two more experiments, I trashed the container.  The mice they used for the testing must not have had human sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.  It can be dry at times and oily at times but is usually somewhere in between.  I used to use a lot of tough acne washes but have found changing my diet (less dairy) and products, has drastically helped.  I wash with Cetaphil or St. Ives Green Tea Scrub, use Dickinson&#x27;s toner (thought was unnecessary and drying but now realize how wrong I was), and follow up with this and my skin is so much better.  I&#x27;ve never used a cream before as most products clog my pores (I breakout every time I wear sunscreen) and I was worried about something so &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.  I formally used Clean and Clear moisturizer with sa in.  While I liked that product, pairing with the acne wash actually dried out my skin and caused me to produce more sebum which led to more acne.  I had also used cervae moisturizer which was good (maybe I didn&#x27;t give it a fair chance as the rest of my routine at the time was problematic) but does not compare to this.  All in all I say if you need a good moisturizer, I would highly recommend that you consider this!</li>
            <li> Creamy, but it has a smell I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Love this cream - great for sensitive skin, absorbs quickly, moisturizes thoroughly but doesn&#x27;t promote breakouts, and a decent quantity for the price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not always easy to find locally, but Amazon seems to be out of stock pretty often on this item as well. My monthly Subscribe and Save shipment of this cream got skipped AGAIN for this reason - right in the middle of winter! - and I&#x27;ve ended up using a similar, but much more expensive product while Amazon (hopefully) re-stocks.</li>
            <li> As mentioned. No issues so far.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for dry skin....I love all of their products! Great for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and really can&#x27;t live without it! It&#x27;s silky on the skin and absorbs nicely. Not heavy scented by any means. I&#x27;ve since purchased 4 jars and have given them to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from a skin condition and a friend of mine recommended Sebaned Cream and body wash,  Wow,  I have cleared up and my face seems soft and is smooth.  I wish I would have known about it years ago.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully affordable moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> This my favorite moisturizer. The price and quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> I love it, and use everyday.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer, you really cannot beat it. I am male, and I am prone to breakouts after shaving. This seems to prevent the breakouts and is very soothing, no stinging! The pH is balanced perfectly, I would highly recommend it especially with dry winter approaching for us up north! It is a thicker moisturizer, but I have never found that to clog my pores or be greasy. They used to carry it in a local drug store, but it has since disappeared, thankfully Amazon saves the day again!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I have been struggling with acne lately and this product is great. It keeps my skin feeling very fresh and has helped keep my acne under control.</li>
            <li> One of the best moisturizing creams I&#x27;ve ever used. It is not too oily and does a good job in preventing dry skin. If you have never used this brand, I suggest looking at their other products too. They have a great selection of skin care products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY JAM!  I mix a pea of this with a pea of khiel&#x27;s fluid sunblock and apply daily in the AM after cleansing and toning.  At night, this goes on over my serum.  Absolutely fantastic; Amazon has the best prices on this line, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for my sensitive, fair, acne-prone (chin) skin.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this product and I feel good about using it knowing that it is a pure product, PH balanced.</li>
            <li> This cream is dense but non-greasy.  I used to just use it exclusively on my face, but now it apply it over my whole body because it&#x27;s so good.  It surpasses other similar creams the rub off in little waxy particles.  I swim year round outdoors  - so my skin takes a beating.  I shared it with my mom during a recent visit to Chicago during the harsh winter.  She has very limited choices when it comes to skin care product due to her highly sensitive skin, but she absolutely loved this too.  This is on my Amazon subscription so I can have a continuous supply for my whole family.</li>
            <li> Used to use this in Austria.  So glad I can purchase it on Amazon.  So sad CVS discontinued it.  Great face cream.</li>
            <li> I first sampled this at Costco when they had a roadshow. I have been using it for about a month now (ordered from Amazon) and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have really picky skin. It&#x27;s oily, but it gets parched very easily. It&#x27;s sensitive, prone to breakouts, and very red sometimes. This cream never irritates my skin, and it is very moisturizing. If I feel like I need less moisture, I add a little water to it in my hands to thin it out. It even seems to help with the redness. I&#x27;m on my second jar, and I rarely stick with one product for that long (and I do mean long, because one jar lasted me several months)! It works well under makeup, too.</li>
            <li> love this a lot of products break me out but this keeps skin smooth and smells great and its sensitive to my face</li>
            <li> We love this moisturizer and have chosen it time and again.&lt;br /&gt;We live near 6000 feet and the arid winters are the worst on our skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sebamed is a light and penetrating moisturizer we use year round on the sensitive, combination and dry skin in our household.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have loved the face wash (see my other review) and tried the face cream today. I found it caused a burning sensation on my face, was greasy feeling and made my skin shiny.  It smelled terribly perfume-y, so much so that I ended up coughing.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with Aveno lotion on my face, but it too has a subtle unpleasant odor, although it is described as \\&quot;fragrance free.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I order this brand of Moisturing Cream and body wash for my 6 year old grandson, who has eczema and his mother says these products are the best she has found to help control his eczema.  It is a bit expensive for the amount of product, but if you use it sparely, \\&quot;Mom\\&quot; says it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Best mosterizer I&#x27;ve ever used and ive used them all!!.... If you have trouble skin and acne this is the one for you! It&#x27;s light and not greasy won&#x27;t make you break out!! I&#x27;ve used every lotion on the market just about this is the one for you try it.... You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> great moisuturizing cream - free of dyes ect.</li>
            <li> A lot of people commented on the smell. It&#x27;s true; the smell isn&#x27;t great but the consistency is really nice. It isn&#x27;t moisturizing as much as I had hoped, but my face stopped being overly dry. It is really good for sensitive skin and it calmed down my breakouts. I like that it matches the pH of natural skin, which probably helps with my skin irritation. I&#x27;m already on my 2nd bottle of it; the product is affordable and worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product I would definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good for all the different skin types, we have with my family.</li>
            <li> Every winter having problems with my skin, getting super dry after what peeling and itching all over. Decided to try this cream and have no regrets. Its not greasy, not oily, easily absorbs into skin giving a perfect moisture to it. Worth trying!</li>
            <li> I am still a Dermalogica customer however this product is comparable. This moisturizer is similar to Active Moist by Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin. This product has been the best!</li>
            <li> Sebamed Moisturing Cream, Sensitive Skin is very good</li>
            <li> I love this lotion because it has absolutely no odor.  I can&#x27;t stand perfume-y smells on my face and this stuff is great and easy to go on with no smell whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist and feeling good.  I have tried many products over the years and this is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff for my face- I have used many brands and this is the best. My skin is soft and some of the age spots are fading.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. No scent, feels good, inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t both my sensitive skin. The jar comes filled to the brim.</li>
            <li> Great quality cream at an Amazing price</li>
            <li> Consistently works well on my skin,not oily but leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it every morning after I shower to give my face some much needed moisture!  I have tried many many face creams, but this is the only one that works with my sensitive skin and does not make my face turn red and dry. I highly recommend to those with sensitive skin!  My only wish is that they made a version with some SPF in it to help protect my sensitive skin from the sun!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for the money.  I&#x27;m a fan of Creme de la Mer and Bobbie Brown Beauty Balm. Both of which are awesome and very expensive.  The Sebamed has been awesome in doing a similar job to the two more expensive products!  Does it smell weird? Yeah, like a German woman in 1942, but I&#x27;m okay with that. For the money and the effect, you cant beat it.</li>
            <li> This is what I call my first grown up moisturizer. The fact that it is Hypoallergenic and Non-comedogenic for sensitive skin works perfectly for my acne prone, oily and sensitive skin. I will use this cream only in the winter as my skin is dryer. The smell is something to get used to. The first time I wore this creme, the smell irritated my nose all day. Then after 4 days, I didn&#x27;t notice it as much. I would definitely recommend this product. A++++ all around. My skin is soft and non greasey and this cream does not break me out at all.  Goes well under my BB cream.</li>
