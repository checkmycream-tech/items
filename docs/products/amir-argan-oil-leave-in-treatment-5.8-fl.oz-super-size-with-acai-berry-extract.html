            <li> I only use a small amount because if you use too much, you will feel greasy.</li>

            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! Feels great and smells better! I have dermatitis and I find that this always helps when things get a little out of hand. Eliminates frizz and leaves my hair silky smooth without weighing it down.</li>

            <li> I totally love this product. Thie is my second bottle(bought my first one at winners)and  I now have a hard time with my hair if I don&#x27;t use it after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I think it&#x27;s an OK product for styling and not for treating damaged hair. it has a nice smell, was absorbed quickly and my hair felt very soft after applying it but it is not a treatment it&#x27;s just a temporary fix.... after you wash your hair the effect is gone. Should not be advertised as a treatment.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, great for any type of hair.  Price was reasonable too. Would recommend this product to friends and have already .  Great Christmas present for the girls.</li>

            <li> For humid summers, this is the best product.  Your hair feels like silk and it lasts all day. I only use a small amount because if you use too much, you will feel greasy. Great for the frizzy and unruly hair for us that live in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS. The smell is amazing and it leaves your hair feeling like silk. I have long thick hair and all it takes is one pump to cover all my ends and flyaway crown pieces. Fabulous</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my hair shiny, but my husband, who deals with dandruff and dryness, started using it and it has helped tremendously. His hair looks great, is healthier and smells wonderful. And at this price, it&#x27;s quite a bargain.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It  leaves my hair feeling healthy, silky, and shiny!</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price was reasonable and the amount more generous than the brand sold on my online beauty needs site StyleB***. I found it to be a great product for my dry hair. I also boght the hair moisturizer for colored hair and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 6 Months now. I LOVE IT! I have hair that is colored once every 3 Mos. It&#x27;s down to my waist. I wash my hair with very good Shampoo and wrap it in a towel for a 1/2 hour. I put two pumps in my hands and work it through my pony tail. I then use a wide tooth comb and comb from bottom up.. My hair then air drys. It is like silk. No frizz, just silk and shine. I have people walk up to me and tell me how beautiful my hair is... I tell everyone about this product!!! Try it and see for yourself..</li>
            <li> Love love love, as noted on my other review of the smaller size of this treatment. Nice, self-caring moment when you run it through your hair. Nice aroma, light, completely unnoticed oil, that magically nourishes your hair.</li>
