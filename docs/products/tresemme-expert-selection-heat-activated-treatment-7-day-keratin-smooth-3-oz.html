            <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>It tends to be overpriced in stores, so we buy it here when it is available and attractively priced.</li>
            <li>Like most Tresemme shampoos, this one is a good one too.</li>
            <li>I like it - nice fragrance</li>

            <li>And it is so soft and smells great!</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a strong scent with this product, which is nice too.  </li>
            <li>and my hair continues to look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Helps to make it more manageable during the straightening process.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos leave my hair feeling like straw, and irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been in better shape.</li>
            <li>I love tresemme shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li>Use with the condtioner and my hair is so shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>What I like the most is the way my hair feels as I wash the products out of my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent, lathers nicely, and is &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; sulfate.</li>
            <li>but it works fine, love the smell and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a shampoo that made my hair not be frizzy and was easy to wash out of my hair</li>
            <li>My wife really like the product so in turn I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>They smell delicious and make my hair super soft, but I don&#x27;t think they do much for moisture.</li>
            <li>To start off with, I&#x27;m a huge beauty product junkie.</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with [[ASIN:B00IEY8F9C Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner, 25 Ounce (Pack of 2)]].</li>
            <li>I like how the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>Best everyday shampoo around.</li>
            <li>This shampoo along with the Keratin Conditioner are really fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to help smooth</li>
            <li>I prefer sulfate-free for my color-treated hair, but this is a nice shampoo for the whole family.</li>
            <li>Amazon Prime is quick, fast and easy!</li>
            <li>Good smelling and properly smoothing</li>
            <li>Really makes hair smooth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo/conditioner combo for those of us who have frizzy or slightly curly hair and want to wear it straight with all day staying power.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend the complete line of these Keratin infused priducts because they all work wonderfully as well, especially together.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, fragile hair.</li>
            <li>makes my hair feel CLEAN, not very much is needed to get sudsy, it even feels better than 2 in 1&#x27;s, tho, for my hair, conditioner is still needed</li>
            <li>Thanks, Tresemme!</li>
            <li>Tresemme Shampoo with Keratin is as good as the Keratin brand, and it is less than 1/2 the price!  </li>
            <li>I have tried cheap 1.00 shampoo brands to expensive salon brands and this makes my highlighted hair soft silky and gorgeous love it</li>
            <li>it was easy to manage later..</li>
            <li>Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li>This really does what it says.</li>
            <li>Using the shampoo, intense conditioner and serum.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair</li>
            <li>and this really helps.</li>
            <li>but I do not have to use it as much.</li>
            <li>Really makes my hair shiny and soft and when I straighten it it is really straight</li>
            <li>and it has never stayed frizz free for so long!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>and I have very frizzy hair naturally.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair straight and soft.</li>
            <li>I was surprised about how much I like this product, though I wish the price were cheaper</li>
            <li>Always leaves my hair super soft and definitely helps my hair stay healthy since I straighten it everyday.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have a pool, live in the Houston-area</li>
            <li>Hair is so soft!</li>
            <li>I no longer use an additional styling product, which I have never liked doing that anyway as my hair is very fine.  </li>
            <li>Keratin smooth keeps my hair soft and keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li>I really believe that this product protects my hair from the hair dryer and straightening iron that I use daily.  </li>
            <li>Since this comes in a 2 pack it really does seem to last forever</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old, and the gold hairs on my head are beginning to mingle with the silver ones showing up.</li>
            <li>I would very much recommend giving this a try if you are looking to eliminate frizz and pouffyness and cut down on your flat-ironing time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young senior, and my hair isn&#x27;t what it used to be, but using products with Keratin brings back the shine and luster to my hair.</li>
            <li>I love how this strengthen s my thin hair and</li>
            <li>Noticeable results within the first few washes.</li>

            <li> Ordered the shampoo for my wife, received conditioner instead.</li>
            <li> Best everyday shampoo around.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo!!! Always leaves my hair super soft and definitely helps my hair stay healthy since I straighten it everyday.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair greasy and it seems like you need a ton of shampoo to get it to lather.</li>
            <li> Like both the shampoo and conditioner. They smell delicious and make my hair super soft, but I don&#x27;t think they do much for moisture. Helps to make it more manageable during the straightening process. For reference, I&#x27;m AA with 3c hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have tried cheap 1.00 shampoo brands to expensive salon brands and this makes my highlighted hair soft silky and gorgeous love it</li>

            <li> I like how my hair feels after using this shampoo. It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Tresemme Shampoo with Keratin is as good as the Keratin brand, and it is less than 1/2 the price!  Highly recommend.  I&#x27;m still using the regular brand Kertain conditioner, so I haven&#x27;t experimented with the Tresemme conditioner wtih Keratin.  I&#x27;m a young senior, and my hair isn&#x27;t what it used to be, but using products with Keratin brings back the shine and luster to my hair.</li>
            <li> best asexal shampoo ever!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that made my hair not be frizzy and was easy to wash out of my hair but this one does not help my hair not be frizzy and hard and its still hard to wash it out of my very fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo. Didn&#x27;t do wonders for me but it&#x27;s a good deal and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> At first this was great shampoo for me! But after a while it seems my hair just doesn&#x27;t respond to this as well as it use to.</li>
            <li> To start off with, I&#x27;m a huge beauty product junkie. I&#x27;ve gone through countless brands and types of shampoos and conditioners and I&#x27;ve honestly never found one that I could see myself sticking with. Until now! I have very fine, fragile hair. Most shampoos leave my hair feeling like straw, and irritate my scalp. This entire line of Keratin products has worked wonders for my hair, and I haven&#x27;t even been using them for a month! Noticeable results within the first few washes. The price is affordable, and the quality isn&#x27;t compromised. I definitely recommend the complete line of these Keratin infused priducts because they all work wonderfully as well, especially together. My hair has never been in better shape. Thanks, Tresemme!</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, course long hair and this shampoo was recommended to me by a couple friends who have similar hair textures because I ran out of the Aussie frizz shampoo I&#x27;ve been using for months. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks now but it makes my hair SO soft every time and smells wonderful. Paired with the conditioner it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Really makes my hair shiny and soft and when I straighten it it is really straight and I have very frizzy hair naturally.</li>
            <li> I love tresemme shampoo. My hair is not curly at all so I was worried that this shampoo wouldn&#x27;t work well on it (just got it because it&#x27;s the only tresemme shampoo offered through s&amp;s) but it works fine, love the smell and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my hair. It has helped build strength again for my hair and helped with split ends</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for curly hair</li>
            <li> Great product and great prices at amazon!</li>
            <li> product as described--shipped in 2 days</li>
            <li> Like most Tresemme shampoos, this one is a good one too. It tends to be overpriced in stores, so we buy it here when it is available and attractively priced.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo!!!! I have thick curly hair and I straighten it every day and it has never stayed frizz free for so long!! And it is so soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> This shampoo along with the Keratin Conditioner are really fantastic.  I am 64 years old, and the gold hairs on my head are beginning to mingle with the silver ones showing up. These products keep my locks looking shiny and well finished..</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel CLEAN, not very much is needed to get sudsy, it even feels better than 2 in 1&#x27;s, tho, for my hair, conditioner is still needed</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shampoos. This is my favorite! Smells wonderful. I use it with the conditioner. What I like the most is the way my hair feels as I wash the products out of my hair. My fingers slide through my hair. It&#x27;s silky smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a pool, live in the Houston-area so my hair is exposed to a lot of chlorine and sun. I have purchased salon-products and all other kinds at the grocery store. I always end up going back to this one. I&#x27;m done experimenting. This is my shampoo!!</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo,it did smooth my hair a lot, will buy again by sure</li>
            <li> My girls like smell and how it cleans their hair</li>
            <li> My wife really like the product so in turn I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Shipping is terrible it comes in a plastic bag in a box so hope yours comes sealed mine didn&#x27;t so I had shampoo everywhere</li>
            <li> This really does what it says. Using the shampoo, intense conditioner and serum. It keeps my hair straight and soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my wife happier instead of having to run out and buy this item that she loves using. Amazon Prime is quick, fast and easy!</li>
            <li> I like it - nice fragrance</li>
            <li> Really makes hair smooth!</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers nicely and smells great.  It does seem to help smooth but I do wonder if my hair develops some buildup over time.  Nevertheless, I keep using it and like how it feels/smells.  It is a silky mixture.  Not pasty or too thick/too milky.</li>
            <li> Great price great product! Been using over a year and love it!</li>
            <li> Keratin smooth keeps my hair soft and keeps the frizz down. I have very frizzy hair and this really helps. I still use a straightner to tame the frizz completely but I do not have to use it as much.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does seem to have some calming effect on the hair. It has a mild scent, lathers nicely, and is &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; sulfate. I prefer sulfate-free for my color-treated hair, but this is a nice shampoo for the whole family.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo/conditioner combo for those of us who have frizzy or slightly curly hair and want to wear it straight with all day staying power.  I can very easily tell the difference using these 2 products.  If I have plans after 5, I don&#x27;t have to re-iron hair, it still looks great - Even in the Alabama humidity!!!!  I no longer use an additional styling product, which I have never liked doing that anyway as my hair is very fine.  I would very much recommend giving this a try if you are looking to eliminate frizz and pouffyness and cut down on your flat-ironing time.</li>
            <li> Hair becomes silky and pleasant to touch. Even if I went to sleep with wet hair- it was easy to manage later.. I really loved this shampoo. Not telling about the fragrance- it&#x27;s heavenly one.</li>
            <li> I was surprised about how much I like this product, though I wish the price were cheaper but it&#x27;s cheaper than at the store.  I don&#x27;t require using a conditioner afterwards like I do with cheaper shampoo (less than $1).</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  Hair is so soft!</li>
