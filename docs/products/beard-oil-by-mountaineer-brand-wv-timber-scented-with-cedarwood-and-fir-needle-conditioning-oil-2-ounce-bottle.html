    <ol>
            <li>And it smells wonderful to boot!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do a great deal for moisturizing the beard.  </li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>Smell is great and does wonders for my beard.</li>
            <li>If you want to smell good, I guess buy cologne.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I bought a beard oil on Amazon and loved how my beard looked.</li>
            <li>Smells great and it will give your beard a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Great oil, the Coal scented oil is my favorite by Mountaineer brand.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with it -</li>
            <li>I can honestly say all it did was make my face smell like I was my face with pine sap.</li>
            <li>enjoyed the scent and found it to be a good manly timber/ woody scent.</li>
            <li>The oil has a nice feel to it and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>Very good oil, but it is my first beard oil</li>
            <li>If you want a better product for taking care of your beard, I would suggest Honest Amish beard balm.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>The cap on the top can leak if the bottle is set on its side.</li>
            <li>Because I keep my hair up in buns most or the time, I am prone to tension headaches.</li>
            <li>I got this hoping it would be better and smell better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thought it would smell more woodsy like pine  but  not at all</li>
            <li>I love GBS products,  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap product to reduce or eliminate &amp;#34;beard-druff,&amp;#34; this will do; if you&#x27;re looking for an amazing smell on top of that, search elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Just cheap quality and very VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li>Initially, I would have thought of that as a good thing, because I wasn&#x27;t looking for a scented oil, but the smell is so pleasant</li>
            <li>I loved the old oil and looked forward to using it each day - loving the look of it.</li>
            <li>This oil smells good and you get a lot of it for the money, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my beard very soft.</li>
            <li>Caused breakouts... didn&#x27;t really smooth my skin any.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that this is scented NATURALLY.  </li>
            <li>It also helped tremendously on the beard itch.</li>
            <li>Such good quantity and price, really proves the compassion exists between bearded fellows.</li>
            <li>Almond oil is light and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Castor oil most closely mimics the natural sebum found in skin/on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells like a fresh dug hole (dirt).....</li>
            <li>Not as a good as expected...</li>
            <li>The smell is nice-strong at first but dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week daily and my beard has blossomed into a happy and lusturous facial forest.</li>
            <li>This is the first beard oil that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It seems to work pretty well, but I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it caused itching when applied that, over the course of several days, progressed into an actual rash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Grapeseed oil is very high in ceramides, which are beneficial to hair and skin.</li>
            <li>Which is a huge plus for me in terms of cost and value at the end these products are very similar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days, but it&#x27;s already made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I also found that it did soften my beard but when asking the lady friend she did not find much of a difference, accept for shine and scent.</li>
            <li>and I have waist-length very curly hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is VERY off putting</li>
            <li>This stuff really soften and subricates my beard for combing.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Really kick-azz beard oil.</li>
            <li>one smells nice, not overpowering and the scent fades within a few hours.</li>
            <li>The bottle was really crappy leaks bad if u take it in your luggage, also you could just get a recipe and buy all of these ingredients at the store so really its not worth the money its cheaper to just make ur own, i think the Honest Amish brand works way better!</li>
            <li>smell is a pleasantly strong pine/cedar combination, but it doesn&#x27;t linger for too long.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this based on the experience with my last beard oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also ordered the beard balm from the same company, and the combination of the two has improved my beard&#x27;s manageability tremendously already.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having those tree car fresheners hanging under your nose with the intense smell they produce right when you open the package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottomline: I highly recommend this for first-time beard oil buyers like myself.</li>
            <li>While the bottle itself could be a little better for travel but works</li>
            <li>And when looking at the ingredients they all pretty much follow similar recipes.</li>
            <li>My last beard oil was primarily Jojoba oil, which maintained the shine all day long.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m surprised at the amount received for the price, I am not fond of the smell.</li>
            <li>The packaging is deep blue to help keep the ingredients fresher longer, and there&#x27;s a slow-pour mechanism in the opening of the bottle to help you dispense the right</li>
            <li>It seems like it will last a very long time for the reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m afraid I had to return mine, the scent was too much like a car freshener and was STRONG even when diluting.</li>

            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not happy have to keep as this is all the oil I have right now.</li>
            <li> But when comparing to other brand you find that the Mountaineer Brand give you about double the amount.</li>
            <li> And I only use 3-5 drops for my entire hairline- a little bit goes</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t get past this point because the beard starts getting a bit too wild to tame at this length, so I end up shaving it off, regretting it, and starting the growth process again.</li>
            <li> While it did give my beard a little shine it wasn’t anything crazy and I wasn’t looking for big shine for my beard; so in those regards I was pleased .</li>
            <li> The only slight downside is that the scent of the oil wears off in minutes.</li>
            <li> I saw a few reviews where they said the scent didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> No real scent except an &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a small blue plastic 2oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> The scent disappears in less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after a shower in the morning, and by the time I get to work the smell is so faint that only I can notice it occasionally while at work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m half way thru the bottle</li>
            <li> However, the oil seems to disappear in a few hours.</li>
            <li> This one lasts just a few hours.</li>
            <li> Turned beard stiff and didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> I have yet to have someone smell it and say &amp;#34;oh that smells nice.&amp;#34; The usual reaction is &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about beard oil in general, thinking of it as  being some silly hipster nonsense, but I figured I&#x27;d order some anyway to see if it could help my beard from getting out of control.</li>
            <li> It left my beard feeling oily in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I guess they got a bad batch because it usually lasts all day for me.</li>
            <li> waste if 18.00 bucks!  :(</li>
            <li> The smell is unpleasant, although it does smell something like pine.</li>
            <li> I hate saying it cause</li>
            <li> This beard oil smells horrible</li>
            <li> Smell is TERRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this stuff to soften and keep my beard from itching. I can honestly say all it did was make my face smell like I was my face with pine sap. Only way I would suggest you buy this product, is if you want your face to smell like a 2 x 4.....</li>
            <li> This beard oil smells horrible I would never recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I had to return mine, the scent was too much like a car freshener and was STRONG even when diluting.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the unscented version and I bought the timber accidentally  and he hates it... waste if 18.00 bucks!  :(</li>
            <li> Let’s start out with the size and packaging. It comes in a small blue plastic 2oz bottle.  While the bottle itself could be a little better for travel but works okay. The cap on the top can leak if the bottle is set on its side. But when comparing to other brand you find that the Mountaineer Brand give you about double the amount. Which is a huge plus for me in terms of cost and value at the end these products are very similar. And when looking at the ingredients they all pretty much follow similar recipes. And the oil ingredients used in these products have been known for years to improve softening beards and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do is work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the scent and found it to be a good manly timber/ woody scent. I also found that it did soften my beard but when asking the lady friend she did not find much of a difference, accept for shine and scent. It also helped tremendously on the beard itch. While it did give my beard a little shine it wasn’t anything crazy and I wasn’t looking for big shine for my beard; so in those regards I was pleased .</li>
            <li> Just cheap quality and very VERY strong smell. Don&#x27;t want to smell like a Christmas tree all day.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased that this is scented NATURALLY.  The packaging is deep blue to help keep the ingredients fresher longer, and there&#x27;s a slow-pour mechanism in the opening of the bottle to help you dispense the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman and I have waist-length very curly hair. Because I keep my hair up in buns most or the time, I am prone to tension headaches. I have been applying this to the front perimeter of my hairline and using a rubber soap saver to give myself a scalp massage.  Unlike peppermint oil, essential oils of cedar and fir needle won&#x27;t cause any tingling or skin irritation. And I only use 3-5 drops for my entire hairline- a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grapeseed oil is very high in ceramides, which are beneficial to hair and skin. Almond oil is light and very moisturizing. Castor oil most closely mimics the natural sebum found in skin/on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: grapeseed oil, almond oil, castor oil, essential oils of cedar and fir needle.</li>
            <li> I got this hoping it would be better and smell better. The smell is VERY off putting I have yet to have someone smell it and say &amp;#34;oh that smells nice.&amp;#34; The usual reaction is &amp;#34;oh god please don&#x27;t tell me you wear that!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> No real scent except an &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; smell.  Did not like.</li>
            <li> stinks like linseed oil or something ,,  not that thrilled with product  but its all good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought it would smell more woodsy like pine  but  not at all</li>
            <li> This stuff really soften and subricates my beard for combing. And it smells wonderful to boot!</li>
            <li> Caused breakouts... didn&#x27;t really smooth my skin any.</li>
            <li> The smell is unpleasant, although it does smell something like pine. It left my beard feeling oily in a bad way. Most importantly, it caused itching when applied that, over the course of several days, progressed into an actual rash. Several days after I stopped use, the rash is subsiding, including gross skin peeling / flaking that requires extra grooming to ensure skin flakes are not visibly stuck on my beard.</li>
            <li> Received my oil today and was the unscented and ordered the timber.  Not happy have to keep as this is all the oil I have right now.</li>
            <li> It made my beard itch.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a great deal for moisturizing the beard.  The scent disappears in less than 5 minutes.  If you want a better product for taking care of your beard, I would suggest Honest Amish beard balm.  If you want to smell good, I guess buy cologne.</li>
            <li> Great oil, the Coal scented oil is my favorite by Mountaineer brand. Plus you get double yer bang for actually cheaper than...I hate saying it cause I love GBS products,  but you get 2oz. Bottle of oil for like $13.00 from Mountaineer, &amp; only get a 1oz. Bottle of oil from grave before you shave  fer bout what thru amazon like $15.00?</li>
            <li> This oil smells good and you get a lot of it for the money, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my beard very soft.</li>
            <li> Smell is TERRIBLE. Gave me a headache. It&#x27;s like having those tree car fresheners hanging under your nose with the intense smell they produce right when you open the package. No bueno.</li>
            <li> I put oil in beard, did not turn into a mountaineer. DISAPPOINT.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m surprised at the amount received for the price, I am not fond of the smell. It is slightly reminiscent of mint and a pine tree car freshener. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap product to reduce or eliminate &amp;#34;beard-druff,&amp;#34; this will do; if you&#x27;re looking for an amazing smell on top of that, search elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my current beard for about 4 &amp;1/2 months. I generally don&#x27;t get past this point because the beard starts getting a bit too wild to tame at this length, so I end up shaving it off, regretting it, and starting the growth process again. I was a bit skeptical about beard oil in general, thinking of it as  being some silly hipster nonsense, but I figured I&#x27;d order some anyway to see if it could help my beard from getting out of control. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days, but it&#x27;s already made a huge difference. I also ordered the beard balm from the same company, and the combination of the two has improved my beard&#x27;s manageability tremendously already. The only slight downside is that the scent of the oil wears off in minutes. Initially, I would have thought of that as a good thing, because I wasn&#x27;t looking for a scented oil, but the smell is so pleasant, I wish it stayed around for a while I will definitely be ordering again soon. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Works well, makes my beard curlier and easier to shape. Smells great. Easier than wax. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells like a fresh dug hole (dirt).....</li>
            <li> This is the first beard oil that I&#x27;ve tried. It seems to work pretty well, but I have nothing to compare it to. The smell is nice-strong at first but dissipates pretty quickly. I&#x27;ll likely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Turned beard stiff and didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> Very good oil, but it is my first beard oil so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. It seems like it will last a very long time for the reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a pleasantly strong pine/cedar combination, but it doesn&#x27;t linger for too long. I put it on after a shower in the morning, and by the time I get to work the smell is so faint that only I can notice it occasionally while at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By beard definitely feels smoother and shinier and the oil helps to tame wild hairs somewhat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline: I highly recommend this for first-time beard oil buyers like myself.</li>
            <li> Not as a good as expected... I bought a beard oil on Amazon and loved how my beard looked. I was very pleased with it - but it was odorless. I noticed Mountaineer Brand has this once that is scented and well reviewed. So I wanted to try this instead of ordering the same one again. I was excited to try this based on the experience with my last beard oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one smells nice, not overpowering and the scent fades within a few hours. The oil has a nice feel to it and goes on nicely. However, the oil seems to disappear in a few hours. It&#x27;s like my beard drinks this in and it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m half way thru the bottle and I&#x27;ve lost my interest in this, because of how it fades away. My last beard oil was primarily Jojoba oil, which maintained the shine all day long. I loved the old oil and looked forward to using it each day - loving the look of it. This one lasts just a few hours.</li>
            <li> The bottle was really crappy leaks bad if u take it in your luggage, also you could just get a recipe and buy all of these ingredients at the store so really its not worth the money its cheaper to just make ur own, i think the Honest Amish brand works way better!</li>
            <li> My beard has never been softer or healthier looking and - bonus - smells like wood shop.  I saw a few reviews where they said the scent didn&#x27;t last long. I guess they got a bad batch because it usually lasts all day for me. I recommend this to anyone with a beard or anyone who just likes the smell of wood.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it will give your beard a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Really kick-azz beard oil. Such good quantity and price, really proves the compassion exists between bearded fellows. Smell is great and does wonders for my beard. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week daily and my beard has blossomed into a happy and lusturous facial forest. 5 stars and two thumbs up for Mountaineer Brand!</li>
