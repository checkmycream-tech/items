            <li>Great product and reasonable price!  </li>

            <li>Heats up lightning fast, easy to clean off hair products from ceramic surface, perfect weight (not too hefty, nice handle).</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and maintains a good temperature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to style my hair every day, but this straightener is so easy to use and effective</li>
            <li>I know, my fault for touching it).</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this straightner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for a bit more than 2 years</li>
            <li>I usually love bed head products.</li>
            <li>and I have used many</li>
            <li>Looks just Ike picturs works awsome love everything from bed head</li>
            <li>Even at this price point I&#x27;ve had much better straighteners.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks. :)</li>
            <li>so hopefully this one does too :)</li>
            <li>and I would use the straightener to straighten, but mostly to flip my hair out.</li>
            <li>Found this one from Amazon with better price so give it  a try.</li>
            <li>Love bed head products.</li>
            <li>I love that I can choose the temperature so that I don&#x27;t feel as though I am going to fry my hair.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that purchased this item.</li>
            <li>am not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>Great product - it does what it needs to do and gets hot really fast! :)</li>
            <li>wow a great product would buy again.</li>
            <li>I read some good reviews about it and also it was reasonably priced</li>
            <li>The appearance is really cool!</li>
            <li>but I just felt like my hair didn&#x27;t glide thought it as easily</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong</li>
            <li>I was about to give up on finding a good one and settle on another overpriced high end straightener</li>
            <li>She liked it very much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just really happy that I finally found a good straightener that is capable of doing its job.</li>
            <li>Keeps her hair nice and straight!</li>
            <li>it is fine.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect for giving hair a slight curl under or flip out.</li>
            <li>I love how it heats up so quickly.</li>
            <li>The color is super cute.</li>
            <li>The iron heats up very quickly and straightens without much effort and most importantly, does not pull on my hair!</li>
            <li>Love this first time bed head buyer!</li>
            <li>Overall, it was great.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I don&#x27;t know why others liked it so much.  </li>
            <li>Iv always bought the cheapy straighteners from walmart for $10 or so because im cheap</li>
            <li>Such a joy to use.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this straightener because of the reviews and how inexpensive it is and I have to say I think it&#x27;s worth every penny and more.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple times but it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Ehhh I&#x27;ve always loved Bed Head products, unfortunately my old one gave up after like 6 years &amp; now its off markets</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for two months, but I love it!!</li>
            <li>I really do love the look and feel of it, but it does not get as hot as I would like it.</li>
            <li>It does a great job straightening my 2&#x27; + long hair in no time!</li>
            <li>Love love love this flat iron</li>
            <li>so i thought i would buy a new straightener and do my own hair to save money.</li>
            <li>I used to have a 1.25&amp;#34; FHI straightener that gave me such smooth straight hair, and would glide beautifully over hair.  </li>
            <li>made someone happy over the holidays and that is all that can be expected.  </li>
            <li>Made me feel better after straight my hair each time which just took about 5 mins.</li>
            <li>and it does the job quite quickly without me having to burn my hair in the process.</li>
            <li>I really liked this straightener, it works very well and straightening my hair was so much quicker.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so smooth and heats up super fast!</li>
            <li>It looks cool when it lights up, but it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s good for the price but not at all for long term use</li>
            <li>As far as doing its job it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li>I had a bedhead straightener previously &amp; it was great.  </li>
            <li>Great hair straightner, makea me hair sleek and cut my straightening time in half.</li>
            <li>I love this hair straightener so far!</li>
            <li>This flat iron gets VERY hot, which I love, and does the job!</li>
            <li>My hair is not the thickest (being a blonde), and this straightner is amazing for all hair types.  </li>
            <li>I only had to run the hair through the iron once or twice at most and it runs through smoothly.</li>
            <li>I first bought one back in 2005 at Target for $80 and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing and and did the job in a zip.</li>
            <li>but other wise I&#x27;ve never had a problem.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, works very well.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it on my hair...</li>
            <li>So glad I found the same straightner.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 6 years</li>
            <li>Very durable also!</li>
            <li>This one drys my hair out and does not straighten well on the first stroke.</li>
            <li>I love how it lights up different colors according to the heat setting you have it set on.</li>
            <li>Anything that works well and helps me get ready faster, is a winner!</li>
            <li>I received my first Bed Hair flatiron as a gift.</li>
            <li>who knows how much it will be in vegas!</li>
            <li>Beyond couple of years ago with higher price.</li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time,  and i am inlove.  </li>
            <li>read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>i had my last straightener for 4 years and it was my favorite lets</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been trying to look for a good but reasonably priced straightener for a while with no success.</li>
            <li>For a beginner like me who was intimidated by flat irons, it was very easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found this one when my old one stopped working.</li>
            <li>I just want to start of by saying I read so many reviews on flat irons.</li>
            <li>i love it would recommend this to everyone meets all of my wants and needs cant say enough about how i like it</li>
            <li>It smells a little when heated, but other than that it is perfect</li>
            <li>I love the color and how long the cord is.</li>
            <li>As hot as I used it, and as much hairspray as I used, it never ever damaged my hair, and that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it less than a year (still works perfectly), but my previous bed head lasted 3 years</li>
            <li>I wound up with a Hot Tools, and I really don&#x27;t care for it too much.</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair super quick and the little pieces on the ends to clamp the plates together definitely come in handy.</li>
            <li>At first, just the lights stopped working, but the flat iron still worked just fine, which I realized after I burned my hand</li>
            <li>I felt like it left my hair super frizzy!</li>
            <li>It worked really well and did its job to a tee.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this straightner!</li>
            <li>fool proof cuz my husband (who knows absolutely nothing about hair) can do it and help me with my hair</li>
            <li>not Work very well.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really heat up that much either...</li>
            <li>(my hair is very think FYI)</li>
            <li>and he prefers my hair straight when we are getting all fancy and dressed up</li>
            <li>This causes so much damage to your hair, even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>After much searching I dedicided to try this straightener out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, with this straightener the heating process is much quicker</li>
            <li>I never thought that someone with naturally straight hair would ever need to buy a straightener</li>
            <li>Read the reviews and was really expecting a lot out of this.</li>
            <li>I like my hair really really straight when I take the time to do it.</li>
            <li>Very nice flat iron, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter loves this flat iron, it is very sturdy yet easy for her to use</li>
            <li>It took me longer to straigten my hair with this one, I should have not bought it and spent a few more dollars on something better.</li>
            <li>: Honestly, I loved this flat iron, but it&#x27;s not worth your money.</li>
            <li>I also love how it clamps down on your hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of hard to really straighten the roots of your hair.</li>
            <li>It did its job, but I probably got lucky that it didn&#x27;t kill me or my mother, who occasionally used it as well.</li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift for my mom and it quickly straightens her short hair.</li>
            <li>Skip these cheap irons and buy something professional that will last.</li>
            <li>I get very hot and could cause a burn so would not buy for a younger person</li>
            <li>Leaves hair straight and soft.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out, but in the spring (when it&#x27;ll be long enough to do Locks of Love)</li>
            <li>that would leave my hair super frizzy or wouldn&#x27;t last a whole day, but this one left my hair smooth and lasted long.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and if you have really stubbornly curly hair like I do, it only takes a couple of passes to straighten hair.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it&#x27;s not too hot</li>
            <li>i can straighten my hair in half the time with way fewer passes than the cheap straighteners</li>
            <li>Instead of taking an hour to straightener my hair with my old 1 inch straightener, it takes me 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I will say that since I started using it my naturally curly hair has eventually turned into naturally wavy-ish, straight-ish hair.</li>
            <li>(its naturally wavy</li>
            <li>My 1inch is some professional brand and doesn&#x27;t  even compare to this.  </li>
            <li>It does its job but its not really Amazing its ok</li>
            <li>I have SUPER thick hair and on the hottest setting, it takes me about 5 mins to straighten my whole head of hair!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>: Works exactly the same as described above.</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair and it needs super high heat.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick, does the job in half the time!</li>
            <li>Like I said, my hair is very thick and wavy - this straightener has many heat settings and my hair doesn&#x27;t get snagged.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and they all sounded great and the price wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely maner; haven&#x27;t used the product yet but looks the same as the old one I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>My last one has lasted about 4 years so far</li>
            <li>and i love to 2 inch plates since i have long thick hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter says that this gets really hot and cuts her flat-ironing time in half.  </li>
            <li>and she has cut her hair straightening time from 3 hours to 1 and a half when she does it herself and the hair stays straight for days!</li>
            <li>It began to spark and make odd noises, so I finally chucked it, probably right about before the 3 &amp; 1/2 year mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, FLAT and shiny.</li>
            <li>Although I do have very straight hair there are those few strands that want to do what they want to do and not what I want them to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this iron so much on my long, thick hair that I rebought the same iron when I left mine out of town.  </li>
            <li>My fiance and I are going to vegas to get married in a few weeks</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get that hot but the plates are not smooth</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I ABSOLUTELY love love LOVE this straightner!  </li>
            <li> Great product and reasonable price!  </li>
            <li> My wife loves it because lives her hair very smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> Heats up lightning fast, easy to clean off hair products from ceramic surface, perfect weight (not too hefty, nice handle).</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and maintains a good temperature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to style my hair every day, but this straightener is so easy to use and effective</li>
            <li> I know, my fault for touching it).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a bit more than 2 years</li>
            <li> I usually love bed head products.</li>
            <li> and I have used many</li>
            <li> Looks just Ike picturs works awsome love everything from bed head</li>
            <li> Even at this price point I&#x27;ve had much better straighteners.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks. :)</li>
            <li> so hopefully this one does too :)</li>
            <li> and I would use the straightener to straighten, but mostly to flip my hair out.</li>
            <li> Found this one from Amazon with better price so give it  a try.</li>
            <li> Love bed head products.</li>
            <li> I love that I can choose the temperature so that I don&#x27;t feel as though I am going to fry my hair.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that purchased this item.</li>
            <li> am not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Great product - it does what it needs to do and gets hot really fast! :)</li>
            <li> wow a great product would buy again.</li>
            <li> I read some good reviews about it and also it was reasonably priced</li>
            <li> The appearance is really cool!</li>
            <li> but I just felt like my hair didn&#x27;t glide thought it as easily</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong</li>
            <li> I was about to give up on finding a good one and settle on another overpriced high end straightener</li>
            <li> She liked it very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just really happy that I finally found a good straightener that is capable of doing its job.</li>
            <li> Keeps her hair nice and straight!</li>
            <li> it is fine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for giving hair a slight curl under or flip out.</li>
            <li> I love how it heats up so quickly.</li>
            <li> The color is super cute.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up very quickly and straightens without much effort and most importantly, does not pull on my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this first time bed head buyer!</li>
            <li> Overall, it was great.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I don&#x27;t know why others liked it so much.  </li>
            <li> Iv always bought the cheapy straighteners from walmart for $10 or so because im cheap</li>
            <li> Such a joy to use.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this straightener because of the reviews and how inexpensive it is and I have to say I think it&#x27;s worth every penny and more.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple times but it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Ehhh I&#x27;ve always loved Bed Head products, unfortunately my old one gave up after like 6 years &amp; now its off markets</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for two months, but I love it!!</li>
            <li> I really do love the look and feel of it, but it does not get as hot as I would like it.</li>
            <li> It does a great job straightening my 2&#x27; + long hair in no time!</li>
            <li> Love love love this flat iron</li>
            <li> so i thought i would buy a new straightener and do my own hair to save money.</li>
            <li> I used to have a 1.25&amp;#34; FHI straightener that gave me such smooth straight hair, and would glide beautifully over hair.  </li>
            <li> made someone happy over the holidays and that is all that can be expected.  </li>
            <li> Made me feel better after straight my hair each time which just took about 5 mins.</li>
            <li> and it does the job quite quickly without me having to burn my hair in the process.</li>
            <li> I really liked this straightener, it works very well and straightening my hair was so much quicker.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so smooth and heats up super fast!</li>
            <li> It looks cool when it lights up, but it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s good for the price but not at all for long term use</li>
            <li> As far as doing its job it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li> I had a bedhead straightener previously &amp; it was great.  </li>
            <li> Great hair straightner, makea me hair sleek and cut my straightening time in half.</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener so far!</li>
            <li> This flat iron gets VERY hot, which I love, and does the job!</li>
            <li> My hair is not the thickest (being a blonde), and this straightner is amazing for all hair types.  </li>
            <li> I only had to run the hair through the iron once or twice at most and it runs through smoothly.</li>
            <li> I first bought one back in 2005 at Target for $80 and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing and and did the job in a zip.</li>
            <li> but other wise I&#x27;ve never had a problem.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, works very well.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it on my hair...</li>
            <li> So glad I found the same straightner.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 6 years</li>
            <li> Very durable also!</li>
            <li> This one drys my hair out and does not straighten well on the first stroke.</li>
            <li> I love how it lights up different colors according to the heat setting you have it set on.</li>
            <li> Anything that works well and helps me get ready faster, is a winner!</li>
            <li> I received my first Bed Hair flatiron as a gift.</li>
            <li> who knows how much it will be in vegas!</li>
            <li> Beyond couple of years ago with higher price.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time,  and i am inlove.  </li>
            <li> read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> i had my last straightener for 4 years and it was my favorite lets</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been trying to look for a good but reasonably priced straightener for a while with no success.</li>
            <li> For a beginner like me who was intimidated by flat irons, it was very easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this one when my old one stopped working.</li>
            <li> I just want to start of by saying I read so many reviews on flat irons.</li>
            <li> i love it would recommend this to everyone meets all of my wants and needs cant say enough about how i like it</li>
            <li> It smells a little when heated, but other than that it is perfect</li>
            <li> I love the color and how long the cord is.</li>
            <li> As hot as I used it, and as much hairspray as I used, it never ever damaged my hair, and that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it less than a year (still works perfectly), but my previous bed head lasted 3 years</li>
            <li> I wound up with a Hot Tools, and I really don&#x27;t care for it too much.</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair super quick and the little pieces on the ends to clamp the plates together definitely come in handy.</li>
            <li> At first, just the lights stopped working, but the flat iron still worked just fine, which I realized after I burned my hand</li>
            <li> I felt like it left my hair super frizzy!</li>
            <li> It worked really well and did its job to a tee.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this straightner!</li>
            <li> fool proof cuz my husband (who knows absolutely nothing about hair) can do it and help me with my hair</li>
            <li> not Work very well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really heat up that much either...</li>
            <li> (my hair is very think FYI)</li>
            <li> and he prefers my hair straight when we are getting all fancy and dressed up</li>
            <li> This causes so much damage to your hair, even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> After much searching I dedicided to try this straightener out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, with this straightener the heating process is much quicker</li>
            <li> I never thought that someone with naturally straight hair would ever need to buy a straightener</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and was really expecting a lot out of this.</li>
            <li> I like my hair really really straight when I take the time to do it.</li>
            <li> Very nice flat iron, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter loves this flat iron, it is very sturdy yet easy for her to use</li>
            <li> It took me longer to straigten my hair with this one, I should have not bought it and spent a few more dollars on something better.</li>
            <li> : Honestly, I loved this flat iron, but it&#x27;s not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I also love how it clamps down on your hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of hard to really straighten the roots of your hair.</li>
            <li> It did its job, but I probably got lucky that it didn&#x27;t kill me or my mother, who occasionally used it as well.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my mom and it quickly straightens her short hair.</li>
            <li> Skip these cheap irons and buy something professional that will last.</li>
            <li> I get very hot and could cause a burn so would not buy for a younger person</li>
            <li> Leaves hair straight and soft.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out, but in the spring (when it&#x27;ll be long enough to do Locks of Love)</li>
            <li> that would leave my hair super frizzy or wouldn&#x27;t last a whole day, but this one left my hair smooth and lasted long.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and if you have really stubbornly curly hair like I do, it only takes a couple of passes to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it&#x27;s not too hot</li>
            <li> i can straighten my hair in half the time with way fewer passes than the cheap straighteners</li>
            <li> Instead of taking an hour to straightener my hair with my old 1 inch straightener, it takes me 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I will say that since I started using it my naturally curly hair has eventually turned into naturally wavy-ish, straight-ish hair.</li>
            <li> (its naturally wavy</li>
            <li> My 1inch is some professional brand and doesn&#x27;t  even compare to this.  </li>
            <li> It does its job but its not really Amazing its ok</li>
            <li> I have SUPER thick hair and on the hottest setting, it takes me about 5 mins to straighten my whole head of hair!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> : Works exactly the same as described above.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and it needs super high heat.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick, does the job in half the time!</li>
            <li> Like I said, my hair is very thick and wavy - this straightener has many heat settings and my hair doesn&#x27;t get snagged.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they all sounded great and the price wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely maner; haven&#x27;t used the product yet but looks the same as the old one I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> My last one has lasted about 4 years so far</li>
            <li> and i love to 2 inch plates since i have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter says that this gets really hot and cuts her flat-ironing time in half.  </li>
            <li> and she has cut her hair straightening time from 3 hours to 1 and a half when she does it herself and the hair stays straight for days!</li>
            <li> It began to spark and make odd noises, so I finally chucked it, probably right about before the 3 &amp; 1/2 year mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, FLAT and shiny.</li>
            <li> Although I do have very straight hair there are those few strands that want to do what they want to do and not what I want them to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this iron so much on my long, thick hair that I rebought the same iron when I left mine out of town.  </li>
            <li> My fiance and I are going to vegas to get married in a few weeks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get that hot but the plates are not smooth</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair that is about 3 inches past my shoulders and full of layers.  </li>
            <li> that uses a flat iron almost daily.</li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron I can use!</li>
            <li> This is my second straightener, and I will continue to buy the same one as long as they are made!</li>
            <li> With my previous straightener I was spending about 30 minutes to complete my entire head.  </li>
            <li> this may not be the flat iron for you.</li>
            <li> It does not make hair flat and shining.</li>
            <li> These straightners have last me on average 3 to 4 years, have never once damaged my hair (super thick hair</li>
            <li> and I expect this one to last just as long!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and works very well even on thick hair because my hair is thick!</li>
            <li> Just recently I&#x27;ve had a problem keeping the straighner on because I think the wire is loose or something.</li>
            <li> It became really dangerous and there&#x27;s much, much better flat irons out there.</li>
            <li> The plated are wide, but I simply loveeee this flat iron.</li>
            <li> but honestly it&#x27;s not even bothering me that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for a long time</li>
            <li> Her&#x27;s was a few years old though.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and poofy/frizzy.</li>
            <li> For i cant even tell you how long.  </li>
            <li> Also, I like the fact that the iron is 2 inches wide because I can straighten my extremely long hair in relatively short time with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My friend had a 2 inch bed head straightener and when she moved out I was more sad about the straightener going than I was about her going!  </li>
            <li> just hope this one lasts that long!</li>
            <li> I have used Chi and other expensive high end irons and this out preforms all of them by far!</li>
            <li> I especially like the little short pink nubs on the end, which allow me to guide the straightener and keep hair tightly against the ceramic plates.</li>
            <li> that I don&#x27;t mind taking a little extra time.</li>
            <li> it took a little longer than the above product, but was delivered basically on time and again, Amazon&lt;br /&gt;comes through!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommended this tho for shorter hair its much to wide...</li>
            <li> Ive been using a 1inch straightener forever for no real reason and wanted to buy myself a treat and found this,  </li>
            <li> like the width, the weight, and the look of pink color.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time; product as expected.</li>
            <li> I have extremely wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> The cord is longer than any other straightener I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> I had this flat iron for a little less than 4 years.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair and was straightening my hair with a 1 inch tiny straightener.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the exterior (the purple part) is a bit bulky</li>
            <li> the price now down to $22 bucks</li>
            <li> Only &amp;#34;minor&amp;#34; problem is a little hard to turn on and that could just be me...</li>
            <li> I love my curling wand by same company but the straightener is terrible.  </li>
            <li> The previous one lasted for 4 years before it just didn&#x27;t heat up like it should.</li>
            <li> I had my previous straightner for 5 years</li>
            <li> My daughter previously owned one, used it until it broke.</li>
            <li> My style time is cut in half now.</li>
            <li> Not good for short hair.</li>
            <li> Plus I have long, thick hair and the 2 inch tiles</li>
            <li> I have burned my hand and head because It&#x27;s to wide, which makes it hard to handle.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I didnt know what i was missing.</li>
            <li> This straightener stopped heating up after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> and I get the job done in half the time!</li>

            <li> It pulls my hair bad and has already stopped getting hot.  </li>
            <li> but I could tell that the heating process was beginning to slow down.  </li>

            <li> It sucks....</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone with really thick and curly or wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is somewhat wavy</li>
            <li> This flat iron has thick edge, it is very difficult to get it closer to hair roots.</li>

            <li> I had this flat iron for a little less than 4 years. It worked really well and did its job to a tee. Overall, it was great. After those 4 years though, it started to die. At first, just the lights stopped working, but the flat iron still worked just fine, which I realized after I burned my hand (yeah I know, my fault for touching it). Then, and here&#x27;s where it gets truly dangerous, the entire straightener got extremely hot and incredibly difficult to hold and work with. Surprisingly, that&#x27;s not when I threw it out. It began to spark and make odd noises, so I finally chucked it, probably right about before the 3 &amp; 1/2 year mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Honestly, I loved this flat iron, but it&#x27;s not worth your money. It became really dangerous and there&#x27;s much, much better flat irons out there. It did its job, but I probably got lucky that it didn&#x27;t kill me or my mother, who occasionally used it as well. It looks cool when it lights up, but it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> great product, works nicely. It smells a little when heated, but other than that it is perfect</li>
            <li> My very expensive, professional quality straightening iron broke after 7 years and I&#x27;ve been trying to look for a good but reasonably priced straightener for a while with no success. One major problem I found with a lot of straightening irons was that it pulled on my hair like crazy. I was about to give up on finding a good one and settle on another overpriced high end straightener then I found bed head!! I read some good reviews about it and also it was reasonably priced so I decided to give it a try as my last resort. When I first tried it on my hair...it was like miracle! The iron heats up very quickly and straightens without much effort and most importantly, does not pull on my hair! It truly is a miracle! Good things do happen to those who wait. My only complaint is that the exterior (the purple part) is a bit bulky but honestly it&#x27;s not even bothering me that much. I&#x27;m just really happy that I finally found a good straightener that is capable of doing its job. Also, I like the fact that the iron is 2 inches wide because I can straighten my extremely long hair in relatively short time with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very very pleased with the bed head straightener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for quite some time and thought I&#x27;d leave a review. It&#x27;s got to be the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever bought. Bed head makes great durable products(I&#x27;d know...I put it through hell)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightner. I&#x27;ve had mine for a bit more than 2 years and it&#x27;s worked great. I had straightners before that would leave my hair super frizzy or wouldn&#x27;t last a whole day, but this one left my hair smooth and lasted long. Plus I have long, thick hair and the 2 inch tiles allow me to straigten my hair in no more than 30 minutes. Just recently I&#x27;ve had a problem keeping the straighner on because I think the wire is loose or something. Anyway I ordered this off of Amazon since the store I bought it from no longer had it. I placed the order over 2 months ago and it still hasn&#x27;t shipped...&lt;br /&gt;EDIT(October): Straightner finally shipped. Arrived in a timely maner; haven&#x27;t used the product yet but looks the same as the old one I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Works exactly the same as described above. So glad I found the same straightner. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this style straightener going on 10 years. My first one lasted about 6 years and I am now onto my second one! It does a great job straightening my 2&#x27; + long hair in no time!</li>
            <li> Very nice flat iron, not too heavy. Purchased for my 15 y.o. that uses a flat iron almost daily. Heats quickly and maintains a good temperature. She is very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product - it does what it needs to do and gets hot really fast! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for three years. The best straightener I have ever bought and for a great price. After extensive use I&#x27;ve decided to re-buy the same one. It still works great but I just felt like my hair didn&#x27;t glide thought it as easily but other wise I&#x27;ve never had a problem.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage daughter for Christmas and it&#x27;s been 2 days &amp; it broke. The end if it where it connects the top &amp; bottom is made of like a hard styrofoam stuff not sure but very disappointed. I usually love bed head products.</li>
            <li> Great Product and price</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY love love LOVE this straightner!  I first bought one back in 2005 at Target for $80 and fell in love with it! I have SUPER thick hair and on the hottest setting, it takes me about 5 mins to straighten my whole head of hair! I just purchased my 3rd one as after almost 4 years on my last, it just shorted out this morning.  These straightners have last me on average 3 to 4 years, have never once damaged my hair (super thick hair and I don&#x27;t use any product) and the price now down to $22 bucks, it&#x27;s a steal! I HIGHLY recommend this straightner!</li>
            <li> This is the worst flat iron I have ever purchased. It doesn&#x27;t heat up well, it pulls your hair and it&#x27;s just horrible. Please don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product. Bought it as a gift for my mom and it quickly straightens her short hair. She&#x27;s not tech/gadget friendly and hasn&#x27;t gotten frustrated yet! Even heat, solid choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for a long time and I love it! I especially love that you can change the temperature so I can use it on my sister&#x27;s hair on a lower setting so as not to fry her locks, while mine are already damaged so I crank it. After about 3 years it started to malfunction. I still use it but I have to slide the power button back and forth for it to power on, and I always unplug it when I&#x27;m finished since it will turn on randomly by itself. I think it&#x27;s just a problem with the switch itself, but doesn&#x27;t bother me. As far as doing its job it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair straighner ever and I have used many</li>
            <li> The straightener heats very fast and works perfect the quality is good and very nice to handle . My wife loves it because lives her hair very smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> i love it would recommend this to everyone meets all of my wants and needs cant say enough about how i like it</li>
            <li> By far the best straightener I have ever bought! Makes my hair so smooth and heats up super fast!</li>
            <li> bought for a gift she loved it works good</li>
            <li> If you have  short tresses this may not be the flat iron for you. The plated are wide, but I simply loveeee this flat iron. It straightens my hair and the lights are amazing. Very cute design</li>
            <li> I love how it heats up so quickly. I&#x27;ve only had it for two months, but I love it!!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this flat iron.  I love my curling wand by same company but the straightener is terrible.  I used to have a 1.25&amp;#34; FHI straightener that gave me such smooth straight hair, and would glide beautifully over hair.  This one doesn&#x27;t glide and the hair comes out aweful looking, almost burnt.  I hate the size of it too.  Very disappointed.  I don&#x27;t know if I just got a defective one.... Otherwise, I don&#x27;t know why others liked it so much.  Will be getting a different straightener.</li>
            <li> Loved it.. The only problem is that it&#x27;s not too hot</li>
            <li> Great product and reasonable price!  Only &amp;#34;minor&amp;#34; problem is a little hard to turn on and that could just be me...lol  I would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Looks just Ike picturs works awsome love everything from bed head</li>
            <li> Does a great job. I have extremely wavy/curly hair and it does the job quite quickly without me having to burn my hair in the process. fool proof cuz my husband (who knows absolutely nothing about hair) can do it and help me with my hair</li>
            <li> Ehhh I&#x27;ve always loved Bed Head products, unfortunately my old one gave up after like 6 years &amp; now its off markets so i was like why not give this one a shot. It does its job but its not really Amazing its ok</li>
            <li> My hair is not the thickest (being a blonde), and this straightner is amazing for all hair types.  Very durable also!</li>
            <li> Even at this price point I&#x27;ve had much better straighteners. This one drys my hair out and does not straighten well on the first stroke.</li>
            <li> Horrible for mixed or course hair</li>
            <li> Awful.....doesn&#x27;t head up, doesn&#x27;t glide through hair like it should....returned item.</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener so far! I love how it lights up different colors according to the heat setting you have it set on. I also love how it clamps down on your hair. I love the color and how long the cord is. It heats up quickly and works very well even on thick hair because my hair is thick! No complaints about it yet and I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good straightener and it shipped very quickly. :)</li>
            <li> Looks great but&lt;br /&gt;My daughter says it&lt;br /&gt;Does not Work very well. For&lt;br /&gt;The price it is fine.</li>
            <li> It was awful.!!!  I had a bedhead straightener previously &amp; it was great.  This doesn&#x27;t straighten well at all...very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Anything that works well and helps me get ready faster, is a winner! Heats up fast and if you have really stubbornly curly hair like I do, it only takes a couple of passes to straighten hair. This is my second one. The previous one lasted for 4 years before it just didn&#x27;t heat up like it should. Good value!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener!  I have very thick and long hair and was straightening my hair with a 1 inch tiny straightener.  My friend had a 2 inch bed head straightener and when she moved out I was more sad about the straightener going than I was about her going!  Her&#x27;s was a few years old though.  So, I decided I needed one.  Like I said, my hair is very thick and wavy - this straightener has many heat settings and my hair doesn&#x27;t get snagged.  The cord is longer than any other straightener I&#x27;ve seen.  Instead of taking an hour to straightener my hair with my old 1 inch straightener, it takes me 10 minutes.  I would recommend this for anyone with really thick and curly or wavy hair.  The price was great too!</li>
            <li> I received my first Bed Hair flatiron as a gift. I was so excited when I found this one when my old one stopped working. Best flatiron there is!</li>
            <li> On time, no delays  !! Excellent product</li>
            <li> Love love love this flat iron it works amazingly...I don&#x27;t recommended this tho for shorter hair its much to wide...I&#x27;ll have to get another since my mom stole mine because she loved it so much lol</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they all sounded great and the price wasn&#x27;t bad so I bought it. All the hype was a waist. I felt like it left my hair super frizzy! It took me longer to straigten my hair with this one, I should have not bought it and spent a few more dollars on something better. It didn&#x27;t really heat up that much either...perhaps I got a lemon. Either way, I would not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else. It sucks....</li>
            <li> Has a weird smell when heating up, it&#x27;s almost like the plates stick to my hair..doesn&#x27;t glide through at all. I guess it&#x27;s good for the price but not at all for long term use</li>
            <li> My daughter says that this gets really hot and cuts her flat-ironing time in half.  The color is really nice and the design is sleek.</li>
            <li> I really liked this straightener, it works very well and straightening my hair was so much quicker. Since it&#x27;s a bigger straightener it&#x27;s kind of hard to really straighten the roots of your hair. The appearance is really cool! the straightener is bright pink/purple and it has color indicating led lights when you turn it on. I will say that since I started using it my naturally curly hair has eventually turned into naturally wavy-ish, straight-ish hair. It&#x27;s a not here nor there kind of thing and I&#x27;m not sure I like that. I do use the straightener at its highest setting often, so I&#x27;m guessing I damaged the curl out of my hair.......so beware! I&#x27;ve had it less than a year (still works perfectly), but my previous bed head lasted 3 years so hopefully this one does too :)</li>
            <li> I had this straightener somewhere between 3 1/2-4 years. I had crazy, choppy layers in my hair (my hair is very think FYI) and I would use the straightener to straighten, but mostly to flip my hair out. It worked marvelously. Now, I no longer have it because for me too, the lights stopped working on it, and then a while after that when I would use it, it would make electric pop and crackle sounds before finally deciding to stop turning on. I used it on 400 degrees everytime, and anything you use for years and years at that temperature is going to short out. Personally, I think it is worth the price. As hot as I used it, and as much hairspray as I used, it never ever damaged my hair, and that&#x27;s saying something. I went to Ulta to get a second bed-head straightener when this one died, and they didn&#x27;t have any. I wound up with a Hot Tools, and I really don&#x27;t care for it too much. My hair has become damaged, it doesn&#x27;t feel nice in my hand, and if I tried to flip my hair with it I just don&#x27;t think it would work. I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out, but in the spring (when it&#x27;ll be long enough to do Locks of Love) I plan on chopping my hair off to go back to flippy, and I will be ordering this straightener when I do.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and it needs super high heat. This flat iron gets VERY hot, which I love, and does the job! My hair always needs product but not with this tool. I only had to run the hair through the iron once or twice at most and it runs through smoothly. My hair never gets snagged or caught and I get the job done in half the time! I have used Chi and other expensive high end irons and this out preforms all of them by far!</li>
            <li> this thing is great! Iv always bought the cheapy straighteners from walmart for $10 or so because im cheap and i dont straighten my hair often. I didnt know what i was missing. My fiance and I are going to vegas to get married in a few weeks and he prefers my hair straight when we are getting all fancy and dressed up (its naturally wavy so he gets to see that all the time) so i thought i would buy a new straightener and do my own hair to save money. who knows how much it will be in vegas! This thing works wonderfully. i can straighten my hair in half the time with way fewer passes than the cheap straighteners and i love to 2 inch plates since i have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I just want to start of by saying I read so many reviews on flat irons. I have never used one until now (I&#x27;m 35). I am incredibly satisfied with this purchase! I have VERY thick wavy/curling hair. My hair is long and poofy/frizzy. It&#x27;s always up in a pony tail or braided because it drives me crazy. This flat iron is amazing and and did the job in a zip. I can&#x27;t stop looking at my hair; it looks great! It&#x27;s soft, FLAT and shiny. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Recommended by friend who bought from Bed&amp;bath Beyond couple of years ago with higher price. She liked it very much and I can see how beautiful her hair straighten with shining.. Found this one from Amazon with better price so give it  a try. Made me feel better after straight my hair each time which just took about 5 mins. Would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, works very well. BedHead is now my go to for all my hair needs</li>
            <li> This causes so much damage to your hair, even on the lowest setting. It doesn&#x27;t get that hot but the plates are not smooth so it breaks your hair. I&#x27;m unhappy with this purchase. Don&#x27;t buy if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Skip these cheap irons and buy something professional that will last.</li>
            <li> I had my previous straightner for 5 years and it&#x27;s still going strong but I could tell that the heating process was beginning to slow down.  After much searching I dedicided to try this straightener out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not disappointed!  I have extremely curly hair that is about 3 inches past my shoulders and full of layers.  With my previous straightener I was spending about 30 minutes to complete my entire head.  However, with this straightener the heating process is much quicker and I&#x27;ve skimmed off 10 minutes (which is a god send in the morning!).  Also, Bed Head made a gorgeous straightener that I&#x27;m proud to leave out on the bathroom counter. :)</li>
            <li> The very best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. Heats up lightning fast, easy to clean off hair products from ceramic surface, perfect weight (not too hefty, nice handle). I&#x27;ve never been one to style my hair every day, but this straightener is so easy to use and effective that I don&#x27;t mind taking a little extra time. Such a joy to use. I especially like the little short pink nubs on the end, which allow me to guide the straightener and keep hair tightly against the ceramic plates. Perfect for giving hair a slight curl under or flip out.</li>
            <li> Great hair straightner, makea me hair sleek and cut my straightening time in half. The only downside is that its bulky.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, without words</li>
            <li> Pulls hair can&#x27;t get close to bottom roots. Not good for short hair. Love bed head products. Have curlers but this just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> For a beginner like me who was intimidated by flat irons, it was very easy to use and works very well. Good product.</li>
            <li> My daughter previously owned one, used it until it broke. Found it on your site and purchased it again. Leaves hair straight and soft.</li>
            <li> I love that I can choose the temperature so that I don&#x27;t feel as though I am going to fry my hair. Although I do have very straight hair there are those few strands that want to do what they want to do and not what I want them to. I use this straightener to ensure that those few crazy strands around my face behave themselves. I am so glad that purchased this item. I never thought that someone with naturally straight hair would ever need to buy a straightener but I can say that I love this item!!</li>
            <li> this was purchased for a gift - and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time,  and i am inlove.  Ive been using a 1inch straightener forever for no real reason and wanted to buy myself a treat and found this,  read the reviews first.  My hair hasnt looked this nice... For i cant even tell you how long.  I would have paid 100 bucks for this.  The price tag is wonderful and i might just buy another and keep it away incase this one ever dies on me.  I don&#x27;t want to be without it now. Everything it says it will do,  it does.  My 1inch is some professional brand and doesn&#x27;t  even compare to this.  My style time is cut in half now.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener!</li>
            <li> This flat iron has thick edge, it is very difficult to get it closer to hair roots. It does not make hair flat and shining. Temperature setting is not reflecting the actual temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the width, the weight, and the look of pink color.</li>
            <li> Love it! The color is super cute. It straightens my hair super quick and the little pieces on the ends to clamp the plates together definitely come in handy. It heats up super quick and it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
            <li> This too was a gift at Christmas and she loves it.  Is thrilled to have a hair straightener and is using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;I made someone happy over the holidays and that is all that can be expected.  Great gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it took a little longer than the above product, but was delivered basically on time and again, Amazon&lt;br /&gt;comes through!  Always the best place to get what you want!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend as a present and it was the perfect one for her hair since her hair is really curly. Keeps her hair nice and straight!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this iron so much on my long, thick hair that I rebought the same iron when I left mine out of town.  My last one has lasted about 4 years so far and I expect this one to last just as long!</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and was really expecting a lot out of this. I really do love the look and feel of it, but it does not get as hot as I would like it. I like my hair really really straight when I take the time to do it. But this product does not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love Bed Head products! This is my second straightener, and I will continue to buy the same one as long as they are made!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this straightener because of the reviews and how inexpensive it is and I have to say I think it&#x27;s worth every penny and more.  I had a Chi and did not like it and got rid of it.  I have only used it a couple times but it does a great job.  I have thick hair that is somewhat wavy and I used the hottest setting and only had to use it twice on the same area of hair.  I did not have to use any product which I was happy about and it has a 3 year warranty.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this flat iron. There is nothing I can complain about.</li>
            <li> AAAAA+++++ wow a great product would buy again. I get very hot and could cause a burn so would not buy for a younger person</li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron I can use! Heats up quick, does the job in half the time! Love it and always will!</li>
            <li> Love this first time bed head buyer! Great color!</li>
            <li> Not the same size as picture. I have burned my hand and head because It&#x27;s to wide, which makes it hard to handle.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  It pulls my hair bad and has already stopped getting hot.  Awful product.</li>
            <li> Love it! i had my last straightener for 4 years and it was my favorite lets just hope this one lasts that long! it straightens my hair so good! its hard for me to find  straightener that works for my thick puffy curly hair n this does the job!</li>
            <li> The best I Love itt ..</li>
            <li> loveeeeeeee it. best everrrrrrr!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time; product as expected.</li>
            <li> This straightener stopped heating up after just a few uses.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter loves this flat iron, it is very sturdy yet easy for her to use and she has a lot of curly hair up to her waist and she has cut her hair straightening time from 3 hours to 1 and a half when she does it herself and the hair stays straight for days!</li>
