            <li>I loved the color of this polish.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to receive this product quickly and intact.</li>
            <li>Personally I am much more keen on ORLY nail polish, but to each is own!</li>
            <li>but once I tried it on I really liked it.</li>
            <li>a lot of my friends liked it, if I could buy it again i would</li>
            <li>This colour is great and is true to the pictures provided.</li>
            <li>:)   </li>
            <li>This is personally my favorite color ever.</li>
            <li>My favorite OPI color.  </li>
            <li>One of my all time favorite OPI colors.</li>
            <li>13 more words required.</li>
            <li>9 more words required.</li>
            <li>it was the perfect purple and it lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>Also, the color was cheap looking.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new favorite shade!</li>
            <li>I always tend to choose funky fingernail polish colors and this is by far my favorite color!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it really was OPI.</li>
            <li>It very flattering on most skin tones</li>
            <li>I recieved my purchase so quickly (about 3 days after I ordered).  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for this color &amp; am stoked I finally found it :) love this purple</li>
            <li>only problem was that my bottle had a chip on it, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Still great purchase and love the color.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is the exact color I was expecting</li>
            <li>Especially for the Spring Time! :)</li>
            <li>This nail polish is exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>However I must say as an avid nail polish</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>The polish was very runny.  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li>That seems like a lot more trouble than it&#x27;s actually worth.</li>
            <li>Plus it lasted longer than most polishes,about two and a half weeks without chipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of pastel colors but this one is so pretty on!</li>
            <li>Doubt the polish is really Rumple&#x27;s Wiggin&#x27; the bottle should have been OPI&#x27;s old packaging since its from an old retired collection...</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>but it looks exactly like the new ones unlike my other bottles from the Shrek collection.</li>
            <li>Finally, I chipped THREE nails by the second day, very unusual for OPI.</li>
            <li>A vibrant color is attained with only 2 coats, and it lasts a long time.</li>

            <li> I do not find that OPI colours last very long on my nails.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the polish that came was a watered down version of a light purple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lavender color,but not too light,or not too dark.</li>
            <li> Just like on Pretty Little Liars!!!!!</li>
            <li> When I ordered it I was a little apprehensive</li>
            <li> I wasted $9.00 (w/ shipping) for this crappy runny thin nail polish that I can&#x27;t even use now.</li>
            <li> I mean hell</li>
            <li> (I hated to write a bad review, never have before, but there was no other way to contact the seller and let them know they were receiving poor quality polish.)</li>
            <li> Sad they discontinued it .</li>
            <li> I do not know if the seller put nail polish remover in it or something else to thin it out, but it is crap.</li>
            <li> Thank God it wasn&#x27;t anything expensive!  </li>

            <li> I loved the color of this polish.  I recieved my purchase so quickly (about 3 days after I ordered).  A very happy customer.</li>
            <li> I received this nail polish today and tried using it, BUT it was so runny that I could not even use/wear it. I do not know if the seller put nail polish remover in it or something else to thin it out, but it is crap. I wasted $9.00 (w/ shipping) for this crappy runny thin nail polish that I can&#x27;t even use now. I will never buy from this seller again. I will go to a beauty supply store next time and buy one that isn&#x27;t altered!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to receive this product quickly and intact. I will definitely be making future purchases with this seller.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is the exact color I was expecting and it is so beautiful! The shipping came in on time and nothing was damaged! This nail polish is a must buy!!! Especially for the Spring Time! :)</li>
            <li> it was to lilacy for me.  i tend to shove off what doesn&#x27;t impress me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been leery of purchasing online but know of my people who purchase through Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  I mean hell it&#x27;s only nail polish and it was only $7.  Well one month later and I&#x27;ve never received my product so it&#x27;s not likely I&#x27;ll do this again.  Thank God it wasn&#x27;t anything expensive!  Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> This nail polish is exactly what I thought it would be. A vibrant color is attained with only 2 coats, and it lasts a long time. I receive tons of compliments on my nails whenever I wear it. This is definitely my new favorite shade! Buy it ASAP.</li>
            <li> This polish went on so glommy and pasty I wasn&#x27;t sure if it really was OPI. Also, the color was cheap looking. Finally, I chipped THREE nails by the second day, very unusual for OPI. Do not waste your money on this product. (I hated to write a bad review, never have before, but there was no other way to contact the seller and let them know they were receiving poor quality polish.) Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of pastel colors but this one is so pretty on! When I ordered it I was a little apprehensive but once I tried it on I really liked it. Although the color is pastel it still has a vibrance.</li>
            <li> I always tend to choose funky fingernail polish colors and this is by far my favorite color! :)   Stays on a good while and looks wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is the great purple for your hands. Just like on Pretty Little Liars!!!!! Makes your hands look well manicured!!</li>
            <li> This is personally my favorite color ever. It&#x27;s a lavender color,but not too light,or not too dark. Plus it lasted longer than most polishes,about two and a half weeks without chipping.</li>

            <li> My favorite OPI color.  I hate they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the polish that came was a watered down version of a light purple. Not the OPI color that I&#x27;ve used for years. Seller offered to take it back. That seems like a lot more trouble than it&#x27;s actually worth.</li>
            <li> it was the perfect purple and it lasted a long time. a lot of my friends liked it, if I could buy it again i would</li>
            <li> This colour is great and is true to the pictures provided. I am forever getting compliments when I wear this colour. However I must say as an avid nail polish applier I do not find that OPI colours last very long on my nails. Personally I am much more keen on ORLY nail polish, but to each is own!</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite OPI colors. Sad they discontinued it . It very flattering on most skin tones</li>
            <li> Doubt the polish is really Rumple&#x27;s Wiggin&#x27; the bottle should have been OPI&#x27;s old packaging since its from an old retired collection... but it looks exactly like the new ones unlike my other bottles from the Shrek collection.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this color &amp; am stoked I finally found it :) love this purple, it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> The polish was very runny.  I will not be buying nail polish over the internet again. Very dissapointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> It was a gift.  Everything went great. 13 more words required. 9 more words required. 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.</li>
