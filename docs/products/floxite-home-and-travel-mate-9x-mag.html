            <li>it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I thought I found the PERFECT lighted mirror for putting my contacts in, and it was for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>The Floxite double-sided, lighted cosmetic mirror is the perfect mirror.  </li>
            <li>best mirror I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li>GREAT MIRROR - JUST PERFECT - MAGNIFICATION IS EXCELLENT FOR MAKE-UP APPLICATION AND THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the mirror out and love it!!</li>
            <li>For the money this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>I loved this mirror....for 2 1/2 months, and then it broke.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about these things -- I need the light to be BRIGHT -- daylight bright!</li>
            <li>I needed something that would fold up and store easily and provide me with great magnification and light when putting on my makeup.</li>

            <li> I use a lighted makeup mirror daily, and needed to find another one small enough for travel.</li>

            <li> Wish it was a little smaller</li>
            <li> but it just was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Base is heavy enough to support mirror and lighting is great.&lt;br /&gt;Choice of regular or 9x magnification with easy change.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can and other times I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is advertised as a travel mirror, but it is very heavy &amp; the mirror is on the outside when folded up, so it is not protected.</li>
            <li> She had one previously that broke and wanted to replace it with another one like it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this new mirror started having issues literally just a couple of days after my 30 day return window.</li>
            <li> Another plus is the little compartments inside for tweezers, etc.  </li>
            <li> Too heavy and cumbersome for travel.  </li>
            <li> I spent over $100 on another mirror and was not happy with the lighting and magnification</li>
            <li> The worst part was trying to get the cord to fit inside once it was unwrapped.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror less than a year ago and the glue that holds the mirror in place has failed.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a replacement bulb through Amazon and when that failed to fix the problem, I did a little research.</li>
            <li> I am lifting the entire base and turning it around that way.  </li>
            <li> I believe removing the little &amp;#34;walls&amp;#34; in the base would have helped a lot.</li>
            <li> So, I was very disappointed and have decided just to continue using my little magnification mirror that can be stuck to the bathroom mirror that I bought for $1.00 at the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror after having a bad experience with Zadro&#x27;s travel mirror.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had the same experience with this item and the seller as the earlier reviewer, L. Pilong.  I purchased the mirror for my wife.  When she switched it on the first time, it illuminated briefly, then went out.  I obtained a replacement bulb from the manufacturer, presuming that to be the defective part, but the mirror would still not illuminate when plugged in and switched on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller, DBRoth, refused to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As L. Pilong said, avoid this item, and this seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a make up mirror in my dorm. It works perfectly because when I want to use it I can just pull it out and use it then pack it right back up with no problem....but after 4 months of having it I thought the light bulb burnt out. So I bought a brand new light bulb for around $15 still didn&#x27;t work. My dad is pretty handy at fixing things he took it apart and found out that the ballast (which supplies the power to the whole thing) completely burn out..wont work!! We have been trying to find a new ballast to replace it with but this company makes it a certain size and doesn&#x27;t sell replacements. I mean its not an easy thing to replace in the first place but since I paid about $50 for a mirror that lasted 4 months we thought we could fix it. I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT GETTING THIS MIRROR!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror after having a bad experience with Zadro&#x27;s travel mirror. This product is vastly superior to the Zadro one and although it is larger, it still can be packed for travel if necessary.  The light is bright and I love how the mirror folds on itself to a more compact size. I also like that it has a regular plug instead of an AC adapter. Another plus is the little compartments inside for tweezers, etc.  I would definitely recommend this product highly. Mirror Place sent it promptly, packaged beautifully. For the money this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased this same type of mirror years ago from somewhere else. After much use it wore out. I purchased the same exact mirror from Amazon and it appears to be the same as my old one. This brand,for me, has proven to be very durable and dependable! I loved my old one and look forward to using this one for many years to come ! Quick delivery and so far, very pleased!</li>
            <li> GREAT MIRROR - JUST PERFECT - MAGNIFICATION IS EXCELLENT FOR MAKE-UP APPLICATION AND THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;IS VERY WELL EXECUTED - I LOVE THIS MIRROR AND HOW IT IS DESIGNED - THERE ARE MANY PRODUCTS LIKE THIS BUT THIS&lt;br /&gt;IS THE GOOD ONE - EXCELLENT AND SPEEDY DELIVERY - ALL GOOD.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror less than a year ago and the glue that holds the mirror in place has failed.  The mirror is no longer in the center but has dropped down over the light.  Probably can get the mirror off and re-glue it but it&#x27;s less than a year old and I paid over $60 for it.  Maybe just 1 star.</li>
            <li> Update: It is now July 2013 and I have never had an issue with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s great! Better than the Zadro travel mirror (which is delightfully smaller and more compact but doesn&#x27;t stay up very well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror packs up nicely. Wish it was a little smaller but I like the dimensions of the mirror to be larger anyway - in which to examine my entire face.  I don&#x27;t need the magnification to be 9x. 3-6x will do but it is the only two sided mirror with 1x on one side and increased magnification on the other that I found for travel and actually like. The lighting is the bomb diggity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched high and low for my make up mirrors for home and travel. The Zadro S neck surround light for home and this baby for travel has -thankfully- put an end to my search.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this mirror.  She had one previously that broke and wanted to replace it with another one like it.</li>
            <li> This is not a light weight item, but has great lighting and magnification.  I use it when I travel by personal vehicle, but, by my standards, it is too big and bulky for air travel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I had high expectations or what but it just was not what I expected. I have been looking for a travel mirror for sometime now. Most are either too strong (10X and more) or not small enough or ridiculously expensive or whatever. We will be traveling in a corvette so our room is very limited. When I found this one I was excited because I thought the 9X would work (I had looked in stores and really wanted a 7X but this was close, I thought) and I need a light. Lighting is a big issue for me so I really need a lighted mirror. Once received I tried it out the next morning. In my opinion, it may as well not even have a light. It did not illuminate my face at all. The 9X magnification was more like 13X. Much too strong for my needs. The worst part was trying to get the cord to fit inside once it was unwrapped. Took me forever. It would take me 15 minutes every morning just to get the cord back inside. I believe removing the little &amp;#34;walls&amp;#34; in the base would have helped a lot. So, I was very disappointed and have decided just to continue using my little magnification mirror that can be stuck to the bathroom mirror that I bought for $1.00 at the Dollar Store. Hopefully I can get enough lightning from the motels bathroom lighting. Sometimes I can and other times I can&#x27;t. I returned the mirror with no hassles.</li>
            <li> I loved this mirror....for 2 1/2 months, and then it broke.  It wont light.  DBroth wont give me my money back or replace it.  Don&#x27;t bother with this mirror....or the seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two for myself (home and office), one for daughter, mother, sister-in-law.  I love this mirror and can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> It is advertised as a travel mirror, but it is very heavy &amp; the mirror is on the outside when folded up, so it is not protected. I do like it for home use, but purchased it for travel.</li>
            <li> I thought I found the PERFECT lighted mirror for putting my contacts in, and it was for about 6 months.  With no warning, the light would not turn on.  Same problem as the others, the ballast.  For a $50. mirror there should be better quality control, or at least a warranty to cover these things since the consumers cannot find a replacement ballast.</li>
            <li> Too heavy and cumbersome for travel.  Ended up giving to my mother to use on her vanity.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror to use when traveling. I needed something that would fold up and store easily and provide me with great magnification and light when putting on my makeup. It seems to fit all my needs so I&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan. 25, 2013 UPDATE!! I&#x27;ve tried the mirror out and love it!! The light is so nice and BRIGHT!! I put away my other round lighted mirror and decided to use this one for everyday, plus I use the storage compartments for some of my favorite jewelry pieces.</li>
            <li> I purchased this same mirror a few years ago and was extremely happy with it so when the light started functioning intermittently and then stopped altogether, I assumed the bulb had burned out. I ordered a replacement bulb through Amazon and when that failed to fix the problem, I did a little research. Other reviewers of this item commented on a similar issue and explained that it was related to the wiring getting overstretched by the folding mechanism and shorting out. I spent over $100 on another mirror and was not happy with the lighting and magnification so I went ahead and ordered another of these mirrors figuring I had gotten some years of good use from the first one. Unfortunately, this new mirror started having issues literally just a couple of days after my 30 day return window. I am going to try to address this directly with the manufacturer since neither Amazon nor the seller offer any other recourse for returning or exchanging this defective product. I will update my review when I get a response from the manufacturer about what they will do to rectify this problem.</li>
            <li> The Floxite double-sided, lighted cosmetic mirror is the perfect mirror.  Just the right amount of light and magnification for applying makeup or using tweezers.  The adjustable neck on the mirror allows you to find just the height and position you need.  This mirror folds flat for storage and when the neck is extended during use you twist the mirror portion to change from regular to magnification views.  Herein lies the problem.  After folding and twisting during use the wires are compromised and wear out.  At this point the light will not work.  This is actually my second one of these mirrors as I could not find another mirror with the proper lighting and magnification.  This time I am folding it for storage but rather than twisting it to get the magnification side I am lifting the entire base and turning it around that way.  I am hoping with just the folding and no twisting it will hold up this time.</li>
            <li> Base is heavy enough to support mirror and lighting is great.&lt;br /&gt;Choice of regular or 9x magnification with easy change.</li>
            <li> Have already bought two of them. The first lasted many years. Provides both regular view and magnified view. No cons that I am aware of.</li>
            <li> I use a lighted makeup mirror daily, and needed to find another one small enough for travel. I&#x27;m pretty picky about these things -- I need the light to be BRIGHT -- daylight bright! This mirror fits the bill. It&#x27;s not quite small enough to fit in a big purse or anything but it fit GREAT in carry-on luggage. I&#x27;d say this was worth the money!</li>
            <li> best mirror I have ever owned!  The light is super bright and the magnification is so much better than my old mirror.  I would recommend.</li>
