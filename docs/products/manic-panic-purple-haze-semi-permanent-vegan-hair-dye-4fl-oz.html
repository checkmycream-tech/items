            <li>Beautiful color!</li>
            <li>Before I used Purple Haze, I used the Manic Panic Amplified Flash Lightning Bleach Kit, and it was awesome!</li>
            <li>it was deff awesome</li>
            <li>Perfect color just what I was looking for</li>

            <li>This color was beautiful!</li>
            <li>but I just wish I hadn&#x27;t thrown all that money at a product I was hoping would be perfect for me.</li>

            <li>Looks amazing in my daughters hair!  </li>
            <li>but i love manic panic it the best viberant hair color out there</li>
            <li>My mom applied it using a paint brush, and even did a strand of her own -- which is unbleached and brown!</li>
            <li>Gifted and they loved it, Awesome Gift</li>
            <li>Like any bright coloring it does fad after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>You will not have good results if you don&#x27;t get the dye somewhat</li>
            <li>I loved it, and the fact that it&#x27;s conditioning as it dyes helps ease some of the damage caused by bleaching.</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>she loved it.</li>
            <li>Good for someone with lighter hair</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I LOVED the color.</li>
            <li>It bleeds a bit if you don&#x27;t rinse well and might stain your towels and bath tub, but it all comes out with a good wash and scrub</li>
            <li>It even looks good without bleaching your hair</li>
            <li>help me good</li>
            <li>Looks best on light hair or it will look a bit muddy/dark.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shampoo really good before you are going to put manic panic in your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>i stripped my hair and dyed it with this, it was a good price</li>
            <li>but once I washed it, it had lightend up a bit and became a very pretty darker bright purple very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Nice purple color loved it&lt;br</li>
            <li>Popular brands do not always equate to good.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it, and that it&#x27;s vegan!</li>
            <li>I have so many shades in my hair now!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>this amazing hair color</li>
            <li>Hope this is helpful.p my hair in a bandanna or wear a ball cap to help warm it with my body heat.</li>
            <li>&gt;_ nice color</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>It looks nice however.</li>
            <li>It fades out really nice as well.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color and easy to remove when you&#x27;re done :]</li>
            <li>Beautiful color doesn&#x27;t fade quick like reds tend to.</li>
            <li>It fades quickly, but to this beautiful silvery lavender color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the \\&quot;amplified\\&quot; version with slightly better results, but miss the days when dumping the money for \\&quot;the good stuff\\&quot; yielded better results than some off walmart brand.</li>
            <li>No matter what I did it washes out quickly, but it&#x27;s a great color</li>
            <li>Also the color comes on very strong.</li>
            <li>Worth it, great color.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend has real light hair &amp; it looked great when first done.</li>
            <li>It also washed out very quickly!</li>
            <li>Love this color it so pretty and beautiful.</li>
            <li>_ looks beautiful in certain lighting</li>
            <li>, you need to know this color is suitable more purple than violet.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super permanent, but eh, it&#x27;s bright color hair dye.</li>
            <li>super bright.</li>
            <li>it good temporary hair dye, but it fades kinda quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic many times, so this review is very justified.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work better on bleached or very light hair</li>
            <li>Great price for a decent dye!</li>
            <li>Not my favorite purple.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoyed it, in spite of the taunts thrown at me by the elders that they \\&quot;earned\\&quot; their grays</li>
            <li>The dye has already acted as a conditioner, but if you need more, now would be the time to use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dye has already acted as a conditioner, but if you need more, now would be the time to use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t noticed much if any color transfer onto my towels or pillows, which is great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely phenomenal color.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, I cover a bit more and leave it on longer to get a darker tint.</li>
            <li>My students love it.</li>
            <li>I sometimes mix this with fuscia to get it a bit more purple-red.  </li>
            <li>Manic Panic is my favorite hair dye.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, this is more like a coating than a dye.</li>
            <li>Since my intent was to shock and appall my children by showing up with blobs of purple hair on my Oldth birthday, and not to make a permanent fashion statement, this was OK. &#x27;</li>
            <li>The color came out fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given it many chances.</li>
            <li>I love this dye because I was able to use it on the ends of my hair and</li>
            <li>i love manic panic products though.</li>
            <li>so I had to use 3/4 of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an ok product</li>
            <li>so I plan on touching it up with more dye before it</li>
            <li>Love it üòç</li>
            <li>and I love the choice of vegan dye for it being non damaging</li>
            <li>I love this dye because the color is AH-MAZ-ING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thought it would have given me more color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most purple color I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love it a lot.</li>
            <li>I love love love this color.</li>
            <li>Manic Panic has a much better smell than most hair dyes.</li>
            <li>TIP* make sure your hair is detangled.</li>
            <li>I love the color and how tha brand is vegan&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>But for me, I&#x27;ll just have to find a more permanent dye.</li>
            <li>Also, this brand is cruelty free!</li>
            <li>I love Manic Panic</li>
            <li>okay, i used to swear by manic panic.</li>
            <li>i love the stuff.</li>
            <li>however, i love love love the turquoise in manic panic.</li>
            <li>Do not wash your hair more than once or twice a week with this dye in.</li>
            <li>&amp; I would say in under a week it was 90% gone even with just one wash with a color safe shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bright electric purple and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying more soon!</li>
            <li>your hair needs to be squeaky clean, and do NOT use conditioner!</li>
            <li>Just because it&#x27;s a cute container does not mean it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works better on light color hair.</li>
            <li>To keep my color bright and shiny between professional colorings, I love touching up with Manic Panic.</li>
            <li>I get the most fabulous color, just what I wanted</li>
            <li>I love this &amp;#34;dye&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>all except the flamingo and pink were wonderful.</li>
            <li>The color is bright for two weeks--even after washing it every other day or so even, with fairly warm water!  </li>
            <li>but I cleaned it up easily with bleach.</li>
            <li>The color is great and it left my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>The color is bright and vibrant - it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Its good color and lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted strong color</li>
            <li>While Manic Panic gives you more of the product, I noticed right away that the color was a duller shade &amp; it washed out in the shower much more than the SPLAT.</li>
            <li>But my Daughter has beautiful curly blonde hair and now it is purple......kids.....</li>
            <li>I mixed the purple haze and ultra violet together and got a very beautiful color I only wish the color would stay in for a good 5 months before having to retouch on it</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>These look great at first, and actually look really nice when they are fading out.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, a deep purple.</li>
            <li>u hair needs to be light</li>
            <li>also your hair needs to be a light blonde again for the purple to more bright</li>
            <li>This came out such an great electric purple color.  </li>
            <li>but i would have to bleach it before i dye it because it didn&#x27;t show up on my light brown hair.</li>
            <li>I placed a cheap plastic showercap during the waiting portion, both to keep me from getting it everywhere and to hold heat</li>
            <li>filled with product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did not bleach my hair before dying, and the purple still showed up quite nicely in my light brown hair.</li>
            <li>Manic Panic is a lot more gentle :)</li>
            <li>All they could do is go on about how good my hair looked and how natural</li>
            <li>Overall, good product, but I&#x27;m still looking for something better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had good luck with it so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product is a good option for those with natural african-american hair that want to color their hair without damage.</li>
            <li>If you stain a porcelin sink with the color, put more of the color on the stain and it will wash right off.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; haze I more of a magenta color it has a very pink hue to it, wasn&#x27;t happy at all</li>
            <li>But is quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This is stunning, and fades into a pretty light lavender.</li>
            <li>I was pretty sure the salon used manic panic, so</li>
            <li>Redye it soon after that first time, and there will be more build up of dye sticking to your hair.</li>
            <li>This lasts long (maybe because of the redish/pinkish tinge it has to it) on my hair, and looks great.</li>
            <li>fun stuff!</li>
            <li>I added the MP on the ends and left it for about 10 min and loved the results.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for hours with a shower cap on my head before rinsing with cool water.</li>
            <li>and i would recommend leaving in longer than 30 mins if u want more intense color</li>
            <li>Manic Panic&#x27;s colours are intense but I&#x27;ve found that they fade more quickly than Splat or Punky Colour.</li>
            <li>Fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>Before applying, I always bleach my hair and then it takes the dye super well.</li>
            <li>Even if you get it on your ears or forehead, I used a Q-Tip dipped in Listerine (alcohol) to clean it right up.</li>
            <li>I think the color is bright and lasts as long as a semi-permanent can.</li>
            <li>At my end: delivered on time and packaged really well, so again, many thanks to the supplier, you guys rock!</li>
            <li>I was saddened because the original tint was pretty</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously the more frequently you wash your hair, the quicker the color will fade - but if you use cooler water, it will not fade as quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously the more frequently you wash your hair, the quicker the color will fade - but if you use cooler water, it will not fade as quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is very good and definitely will be buying again.</li>
            <li>there are some emollients or conditioners in this product which leave the dyed section of hair very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It hydrated my hair and left a nice purple color.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, if the dye touches anything at this point it will stain, so don&#x27;t sleep on your favorite embroidered pillowcase or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>mo3A547UKEX2GAE]]It&#x27;s a really funky color, and not at all what I expected lol.</li>
            <li>i love the fact that its not tested on animals and that its completely vegan it also helps condition my hair after bleaching</li>
            <li>It will begin fading within weeks even when only washing with cold/luke warm water.</li>
            <li>I had bought this dye at Sally Hanson and I had never used any fun colors in my hair or vegan dye for that matter.</li>
            <li>it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>ion is so far better.</li>
            <li>this has a nice color to it, and it doesn&#x27;t turn blue, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>A little bit of this with a large amount of conditioner gave me some seriously beautiful lavender hair.</li>
            <li>So the first time you dye it, it will fade quickly.</li>
            <li>I think they paid the other people to write good reviews for this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mix it with hot hot pink to get a super bright plum.</li>
            <li>My hair is colored purple right now</li>
            <li>The color on my double process bleach was beautiful for the short time it lasted.</li>
            <li>Also unlike my usual brand when I was done with the color I was able to lift it out nicely to redye over.</li>
            <li>so I would assume if you were to keep up on dying your hair with manic panic you&#x27;d have to do it very consistently, another downside is that it stains clothing (I&#x27;ve heard many mixed things about this people either have no problem with stains or it gets all over their clothes) other than that I loved this color</li>
            <li>It have me the effect that I wanted: dark purple tint and bright purple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good to mix with hot hot pink for a pretty fuschia color.</li>
            <li>they never dry out my hair and normally the color is amazing</li>
            <li>The one thing I love most about manic panic is that it doesn&#x27;t have such harsh chemicals in it and that you don&#x27;t mix it and then not be able to use it again.</li>
            <li>Washes out very very fast.</li>
            <li>It would strip if you used hot water and a shampoo that helps stripping like Aveda croton infusion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would keep using it ;)</li>
            <li>I will most likely not buy this again, nor recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty and it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li>it works magic ( my hair is blonde )</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re willing to dye your hair every two weeks.</li>
            <li>I suggest you bleach your hair first, because it doesn&#x27;t show up THAT well on unbleached hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair.</li>
            <li>Customer service hah that&#x27;s funny.</li>
            <li>so if you have darker hair then i would bleach it first.</li>
            <li>Semi-permanent color only sits on top of your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, I really love Manic Panic and especially purple haze.</li>
            <li>First I would bleach then put in a leave in conditioner then bleach a week</li>
            <li>jar bigger and more</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Really dissappointing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely purchase more manic panic because of this.</li>
            <li>(but it was a pretty color</li>
            <li>the color is more noticeable in sunlight and depending on the light indoors, it can look black or you can see color of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I done purple haze this last time wanting a gradient effect from light to dark and it came out gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair with other Manic Panic colors for years and never have I had a problem like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good only if you have blonde hair or bleach yours first.</li>
            <li>I think that if I had made more of an effort to maximize the longevity of the color, it would have lasted longer, but I enjoyed each new shade of purple after a few washes.</li>
            <li>The color is brilliant and in the sun looks so dramatic.</li>
            <li>But when it says semi permanent, it really means &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not coming off your hair for at least 3 months&amp;#34; lol</li>
            <li>but if I want longer lasting bright colour, I use a different brand.  </li>
            <li>i love this dye so much it always does the job and last for 3-4 months</li>
            <li>This is a good product if you have BLEACHED hair, or are only planning on it lasting for a while.</li>
            <li>My (prior) hair when I had added purple was a light golden brown and the pigment of the color</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the dye is just sitting on top of your natural color, and though it might have a purple sheen, it will just be a darkened version of your natural color (heads up: for some people, this might be what you want).</li>
            <li>If you want dark hair with a total purple tinge (beautiful), this is the product to use.</li>
            <li>It may be smart to use shampoo first, and then avoid your scalp when using the dishsoap.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and it came in right when expected.</li>
            <li>not I wrapped it on saran wrap and put a plastic bag over to hold in the heat and rinsed with very cool water the next morning.</li>
            <li>The purple turned out much too dark for me; I have naturally dark brown hair, and the purple blends in perfectly unless I&#x27;m in the sunlight.</li>
            <li>and it was very purple for the first day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s ph balanced, but I always get good results using it.</li>
            <li>As with all Manic Panic dyes, it fades quickly and needs frequent touch-ups.</li>
            <li>i only wanted to do one strip and it worked fine</li>
            <li>Of course, this is if you want your hair looking consistent and vibrant.</li>
            <li>It also conditions the hair a little, which is nice after the bleach, so it doesn&#x27;t feel so straw-like.</li>
            <li>But with gentle lukewarm water and conditioner it would stay in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>u want it to be really purple</li>
            <li>I dyed purple straight over my Atomic Turquoise hair, and I WOULD NOT SUGGEST anyone else do that.</li>
            <li>One thing I really like:  </li>
            <li>my hair was light brown with blonde highlights.</li>
            <li>but it faded so so fast.</li>
            <li>My hair was light brown, with blonde underneath.</li>
            <li>I put this over the light brown and the blonde, because it said you can do it on darker hair</li>
            <li>I really like the outcome of the color on my hair</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re looking REALLY close.</li>
            <li>I like that the color took so fast to my hair</li>
            <li>I rinse it out in my stainless steel sink because it doesn&#x27;t stain the SS.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can get fun colors on natural hair, but keep in mind it won&#x27;t be like bleached hair.  </li>
            <li>After about 5 days, the \\&quot;purple\\&quot; disappeared and I&#x27;m left with light brown hair.</li>
            <li>It really soaks it up.</li>
            <li>so i haven&#x27;t really had to worry about it fading too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough to re-apply when the color fades.</li>
            <li>I really like the color</li>
            <li>, it was shipped fast, the dye lasted about a month</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this color faded so fast on my hair...</li>
            <li>I left the dye in for about four hours on natural dirty-blond hair, and it turned out more purply-brown than purple.</li>
            <li>This dye is the best but about half this price at sallys beauty supply, dont waste your money online, this is a rip off!</li>
            <li>The brand is an excellent on but this particular color starts to look grey after only a week an a half of coloring it, so unless you are ok with re-doing your color every other week</li>
            <li>If you bleach your hair to an orange, and then put purple on top, purple + orange neutralize each other and you will just get brown.</li>
            <li>sticking to Special Effects...that brand actually works!</li>
            <li>The color was very subdued &amp; within less than a week most of it has faded out.</li>
            <li>On the blonde part it did though, and its a very cool purple, its not to dark or light.</li>
            <li>I had mixed this dye with the virgin snow toner and the color result was kinda this cool purple-ish gray color</li>
            <li>Looks like brand new!</li>
            <li>have dark brown hair and was actually happy with the color I got, which was a dark purple.</li>
            <li>Before it was red, and i did use manic panic, but when it washed out my hair was my hair was its natural color, light brown.</li>
            <li>The color will last longer if you use Wen, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve experienced at least.</li>
            <li>I only redo it once a month and it stays super purple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and is lasting longer than the salon dye.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Going to try again and see if the dye will take better if I leave it in a little longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got many complements on this color but it kinda faded a little bit after one wash.</li>
            <li>The container also is really difficult to open, the sealing doesn&#x27;t even have a tab to pull so your best et is using something to puncture it, so be ready for a huge mess.</li>
            <li>This time it is a nice dark purple very similar to the color in the container.</li>
            <li>So you are definitely getting your money worth.  </li>
            <li>The purple in particular fades to a nice shade even after a couple weeks (some blues look a little gross over time)</li>
            <li>The color was a little more red than I had expected, but that was ok.</li>
            <li>was expecting a nice clean shade of light purple, but what I got was a weird pink-orange streaky MESS.</li>
            <li>If you are someone, like me, who wants colored hair but doesn&#x27;t want to worry about touching it up every week, I&#x27;d go with this color, or a dark red.</li>
            <li>So I went ahead and re did it, but this time bleaching my hair similar to a light strawberry blonde.</li>
            <li>super pretty dark purple on the hair!</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair twice to get it to a nice pale blonde shade.</li>
            <li>The first application, I left it on for an hour, and it did not take evenly.</li>
            <li>I used it at first (because it was what I already had) and it washes the color off almost instantly.</li>
            <li>My color is not as vivid as you could get this color to be, but I&#x27;m a teacher, so I prefer it that way.</li>
            <li>I bleach my hair with Blonde Brilliance first and then put the dye in.</li>
            <li>The first time I ever used this color, with proper bleaching and dye care, this product stayed in the hair for almost a month.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to add purple highlights to my light brown to dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest choosing a different shade unless you had virgin hair before bleaching, you may have more luck if so, but I&#x27;ve used several colors and this is the only one that &#x27;greyed&#x27; on me.</li>
            <li>best of luck and remember to use cold water!</li>
            <li>Same as before, really, but again was a gift for my sister in law, and what can I say - she loves the stuff! .</li>
            <li>Test on a small area first, and if you&#x27;re having trouble getting a good color, try bleaching.</li>
            <li>since I shower and wash my hair daily using the Wen really helps keep the color vibrant.</li>
            <li>Lasted less than a week before huge streaks started turning a hideous pink-gray.    </li>
            <li>This color shows as a deep violet tint at first, then slowly fades to a prominent purple with every wash (:</li>
            <li>(Don&#x27;t use this as a regular shampoo - your hair likes a little oil to stay healthy.</li>
            <li>after the color process, i let it sit on my hair with a plastic cap on top for 2-3 hours so that it will be seen not only on the darkest parts of my hair (which is very dark brown/black), but also on the lighter areas.</li>
            <li>Take a fine, stiff comb and COMB THE DYE THROUGH YOUR HAIR until it is frothy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Washes out very easily, as expected, but also it actually leaves a nice pink color on bleached hair.</li>
            <li>I suggest using a blow dryer to make it set without wearing the shower cap, and using a smock or old clothing that can be stained.</li>
            <li>We left it on wrapped in foil for 2 hrs and the color stayed for over a week before it really faded.  </li>
            <li>I bleached my roots and used this over the old dye.</li>
            <li>completely fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I did not bleach my hair, I&#x27;m a natural brunette.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy Manic Panic - it washes out after a few washes (as it is supposed to.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please, do NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li>But I was Suprised that it completely covered my hair</li>
            <li>let mine sit for 30 mins and rinsed it out until water was completely</li>
            <li>It was completely out by 5 days.</li>
            <li>I was worried about buying a purple as I didn&#x27;t want one too dark or too cool toned.</li>
            <li>Not bad,, doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>In low-lit areas, it looks like my hair is just a dark brown/burgundy, but in light its very clear thatmy hair is a deep purple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for a while now, and this one has the truest purple color of them all and is very nice, but I would have to recommend that the hair be a lighter color before applying this product, or else it will only faintly show.</li>
            <li>It will also stain anything you lay on after washing it out the first time, too, so always blow dry well after.</li>
            <li>If you only have a small streak, you may be able to clip it out of the way while you wash the rest of your hair, and then only rinse or gently wash the dyed</li>
            <li>If you only have a small streak, you may be able to clip it out of the way while you wash the rest of your hair, and then only rinse or gently wash the dyed</li>
            <li>as it didn&#x27;t last very long and on manic panic&#x27;s website they make it sound like you only have to redye it every so often.</li>
            <li>I colored my hair with this and atomic tourqouise and the blue stayed vibrant way longer than the purple.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that 15 minutes is enough, but two hours gives decent results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands of temporary dyes in the past, and have only had to leave them in for about 20 minutes to get bright even results.</li>
            <li>My hair was back to normal after 5 days.</li>
            <li>However, after washing my hair only 5 times, in cold water and using color care shampoo, the purple faded greatly.</li>
            <li>The color stays for at least a week before starting to fade; the more you wash it the faster</li>
            <li>pretty color but doesnt last long.</li>
            <li>Manic Panic was always a pretty solid brand, and I&#x27;ve stood by it for I think too long now.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the product worked exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>the jar looks like I barely used it!</li>
            <li>However, even avoiding hot water and washing my hair every other day did not stop this from washing out in a week.</li>
            <li>but it just didn&#x27;t last nearly long enough to be worth investing in again.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t hurt anything to add a little heat; I usually wrap my hair in a bandanna or wear a ball cap to help warm it with my body heat.</li>
            <li>Because I din&#x27;t bleach the first time, it came out like a dark plum color.</li>
            <li>if u have dark hair and u want it to show alot, bleach it first so it can show through</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally auburn, but I already bleached and dyed my hair with purple and blue splat or</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need the entire bleaching kit that SPLAT offers.</li>
            <li>They were dark brown at first but they over time, it lightened a couple of shades.</li>
            <li>it was splotchy, lasted one rinse and was barely visible even immediately after colouring.</li>
            <li>My natural hair is black so taking the color out is a b***h, but the bleach I use really does the job.</li>
            <li>I put it over highlighted hair, and it&#x27;s a really fun look- dark almost black purple on my natural brown, and vivid purple over the highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that this product is vegan, which means it can be left in your hair as long as you so please without any negative effects.</li>
            <li>always* recommend a dark pillowcase for the first few weeks ;)</li>
            <li>any of these are things you marked the product down for, those are just negatives to be aware of with any semi-permanent, strangely colored dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On natural blonde it lasts the longest and newly beached it doesnt last very long at all</li>
            <li>I expected more, at least it didnt harm my hair</li>
            <li>I used the last half of the jar and let it soak in for a few hours and it looks better now.</li>
            <li>What I like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t messy and doesn&#x27;t color my towels or pillow if I rinse it very, very well then shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I had previously bleached hair (light brown) but after applying manic panic, my hair just became really dark purple.</li>
            <li>I bleached my dark brown hair to a light (slightly orange)</li>
            <li>My hair is to my shoulders, but it super thick</li>
            <li>I only used a small section of hair and I love it and little peek-a-boo of color.</li>
            <li>Very dark and very vibrant purple, so I like to thin is out with white, silicone free conditioner.  </li>

            <li> You will not have good results if you don&#x27;t get the dye somewhat</li>
            <li> I loved it, and the fact that it&#x27;s conditioning as it dyes helps ease some of the damage caused by bleaching.</li>

            <li> &gt;_ nice color</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> It looks nice however.</li>
            <li> It fades out really nice as well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and easy to remove when you&#x27;re done :]</li>
            <li> Beautiful color doesn&#x27;t fade quick like reds tend to.</li>
            <li> It fades quickly, but to this beautiful silvery lavender color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the \\&quot;amplified\\&quot; version with slightly better results, but miss the days when dumping the money for \\&quot;the good stuff\\&quot; yielded better results than some off walmart brand.</li>
            <li> No matter what I did it washes out quickly, but it&#x27;s a great color</li>
            <li> Also the color comes on very strong.</li>
            <li> Worth it, great color.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has real light hair &amp; it looked great when first done.</li>
            <li> It also washed out very quickly!</li>
            <li> Love this color it so pretty and beautiful.</li>
            <li> _ looks beautiful in certain lighting</li>
            <li> , you need to know this color is suitable more purple than violet.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t super permanent, but eh, it&#x27;s bright color hair dye.</li>
            <li> super bright.</li>
            <li> it good temporary hair dye, but it fades kinda quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic many times, so this review is very justified.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work better on bleached or very light hair</li>
            <li> Great price for a decent dye!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite purple.  </li>
            <li> and I enjoyed it, in spite of the taunts thrown at me by the elders that they \\&quot;earned\\&quot; their grays</li>
            <li> The dye has already acted as a conditioner, but if you need more, now would be the time to use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dye has already acted as a conditioner, but if you need more, now would be the time to use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t noticed much if any color transfer onto my towels or pillows, which is great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely phenomenal color.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, I cover a bit more and leave it on longer to get a darker tint.</li>
            <li> My students love it.</li>
            <li> I sometimes mix this with fuscia to get it a bit more purple-red.  </li>
            <li> Manic Panic is my favorite hair dye.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, this is more like a coating than a dye.</li>
            <li> Since my intent was to shock and appall my children by showing up with blobs of purple hair on my Oldth birthday, and not to make a permanent fashion statement, this was OK. &#x27;</li>
            <li> The color came out fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it many chances.</li>
            <li> I love this dye because I was able to use it on the ends of my hair and</li>
            <li> i love manic panic products though.</li>
            <li> so I had to use 3/4 of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an ok product</li>
            <li> so I plan on touching it up with more dye before it</li>
            <li> Love it üòç</li>
            <li> and I love the choice of vegan dye for it being non damaging</li>
            <li> I love this dye because the color is AH-MAZ-ING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thought it would have given me more color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most purple color I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love it a lot.</li>
            <li> I love love love this color.</li>
            <li> Manic Panic has a much better smell than most hair dyes.</li>
            <li> TIP* make sure your hair is detangled.</li>
            <li> I love the color and how tha brand is vegan&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> But for me, I&#x27;ll just have to find a more permanent dye.</li>
            <li> Also, this brand is cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I love Manic Panic</li>
            <li> okay, i used to swear by manic panic.</li>
            <li> i love the stuff.</li>
            <li> however, i love love love the turquoise in manic panic.</li>
            <li> Do not wash your hair more than once or twice a week with this dye in.</li>
            <li> &amp; I would say in under a week it was 90% gone even with just one wash with a color safe shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bright electric purple and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying more soon!</li>
            <li> your hair needs to be squeaky clean, and do NOT use conditioner!</li>
            <li> Just because it&#x27;s a cute container does not mean it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works better on light color hair.</li>
            <li> To keep my color bright and shiny between professional colorings, I love touching up with Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> I get the most fabulous color, just what I wanted</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;dye&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free.  </li>
            <li> all except the flamingo and pink were wonderful.</li>
            <li> The color is bright for two weeks--even after washing it every other day or so even, with fairly warm water!  </li>
            <li> but I cleaned it up easily with bleach.</li>
            <li> The color is great and it left my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> The color is bright and vibrant - it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily.</li>
            <li> Its good color and lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted strong color</li>
            <li> While Manic Panic gives you more of the product, I noticed right away that the color was a duller shade &amp; it washed out in the shower much more than the SPLAT.</li>
            <li> But my Daughter has beautiful curly blonde hair and now it is purple......kids.....</li>
            <li> I mixed the purple haze and ultra violet together and got a very beautiful color I only wish the color would stay in for a good 5 months before having to retouch on it</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> These look great at first, and actually look really nice when they are fading out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, a deep purple.</li>
            <li> u hair needs to be light</li>
            <li> also your hair needs to be a light blonde again for the purple to more bright</li>
            <li> This came out such an great electric purple color.  </li>
            <li> but i would have to bleach it before i dye it because it didn&#x27;t show up on my light brown hair.</li>
            <li> I placed a cheap plastic showercap during the waiting portion, both to keep me from getting it everywhere and to hold heat</li>
            <li> filled with product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did not bleach my hair before dying, and the purple still showed up quite nicely in my light brown hair.</li>
            <li> Manic Panic is a lot more gentle :)</li>
            <li> All they could do is go on about how good my hair looked and how natural</li>
            <li> Overall, good product, but I&#x27;m still looking for something better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had good luck with it so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this product is a good option for those with natural african-american hair that want to color their hair without damage.</li>
            <li> If you stain a porcelin sink with the color, put more of the color on the stain and it will wash right off.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; haze I more of a magenta color it has a very pink hue to it, wasn&#x27;t happy at all</li>
            <li> But is quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is stunning, and fades into a pretty light lavender.</li>
            <li> I was pretty sure the salon used manic panic, so</li>
            <li> Redye it soon after that first time, and there will be more build up of dye sticking to your hair.</li>
            <li> This lasts long (maybe because of the redish/pinkish tinge it has to it) on my hair, and looks great.</li>
            <li> fun stuff!</li>
            <li> I added the MP on the ends and left it for about 10 min and loved the results.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for hours with a shower cap on my head before rinsing with cool water.</li>
            <li> and i would recommend leaving in longer than 30 mins if u want more intense color</li>
            <li> Manic Panic&#x27;s colours are intense but I&#x27;ve found that they fade more quickly than Splat or Punky Colour.</li>
            <li> Fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> Before applying, I always bleach my hair and then it takes the dye super well.</li>
            <li> Even if you get it on your ears or forehead, I used a Q-Tip dipped in Listerine (alcohol) to clean it right up.</li>
            <li> I think the color is bright and lasts as long as a semi-permanent can.</li>
            <li> At my end: delivered on time and packaged really well, so again, many thanks to the supplier, you guys rock!</li>
            <li> I was saddened because the original tint was pretty</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously the more frequently you wash your hair, the quicker the color will fade - but if you use cooler water, it will not fade as quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously the more frequently you wash your hair, the quicker the color will fade - but if you use cooler water, it will not fade as quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is very good and definitely will be buying again.</li>
            <li> there are some emollients or conditioners in this product which leave the dyed section of hair very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> It hydrated my hair and left a nice purple color.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, if the dye touches anything at this point it will stain, so don&#x27;t sleep on your favorite embroidered pillowcase or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> mo3A547UKEX2GAE]]It&#x27;s a really funky color, and not at all what I expected lol.</li>
            <li> i love the fact that its not tested on animals and that its completely vegan it also helps condition my hair after bleaching</li>
            <li> It will begin fading within weeks even when only washing with cold/luke warm water.</li>
            <li> I had bought this dye at Sally Hanson and I had never used any fun colors in my hair or vegan dye for that matter.</li>
            <li> it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> ion is so far better.</li>
            <li> this has a nice color to it, and it doesn&#x27;t turn blue, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this with a large amount of conditioner gave me some seriously beautiful lavender hair.</li>
            <li> So the first time you dye it, it will fade quickly.</li>
            <li> I think they paid the other people to write good reviews for this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mix it with hot hot pink to get a super bright plum.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored purple right now</li>
            <li> The color on my double process bleach was beautiful for the short time it lasted.</li>
            <li> Also unlike my usual brand when I was done with the color I was able to lift it out nicely to redye over.</li>
            <li> so I would assume if you were to keep up on dying your hair with manic panic you&#x27;d have to do it very consistently, another downside is that it stains clothing (I&#x27;ve heard many mixed things about this people either have no problem with stains or it gets all over their clothes) other than that I loved this color</li>
            <li> It have me the effect that I wanted: dark purple tint and bright purple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good to mix with hot hot pink for a pretty fuschia color.</li>
            <li> they never dry out my hair and normally the color is amazing</li>
            <li> The one thing I love most about manic panic is that it doesn&#x27;t have such harsh chemicals in it and that you don&#x27;t mix it and then not be able to use it again.</li>
            <li> Washes out very very fast.</li>
            <li> It would strip if you used hot water and a shampoo that helps stripping like Aveda croton infusion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would keep using it ;)</li>
            <li> I will most likely not buy this again, nor recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> and I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty and it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li> it works magic ( my hair is blonde )</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re willing to dye your hair every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I suggest you bleach your hair first, because it doesn&#x27;t show up THAT well on unbleached hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair.</li>
            <li> Customer service hah that&#x27;s funny.</li>
            <li> so if you have darker hair then i would bleach it first.</li>
            <li> Semi-permanent color only sits on top of your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, I really love Manic Panic and especially purple haze.</li>
            <li> First I would bleach then put in a leave in conditioner then bleach a week</li>
            <li> jar bigger and more</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Really dissappointing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely purchase more manic panic because of this.</li>
            <li> (but it was a pretty color</li>
            <li> the color is more noticeable in sunlight and depending on the light indoors, it can look black or you can see color of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I done purple haze this last time wanting a gradient effect from light to dark and it came out gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair with other Manic Panic colors for years and never have I had a problem like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good only if you have blonde hair or bleach yours first.</li>
            <li> I think that if I had made more of an effort to maximize the longevity of the color, it would have lasted longer, but I enjoyed each new shade of purple after a few washes.</li>
            <li> The color is brilliant and in the sun looks so dramatic.</li>
            <li> But when it says semi permanent, it really means &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not coming off your hair for at least 3 months&amp;#34; lol</li>
            <li> but if I want longer lasting bright colour, I use a different brand.  </li>
            <li> i love this dye so much it always does the job and last for 3-4 months</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you have BLEACHED hair, or are only planning on it lasting for a while.</li>
            <li> My (prior) hair when I had added purple was a light golden brown and the pigment of the color</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the dye is just sitting on top of your natural color, and though it might have a purple sheen, it will just be a darkened version of your natural color (heads up: for some people, this might be what you want).</li>
            <li> If you want dark hair with a total purple tinge (beautiful), this is the product to use.</li>
            <li> It may be smart to use shampoo first, and then avoid your scalp when using the dishsoap.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and it came in right when expected.</li>
            <li> not I wrapped it on saran wrap and put a plastic bag over to hold in the heat and rinsed with very cool water the next morning.</li>
            <li> The purple turned out much too dark for me; I have naturally dark brown hair, and the purple blends in perfectly unless I&#x27;m in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> and it was very purple for the first day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s ph balanced, but I always get good results using it.</li>
            <li> As with all Manic Panic dyes, it fades quickly and needs frequent touch-ups.</li>
            <li> i only wanted to do one strip and it worked fine</li>
            <li> Of course, this is if you want your hair looking consistent and vibrant.</li>
            <li> It also conditions the hair a little, which is nice after the bleach, so it doesn&#x27;t feel so straw-like.</li>
            <li> But with gentle lukewarm water and conditioner it would stay in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> u want it to be really purple</li>
            <li> I dyed purple straight over my Atomic Turquoise hair, and I WOULD NOT SUGGEST anyone else do that.</li>
            <li> One thing I really like:  </li>
            <li> my hair was light brown with blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> but it faded so so fast.</li>
            <li> My hair was light brown, with blonde underneath.</li>
            <li> I put this over the light brown and the blonde, because it said you can do it on darker hair</li>
            <li> I really like the outcome of the color on my hair</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re looking REALLY close.</li>
            <li> I like that the color took so fast to my hair</li>
            <li> I rinse it out in my stainless steel sink because it doesn&#x27;t stain the SS.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can get fun colors on natural hair, but keep in mind it won&#x27;t be like bleached hair.  </li>
            <li> After about 5 days, the \\&quot;purple\\&quot; disappeared and I&#x27;m left with light brown hair.</li>
            <li> It really soaks it up.</li>
            <li> so i haven&#x27;t really had to worry about it fading too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap enough to re-apply when the color fades.</li>
            <li> I really like the color</li>
            <li> , it was shipped fast, the dye lasted about a month</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this color faded so fast on my hair...</li>
            <li> I left the dye in for about four hours on natural dirty-blond hair, and it turned out more purply-brown than purple.</li>
            <li> This dye is the best but about half this price at sallys beauty supply, dont waste your money online, this is a rip off!</li>
            <li> The brand is an excellent on but this particular color starts to look grey after only a week an a half of coloring it, so unless you are ok with re-doing your color every other week</li>
            <li> If you bleach your hair to an orange, and then put purple on top, purple + orange neutralize each other and you will just get brown.</li>
            <li> sticking to Special Effects...that brand actually works!</li>
            <li> The color was very subdued &amp; within less than a week most of it has faded out.</li>
            <li> On the blonde part it did though, and its a very cool purple, its not to dark or light.</li>
            <li> I had mixed this dye with the virgin snow toner and the color result was kinda this cool purple-ish gray color</li>
            <li> Looks like brand new!</li>
            <li> have dark brown hair and was actually happy with the color I got, which was a dark purple.</li>
            <li> Before it was red, and i did use manic panic, but when it washed out my hair was my hair was its natural color, light brown.</li>
            <li> The color will last longer if you use Wen, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve experienced at least.</li>
            <li> I only redo it once a month and it stays super purple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is lasting longer than the salon dye.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Going to try again and see if the dye will take better if I leave it in a little longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got many complements on this color but it kinda faded a little bit after one wash.</li>
            <li> The container also is really difficult to open, the sealing doesn&#x27;t even have a tab to pull so your best et is using something to puncture it, so be ready for a huge mess.</li>
            <li> This time it is a nice dark purple very similar to the color in the container.</li>
            <li> So you are definitely getting your money worth.  </li>
            <li> The purple in particular fades to a nice shade even after a couple weeks (some blues look a little gross over time)</li>
            <li> The color was a little more red than I had expected, but that was ok.</li>
            <li> was expecting a nice clean shade of light purple, but what I got was a weird pink-orange streaky MESS.</li>
            <li> If you are someone, like me, who wants colored hair but doesn&#x27;t want to worry about touching it up every week, I&#x27;d go with this color, or a dark red.</li>
            <li> So I went ahead and re did it, but this time bleaching my hair similar to a light strawberry blonde.</li>
            <li> super pretty dark purple on the hair!</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair twice to get it to a nice pale blonde shade.</li>
            <li> The first application, I left it on for an hour, and it did not take evenly.</li>
            <li> I used it at first (because it was what I already had) and it washes the color off almost instantly.</li>
            <li> My color is not as vivid as you could get this color to be, but I&#x27;m a teacher, so I prefer it that way.</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair with Blonde Brilliance first and then put the dye in.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever used this color, with proper bleaching and dye care, this product stayed in the hair for almost a month.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to add purple highlights to my light brown to dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest choosing a different shade unless you had virgin hair before bleaching, you may have more luck if so, but I&#x27;ve used several colors and this is the only one that &#x27;greyed&#x27; on me.</li>
            <li> best of luck and remember to use cold water!</li>
            <li> Same as before, really, but again was a gift for my sister in law, and what can I say - she loves the stuff! .</li>
            <li> Test on a small area first, and if you&#x27;re having trouble getting a good color, try bleaching.</li>
            <li> since I shower and wash my hair daily using the Wen really helps keep the color vibrant.</li>
            <li> Lasted less than a week before huge streaks started turning a hideous pink-gray.    </li>
            <li> This color shows as a deep violet tint at first, then slowly fades to a prominent purple with every wash (:</li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t use this as a regular shampoo - your hair likes a little oil to stay healthy.</li>
            <li> after the color process, i let it sit on my hair with a plastic cap on top for 2-3 hours so that it will be seen not only on the darkest parts of my hair (which is very dark brown/black), but also on the lighter areas.</li>
            <li> Take a fine, stiff comb and COMB THE DYE THROUGH YOUR HAIR until it is frothy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Washes out very easily, as expected, but also it actually leaves a nice pink color on bleached hair.</li>
            <li> I suggest using a blow dryer to make it set without wearing the shower cap, and using a smock or old clothing that can be stained.</li>
            <li> We left it on wrapped in foil for 2 hrs and the color stayed for over a week before it really faded.  </li>
            <li> I bleached my roots and used this over the old dye.</li>
            <li> completely fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I did not bleach my hair, I&#x27;m a natural brunette.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy Manic Panic - it washes out after a few washes (as it is supposed to.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please, do NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> But I was Suprised that it completely covered my hair</li>
            <li> let mine sit for 30 mins and rinsed it out until water was completely</li>
            <li> It was completely out by 5 days.</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying a purple as I didn&#x27;t want one too dark or too cool toned.</li>
            <li> Not bad,, doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> In low-lit areas, it looks like my hair is just a dark brown/burgundy, but in light its very clear thatmy hair is a deep purple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for a while now, and this one has the truest purple color of them all and is very nice, but I would have to recommend that the hair be a lighter color before applying this product, or else it will only faintly show.</li>
            <li> It will also stain anything you lay on after washing it out the first time, too, so always blow dry well after.</li>
            <li> If you only have a small streak, you may be able to clip it out of the way while you wash the rest of your hair, and then only rinse or gently wash the dyed</li>
            <li> If you only have a small streak, you may be able to clip it out of the way while you wash the rest of your hair, and then only rinse or gently wash the dyed</li>
            <li> as it didn&#x27;t last very long and on manic panic&#x27;s website they make it sound like you only have to redye it every so often.</li>
            <li> I colored my hair with this and atomic tourqouise and the blue stayed vibrant way longer than the purple.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that 15 minutes is enough, but two hours gives decent results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of temporary dyes in the past, and have only had to leave them in for about 20 minutes to get bright even results.</li>
            <li> My hair was back to normal after 5 days.</li>
            <li> However, after washing my hair only 5 times, in cold water and using color care shampoo, the purple faded greatly.</li>
            <li> The color stays for at least a week before starting to fade; the more you wash it the faster</li>
            <li> pretty color but doesnt last long.</li>
            <li> Manic Panic was always a pretty solid brand, and I&#x27;ve stood by it for I think too long now.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the product worked exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> the jar looks like I barely used it!</li>
            <li> However, even avoiding hot water and washing my hair every other day did not stop this from washing out in a week.</li>
            <li> but it just didn&#x27;t last nearly long enough to be worth investing in again.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t hurt anything to add a little heat; I usually wrap my hair in a bandanna or wear a ball cap to help warm it with my body heat.</li>
            <li> Because I din&#x27;t bleach the first time, it came out like a dark plum color.</li>
            <li> if u have dark hair and u want it to show alot, bleach it first so it can show through</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally auburn, but I already bleached and dyed my hair with purple and blue splat or</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need the entire bleaching kit that SPLAT offers.</li>
            <li> They were dark brown at first but they over time, it lightened a couple of shades.</li>
            <li> it was splotchy, lasted one rinse and was barely visible even immediately after colouring.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is black so taking the color out is a b***h, but the bleach I use really does the job.</li>
            <li> I put it over highlighted hair, and it&#x27;s a really fun look- dark almost black purple on my natural brown, and vivid purple over the highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that this product is vegan, which means it can be left in your hair as long as you so please without any negative effects.</li>
            <li> always* recommend a dark pillowcase for the first few weeks ;)</li>
            <li> any of these are things you marked the product down for, those are just negatives to be aware of with any semi-permanent, strangely colored dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On natural blonde it lasts the longest and newly beached it doesnt last very long at all</li>
            <li> I expected more, at least it didnt harm my hair</li>
            <li> I used the last half of the jar and let it soak in for a few hours and it looks better now.</li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t messy and doesn&#x27;t color my towels or pillow if I rinse it very, very well then shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I had previously bleached hair (light brown) but after applying manic panic, my hair just became really dark purple.</li>
            <li> I bleached my dark brown hair to a light (slightly orange)</li>
            <li> My hair is to my shoulders, but it super thick</li>
            <li> I only used a small section of hair and I love it and little peek-a-boo of color.</li>
            <li> Very dark and very vibrant purple, so I like to thin is out with white, silicone free conditioner.  </li>
            <li> When I change colors, I normally dye my hair, re-do the color three days later, re-do the color a week later, re-do the color a week and a half later, re-do the color two weeks later... and keep lessening the time between dyes as the dye builds up on my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy but nothing you can&#x27;t clean up.</li>
            <li> I just add small dollops of dye to a container filled with conditioner until I get a color a few shades darker than I want my hair to be.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is it didn&#x27;t show up on my natural dark hair</li>
            <li> I have natural medium to dark ash brown hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t leave the bleach or dye on long enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grey / silver hair and dying the back</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Weird thing is, that after about two washes, the color completely came out of the 1/2 in of hair that I had bleached right before I colored it this second time.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I have natural black hair, I beached it twice.  </li>
            <li> It has a rich conditioning texture and it stays in very dark katy perryish purple and fades (after about 6 washes) to a love it or hate it grey lavender.</li>
            <li> I bleached first and the overall turnout was very dull and lusterless.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when mixing colors, especially if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing!</li>
            <li> and it comes out a really pretty aubergine, and blends nicely with my roots so the grow out isn&#x27;t shocking.</li>
            <li> i would recommend diluting it with a little bit of conditioner however as the first application i did was rather hard to work with and stained the tiles in my bathroom, the second application i did i diluted with conditioner and the splatters did not leave much of a stain, or at least no stains i couldnt scrub off</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with a non-sulfate shampoo and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I only have had it dyed for a few days, but my blue lasted for 3 MONTHS!  </li>
            <li> However, Purple Haze has a nice red base to it and fades to a pinkish color.</li>
            <li> in mind that I bought Rockabilly blue, it just made my head semi blue and mostly black, never mind that this stuff gets all over me!</li>
            <li> For my little streak I only use about a quarter sized blob of dye, so one canister lays me a long time.</li>
            <li> I left it in over night for almost 10 hours, rinsed my hair with cold water and the only thing that took were my roots (though it was really only a very purple shade of brown) and the rest of my hair turned medium brown.</li>
            <li> I know it isn&#x27;t permanent but this should last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;ll be fine if you&#x27;re doing it on a kid and only want it in for that long, but all together I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Follow the package directions carefully, or go to a stylist.</li>
            <li> The idea is to keep the dye wet so it will continue to do its work on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, and maybe the 5th round of use.  </li>
            <li> and if you dye, say, pink over it, it turns into fuchsia streaks where it was darker.</li>
            <li> Left over dye can also be used to renew the color or touch up roots after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> And still be careful.</li>
            <li> it arrived on time sooner than what i expected,</li>
            <li> blonde and waited a few days, washed my hair with a Ph balanced shampoo.</li>
            <li> it does bleed a bit when i use water based products on my hair but its not a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Alright I did everything it asked and then some, I waited 2 hours to wash out the dye, and well, it didn&#x27;t work out to well as expected, after your hair dries</li>
            <li> until i tried to do pink.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re going to do pink.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would not be enough to saturate my hair as I have thick shortly below the shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> but I wil CERTAINLY never use this color</li>
            <li> I did let it set for 2 hours instead of 30 mins &amp; then soaked it in half white vinegar and half water.</li>
            <li> I have had my hair every color you could think of and only used beyond the zone, but I would get frustrated when the color would fade soo quickly.  </li>
            <li> I used it without the bleach, and I have medium brown hair and it only showed a small accent.</li>
            <li> leaves me looking conventional in front.</li>
            <li> This is a deposit-only dye, so if your hair is naturally dark it will not look like the package at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a dark purple, but it was too dark.</li>
            <li> and it would give it dark purple tones, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair purple at all.</li>
            <li> I used it over both bleached and unbleached dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> it is dark</li>
            <li> My wife got this product, she has dark hair, she didn&#x27;t bleach it.</li>
            <li> Now for color this type of purple has more of a indigo base</li>
            <li> It also showed up in the dark brown hair as well but was obviously not as bold.</li>
            <li> I have naturally black hair</li>
            <li> It looked black indoors</li>
            <li> Washes out in two weeks or less so its not permanent.  </li>
            <li> Used it on my black hair and it gave it a purple shine in the sun.</li>
            <li> Not true...</li>
            <li> If you have thick or long hair (or both, like me), be prepared to spend a lot of time and money each time.</li>
            <li> I have very very dark brown hair, some say that it&#x27;s almost black</li>
            <li> Luckily this washes out within 1 - 3 washes, so I suppose it isn&#x27;t too bad, but it didn&#x27;t come out at all how advertised.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this stuff didn&#x27;t last a whole week before I had to do another application.</li>
            <li> my -very slightly- lightened dark brown hair</li>
            <li> My bathtub was also stained a little</li>
            <li> i had one little strand of purple hair.</li>
            <li> I can see a little bit of blond from wear</li>
            <li> _  fades a little bit&lt;</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just doing a few streaks, you can use foil instead.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably my fault because I wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> could get messy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste¬†your time or money.</li>
            <li> , it will wash out in the shower for a few days.</li>
            <li> It will stain the skin for a few days too.</li>
            <li> It lasted a few weeks, washing hair every 3 days.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I think it&#x27;s time for this old bat to switch.  </li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> It washed out after a few days even after I let the sey sit for over an hour.</li>
            <li> Washes out within a few days.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used the purple as well and flamingo and neon green.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m not too mad that this color made my hair DARK black because it&#x27;s only a semi permanent dye that will fade if I wash it enough times, BUT I am mad that I spent 25 dollars on nothing when I could have went to the drugstore and bought a 4 dollar box of black dye that would have done the same thing.</li>
            <li> It was a little slow to arrive, but no complaints other than that.</li>
            <li> Typically bought SPLAT brand in the past.</li>
            <li> up, rinse your hair in clear water, as cold as you can tolerate.</li>

            <li> Manic Panic is the go to for crazy color hair dye, but after reading the negative reviews, I just wanna make it clear how to use semi-permanent dyes like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I work inside all day long so there&#x27;s not difference.</li>

            <li> I wonder if the negative reviewers didn&#x27;t apply it correctly, so I&#x27;m going to detail how I use this</li>
            <li> Only shampooing and washing with cold water will lengthen the life of the color a lot.</li>
            <li> To sum it up, this thing sucks.</li>
            <li> and then it slowly fades away.</li>
            <li> The length of my hair is BSL (bra strap length) and it is also thick</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice purple color loved it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works better on light color hair. I had a bad experience with Aveda coloring at this school and my hair ends turn to be grey. I added the MP on the ends and left it for about 10 min and loved the results. It hydrated my hair and left a nice purple color.  It would strip if you used hot water and a shampoo that helps stripping like Aveda croton infusion. But with gentle lukewarm water and conditioner it would stay in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would keep using it ;)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, a deep purple. Mix it with hot hot pink to get a super bright plum. Beautiful.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite purple.  Fades quickly.  I mix it with manic panic&#x27;s electric amethyst to get a longer lasting color.  It&#x27;s also good to mix with hot hot pink for a pretty fuschia color.</li>
            <li> I used it to dye my armpit hair and it worked soooo well. I later dyed my hair with it as well.</li>
            <li> I have naturally black hair so I decided to do a strand test. I bleached first and the overall turnout was very dull and lusterless. Maybe I didn&#x27;t leave the bleach or dye on long enough. I did use a hair dryer on the dye portion of it. It also damaged my hair horribly. I will use it more and try the bleach longer, but I was not impressed at all with this product. BE WARNED!!!</li>
            <li> Gifted and they loved it, Awesome Gift IDea</li>
            <li> Beautiful color doesn&#x27;t fade quick like reds tend to.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color but doesn&#x27;t last very long. I colored my hair with this and atomic tourqouise and the blue stayed vibrant way longer than the purple. I would have to redye after two weeks.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this with a large amount of conditioner gave me some seriously beautiful lavender hair. Big thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I had mixed this dye with the virgin snow toner and the color result was kinda this cool purple-ish gray color and I enjoyed it, in spite of the taunts thrown at me by the elders that they \\&quot;earned\\&quot; their grays lol. This product still disappointed me though, as it didn&#x27;t last very long and on manic panic&#x27;s website they make it sound like you only have to redye it every so often. I will most likely not buy this again, nor recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I usually have a purple streak in my hair, and Purple Haze has become my go-to color. I wonder if the negative reviewers didn&#x27;t apply it correctly, so I&#x27;m going to detail how I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, my streak has been bleached. This is a deposit-only dye, so if your hair is naturally dark it will not look like the package at all. In the past I have used a bleach kit intended for unconventional colors (Color Zone? I forgot.) and it worked well. Blonde hair may or may not color well if not bleached - it depends on how porous your hair is. Test on a small area first, and if you&#x27;re having trouble getting a good color, try bleaching. Follow the package directions carefully, or go to a stylist. Bleaching uses some nasty chemicals that must be used properly. Manic Panic is a lot more gentle :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next your hair needs to be squeaky clean, and do NOT use conditioner! I actually use Dawn dishsoap for this. I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s ph balanced, but I always get good results using it. It gets out any oils that may prevent the dye from coating the hair properly. (Don&#x27;t use this as a regular shampoo - your hair likes a little oil to stay healthy. It may be smart to use shampoo first, and then avoid your scalp when using the dishsoap.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up, don some disposable gloves and apply the color. For my little streak I only use about a quarter sized blob of dye, so one canister lays me a long time. Take a fine, stiff comb and COMB THE DYE THROUGH YOUR HAIR until it is frothy. I cannot overemphasize this. You will not have good results if you don&#x27;t get the dye somewhat frothy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up, wrap your hair in plastic. If you&#x27;re just doing a few streaks, you can use foil instead. The idea is to keep the dye wet so it will continue to do its work on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to leave the dye in overnight. I don&#x27;t think that 15 minutes is enough, but two hours gives decent results. It won&#x27;t hurt anything to add a little heat; I usually wrap my hair in a bandanna or wear a ball cap to help warm it with my body heat. Naturally, if the dye touches anything at this point it will stain, so don&#x27;t sleep on your favorite embroidered pillowcase or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up, rinse your hair in clear water, as cold as you can tolerate. Cold water helps to close the cuticle and trap the color in. The dye has already acted as a conditioner, but if you need more, now would be the time to use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the more frequently you wash your hair, the quicker the color will fade - but if you use cooler water, it will not fade as quickly. If you only have a small streak, you may be able to clip it out of the way while you wash the rest of your hair, and then only rinse or gently wash the dyed portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! Hope this is helpful.p my hair in a bandanna or wear a ball cap to help warm it with my body heat. Naturally, if the dye touches anything at this point it will stain, so don&#x27;t sleep on your favorite embroidered pillowcase or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up, rinse your hair in clear water, as cold as you can tolerate. Cold water helps to close the cuticle and trap the color in. The dye has already acted as a conditioner, but if you need more, now would be the time to use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the more frequently you wash your hair, the quicker the color will fade - but if you use cooler water, it will not fade as quickly.

            <li> I have very very dark brown hair, some say that it&#x27;s almost black and I refuse to bleach it or lighten it. I read several reviews where people left the dye on for longer than the recommended time. I decided to try it for 2.5 hours and I got exactly what I wanted. It looked black indoors and outdoors you could see the tinted plum color. It&#x27;s a little messy but nothing you can&#x27;t clean up. Even if you get it on your ears or forehead, I used a Q-Tip dipped in Listerine (alcohol) to clean it right up. My bathtub was also stained a little but I cleaned it up easily with bleach. No permanent damage. I&#x27;m only giving it a 4/5 because although I know it&#x27;s temporary, I didn&#x27;t expect it to wash off in 4-5 days. That&#x27;s probably my fault because I wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Very dark and very vibrant purple, so I like to thin is out with white, silicone free conditioner.  I just add small dollops of dye to a container filled with conditioner until I get a color a few shades darker than I want my hair to be.  I leave it on for hours with a shower cap on my head before rinsing with cool water. It leaves my hair feeling soft and hydrated. The color stays for at least a week before starting to fade; the more you wash it the faster it comes out.  I also haven&#x27;t noticed much if any color transfer onto my towels or pillows, which is great.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! It&#x27;s a bright electric purple and was exactly what I was looking for. Washes out very easily, as expected, but also it actually leaves a nice pink color on bleached hair. Great price for a decent dye!</li>
            <li> It fades quickly, but to this beautiful silvery lavender color. I loved it, and the fact that it&#x27;s conditioning as it dyes helps ease some of the damage caused by bleaching. Absolutely phenomenal color.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair dye that has worked! The color is really pretty and it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li> it works magic ( my hair is blonde ) i only wanted to do one strip and it worked fine could get messy so b carful</li>
            <li> pretty color but doesnt last long. On natural blonde it lasts the longest and newly beached it doesnt last very long at all</li>
            <li> This dye was alright. Did stain a lot of my stuff but I already knew that was going to happen. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> faded to brown after two weeks. great color if you&#x27;re willing to dye your hair every two weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product it definitely works. But my Daughter has beautiful curly blonde hair and now it is purple......kids.....</li>
            <li> this amazing hair color u hair needs to be light it u want it to be really purple and i would recommend leaving in longer than 30 mins if u want more intense color i leave this stuff sit in my hair over night before i wash it out cause it stays in longer that way i just wear a shower cap to bed also your hair needs to be a light blonde again for the purple to more bright but i love manic panic it the best viberant hair color out there</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3A547UKEX2GAE]]It&#x27;s a really funky color, and not at all what I expected lol. The first application, I left it on for an hour, and it did not take evenly. I used the last half of the jar and let it soak in for a few hours and it looks better now. I am not really impressed. I&#x27;ve used other brands of temporary dyes in the past, and have only had to leave them in for about 20 minutes to get bright even results. Before I used Purple Haze, I used the Manic Panic Amplified Flash Lightning Bleach Kit, and it was awesome!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I had the tips of my hair bleached in August, and had it dyed blue. I was pretty sure the salon used manic panic, so, I got this purple haze hair dye. My mom applied it using a paint brush, and even did a strand of her own -- which is unbleached and brown! She and I have taken a shower since, and it still shows up for us. I suggest you bleach your hair first, because it doesn&#x27;t show up THAT well on unbleached hair. I only have had it dyed for a few days, but my blue lasted for 3 MONTHS!  A tip: I suggest using a blow dryer to make it set without wearing the shower cap, and using a smock or old clothing that can be stained. Also, it stains hands for several days, and does not continue to soak in after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> So I decided, after my adventures with blue hair, to go purple. I dyed purple straight over my Atomic Turquoise hair, and I WOULD NOT SUGGEST anyone else do that. The purple turned out much too dark for me; I have naturally dark brown hair, and the purple blends in perfectly unless I&#x27;m in the sunlight. Other than that, the product worked exactly as it should. Just be careful when mixing colors, especially if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing!</li>
            <li> This color shows as a deep violet tint at first, then slowly fades to a prominent purple with every wash (:</li>
            <li> I did my daughters tips purple. it came out great. I loved it she loved it. it was deff awesome</li>
            <li> I dyed all my hair with this color. I must say, I did it twice. The first time I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair. I wanted to get a dark purple, but it was too dark. I have natural medium to dark ash brown hair. Because I din&#x27;t bleach the first time, it came out like a dark plum color. So I went ahead and re did it, but this time bleaching my hair similar to a light strawberry blonde. This time it is a nice dark purple very similar to the color in the container. To maintain it don&#x27;t use those color shield shampoos/conditioners. I used it at first (because it was what I already had) and it washes the color off almost instantly. Now I will start to use &amp;#34;As I Am Coconut Cowash Cleansing Conditioner&amp;#34;. It was recommended to me by a friend. Use COLD water. Oh and also... leave the manic panic hair dye overnight on your hair. It won&#x27;t damage it but it will help to keep the color darker and longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This review was written by the wife of J1M_288) XD Because I&#x27;m the one who used it lol I would like to add pics of how my  hair turned out... but can&#x27;t see where.</li>
            <li> Love it, and that it&#x27;s vegan!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Manic Panic product and it didn&#x27;t work. I called the company and emailed them pictures of my before and after also of their product bottle. Customer service hah that&#x27;s funny. All they could do is go on about how good my hair looked and how natural their product. Don&#x27;t waste¬†your time or money.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, and maybe the 5th round of use.  It&#x27;s great. Every time I use it, I cover a bit more and leave it on longer to get a darker tint. I&#x27;ve grey / silver hair and dying the back leaves me looking conventional in front. My students love it. One thing I really like:  there are some emollients or conditioners in this product which leave the dyed section of hair very shiny and smooth. Highly recommended. I sometimes mix this with fuscia to get it a bit more purple-red.  It does fade with washing, though.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; haze I more of a magenta color it has a very pink hue to it, wasn&#x27;t happy at all</li>
            <li> Manic Panic is my favorite hair dye. Before applying, I always bleach my hair and then it takes the dye super well. The color is bright for two weeks--even after washing it every other day or so even, with fairly warm water!  The purple in particular fades to a nice shade even after a couple weeks (some blues look a little gross over time) and if you dye, say, pink over it, it turns into fuchsia streaks where it was darker. It also conditions the hair a little, which is nice after the bleach, so it doesn&#x27;t feel so straw-like. Left over dye can also be used to renew the color or touch up roots after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons, it will wash out in the shower for a few days. It will stain the skin for a few days too. It will also stain anything you lay on after washing it out the first time, too, so always blow dry well after. And still be careful. It isn&#x27;t super permanent, but eh, it&#x27;s bright color hair dye. None of them last forever. Only shampooing and washing with cold water will lengthen the life of the color a lot.</li>
            <li> Perfect color just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> it good temporary hair dye, but it fades kinda quickly. if u have dark hair and u want it to show alot, bleach it first so it can show through</li>
            <li> i love this dye so much it always does the job and last for 3-4 months i love the fact that its not tested on animals and that its completely vegan it also helps condition my hair after bleaching</li>
            <li> This came out such an great electric purple color.  My daughter was so happy. We left it on wrapped in foil for 2 hrs and the color stayed for over a week before it really faded.  Next time we will leave it in longer.</li>
            <li> I WANT MY MONEY BACK because I didn&#x27;t get the stuff at all so I will never do this AGAIN</li>
            <li> This dye is the best but about half this price at sallys beauty supply, dont waste your money online, this is a rip off!</li>
            <li> To keep my color bright and shiny between professional colorings, I love touching up with Manic Panic. My hair is colored purple right now and I have to touch up every 3 weeks. I think the color is bright and lasts as long as a semi-permanent can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I used it without the bleach, and I have medium brown hair and it only showed a small accent. It also washed out very quickly! Good for someone with lighter hair I imagine.</li>
            <li> I used this dye along with some white conditioner to make my hair lilac. As with all Manic Panic dyes, it fades quickly and needs frequent touch-ups. However, Purple Haze has a nice red base to it and fades to a pinkish color. Loved it.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, this is more like a coating than a dye. I left it in for a l-o-n-g time, and tried setting it variously with salt and vinegar solutions. It still washed out within a week. Since my intent was to shock and appall my children by showing up with blobs of purple hair on my Oldth birthday, and not to make a permanent fashion statement, this was OK. &#x27;Course, the kids said, &amp;#34;Hi, Mom. Oh, Purple hair. Now where did I put the diaper bag?&amp;#34; So apparently I&#x27;ve done enough outrageous things to get away with the ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Ive always used Manic Panic [going on 10 yrs now] and probably always will. Its good color and lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally auburn, but I already bleached and dyed my hair with purple and blue splat or w/e the walmart hair dye is. When that started to fade I bleached my roots and used this over the old dye. The color came out fantastic! I have so many shades in my hair now! Weird thing is, that after about two washes, the color completely came out of the 1/2 in of hair that I had bleached right before I colored it this second time. Going to try again and see if the dye will take better if I leave it in a little longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic many times, so this review is very justified. I&#x27;ve given it many chances. This is a good product if you have BLEACHED hair, or are only planning on it lasting for a while. It will begin fading within weeks even when only washing with cold/luke warm water. The container also is really difficult to open, the sealing doesn&#x27;t even have a tab to pull so your best et is using something to puncture it, so be ready for a huge mess. The shape and design of the container are also inconvenient as it is difficult to get it all out. Popular brands do not always equate to good. Just because it&#x27;s a cute container does not mean it&#x27;s a good product. Unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and it came in right when expected. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying more soon!</li>
            <li> I love this dye because I was able to use it on the ends of my hair and the jar looks like I barely used it! Looks like brand new! Also the color comes on very strong. The only thing is it didn&#x27;t show up on my natural dark hair but it did show up on my ombre ends. Love this!</li>
            <li> Typically bought SPLAT brand in the past. Wanted to try out this brand since they offer just the dye. I don&#x27;t need the entire bleaching kit that SPLAT offers. While Manic Panic gives you more of the product, I noticed right away that the color was a duller shade &amp; it washed out in the shower much more than the SPLAT. The color was very subdued &amp; within less than a week most of it has faded out. I can easily last 4-5 weeks between coloring sessions with SPLAT. Disappointed that this stuff didn&#x27;t last a whole week before I had to do another application. Spend the few extra dollars &amp; buy a different brand unless you want very temporary color change.</li>
            <li> I had dyed my hair about a month or two prior to using this product and the color didn&#x27;t stick. my hair was light brown with blonde highlights. i had one little strand of purple hair. it was cute, i just wish all of my hair was purple!!!!!! i love manic panic products though. they never dry out my hair and normally the color is amazing</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! The color is great and it left my hair feeling healthy. Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I did not and will not bleach my hair. I want to get that out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair and was actually happy with the color I got, which was a dark purple. However, even avoiding hot water and washing my hair every other day did not stop this from washing out in a week. My hair is to my shoulders, but it super thick so I had to use 3/4 of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an ok product but it just didn&#x27;t last nearly long enough to be worth investing in again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purple dyes ive used. It has a rich conditioning texture and it stays in very dark katy perryish purple and fades (after about 6 washes) to a love it or hate it grey lavender. Overall ill be buying it again soon.</li>
            <li> I LOVED the color. I read reviews and lightened my hair with the manic lightning bleach kit and then added color to my conditioner as well to try and keep it from fading so bad. I also kept in my hair ALL night and it faded in 4 days.. I was so upset. The one thing I love most about manic panic is that it doesn&#x27;t have such harsh chemicals in it and that you don&#x27;t mix it and then not be able to use it again. This color was beautiful! but it faded so so fast.</li>
            <li> My hair was light brown, with blonde underneath. Before it was red, and i did use manic panic, but when it washed out my hair was my hair was its natural color, light brown. I put this over the light brown and the blonde, because it said you can do it on darker hair and it would give it dark purple tones, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair purple at all. On the blonde part it did though, and its a very cool purple, its not to dark or light. I would definitely buy it again but i would have to bleach it before i dye it because it didn&#x27;t show up on my light brown hair. so if you have darker hair then i would bleach it first.</li>
            <li> I mixed the purple haze and ultra violet together and got a very beautiful color I only wish the color would stay in for a good 5 months before having to retouch on it</li>
            <li> Like any bright coloring it does fad after about 2 weeks. But is quick and easy to apply. I only used a small section of hair and I love it and little peek-a-boo of color. My stylist turned me on to this product, I will continue to use it!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the outcome of the color on my hair it&#x27;s really beautiful. I&#x27;ve got many complements on this color but it kinda faded a little bit after one wash. I can see a little bit of blond from wear I bleached it so I plan on touching it up with more dye before it completely fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_ nice color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_ looks beautiful in certain lighting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_ doesn&#x27;t have a  lot of chemicals in it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;_  fades a little bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- container is small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m not too mad that this color made my hair DARK black because it&#x27;s only a semi permanent dye that will fade if I wash it enough times, BUT I am mad that I spent 25 dollars on nothing when I could have went to the drugstore and bought a 4 dollar box of black dye that would have done the same thing. I have a purple tint in my hair if I&#x27;m outside in the sun and you&#x27;re looking REALLY close. Unfortunately I work inside all day long so there&#x27;s not difference. I like that the color took so fast to my hair but I just wish I hadn&#x27;t thrown all that money at a product I was hoping would be perfect for me. I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll never use Manic Panic brand again but I wil CERTAINLY never use this color again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These people should warn you it WILL NOT be the color it looks like if you haven&#x27;t bleached the #$%@ out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to hoping it washes out soon!</li>
            <li> Love it üòç it is exelent it arrived on time sooner than what i expected,</li>
            <li> I had bought this dye at Sally Hanson and I had never used any fun colors in my hair or vegan dye for that matter. My (prior) hair when I had added purple was a light golden brown and the pigment of the color still remained only a short while so I would assume if you were to keep up on dying your hair with manic panic you&#x27;d have to do it very consistently, another downside is that it stains clothing (I&#x27;ve heard many mixed things about this people either have no problem with stains or it gets all over their clothes) other than that I loved this color and I love the choice of vegan dye for it being non damaging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it seven years ago for Aqua and it&#x27;s still the best you can buy. The only problem is the amount of die it gives you. Otherwise, buy buy buy! :D</li>
            <li> Manic Panic is the go to for crazy color hair dye, but after reading the negative reviews, I just wanna make it clear how to use semi-permanent dyes like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You -have to- bleach or lighten your hair. Otherwise, the dye is just sitting on top of your natural color, and though it might have a purple sheen, it will just be a darkened version of your natural color (heads up: for some people, this might be what you want). Also, if you don&#x27;t bleach, it will fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You need to remember how colors mix. If you bleach your hair to an orange, and then put purple on top, purple + orange neutralize each other and you will just get brown. This is why you go to salons, usually, because colorists are trained to know these things and tone your hair correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Semi-permanent color only sits on top of your hair. So the first time you dye it, it will fade quickly. Redye it soon after that first time, and there will be more build up of dye sticking to your hair. When I change colors, I normally dye my hair, re-do the color three days later, re-do the color a week later, re-do the color a week and a half later, re-do the color two weeks later... and keep lessening the time between dyes as the dye builds up on my hair. Of course, this is if you want your hair looking consistent and vibrant. Some people like the faded pastel-y look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of these are things you marked the product down for, those are just negatives to be aware of with any semi-permanent, strangely colored dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I really love Manic Panic and especially purple haze. I put it over my -very slightly- lightened dark brown hair and it comes out a really pretty aubergine, and blends nicely with my roots so the grow out isn&#x27;t shocking. My color is not as vivid as you could get this color to be, but I&#x27;m a teacher, so I prefer it that way. In low-lit areas, it looks like my hair is just a dark brown/burgundy, but in light its very clear thatmy hair is a deep purple. I mix this color with Sparks Purple Passion and the Manic Panic Fuschia color (forget the name). It bleeds a bit if you don&#x27;t rinse well and might stain your towels and bath tub, but it all comes out with a good wash and scrub - I&#x27;ve never had anything permanently ruined unless I&#x27;ve stuck it in dye or my hair pre-wash</li>
            <li> I have a base color that is dark brown (I am completely gray).  I have my stylist color my base then I put this color on and leave it on for 3 hours.  I get the most fabulous color, just what I wanted (after doing this look in a mirror in the sun, it&#x27;s totally beautiful).  What I like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t messy and doesn&#x27;t color my towels or pillow if I rinse it very, very well then shampoo.  I rinse it out in my stainless steel sink because it doesn&#x27;t stain the SS.  If you stain a porcelin sink with the color, put more of the color on the stain and it will wash right off.  If you want dark hair with a total purple tinge (beautiful), this is the product to use.</li>
            <li> The color was a little more red than I had expected, but that was ok. I used it over both bleached and unbleached dark brown hair. It have me the effect that I wanted: dark purple tint and bright purple. It lasted a few weeks, washing hair every 3 days. It bled every time I washed it and also got on my pillowcases. Overall, good product, but I&#x27;m still looking for something better.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I did not bleach my hair, I&#x27;m a natural brunette.  It looks JUST LIKE Katy Perry&#x27;s hair!!!!!!!! I did let it set for 2 hours instead of 30 mins &amp; then soaked it in half white vinegar and half water.</li>
            <li> Great Purple color!  Looks amazing in my daughters hair!  Washes out in two weeks or less so its not permanent.  Wear gloves!</li>
            <li> Love this color it so pretty and beautiful. It washed out after about 2 weeks but there will still be color left over in your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;dye&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free.  I love this dye because the color is AH-MAZ-ING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get fun colors on natural hair, but keep in mind it won&#x27;t be like bleached hair.  I put it over highlighted hair, and it&#x27;s a really fun look- dark almost black purple on my natural brown, and vivid purple over the highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted strong color so I left it on longer than indicated- since this is a deposit only (essentially a stain rather than chemical dye) you can do that.  I left mine on for an hour after completing application, and also applied heat.  I placed a cheap plastic showercap during the waiting portion, both to keep me from getting it everywhere and to hold heat in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point I had used it just for streaks, and for those I applied the color and foil wrapped, leaving for an hour, occasionally during the wait I applied heat to the foils with my blowdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In both cases I&#x27;ve been happy with the result.  See pics!</li>
            <li> Used it on my black hair and it gave it a purple shine in the sun. I&#x27;ll probably bleach before I use it next time.</li>
            <li> Luckily this washes out within 1 - 3 washes, so I suppose it isn&#x27;t too bad, but it didn&#x27;t come out at all how advertised. I bleached my dark brown hair to a light (slightly orange) blonde and waited a few days, washed my hair with a Ph balanced shampoo. So I was thinking it would turn out so well after all that...not at all. I left it in over night for almost 10 hours, rinsed my hair with cold water and the only thing that took were my roots (though it was really only a very purple shade of brown) and the rest of my hair turned medium brown. After about 5 days, the \\&quot;purple\\&quot; disappeared and I&#x27;m left with light brown hair. Hopefully that will go away within a week and I don&#x27;t have to bleach my hair again!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking to Special Effects...that brand actually works!</li>
            <li> LOVED THIS COLOR! super bright. had this in the winter and my hair just glistened in the sun. Really awesome</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Manic Panic - it washes out after a few washes (as it is supposed to.) The color is bright and vibrant - it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I liked it. It stays on for a couple of weeks and then it slowly fades away. I had previously bleached hair (light brown) but after applying manic panic, my hair just became really dark purple. It looks nice however.</li>
            <li> It was called glaze&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would have given me more color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most purple color I have ever used. Love it a lot. It even looks good without bleaching your hair</li>
            <li> it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it help me good&lt;br /&gt;it look not bad.&lt;br /&gt;but the color is not good&lt;br /&gt;~~~ ~ ~ ~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic for years now and I&#x27;ve had good luck with it so far. I bleach my hair with Blonde Brilliance first and then put the dye in. Sometimes I apply heat to get the color working. I put a shower cap over it and leave it in for hours. It really soaks it up. I done purple haze this last time wanting a gradient effect from light to dark and it came out gorgeous. The color is brilliant and in the sun looks so dramatic. My natural hair is black so taking the color out is a b***h, but the bleach I use really does the job. The color will last longer if you use Wen, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve experienced at least. I have a hard job where after coming home you need a shower, so since I shower and wash my hair daily using the Wen really helps keep the color vibrant. It lasts maybe three weeks for me. The best way to get it out is to just bleach it for 5 mins and wash it out. Then you can start all over. This is just what works for me though, if you don&#x27;t want to damage your hair please don&#x27;t bleach it.</li>
            <li> It was a little slow to arrive, but no complaints other than that.</li>
            <li> I love love love this color. I was worried about buying a purple as I didn&#x27;t want one too dark or too cool toned. This is stunning, and fades into a pretty light lavender. Freshen after a second washing if you want to bring back the vibrancy. Looks best on light hair or it will look a bit muddy/dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching and dying my hair all sorts of colors for like 15 years now . . . Manic Panic was always a pretty solid brand, and I&#x27;ve stood by it for I think too long now. For the last year or two I have been trying not to lose faith in the brand, but . . . it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same formula or something. I&#x27;ve tried the \\&quot;amplified\\&quot; version with slightly better results, but miss the days when dumping the money for \\&quot;the good stuff\\&quot; yielded better results than some off walmart brand. Sadly, I think it&#x27;s time for this old bat to switch.  :&#x27;(  sorry manic panic</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair twice to get it to a nice pale blonde shade. Then I applied Manic Panic&#x27;s purple Haze to second day hair and left it in for 12 hours with heat from my hair dryer on and off.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a nice clean shade of light purple, but what I got was a weird pink-orange streaky MESS. I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair with other Manic Panic colors for years and never have I had a problem like this.&lt;br /&gt;Please, do NOT waste your money. If I could give it 0 stars I would.</li>
            <li> Manic Panic has a much better smell than most hair dyes. It goes on easily. I left the dye in for about four hours on natural dirty-blond hair, and it turned out more purply-brown than purple. Nothing disastrous, but not what I hoped. I&#x27;m sure it would work better on bleached or very light hair</li>
            <li> So when I received my package of manic panic and I opend my heart dropped it was alot smaller then I had thought. I was worried it would not be enough to saturate my hair as I have thick shortly below the shoulder length hair.  But I was Suprised that it completely covered my hair and I still have some left for touch up. So you are definitely getting your money worth.  Now for color this type of purple has more of a indigo base it is dark but once I washed it, it had lightend up a bit and became a very pretty darker bright purple very happy with it.  Not I let my hair sit over not I wrapped it on saran wrap and put a plastic bag over to hold in the heat and rinsed with very cool water the next morning. Overall this product is very good and definitely will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Lasted less than a week before huge streaks started turning a hideous pink-gray.    If you have thick or long hair (or both, like me), be prepared to spend a lot of time and money each time. It took me four jars and five hours. The consistency makes it hard to spread and distribute evenly.    The color on my double process bleach was beautiful for the short time it lasted.</li>
            <li> Great color! Also vegan! If only my dictator mom hadn&#x27;t stolen it !</li>
            <li> I used this color on pre-lightened highlights that I have in my hair. They were dark brown at first but they over time, it lightened a couple of shades. The length of my hair is BSL (bra strap length) and it is also thick so I used two jars of this on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I washed my hair with a non-sulfate shampoo and let it air dry. *TIP* make sure your hair is detangled. it&#x27;ll make things easier once you start to apply the color.&lt;br /&gt;2. Divided my hair into four sections and applied the color section by section. (it took almost 2 hrs. :/) *TIP* use vaseline around the edges of your hair and on the back of your neck to prevent staining.*&lt;br /&gt;3. after the color process, i let it sit on my hair with a plastic cap on top for 2-3 hours so that it will be seen not only on the darkest parts of my hair (which is very dark brown/black), but also on the lighter areas. i used the heat from my blow dryer for about 5 minutes every hour to help it work more.&lt;br /&gt;4. rinse hair in cold water.&lt;br /&gt;5. style as wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair every two weeks so i haven&#x27;t really had to worry about it fading too much. it does bleed a bit when i use water based products on my hair but its not a whole lot. when i washed my hair, the color did wash out some but thats just the nature of semi-permanent dye. the color is more noticeable in sunlight and depending on the light indoors, it can look black or you can see color of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is a good option for those with natural african-american hair that want to color their hair without damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use this product again.  The first time I ever used this color, with proper bleaching and dye care, this product stayed in the hair for almost a month.  When I used this when I got it, the product didn&#x27;t last for a week after proper bleaching and washes.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the new formula.  This is the last time I use Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is vegan, which means it can be left in your hair as long as you so please without any negative effects. This helps the color stay in your hair longer, but when it was not bleached, leaving it in for a day or two did not do much.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for a while now, and this one has the truest purple color of them all and is very nice, but I would have to recommend that the hair be a lighter color before applying this product, or else it will only faintly show.</li>
            <li> I have had my hair every color you could think of and only used beyond the zone, but I would get frustrated when the color would fade soo quickly.  I just decided one day to use this manic panic purple haze, and oh my what a difference!  I only redo it once a month and it stays super purple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Bleach your hair!!  I have natural black hair, I beached it twice.  First I would bleach then put in a leave in conditioner then bleach a week later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo really good before you are going to put manic panic in your hair.  DO NOT USE CONDITIONER!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blow dry hair.  BONE DRY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let mine sit for 30 mins and rinsed it out until water was completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash hair with COLD COLD COLD water.</li>
            <li> I love the color and how tha brand is vegan&lt;br /&gt;But the jar is pretty small.They should make&lt;br /&gt;The jar bigger and more filled with product.&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT think the price should be that high&lt;br /&gt;for an itty bitty jar</li>
            <li> This is my go to hair color. This lasts long (maybe because of the redish/pinkish tinge it has to it) on my hair, and looks great. It fades out really nice as well. If you are someone, like me, who wants colored hair but doesn&#x27;t want to worry about touching it up every week, I&#x27;d go with this color, or a dark red. These look great at first, and actually look really nice when they are fading out.</li>
            <li> Worth it, great color.</li>
            <li> I wanted to add purple highlights to my light brown to dark brown hair. I did not bleach my hair before dying, and the purple still showed up quite nicely in my light brown hair. It also showed up in the dark brown hair as well but was obviously not as bold. However, after washing my hair only 5 times, in cold water and using color care shampoo, the purple faded greatly. I was saddened because the original tint was pretty but it didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! great product! been using the same brand for 10+ years! I love it I love it! I love it! Would *always* recommend a dark pillowcase for the first few weeks ;)</li>
            <li> Not bad,, doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I used this product for some highlights, and was expecting it to stay for several weeks. Not true... It lasted maybe 2 days before it faded into an ugly lavender shade. It was completely out by 5 days. Really dissappointing! So, if you never wash your hair, I guess it&#x27;d work. But for me, I&#x27;ll just have to find a more permanent dye.</li>
            <li> I wish it lasted longer, but very happy with the results. I think that if I had made more of an effort to maximize the longevity of the color, it would have lasted longer, but I enjoyed each new shade of purple after a few washes. It&#x27;s cheap enough to re-apply when the color fades.</li>
            <li> The brand is an excellent on but this particular color starts to look grey after only a week an a half of coloring it, so unless you are ok with re-doing your color every other week I&#x27;d suggest choosing a different shade unless you had virgin hair before bleaching, you may have more luck if so, but I&#x27;ve used several colors and this is the only one that &#x27;greyed&#x27; on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used manic panic in my hair before (vampire red), but this color just seemed to fade to white every time I showered. The red had stayed in for weeks, maybe it was just the amplified version that last a lot longer. But this purple can&#x27;t compare. Really really disappointing. :(</li>
            <li> Alright I did everything it asked and then some, I waited 2 hours to wash out the dye, and well, it didn&#x27;t work out to well as expected, after your hair dries the dye is still gonna stick on everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that I bought Rockabilly blue, it just made my head semi blue and mostly black, never mind that this stuff gets all over me! I woke up the next day and my face was blue! Alright not totally blue but a tint of blue. To sum it up, this thing sucks. I think they paid the other people to write good reviews for this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> No matter what I did it washes out quickly, but it&#x27;s a great color</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed. I was expecting a lot because I had gotten it from Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply store so I assumed that it was great stuff. I really like the color and it was very purple for the first day. after 1 wash the \\&quot;semi-permanent\\&quot; dye was a completely different shade of purple. My hair was back to normal after 5 days. Going to try a different brand next time. I guess it&#x27;ll be fine if you&#x27;re doing it on a kid and only want it in for that long, but all together I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good. But when it says semi permanent, it really means &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not coming off your hair for at least 3 months&amp;#34; lol</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and easy to remove when you&#x27;re done :] The color came out so pretty even on my uneven hair (thanks to my usual brand of veg dye) &amp;#62;:| Also unlike my usual brand when I was done with the color I was able to lift it out nicely to redye over. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase more manic panic because of this. Also, this brand is cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I love Manic Panic but if I want longer lasting bright colour, I use a different brand.  Manic Panic&#x27;s colours are intense but I&#x27;ve found that they fade more quickly than Splat or Punky Colour.</li>
            <li> It washed out after a few days even after I let the sey sit for over an hour. Awful.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is lasting longer than the salon dye.</li>
            <li> My wife got this product, she has dark hair, she didn&#x27;t bleach it. The dye made her hair darker, not one hint of purple can be noticed.</li>
            <li> Washes out within a few days.</li>
            <li> I dyed mi hair and it lasted only 3 hairwashes I expected more, at least it didnt harm my hair</li>
            <li> okay, i used to swear by manic panic. i love the stuff. until i tried to do pink. it was splotchy, lasted one rinse and was barely visible even immediately after colouring. if you&#x27;re going to do pink. ion is so far better. however, i love love love the turquoise in manic panic. it lasted ages, was a beautiful colour and coloured evenly. i&#x27;ve used the purple as well and flamingo and neon green. all except the flamingo and pink were wonderful. best of luck and remember to use cold water! it keeps muuuch longer!</li>
            <li> didnt even last one wash and it was patchy, and i did follow all the recommended steps...very sad :(but it was a pretty color</li>
            <li> Washes out very very fast. Do not wash your hair more than once or twice a week with this dye in. Great color though.</li>
            <li> i stripped my hair and dyed it with this, it was a good price, it was shipped fast, the dye lasted about a month and i was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this color faded so fast on my hair...&lt;br /&gt;also, you need to know this color is suitable more purple than violet.</li>
            <li> I know it isn&#x27;t permanent but this should last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> All Tish and Snooky&#x27;s products are great.  I do my wife&#x27;s hair in Purple Haze ......  fun stuff!</li>
            <li> this has a nice color to it, and it doesn&#x27;t turn blue, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Got MP purple haze to put on my unbleached brown hair. 1st time I left in 40 min. washed out after two washes. So the 2nd time i left in in my hair for 5 hours...its looked awsome a week and 3 washes my bangs area has lightened up. everytime i wash my hair purple bubbles are everywhere..I still can&#x27;t scratch my head without getting purple under my nails.I dont think I will buy it again. I am going to try ION next.</li>
            <li> They (Manic Panic) Claim it can last up to 8 washing. My girlfriend has real light hair &amp; it looked great when first done. But even the next morning it was already fading &amp; I would say in under a week it was 90% gone even with just one wash with a color safe shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good only if you have blonde hair or bleach yours first.</li>
            <li> super pretty dark purple on the hair! i would recommend diluting it with a little bit of conditioner however as the first application i did was rather hard to work with and stained the tiles in my bathroom, the second application i did i diluted with conditioner and the splatters did not leave much of a stain, or at least no stains i couldnt scrub off</li>
            <li> Same as before, really, but again was a gift for my sister in law, and what can I say - she loves the stuff! . At my end: delivered on time and packaged really well, so again, many thanks to the supplier, you guys rock!</li>
