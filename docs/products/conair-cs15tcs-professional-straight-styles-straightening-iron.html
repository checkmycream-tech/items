    <ol>
            <li>The best hair straighteners</li>
            <li>But I will reccomend the Revelon Perfect Heat Straightener</li>
            <li>THEY WORK EXCELLENT</li>
            <li>it turns out great for me !</li>
            <li>i bought this straightener because everyone said it was wonderful</li>
            <li>My hair looks so great</li>
            <li>Follow my advise, and this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This iron is just great.  </li>
            <li>and it was at a great price...</li>
            <li>I think that for the money it is a great product</li>
            <li>this iron is good and it works for my frizzy and wavy hair</li>
            <li>BUT IT COULD BE BETTER!</li>
            <li>and It makes me very happy that its straight and managable.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair, and it is not thick or too frizzy, but it is awesome on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product for someone with a lot of wave or curl because like someone else said, it doesn&#x27;t get REAL hot unless it&#x27;s on for a good while.</li>
            <li>This iron is good if you have thinner hair and are just looking for a quick fix.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stuck with it now and won&#x27;t be returning it because I&#x27;ll be out even more shipping costs.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair, smooth, shiny, plus it heats up in one minute!</li>
            <li>THIS IS A OK PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S OK</li>
            <li>ANOTHER 1 AND WAIST TIME.MONEY.AND MORE SPACE</li>
            <li>and I was ulimately more pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li>but this one works :)</li>
            <li>and i just love it.  </li>
            <li>so it straightened it pretty good.</li>
            <li>this straightener works pretty good on my hair .</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really work too good with humidity .</li>
            <li>The comb on the top is a great idea because it combs your hair through right before the heat touches it which assures smooth straight hair with no frizz.  </li>
            <li>The comb is easy to remove</li>
            <li>It is good, but if you want your hair to be super sleek, I suggest going with a good ceramic flat iron</li>
            <li>I had used one before and it made my hair so fine.</li>
            <li>IF YOU WANT YOUR HAIR TO LOK HALFWAY DECENT!!!!  </li>
            <li>this iron doesn&#x27;t get very hot and it ripped out my hair!  </li>
            <li>It is no longer available, so they have substituted another model without pre-advising you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cheap tho..theres no dials to adjust the heat controls..and its made of cheap plastic...</li>
            <li>It doesnt heat up fast, plus it makes you hair look frizzy!!!</li>
            <li>So when i got this, I was excited to try it to see if it worked.  </li>
            <li>The only thing good about this item is that it is cheap.</li>
            <li>It was able to somewhat straighten my incredibly curly, thick hair</li>
            <li>I have wave in my hair and this product takes it right out!</li>
            <li>It is light weight, fast, and heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I own two other conair straighteners that work really well, which is why i thought this would be better, because it is an ugraded version of my favorite ceramic heat model.  </li>
            <li>the comb is a good idea and actually worked pretty well, but it fell out so often that one day it became permently lost.  </li>
            <li>so I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>but it made my hair very bushy!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this appliance and strongly recommend it to those with similar hair.  </li>
            <li>AND IT WAS NOT ALL RIGHT.</li>
            <li>This is a good iron to use if you just want to wear your hair down and not too bushy or curly.</li>
            <li>My results are super straight.  </li>
            <li>so, it was either much to hot</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d have to wait or go over the same spots many times.</li>
            <li>The comb attachment will cause a problem if you dont brush through your hair first.  </li>
            <li>its about the same price but works a lot better..</li>
            <li>this straightener works pretty good .. not the best , but not the worst : ) if your hair is similar , i recommend buying it !</li>
            <li>theirs is much thicker and more coarse than mine.  </li>
            <li>The whole process of doing my hair seems to take a long time but the iron gets very hot in like 5 mins and its super hot which saves me some time.  </li>
            <li>The handle is easy to grip (not so with most straighteners which feature clunky, thick</li>
            <li>I highly suggest Revlon or Hot Tools.</li>
            <li>so, it was burning my hair or not quite ready</li>
            <li>When my hair dries it is very curly and very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>but my hair doesnt seem as straight.  </li>
            <li>And to my surprise it really did.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY BOUGHT IT BECAUSE MY HAIR SWEATS ALOT,AND</li>
            <li>it really does straighten.</li>
            <li>if you want your hair to turn out straight</li>
            <li>This one just makes my hair straight</li>
            <li>i was very disapointed.</li>
            <li>it was semi straight</li>
            <li>so , over all this product works good on not too thick hair , not to curly hair , and not to wavy hair .  </li>
            <li>If your just looking to try out striaght hair on you, i reccomend this product because its a cheap way to see if you like striagt hair and if you like it you can buy a nicer flat iron.</li>
            <li>For those who live in areas with high humidity in the summer and extreme dryness in the winter, this product make your hair much more manageable in both climates.</li>
            <li>It does straighten your hair if its not thick</li>
            <li>and they normally have glass plates.</li>
            <li>This iron definently won&#x27;t get all of the kinks out very quickly, depending on your hair texture it could take up to an hour and a half to get it just the way you like it.</li>
            <li>I had to go over sections of my hair more than 10 times to get it at least semi straight.</li>
            <li>I purchased this flat iron a few months ago, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>So if you have thick hair, spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality.</li>
            <li>I have super thick, super curly hair and this is the only iron that provided LASTING results; it lasted until I washed my hair (a full week) without any touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>all the other reviews are true...</li>
            <li>like , if u just straightened your hair and u walk out the door in a very high humidity place .. your hair may get frizzy and a bit curly , but that only sometimes happens .</li>
            <li>The iron took a long time to get hot and, there were no heat settings</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t used it without the comb so far.  </li>
            <li>IT SOLD OUT COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally frizzy, wavy, AND bushy.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Conair Professional Straightening Iron and let me tell you</li>
            <li>BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T REALLY MAKE YOUR HAIR FEEL FLAT</li>
            <li>The comb on the side really helps with straightening the hair so if you are in the market for a flat iron, I would definitly pick this one, or one with a comb attatched.</li>
            <li>However, it took three times as long to straighten with this device than my older model.  </li>
            <li>The one I received is made of cheap lightweight plastic and does not handle thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I WAS GOING TO GET THE OTHER LARGE STRAIGHTNER BY CONAIR</li>
            <li>it does heat up quickly, and does getthe base of your hair pretty smooth, but it NEVER worked to straighten my ends, they were always left wwavy.</li>
            <li>This straightener is great for thin hair... but not for thick.</li>
            <li>it takes a little while to get hot</li>
            <li>I have pretty much already stright, thin hair</li>
            <li>This straightener is somewhat heavy to hold and the plates do not get hot enough.</li>

            <li> I got all of my hair straight in less than 1/2 hour!  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for products that will straighten my hair for as long as I can remember and this is the only appliance that works on my super thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> its feature are not very good the hot plate is open for burn.</li>
            <li> I take small segments at a time and instantly have straight, manageable hair that lasts until I wash my hair again.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wavy hair, and when I use this product, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be hot enough to get all the kinks out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was not good on their hair, and maybe they needed Hot Tools (which is the hottest, but the plates are NOT smooth - a lot of hair pulling!).  </li>
            <li> I COULD MAKE IT FLAT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS.</li>
            <li> I bought the flat iron about a month ago</li>
            <li> I tried the more expensive straighteners (I bought a Jilbere one for 80 bucks!)</li>
            <li> I want everyone to be careful when using this flat iron.</li>
            <li> But if you have thick hair like me, i suggest upgrading to a more expensive, top-quality flat iron that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I add some gel and hair oil, dry it and then straighten it.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a pain to blow dry.</li>
            <li> It did not stay straight either.&amp;#60;br /&amp;#62; WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and frizzy when i straightend it with the Conair Professional Straightening Iron</li>
            <li> I myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy.</li>
            <li> Considering the low price and the results for my hair which is medium thick and wavy I would recomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Definitely a must for girls with thick, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> My daughter set this down on the chair while doing her sister hair and burnt the chair.</li>
            <li> I have a previous straightener i&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> ALL MY OTHER ONES WERE TO SMALL</li>
            <li> AND I ALREADY HAVE 3 PRODUCTS-2 STRAIGHTNERS THAT ARE LITTLE AND</li>
            <li> i have thin/wavy/a little bit curly hair .</li>
            <li> So please don&#x27;t waste your money on the Conair Straightener, it&#x27;s practically a toy.  </li>
            <li> out there are about 1&amp;quot; thick or less</li>
            <li> so i have wavy, sort of thick hair, and i figured that a hair iron could handle it?</li>
            <li> If you do decide to get this one keep in mind that it is heavy- my arm got tired after about 5 minutes trying to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definatly not good for people with really thick curly hair..</li>
            <li> Maybe it will work on slightly wavy hair, but for wavy to curly I definately do not recommend UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES that you buy this item!!!  </li>
            <li> this straightener pulls my hair, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot, it&#x27;s kind-of uncomfortable to hold, and it DOESN&#x27;T STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> The trick to this one is to take SMALL sections of hair if yours is thick or coarse, and don&#x27;t use ANY hair products until you are done - the moisture is curly hairs worst enemy in this process.  </li>

            <li> This is a good iron to use if you just want to wear your hair down and not too bushy or curly. I have thick curly/wavy hair, and when I use this product, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be hot enough to get all the kinks out of my hair.  It is good, but if you want your hair to be super sleek, I suggest going with a good ceramic flat iron</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think so. I bought this straightner because I have some curls around my face that never go away, even when I blow-dry my hair stright. The iron took a long time to get hot and, there were no heat settings so, it was either much to hot so, it was burning my hair or not quite ready so I&#x27;d have to wait or go over the same spots many times. I have pretty much already stright, thin hair but, it didn&#x27;t do well for me. I  say, if you&#x27;re going to spend the money, get something else.</li>
            <li> This straightener is great for thin hair... but not for thick. I myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy. The best hair straighteners out there are about 1&amp;quot; thick or less and they normally have glass plates. So if you have thick hair, spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality.</li>
            <li> This straightener has been one of the worst I have ever used. It didn&#x27;t straighten at all. I had to go over sections of my hair more than 10 times to get it at least semi straight. It did not stay straight either.&amp;#60;br /&amp;#62; WASTE OF MONEY!!! DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this item if you are expecting to receive the product as shown.  It is no longer available, so they have substituted another model without pre-advising you. The one I received is made of cheap lightweight plastic and does not handle thick hair.  That is why I was looking for the comb feature.  I&#x27;m stuck with it now and won&#x27;t be returning it because I&#x27;ll be out even more shipping costs.  I&#x27;ll probably just donate it to a resale shop.</li>
            <li> I recently got this item from Target in hopes of having straighter hair.  When my hair dries it is very curly and very frizzy.  I have a previous straightener i&#x27;ve used but my hair doesnt seem as straight.  So when i got this, I was excited to try it to see if it worked.  And to my surprise it really did.  I have had my hair relaxed before and it looks just about the same!!  I add some gel and hair oil, dry it and then straighten it.  The whole process of doing my hair seems to take a long time but the iron gets very hot in like 5 mins and its super hot which saves me some time.  My hair looks so great and It makes me very happy that its straight and managable.  The comb attachment will cause a problem if you dont brush through your hair first.  The comb is easy to remove but I haven&#x27;t used it without the comb so far.  I can&#x27;t think of a problem I have had yet with it so I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This straightener is a definate no! It doesnt heat up fast, plus it makes you hair look frizzy!!! It takes me 30 minutes to get ym hair done. But I will reccomend the Revelon Perfect Heat Straightener RV059C. It makes your hair, smooth, shiny, plus it heats up in one minute! I could get my hair done in 6 minutes including the heat up time. So please, dont buy this conair straightener, it doesnt work at all. Save you money.</li>
            <li> The only thing good about this item is that it is cheap. It was able to somewhat straighten my incredibly curly, thick hair but that was only after going over the same sections of hair numerous times. In the end my hair would still come out somewhat curled, frizzy and puffy. This straightener is somewhat heavy to hold and the plates do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> This cost me $10 on sale at Rite Aid. I was kinda skeptical about buying it but I wasnt as disapointed as I thought. It&#x27;s definatly not good for people with really thick curly hair..my hair isnt so bad so it straightened it pretty good. It&#x27;s really cheap tho..theres no dials to adjust the heat controls..and its made of cheap plastic...all the other reviews are true...I would recommend the Revlon Hair Straightener..its about the same price but works a lot better..</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron a few months ago, and I love it!  I have curly hair, and it is not thick or too frizzy, but it is awesome on my hair.  My results are super straight.  I also have sisters that have curly hair and theirs is much thicker and more coarse than mine.  At first I thought it was not good on their hair, and maybe they needed Hot Tools (which is the hottest, but the plates are NOT smooth - a lot of hair pulling!).  The trick to this one is to take SMALL sections of hair if yours is thick or coarse, and don&#x27;t use ANY hair products until you are done - the moisture is curly hairs worst enemy in this process.  Follow my advise, and this is a great product.  Oh, and the time it takes to heat up...hello - turn it on 5 min before you plan on fixing your hair!!</li>
            <li> This iron is just great.  It is light weight, fast, and heats up very quickly.  I got all of my hair straight in less than 1/2 hour!  The comb on the top is a great idea because it combs your hair through right before the heat touches it which assures smooth straight hair with no frizz.  Considering the low price and the results for my hair which is medium thick and wavy I would recomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A OK PRODUCT. BUT IT COULD BE BETTER! I BROUGHT THIS ITEM AT WALMART FOR 13 DOLLARS BECAUSE I NEEDED A BIG STRAIGHTNER FOR MY HAIR. ALL MY OTHER ONES WERE TO SMALL SO I BOUGHT THIS ONE. IT&#x27;S OK BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T REALLY MAKE YOUR HAIR FEEL FLAT ALL THE WAY. I REALLY BOUGHT IT BECAUSE MY HAIR SWEATS ALOT,AND JUS INCASE WHEN I GET MY HAIR DONE I COULD MAKE IT FLAT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. BUT I GOT MY HAIR DONE AND USED IT AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS AND IT WAS NOT ALL RIGHT. I WAS MAD!!! I WAS GOING TO GET THE OTHER LARGE STRAIGHTNER BY CONAIR BUT THEY HAD SOLD OUT SO I SEEN THAT 1 AND GRAB IT B4 IT SOLD OUT COMPLETELY. DONT GET THIS PRODUCT SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET ANOTHER CONAIR STRAIGHTNER!!!!! BECAUSE NOW I HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER 1 AND WAIST TIME.MONEY.AND MORE SPACE AND I ALREADY HAVE 3 PRODUCTS-2 STRAIGHTNERS THAT ARE LITTLE AND A CURLING IRON THEY WORK EXCELLENT BUT JUS NEEDED A BIGGER 1.</li>
            <li> I tried the more expensive straighteners (I bought a Jilbere one for 80 bucks!) and I was ulimately more pleased with this one.  The handle is easy to grip (not so with most straighteners which feature clunky, thick handles)and it really does straighten. I have super thick, super curly hair and this is the only iron that provided LASTING results; it lasted until I washed my hair (a full week) without any touch-ups.  Definitely a must for girls with thick, frizzy hair that&#x27;s a pain to blow dry.</li>
            <li> this straightener works pretty good on my hair . i have thin/wavy/a little bit curly hair . it heats up in 4 minutes. it doesn&#x27;t really work too good with humidity . like , if u just straightened your hair and u walk out the door in a very high humidity place .. your hair may get frizzy and a bit curly , but that only sometimes happens . if you want your hair to turn out straight i recommend u straightening your hair at night( wash hair before straightening ) , and the next day straighten your hair again ( without washing ). it turns out great for me ! so , over all this product works good on not too thick hair , not to curly hair , and not to wavy hair .  .. this straightener works pretty good .. not the best , but not the worst : ) if your hair is similar , i recommend buying it !</li>
            <li> The product arrived incomplete, does not come with Removable teeth        Arrivals in a pink color, very ugly</li>
            <li> I want everyone to be careful when using this flat iron. its feature are not very good the hot plate is open for burn. My daughter set this down on the chair while doing her sister hair and burnt the chair. Also I was doing my daughters hair and dropped the iron it landed with the plates on the side onto my leg and I have 2nd degree burns. I want to write the ConAir company but I don&#x27;t have the information.</li>
            <li> so i have wavy, sort of thick hair, and i figured that a hair iron could handle it? i guess i was wrong...this iron doesn&#x27;t get very hot and it ripped out my hair!  it got caught in between the plasic part and the actuall straitening part.  the comb is a good idea and actually worked pretty well, but it fell out so often that one day it became permently lost.  it does heat up quickly, and does getthe base of your hair pretty smooth, but it NEVER worked to straighten my ends, they were always left wwavy.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS STRAIGHTENER IF YOU WANT YOUR HAIR TO LOK HALFWAY DECENT!!!!  I own two other conair straighteners that work really well, which is why i thought this would be better, because it is an ugraded version of my favorite ceramic heat model.  However, it took three times as long to straighten with this device than my older model.  Maybe it will work on slightly wavy hair, but for wavy to curly I definately do not recommend UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES that you buy this item!!!  &lt;br /&gt;  PS: DON&#x27;T DO IT!!!!</li>
            <li> This iron is good if you have thinner hair and are just looking for a quick fix. But if you have thick hair like me, i suggest upgrading to a more expensive, top-quality flat iron that will last you a long time. If you do decide to get this one keep in mind that it is heavy- my arm got tired after about 5 minutes trying to straighten my hair. If your just looking to try out striaght hair on you, i reccomend this product because its a cheap way to see if you like striagt hair and if you like it you can buy a nicer flat iron. This iron definently won&#x27;t get all of the kinks out very quickly, depending on your hair texture it could take up to an hour and a half to get it just the way you like it.</li>
            <li> i bought this straightener because everyone said it was wonderful and it was at a great price...BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECIEVING!! this straightener pulls my hair, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot, it&#x27;s kind-of uncomfortable to hold, and it DOESN&#x27;T STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> I recently bought the Conair Straightener and it did not work at all.  My hair is naturally frizzy, wavy, AND bushy.  So when I applied it to my hair it did not do anythingto it!  So then I bought the Revlon straightener...now that works!  Immidiately I could see a difference.  So please don&#x27;t waste your money on the Conair Straightener, it&#x27;s practically a toy.  I highly suggest Revlon or Hot Tools.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for products that will straighten my hair for as long as I can remember and this is the only appliance that works on my super thick, curly hair.  I take small segments at a time and instantly have straight, manageable hair that lasts until I wash my hair again.  I absolutely love this appliance and strongly recommend it to those with similar hair.  PS-For those who live in areas with high humidity in the summer and extreme dryness in the winter, this product make your hair much more manageable in both climates.</li>
            <li> I have wave in my hair and this product takes it right out! It not only straightens my hair but it also makes it shinier and takes 99% of the friz away. The comb on the side really helps with straightening the hair so if you are in the market for a flat iron, I would definitly pick this one, or one with a comb attatched. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product for someone with a lot of wave or curl because like someone else said, it doesn&#x27;t get REAL hot unless it&#x27;s on for a good while.</li>
            <li> this iron is good and it works for my frizzy and wavy hair it takes a little while to get hot but it works  well and i would recomand a V5 one instead of this but this one works :)</li>
            <li> I bought the flat iron about a month ago and i just love it.  I had used one before and it made my hair so fine. This one just makes my hair straight but it still has body to it.  I bought another one about a week ago and sent one to my sister and she loves it too.  I think that for the money it is a great product and you should try this one.</li>
            <li> I bought the Conair Professional Straightening Iron and let me tell you i was very disapointed. My hair is really thick and frizzy when i straightend it with the Conair Professional Straightening Iron it was semi straight but it made my hair very bushy!! It does straighten your hair if its not thick but i dont recommed it to people that have hair like me!!!!!!!!!</li>
