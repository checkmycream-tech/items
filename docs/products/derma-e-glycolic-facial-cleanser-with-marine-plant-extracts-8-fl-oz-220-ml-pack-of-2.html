            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This cleanser works great for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and a great value for your money.</li>
            <li>I like the pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>But, I think it is a good backup for continual glowing.</li>
            <li>It has a very refreshing and pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s overpowering and doesn&#x27;t bother my sinuses.</li>
            <li>When I indulge in skin care products, I like anticipating delicious scents and rich textures.</li>
            <li>its awesome and it perfect for my combination skin and my acne is finally starting to go away!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>the passing years leave their mark, but they are just signs of the love given and received!</li>
            <li>This cleanser is amazing.</li>
            <li>unscented&lt;br /&gt;-its feels nice going on</li>
            <li>This is a nice cleanser, however it doesn&#x27;t remove eye make-up that well....</li>
            <li>I bought this once before and liked it.</li>
            <li>I then use a warm washcloth to massage it off and then rinse.</li>
            <li>This cleanser seems to do a nice job of it without the grainy texture.</li>
            <li>Your face has served you well for so many years, so be nice to it and quit scrubbing off the protective outer layer of skin which protects the under layer.......</li>
            <li>it came right away and is a great exfoliate also</li>
            <li>I have been using it over a month and haven&#x27;t noticed any breathtaking results, but it does clean my skin very well and is non-irritating.</li>
            <li>My skin feels wonderful and not dry after washing.</li>
            <li>If you are just using it for your face, and applying it just with your hands, I guess it would be okay.</li>
            <li>but then again, most cleansers don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting more of an mechanical exfoliatent but perhaps because it is pH balanced the glycolic acid has been nullified.</li>
            <li>, anyways i have tried SO many products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is just a great product thats incredibly gentle, brightening, throughly cleansing, non-drying and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>My night cream absorbs better.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser</li>
            <li>so I have to be more diligent with my moisturizing than before.  </li>
            <li>Really makes  skin feel  good.</li>
            <li>Feels a bit slimy but it is fine and washing off is easy.</li>
            <li>My teenage son uses this because he couldn&#x27;t find a solution for blackheads and breakouts and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working fine</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Face has been blemish free since I started using the product.  </li>
            <li>Great product, it dries skin so a moisturizer is absolutely necessary after you use it.</li>
            <li>Neither stripping it of moisture nor leaving any residue, this cleanser leaves my face completely smooth.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, its a good product and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and clean after using.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li>Love the way I apply it first, add water, wash, and rinse.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap compared to the other products and the fact that it has natural marine plant extracts makes it even better!!!</li>
            <li>It make your face feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>I love that they sell this product at a great price and don&#x27;t waste a lot of frills on the package.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try--gentle, but a thorough, exfoliating clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as Anthony, but it doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything much at all.  </li>
            <li>It will not completely get rid of the makeup I put on, which means the cleanser is not too strong and that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I like it overall and feel that it does a good job cleaning my skin.  </li>
            <li>My face feels much smoother and absorbs moisturizers much better.</li>
            <li>I began using this while I was pregnant, to avoid having to use medication.</li>
            <li>Product does an exceptional job of cleaning skin, deep cleans the pores.</li>
            <li>At night, I will use a mild toner to remove all make-up.</li>
            <li>clean, moisturize and protect it and smile, smile, smile......</li>
            <li>It is safe, has natural ingredients and works!</li>
            <li>So to sum this all up, makes your skin super smooth, but doesnt really affect your acne problem.</li>
            <li>I now rarely have this problem.</li>
            <li>I am trying many cleansers for my adult acne.</li>
            <li>So far, I have been satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>honestly, i think before u buy this on amazon to just check ur local walgreens/cvs</li>
            <li>It very gently removes dead skin, leaves face smooth and clean and ready for next treatment....serum, moisturizer, sunscreen, make up.....whatever you are going to apply after this cleanser will work better since you have created a nice, clean and smooth surface for it to adhere to.  </li>
            <li>first off, I am 59 year old, natural redhead with fair skin.....</li>
            <li>I currenty use other Derma E products and have been very satisfied with their results.</li>
            <li>gentle, gentle, gentle is key to great mature skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my skin and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night and first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I need to get the whole starter kit!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it though to anyone with acne because it does make your face feel better throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This understated face wash simply cleans my skin better than any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My skin stays bright, and clear with pores extremely reduced.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found some of the old formulation online.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s improved my skin tone and texture, but it hasn&#x27;t worsened it.  </li>
            <li>not anything like bottle I bought at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle but thorough cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It has really improved the quality of my skin (hyperpigmentation and acne scars).</li>
            <li>Really like this face wash.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser</li>
            <li>This face wash doesn&#x27;t have much aroma; it&#x27;s not creamy and doesn&#x27;t lather.</li>
            <li>Infact, I dont have any white heads right now!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was looking for a product that cleansed my face well but left it feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>At less than half the price its a great deal.  </li>
            <li>worth sending back, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal with an oily T-zone.</li>
            <li>I started to get extremely dry winter skin with occasional break outs and this helped better than any cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I live and swear by this cleanser.</li>
            <li>saw a new formulation in a store</li>
            <li>I usually use eye makeup remover first and then apply this cleanser to thoroughly clean my face.  </li>
            <li>This face wash has helped clear up my pregnancy acne.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after using it</li>
            <li>(BTW, I am between 45 and 55 years old.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m such a product junkie and have tried way too many ranging from drug store to expensive and finally found the right one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and soothing on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Bare minerals caused me to break out in hives (although I didnt know it until I took it off, it conceals that well)</li>
            <li>I tried this facial cleanser after researching natural products and decided on derma e.</li>
            <li>It does not feel dry even though this is a wash for normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Looking for a natural facial cleanser for my old dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Derma e  does not dry out my face</li>
            <li>This cleanser actually helps dissolve the dead skin cells, preventing pore clogging build up, thus preventing break-outs &amp; revealing fresh, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with a high end beauty cleanser to create a little foaming action.</li>
            <li>Well, i had high hopes for theism product based on other reviews…&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and used to have dry flakey patches on my nose.</li>
            <li>This is a very mild cleansing product that reduced deep wrinkles in approximately four uses.</li>

            <li> The bottle was bigger than i expected and I like the cap mechanism it has.</li>
            <li> I have found products that dry up break-outs</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> Put on dry skin then use water to wash in.</li>
            <li> I have had problems in the past with natural products.</li>
            <li> You rub it on a dry face and then wet to rinse off.  </li>
            <li> I have rosecea and have been afraid to use products that are too strong.  </li>
            <li> It does smell a little like baby powder or just weird smelling flowers, not that big of a fan, but it really does a good job of smoothing out your skin and pealing off all the dead and dirty skin cells on the surface...</li>
            <li> I used to use Anthony Glycolic Face Cleanser, but after they stopped making the large pump, it was starting to get too expensive.  </li>
            <li> My biggest problem is dead skin cells not shedding properly.</li>
            <li> and I have had absolutely no signs of irritation, redness, bumps, etc.</li>
            <li> My skin is so weird its dry first and foremost</li>
            <li> This cleanser cleans my skin without leaving it tight or dry.  </li>
            <li> apply this on dry skin morning and evening, add a little water and massage over face, neck and chest area.</li>
            <li> It seems a little bland and just sits on your skin, never seeming to penetrate.</li>
            <li> Some products leave your face feeling tight and stripped of all moisture.  </li>
            <li> Gentle,non-oily and does not leave my face feeling tight.</li>
            <li> have little to no wrinkles, but the dreaded &amp;#34;sagging&amp;#34; has begun a little.</li>
            <li> It is also a little stronger</li>
            <li> This  did not clean my face and, left behind residue.</li>
            <li> you have allergies, dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> After about a week, I could feel the dead cells scub off my face.  </li>
            <li> i was personally looking for a product that would affect the acne that is deeper down in my skin, but this definitely did help a lot of the bad inflammation and whiteheads i had.</li>
            <li> The secret is to follow the directions and use it on a dry face before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> I had serious pains on my infected areas on my face, and this helped tone down the redness and pain.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when trying products, but would highly recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> Glycolic products usually don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but this one was a bit of a problem.</li>
            <li> I cannot use scrubs, harsh chemicals to exfoliate since I have thinning, delicate, prone to broken capillaries skin.....but needed to somehow help my skin shed the flakiness around the nose and aid in cell turnover, etc.</li>
            <li> An exfoliating scrub made it worse, lotions and masks did nothing to help.</li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical, it leaves your skin supple and hydrated.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a bit weird for me to use.  </li>
            <li> and I had just bought the wrong item.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product for my skin and use it daily.  I was having a recurring problem with ingrown hairs on my chin and neck, since going through menopause.  This is only product that has helped me.  I now rarely have this problem.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing. I started to get extremely dry winter skin with occasional break outs and this helped better than any cleanser I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m such a product junkie and have tried way too many ranging from drug store to expensive and finally found the right one! Definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li> Well, i had high hopes for theism product based on other reviews…&lt;br /&gt;the good:&lt;br /&gt;-its unscented&lt;br /&gt;-its feels nice going on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bad:&lt;br /&gt;-i couldn&#x27;t get it to wash off&lt;br /&gt;-my skin felt slimy until i used a skin toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not worth sending back, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I use this product daily during my nigh time routine.</li>
            <li> Ordered this online because I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in store. I have found products that dry up break-outs but the flakes of skin would just remain stuck on the surface for a long time, clogging my pores &amp; repeating the problem. My biggest problem is dead skin cells not shedding properly. This cleanser actually helps dissolve the dead skin cells, preventing pore clogging build up, thus preventing break-outs &amp; revealing fresh, younger looking skin. I am very skeptical when trying products, but would highly recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> Use it once a week.  Really makes  skin feel  good.</li>
            <li> I began using this while I was pregnant, to avoid having to use medication. I&#x27;m still off of my rosacea meds, and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> My teenage son uses this because he couldn&#x27;t find a solution for blackheads and breakouts and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This is a great face cleaner.  It make your face feel so clean.  I use it at night and first thing in the morning.  I like it, also because&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> This soap has no lubrication.  It also does not foam or sud.  If you are just using it for your face, and applying it just with your hands, I guess it would be okay.</li>
            <li> Pleasant to the skin!</li>
            <li> This is a nice cleanser, however it doesn&#x27;t remove eye make-up that well....but then again, most cleansers don&#x27;t.  I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s improved my skin tone and texture, but it hasn&#x27;t worsened it.  I&#x27;m up in the air on whether or not I&#x27;ll buy this specific cleanser again...I might try another one of their products.</li>
            <li> Looking for a natural facial cleanser for my old dry skin.  Very pleased with this product.  Love the way I apply it first, add water, wash, and rinse.  Goes on smooth and silky.  My skin feels wonderful and not dry after washing.</li>
            <li> This face wash has helped clear up my pregnancy acne. It is safe, has natural ingredients and works! I highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> This facial wash reminds me of Cetaphil.  You rub it on a dry face and then wet to rinse off.  I like it overall and feel that it does a good job cleaning my skin.  My skin feels smooth and clean after using.  It does not feel dry even though this is a wash for normal to oily skin.  I like the ingredients as well.</li>
            <li> Smelled off....not anything like bottle I bought at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> I am trying many cleansers for my adult acne. It&#x27;s working fine but after this bottle is done I will go back to the mud wash.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of an mechanical exfoliatent but perhaps because it is pH balanced the glycolic acid has been nullified. Either way not what I was looking for at all. My skin is normal with an oily T-zone. This  did not clean my face and, left behind residue. I will keep looking.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after using it but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with bumps. It seems like my face got use to the product so I still use it but I alternate with another product.</li>
            <li> While I do prefer cleansers that create a lather, this one does not. It has a creamy texture and kinda feels like it absorbs into your skin - almost like a lotion. It has a very refreshing and pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s overpowering and doesn&#x27;t bother my sinuses. I have been using it over a month and haven&#x27;t noticed any breathtaking results, but it does clean my skin very well and is non-irritating. It doesn&#x27;t do a thing for acne or breakouts though.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle but thorough cleanser.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  I like the pleasant scent.  My mother (age 69), my daughter (age 20) and I (age 47) all use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Product exceeded my expectations.  Will become a staple in my house. Although I was skeptical, it leaves your skin supple and hydrated.</li>
            <li> excellent cleanser. can be drying so use moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li> I had used this product for a month and had not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> This product is for you!!!! I need to get the whole starter kit! Each season brings changes to your skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was looking for a product that cleansed my face well but left it feeling smooth and soft.  Some products leave your face feeling tight and stripped of all moisture.  Derma e  does not dry out my face and I have had absolutely no signs of irritation, redness, bumps, etc.</li>
            <li> The bottle was bigger than i expected and I like the cap mechanism it has. It does smell a little like baby powder or just weird smelling flowers, not that big of a fan, but it really does a good job of smoothing out your skin and pealing off all the dead and dirty skin cells on the surface...i was personally looking for a product that would affect the acne that is deeper down in my skin, but this definitely did help a lot of the bad inflammation and whiteheads i had. Infact, I dont have any white heads right now! So to sum this all up, makes your skin super smooth, but doesnt really affect your acne problem. Definitely recommend it though to anyone with acne because it does make your face feel better throughout the day. I had serious pains on my infected areas on my face, and this helped tone down the redness and pain. Very cheap compared to the other products and the fact that it has natural marine plant extracts makes it even better!!!</li>
            <li> I learned this product from one of those websites that rate low toxic cosmetic products.  I have been using it for a couple of years.  (BTW, I am between 45 and 55 years old.)  My face doesn&#x27;t feel the tightness after using it.  It will not completely get rid of the makeup I put on, which means the cleanser is not too strong and that is a good thing.  I usually use eye makeup remover first and then apply this cleanser to thoroughly clean my face.  So far, I have been satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very mild cleansing product that reduced deep wrinkles in approximately four uses.</li>
            <li> Product does an exceptional job of cleaning skin, deep cleans the pores.</li>
            <li> I live and swear by this cleanser. My skin stays bright, and clear with pores extremely reduced.My skin is so weird its dry first and foremost but i have ocasional breakouts of some sort(there tiny bumps that hurt and itch and turn into dry patches may b excema...?), anyways i have tried SO many products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these product reviews make NO sense.... why does a cleaser need to \\&quot;suds\\&quot; to be working?&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;i guess ït would be alright if you just are using it for your face\\&quot; (paraphased) ....um it IS a FACIAL cleanser!??! So yea that is what its being used for....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a great product thats incredibly gentle, brightening, throughly cleansing, non-drying and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give you skin a work week to adjust to the product and the folowing week you will reap the benifits.</li>
            <li> Bought this thinking it would help with blackheads and... mixed results. Supposedly glycolic acid is a miracle drug for blackheads but it didn&#x27;t work all that well for me. Seems to keep them in control though.</li>
            <li> I love that they sell this product at a great price and don&#x27;t waste a lot of frills on the package.  The smell is a bit blah, but not a big deal.  It is gel like and I am used to foaming washes so it&#x27;s a bit weird for me to use.  It is a great product, and it delivers what it promise.</li>
            <li> Face has been blemish free since I started using the product.  Great product, it dries skin so a moisturizer is absolutely necessary after you use it.</li>
            <li> Really great product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend raved about this product, so I decided to risk it and try it out. I have had problems in the past with natural products. Bare minerals caused me to break out in hives (although I didnt know it until I took it off, it conceals that well) This product is no exception. I&#x27;m breaking out like a teenager! Come to find out, it makes my girlfriend break out too, but she just figured it was suppose to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have allergies, dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this once before and liked it. This was not the same thing. This was more like cold cream in liquid form. I actually broke out using it.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin. Put on dry skin then use water to wash in. Feels a bit slimy but it is fine and washing off is easy.</li>
            <li> This cleanser cleans my skin without leaving it tight or dry.  I currenty use other Derma E products and have been very satisfied with their results.</li>
            <li> Works really well, removes dead skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. It has really improved the quality of my skin (hyperpigmentation and acne scars). It&#x27;s gentle and soothing on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> i got this at a walgreens or something like that. i love it! its awesome and it perfect for my combination skin and my acne is finally starting to go away! yes! honestly, i think before u buy this on amazon to just check ur local walgreens/cvs but seriously awesome face wash</li>
            <li> This is one of the only facial washes I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or dry my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a new formulation in a store and I had tried it and I broke out.  Luckily I found some of the old formulation online.  Maybe I was mistaken and they didn&#x27;t change the formula and I had just bought the wrong item.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and used to have dry flakey patches on my nose. An exfoliating scrub made it worse, lotions and masks did nothing to help. This cleanser saved me! Give it a try--gentle, but a thorough, exfoliating clean. My night cream absorbs better.</li>
            <li> I have rosecea and have been afraid to use products that are too strong.  This cleanser works great for me.  The secret is to follow the directions and use it on a dry face before rinsing.  After about a week, I could feel the dead cells scub off my face.  My face feels much smoother and absorbs moisturizers much better.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a great value for your money.</li>
            <li> first off, I am 59 year old, natural redhead with fair skin..... have little to no wrinkles, but the dreaded &amp;#34;sagging&amp;#34; has begun a little. I tried this facial cleanser after researching natural products and decided on derma e. I cannot use scrubs, harsh chemicals to exfoliate since I have thinning, delicate, prone to broken capillaries skin.....but needed to somehow help my skin shed the flakiness around the nose and aid in cell turnover, etc. I love this cleanser and I&#x27;ve tried tons of different ones over the years....yes, I&#x27;m a vain-iac, I&#x27;ll admit it!&lt;br /&gt;I apply this on dry skin morning and evening, add a little water and massage over face, neck and chest area. I then use a warm washcloth to massage it off and then rinse. At night, I will use a mild toner to remove all make-up. I then follow with any one of derma e excellent moisturizers. I do not use this cleaner to remove eye-makeup. This cleanser has made a big difference in my skin! It very gently removes dead skin, leaves face smooth and clean and ready for next treatment....serum, moisturizer, sunscreen, make up.....whatever you are going to apply after this cleanser will work better since you have created a nice, clean and smooth surface for it to adhere to.  It is not foamy, perfume-y or stringent.....but at my age, I cannot tolerate those things anymore......gentle, gentle, gentle is key to great mature skin. Your face has served you well for so many years, so be nice to it and quit scrubbing off the protective outer layer of skin which protects the under layer.......clean, moisturize and protect it and smile, smile, smile......the passing years leave their mark, but they are just signs of the love given and received!</li>
            <li> Really like this face wash.  Gentle,non-oily and does not leave my face feeling tight.</li>
            <li> I used to use Anthony Glycolic Face Cleanser, but after they stopped making the large pump, it was starting to get too expensive.  Researching on Amazon, I decided to go with this.  At less than half the price its a great deal.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as Anthony, but it doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything much at all.  It is also a little stronger so I have to be more diligent with my moisturizing than before.  Otherwise, its a good product and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I Like using this product. Keep in my there is no foam or suds. But, I think it is a good backup for continual glowing. I mixed it with a high end beauty cleanser to create a little foaming action.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser it came right away and is a great exfoliate also</li>
            <li> This face wash doesn&#x27;t have much aroma; it&#x27;s not creamy and doesn&#x27;t lather. It seems a little bland and just sits on your skin, never seeming to penetrate. When I indulge in skin care products, I like anticipating delicious scents and rich textures. Not here. This understated face wash simply cleans my skin better than any I&#x27;ve used. Neither stripping it of moisture nor leaving any residue, this cleanser leaves my face completely smooth. An excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have already written a review for this product!&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily and would recommend it to all, men and women!</li>
            <li> Looking for a facial cleanser that is made without chemicals but has ingredients that turn over skin cells. This cleanser seems to do a nice job of it without the grainy texture. I would recommend and would buy again. No problems with delivery.</li>
            <li> Glycolic products usually don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but this one was a bit of a problem. I&#x27;ll have to go back to Mario Badescu or NeoStrata products.</li>
