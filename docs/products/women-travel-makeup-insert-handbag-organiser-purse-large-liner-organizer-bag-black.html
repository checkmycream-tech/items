            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>, I honestly had forgotten I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>The bag is not of nice material, but since it inside the bag the look to me doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>But I liked.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really liked them.</li>

            <li>This is very light weight, does not stand alone.</li>
            <li>Great for large totes.</li>
            <li>Many pockets to store things.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t seem to add more weight (not noticeable), but did added some bulk.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, but appears it will be perfect for dividing several one-compartment satchels I use.</li>
            <li>and  I am able to keep all my stuff inside my purse organized and in it&#x27;s place.  </li>
            <li>hope the sellers are able to improve on this.</li>
            <li>I love this thing..</li>
            <li>For 4 bucks i wasn&#x27;t expecting something made of gold like most of you were.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for and this is better than i thought.</li>
            <li>Took more than a month to arrive.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>have been using mine for 6 weeks and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>love it because just holds everything</li>
            <li>Wish the sides were more sturdy as to stand alone in the purse.</li>
            <li>Going to get some more</li>
            <li>This has proven to be very effective for organizing my purse; it also makes it much easier to switch purses.</li>
            <li>Nice size fit easily in all my purses.</li>
            <li>I love that I can find what I need so quick and easy, and don&#x27;t have to worry about losing anything!</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to switch bags and not have to redo all my stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to take in and out of purses and holds quite a bit.</li>
            <li>With large purses it is so nice to have an organizer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s little, compare to what I had in mind, but it works perfectly anyway.</li>
            <li>I am happy with it as the price was very low and shipping was free</li>
            <li>Great in a big tote bag.</li>
            <li>The zippers are cheap plastic</li>
            <li>Light weight</li>
            <li>very useful item...</li>
            <li>Great organizer, keys, phone, pens and makeup all neatly put away not just loose in your handbag.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much I have bought them to give as gifts to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Good that the outside pockets are mesh</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>So convenient when you want to switch bags quickly</li>
            <li>did not have a good experience with how long it took to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I love it,helps me organize every thing in my purse,has limited colors,need more.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nicely made product, I just wish it would stand up in my purse instead of sagging to the bottom.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I have the blue and the color is nice.</li>
            <li>This organizer is exactly what I was looking for to arrange everything in my drawstring backpack.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>then it fell apart the first day</li>
            <li>I am one of the many women that carries a giant purse all the time</li>
            <li>Perfect organizer  for keeping items from going all over purse or small carry-on,  A little too large for the average purse but great for travel.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>For the price I think it is really well worth it and do note that I am taking a half point off for worrying about the zipper more than the zipper</li>
            <li>It was cheap though, and I didn&#x27;t need it for anything specific.  </li>
            <li>very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>but I am very statisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I really this organizer, makes it much easier to find everything in my purse.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really convient.</li>
            <li>The seams and zippers seem sturdy, and with so many pockets and pouches it has tons of uses/possibilities for personal, professional, or travel use.  </li>
            <li>With this handy pocket organizer, there&#x27;s no more fumbling for my wallet, phone, earbuds, etc.</li>
            <li>the bag has decent space, sized as described in the listing.  </li>
            <li>I ordered several in various colors, and will order more for gifts.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product as an organizer.</li>
            <li>Zipper doesn&#x27;t always work properly but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>She loved it and said she can now organize her makeup and save money since she didn&#x27;t have to buy a replacement for her broken lipstick etc.</li>
            <li>I knew I needed it and ended up ordering it right then and there before she even left my house!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order a couple more for my kids to keep books, small tablets, pencils, crayons, etc for car trips.</li>
            <li>The inner pouch is also pretty roomy, which I like.  </li>
            <li>The gray and yellow is pretty.</li>
            <li>It was a lot bigger than I expected and the material was really cheap</li>
            <li>however, I was surprised to find out they padded the dividing walls.  </li>
            <li>Handy to move purse, and personal small items, from one bag to the next.  </li>
            <li>Only issue is that one of the handles pulled out on the first use, but it isn&#x27;t essential to the bag.</li>
            <li>I would really give this 4.5 stars with a half point off for the zipper.  </li>
            <li>thought it was a little larger as they said large.</li>
            <li>and I have had a little trouble with them working smoothly.  </li>

            <li> and I have had a little trouble with them working smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived much faster than the estimate, not sure how they can make money at this low price.  </li>
            <li> Although very practical, size is much smaller than expected and def does not fit mid size purses.</li>
            <li> It took a LONG time to get to me</li>
            <li> delivery was earlier than expected..</li>
            <li> Then two big zipped pockets and the center for you wallet.</li>
            <li> Extremely durable and long lasting</li>
            <li> looks as I expected and arrived much earlier than expected</li>
            <li> The handle was attached by one (1) single thread and the handle was razzled, but I&#x27;ve decided to fix and keep.</li>
            <li> It also has little handles to switch purses in one minute or less instead of having to dump everything out and reorganize it in a new purse.</li>
            <li> One pocket for everything, so I don&#x27;t loose time to find a pen or my lipstick anymore.</li>
            <li> I wish it had being a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I also like the two closed zippered pockets that you can&#x27;t see anything.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this color and a pink version from another vendor.  </li>
            <li> Pencils brushes in the side, eyeshadows in the zipped pockets and creams in the center.</li>
            <li> really made poorly and not what I expected</li>
            <li> The identical in pink that came from the other vendor did not smell.</li>
            <li> piled upon each other at the bottom of my sack.</li>
            <li> No more big black hole where i cant find my keys.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband saw mine and got himself two, in black.</li>
            <li> My handle broke in less than a week</li>
            <li> This product did arrive sooner than I expected, but it is way too small for what I wanted to use it for.  </li>
            <li> It sat down so low in the bag and the dark color made it hard to find, and it just took up space making everything else in the bag hard to get out.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Used with my purses for a few months.  </li>
            <li> not sure about the purpose.</li>
            <li> No more issues digging through her purse to look for things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I like the 2 zipper pockets to stash money and small items in.</li>
            <li> too small for my tote</li>
            <li> It sags and makes it hard to find what I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li> I after I received it with hardly anything in it.</li>

            <li> it works great to keep my purse more organized, and items separated and not falling out every time my purse tips over.  It took a LONG time to get to me, I honestly had forgotten I ordered it.  It was cheap though, and I didn&#x27;t need it for anything specific.  I&#x27;m going to order a couple more for my kids to keep books, small tablets, pencils, crayons, etc for car trips.</li>
            <li> Came just as shown in pic. Many pockets to store things. Great for traveling! Great in a big tote bag.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much I have bought them to give as gifts to my family and friends. My husband saw mine and got himself two, in black.</li>
            <li> Item arrived much faster than the estimate, not sure how they can make money at this low price.  the bag has decent space, sized as described in the listing.  however, I was surprised to find out they padded the dividing walls.  it didn&#x27;t seem to add more weight (not noticeable), but did added some bulk. maybe this was to make the walls stand up? not sure about the purpose.</li>
            <li> Lots of pockets. Great for make up on a trip.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my girlfriend since shew always complain about her makeup getting all over her bag. She loved it and said she can now organize her makeup and save money since she didn&#x27;t have to buy a replacement for her broken lipstick etc. Overall, it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Lightweight, but appears it will be perfect for dividing several one-compartment satchels I use.Things always &amp;#34;got lost&amp;#34; in that vast space. Won&#x27;t add a lot of extra bulk or weight. Nice number of pockets and a good size. Price was great and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Lots of pockets. Good that the outside pockets are mesh so you can see what is in them.  The inner pouch is also pretty roomy, which I like.  I also like the two closed zippered pockets that you can&#x27;t see anything.  The bag is not of nice material, but since it inside the bag the look to me doesn&#x27;t matter.  The material does seem to be sturdy, which I think will matter.  The zippers are cheap plastic and I have had a little trouble with them working smoothly.  I would really give this 4.5 stars with a half point off for the zipper.  For the price I think it is really well worth it and do note that I am taking a half point off for worrying about the zipper more than the zipper is actually a problem.  Also, I bought this item as a gift and my friend loves hers.  Another one of our friends likes our and will probably be buying it for her big roomy tote bag, which is what we use it for.</li>
            <li> very good quality and lots of room</li>
            <li> very flimsy.  Used with my purses for a few months.  Does not work as intended.  It just caved in on itself.</li>
            <li> I bought a purse that is just one big area inside... I got this insert for it and it works great and  I am able to keep all my stuff inside my purse organized and in it&#x27;s place.  Shipping took some time but I am very statisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Good product. It was a gift for my wife and she uses it for work. No more issues digging through her purse to look for things. Lots of pockets to organize.</li>
            <li> Great organizer for your purse.</li>
            <li> This has proven to be very effective for organizing my purse; it also makes it much easier to switch purses. It is well made and has various sizes of pockets.</li>
            <li> I like this organizer for my purse, but it looked stiffer in the  picture than it is.  I may have to put some plastic canvas into it to hold it upright in my purse.  It sags and makes it hard to find what I&#x27;m looking for.  Overall, it&#x27;s a nicely made product, I just wish it would stand up in my purse instead of sagging to the bottom.</li>
            <li> A great and economical purse organizer.  I&#x27;ve even used it alone.  With large purses it is so nice to have an organizer so everything is not lost in the bottom.  This is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great organizer, keys, phone, pens and makeup all neatly put away not just loose in your handbag. Great for large totes. Only issue is that one of the handles pulled out on the first use, but it isn&#x27;t essential to the bag. Shipped from China, so it took awhile but received well before their ending date.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s little, compare to what I had in mind, but it works perfectly anyway. One pocket for everything, so I don&#x27;t loose time to find a pen or my lipstick anymore.</li>
            <li> looks as I expected and arrived much earlier than expected</li>
            <li> Perfect organizer  for keeping items from going all over purse or small carry-on,  A little too large for the average purse but great for travel.  Light weight fabric,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product! It supports most of my things!</li>
            <li> This is great for keeping everything in your handbag organized. It has a pocket for anything u want to put in your purse.</li>
            <li> these are functional, great to use, they are of a good size&lt;br /&gt;I did not have a good experience with how long it took to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;I hope the sellers are able to improve on this.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product as an organizer. It was for a gift and I heard wonderful things about it.</li>
            <li> great to change from purse to office bag!!</li>
            <li> Purchase multiple of these. Extremely durable and long lasting</li>
            <li> I love this thing.. Shipped quickly.  So convenient when you want to switch bags quickly.. holds a lot of crap. For 4 bucks i wasn&#x27;t expecting something made of gold like most of you were. You get what you pay for and this is better than i thought.</li>
            <li> I change purses a lot and will also be using a diaper bag once our baby is born. It makes it so easy to switch bags and not have to redo all my stuff.</li>
            <li> This literally came from China on a very SLOW boat.  Took more than a month to arrive.  I like the compartments and handles.  It&#x27;s easy to take in and out of purses and holds quite a bit.</li>
            <li> A great value for the price. This organizer is exactly what I was looking for to arrange everything in my drawstring backpack. With this handy pocket organizer, there&#x27;s no more fumbling for my wallet, phone, earbuds, etc. piled upon each other at the bottom of my sack.</li>
            <li> I am delighted by the quality of this bag/purse organizer. The quality is impressive for the price. The seams and zippers seem sturdy, and with so many pockets and pouches it has tons of uses/possibilities for personal, professional, or travel use.  I ordered several in various colors, and will order more for gifts. (Shipping was approximately 12 days air mail)</li>
            <li> very useful item...delivery was earlier than expected..</li>
            <li> It works perfect in all my bags. I love it.</li>
            <li> I wish it had being a little bigger. But I liked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit smaller and not as sturdy as I was hoping but it is perfect to hold my coupon pouches.  I am happy with it as the price was very low and shipping was free</li>
            <li> The case is well divided and distributed material But it is not the best and I was torn by receiving side. I&#x27;m not satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> This item helps organize your things in your bag. This also makes switching bags a breeze, just grab by the handles and put in another bag. A very practical item, I ordered a few and started giving them to friends.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. One of the zippers broke the second day I after I received it with hardly anything in it.</li>
            <li> good size. lots of room for the size.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  I just pack it and move it from purse to purse, easy!</li>
            <li> It was a lot bigger than I expected and the material was really cheap</li>
            <li> Excellent buy, excellent quality (mine is FULL) &amp; I WILL be ordering more colors!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this color and a pink version from another vendor.  This one in black/grey had a bad smell that I covered up with perfume.  The identical in pink that came from the other vendor did not smell.</li>
            <li> Although very practical, size is much smaller than expected and def does not fit mid size purses.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really liked them. Good shipping.</li>
            <li> really made poorly and not what I expected</li>
            <li> I really this organizer, makes it much easier to find everything in my purse.</li>
            <li> Had to wait forever for it to get here then it fell apart the first day</li>
            <li> It took a while but I love it,helps me organize every thing in my purse,has limited colors,need more. thought it was a little larger as they said large.</li>
            <li> Saw these elsewhere for 25 dollars. Went to amazon and there they were for 5. Bought 10 for gifts at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mine for 6 weeks and LOVE it. Zippers, pockets, fabric - no issues here. Just grab the handles and change purses.&lt;br /&gt;Can find stuff now and feel so organized. There are mesh pockets on the side and nylon pockets behind those. Then two big zipped pockets and the center for you wallet. Bought all the colors and they were all nice. The gray and yellow is pretty. I have the blue and the color is nice. Could also be used as a makeup case. In fact i may do that. Pencils brushes in the side, eyeshadows in the zipped pockets and creams in the center. Nice size fit easily in all my purses. No more big black hole where i cant find my keys.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and just what I was looking for.  Ordered a couple more and am very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps my purse  organize</li>
            <li> love it because just holds everything</li>
            <li> This product did arrive sooner than I expected, but it is way too small for what I wanted to use it for.  I wanted it for a hobo style bag insert, and it just got lost inside the bag along with the rest of my things that I couldn&#x27;t find before I purchased this item.  It sat down so low in the bag and the dark color made it hard to find, and it just took up space making everything else in the bag hard to get out.&lt;br /&gt;You would have to remove this to find anything, and the handles on this bag are almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> I love it! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This is very light weight, does not stand alone. Wish the sides were more sturdy as to stand alone in the purse.</li>
            <li> Roomy fits my purse perfectly</li>
            <li> Excellent. Going to get some more</li>
            <li> Handy to move purse, and personal small items, from one bag to the next.  I like the 2 zipper pockets to stash money and small items in.</li>
            <li> I was suggested this item by one of my girlfriends. From the moment she pulled it out of her purse I knew I needed it and ended up ordering it right then and there before she even left my house!! I am one of the many women that carries a giant purse all the time and I have always struggled with the designer purses I buy because they never have enough pockets to correctly organize a purse. This totally solved my problem plus some. It also has little handles to switch purses in one minute or less instead of having to dump everything out and reorganize it in a new purse. For the price this can&#x27;t be beat, I already bought them for both my mother and mother in law and a backup for myself!</li>
            <li> This organizer is perfect for storing everything I need to carry in my purse in its own convenient place, and now I have much more room than before. I love that I can find what I need so quick and easy, and don&#x27;t have to worry about losing anything!</li>
            <li> Zipper doesn&#x27;t always work properly but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Disappointed due to poor quality.  The handle was attached by one (1) single thread and the handle was razzled, but I&#x27;ve decided to fix and keep.</li>
            <li> My handle broke in less than a week but it&#x27;s really convient.</li>
            <li> If I could I would do 0 stars! This product is nothing but garbage when I received it it was already broken the zippers did not work just a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Very pleased came before date issuded</li>
            <li> too small for my tote</li>
