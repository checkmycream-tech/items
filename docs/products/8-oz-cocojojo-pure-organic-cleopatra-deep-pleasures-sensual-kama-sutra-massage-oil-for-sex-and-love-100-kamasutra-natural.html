            <li> good stuff..alsome i.ll buy it agin last long time.....use it only for sex wife loves it...glides in and out gooood:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different massage oils on my wife and each of them was lacking.  I decided to try this oil and we&#x27;re now on our third bottle.  We love the scent and feel of this oil.  It absorbs great and the next morning, our skin isn&#x27;t dry like with other oils.  If there was a six-star rating, I would give it to this oil.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. A little goes a long way and the smell is great. Feeling is less greasy/sticky than other similar oils.</li>
            <li> TO MUCH PERFUME IN PRODUCT NOT WHAT I PREFER FOR SENSUAL TIMES, BEEN MARRIED 35 YEARS, PREFER&lt;br /&gt;KAMRA SUTRA TYPE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> 5 star oil! It&#x27;ll change your life.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Whatever the planned use for this oil is, it is very pleasant and smell very good. First time that I purchased something like that and I am very satisfied with it.</li>

This oil feels really great on the skin and since it is actually healthy for the skin, my husband is not only making me feel good with a massage but he is helping me make my skin look good as well.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my wife and she really enjoyed the smell and now she is asking me for massages! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> i was hesitant to spend almost twenty dollars on oil ?&lt;br /&gt;this is lovely to use, pleasant fragrance for men and women. its nice to use, not being greasy or sticky&lt;br /&gt;buy this  - you deserve it</li>
            <li> good product showed up on time</li>

            <li> I was expecting a more erotic smell but this is fine, think I go back to my old Kama Sutra favorites next go around.</li>
            <li> They should really remove the sex part. If youre using these oils your making some love, baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spray bottle is super legit.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the reviews saying how great it smelled.&lt;br /&gt;It did smell good when first applied, but shortly after application it turned into&lt;br /&gt;kind of a weird smell.  May be just how it interacted with my skin, but I was&lt;br /&gt;disappointed.  I do like that it is in a spray bottle which makes application&lt;br /&gt;much easier.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great.  makes it nice to have an intimate massage and not worry about being to greasy or getting it on anything.  enjoy using this product.  def. a great purchase.</li>
            <li> This oil does exactly what you would expect it to do. It is one of the better oils out there today.</li>
            <li> Sensual, erotic...promotes sensuality, imo!  It&#x27;s a tad greasy imo, but it does dissipate.  Hay, it&#x27;s oil, and a great lubricator, so what isn&#x27;t going to be &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I just love this oil!!! It smells divine and hydrates my skin without staying oily. I and my boy friend cannot stop using during our special time. IT IS A GREAT OIL .</li>
            <li> feels really nice and smooth when massaging. even use it in a bath with warm water and you will feel and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, but the smell (and taste) is very, very strong, like perfume. It is okay lube. It loses its slipperiness after a few minutes unlike other oils, but it is great for a quick massage, and you don&#x27;t have to put on perfume after!</li>
            <li> Great scent, great feeling on the skin. Does wonders for dry winter skin.  Doesn&#x27;t stain the bedding! Would recommend it for all my friends.</li>
