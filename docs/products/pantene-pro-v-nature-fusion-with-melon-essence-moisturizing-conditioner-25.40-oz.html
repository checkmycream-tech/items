            <li>I just love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>glad to see that Amazon has a Subscribe and Save program.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product as a daily conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The oz. is generous and it smells amazing and fresh.</li>
            <li>It really helps my hair to look and feel like it is moisturized, soft, and healthy!!!!!</li>
            <li>I am a huge Pantene fan, but this one I will never buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth buying!</li>
            <li>Washes away clean and fragrant.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely be buying this for a good time.</li>
            <li>It almost seemed too full.</li>
            <li>It is a nice conditioner for the price and handy to keep for the next time we are running low on the stuff :)</li>
            <li>I love their new Moisture Balance line!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a fairly good job of helping me comb through my long hair in the shower, but my hair looks frizzy and out of control after it</li>
            <li>It is great conditioner and the perfume is not very strong.</li>
            <li>Family member works for a high priced mall store and brags about the ingredients in her conditioner being very special.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, hair feels clean, and long lasting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this product, well worth it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about this conditioner was the price.</li>
            <li>I usually right reviews about technology and electronics.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this product to a friend and family member!!!!</li>
            <li>If you have healthy hair and do not need a deep conditioning, you will probably be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The company seemed very cooperative with me returning it and refunded my money right away.</li>
            <li>I have very oily scalp and my husbands is more dry but this does not make either of our hair look or feel oily.</li>
            <li>I really hope this is a product line that Pantene keeps.  </li>
            <li>One of the bottles looked very used.</li>
            <li>The lid would not shut and it looked very used.</li>
            <li>So I am giving one star for the whole experience rather than the product since I did not try it.</li>
            <li>It rinses completely out and actually makes my hair full of tangles.  </li>
            <li>The other bottle was lighter in color and filled to the brim when I opened the lid.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature of Pantene Conditioners has always been how slick it made my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair smooth and silky without weighing it down by noon.</li>
            <li>They both came packaged together in a clear sealed bag and nothing had spilled out.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft and helps get out knots.  </li>
            <li>With Pantine, my hair is managable, soft, and healthy-looking.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect such a big volume, and they are very pure.</li>
            <li>There is often a coupon available and  if you use that and Subscribe and save you can purchase this for less than what you would pay at a big box retail store.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, its price is very reasonable, you will not regret to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair is so manageable and soft after using it, and not dry or stick-tough.</li>
            <li>I now get my conditioner delivered right to my door on a regular basis, and at less expense than at the supermarket.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, very curly hair, and I use a curling iron once a week, and my hair just continues to look healthy, not greasy or weighted down, week after week.</li>
            <li>The goo was much darker in color than the other bottle.</li>

            <li> This conditioner is not moisturizing enough for my dry, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> but I really am having hard time with the scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pantene conditioner on my hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> so I found that really strange.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the mean contributing factor for such a high rating is a reason mentioned by another reviewer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would reccomend this to anyone who has dry hair</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s conditioner until few months later.</li>
            <li> I have extremely damaged hair and always feel like I&#x27;m running out of conditioner.</li>
            <li> Even though it isn&#x27;t a deep conditioner, I leave it overnight once every few months and my hair is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lo and behold after leaving it upon my scalp for half a fortnight, my beleaguered locks came to life.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is subtle, not overpowering, but I will probably buy a smoothing version next time.</li>
            <li> I was fraught with sorrow as my limp, lifeless locks brought looks of derision from maidens aplenty.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge deal but a little annoying.</li>
            <li> Hard to go wrong with this conditioner.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I like this product. It is great conditioner and the perfume is not very strong. Its mild perfume smell great. On the other hand, its price is very reasonable, you will not regret to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have scalp psoriasis and I use this along with the shampoo and noticed a reduction of the redness and flaking. The smell isnt overpowering and its soothing. Worth buying!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, hair feels clean, and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;However, the mean contributing factor for such a high rating is a reason mentioned by another reviewer.  I bought this just to switch shampoos, and noticed that my scalp psoriasis had also reduced significantly, if not totally.  Came on here and checked the review, and I noticed another person had that experience also. I really hope this is a product line that Pantene keeps.  Would definitely be buying this for a good time.</li>
            <li> Hard to go wrong with this conditioner.  There is often a coupon available and  if you use that and Subscribe and save you can purchase this for less than what you would pay at a big box retail store.  The Conditioner works well and I have had no issues with it after using it for over 2 months, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was fraught with sorrow as my limp, lifeless locks brought looks of derision from maidens aplenty.  No remedy seemed able to restore unto me the magnificent mane of my youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon Pantene Pro-V NatureFusion on sale one day and with great steadfastness, decided to partake in the bounty it promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lo and behold after leaving it upon my scalp for half a fortnight, my beleaguered locks came to life.  I looked upon my visage in yonder mirror and beheld the hair of Thor himself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner it works great in my hair, smells great and my boyfriend can use it too and it isn&#x27;t too girly for him the scent is bigender.:)</li>
            <li> The product works well but I really am having hard time with the scent. will not buy this scent again.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Pantene fan, but this one I will never buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a fairly good job of helping me comb through my long hair in the shower, but my hair looks frizzy and out of control after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is subtle, not overpowering, but I will probably buy a smoothing version next time.</li>
            <li> I really love this Pantene Pro-V product!!!! It really helps my hair to look and feel like it is moisturized, soft, and healthy!!!!! I love it!!!! I would most definitely recommend this product to a friend and family member!!!!</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve used this product for years; it&#x27;s great for my curly hair. I use a substantial amount every day and don&#x27;t rinse it all out. Great results.</li>
            <li> I sent sent the regular conditioner, not with melon essence. Not a huge deal but a little annoying. Great product though. 3 stars because of the mis shipping</li>
            <li> I have been using Pantene conditioner on my hair for a long time. It&#x27;s been the best product out of all that I have tried. Leaves my hair very soft and silky. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the great deal on this purchase; nice big bottles of Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion Moisture Balance Conditioner.</li>
            <li> This was an exceptional deal on a great product.  It makes your hair smooth and silky without weighing it down by noon.</li>
            <li> The Pantene Conditioner was a great deal. The conditioner is a great product and i would recommend  this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, leaves my hair soft, smooth and shinny. Washes away clean and fragrant.  I recommend this product, well worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect such a big volume, and they are very pure. They are definitely a good value, you can&#x27;t miss it,</li>
            <li> Family member works for a high priced mall store and brags about the ingredients in her conditioner being very special. When compared this has the same ingredients and costs a 5th of what she has.</li>
            <li> I love Pantene.  It leaves hair soft and helps get out knots.  I only get it when it is on sale, though...and then....I stock up!</li>
            <li> My favorite feature of Pantene Conditioners has always been how slick it made my hair feel.  Well, this conditioner does not do that at all.  It rinses completely out and actually makes my hair full of tangles.  I&#x27;ve never in my life had an issue with tangles so I found that really strange.  I also do not like the scent.  The only thing I liked about this conditioner was the price.</li>
            <li> this keeps my hair nice and smooth. I dont know what to say about this. I usually right reviews about technology and electronics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not picky about shampoo, but I HAVE to have Pantine conditioner or else my hair just turns to straw. With Pantine, my hair is managable, soft, and healthy-looking. I just love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to see that Amazon has a Subscribe and Save program. I now get my conditioner delivered right to my door on a regular basis, and at less expense than at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s conditioner until few months later. It&#x27;s good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have always loved Pantene. It was 2 for $12.98 at the time. I cannot do a review on the product itself because I returned it without trying it. One of the bottles looked very used. The lid would not shut and it looked very used. The goo was much darker in color than the other bottle. It was over 1/4 gone. The other bottle was lighter in color and filled to the brim when I opened the lid. It almost seemed too full. They both seemed &amp;#34;just wrong&amp;#34; to me in look and smell. They both came packaged together in a clear sealed bag and nothing had spilled out. So I am giving one star for the whole experience rather than the product since I did not try it. The company seemed very cooperative with me returning it and refunded my money right away.</li>
            <li> I have extremely damaged hair and always feel like I&#x27;m running out of conditioner. This kind is really great with my hair, though. The oz. is generous and it smells amazing and fresh.</li>
            <li> Pantene haiir care products are great and this conditioner is no exception it leaves hair silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend this to anyone who has dry hair</li>
            <li> This just happened to be a great buy this day I bought it for the 3 women in our home.  Since I am bald(ing) I don&#x27;t use the stuff but it beat Wal-Mart prices!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.  I use it to shave my legs. And in my bathwater to give my skin a moisturizing bath.</li>
            <li> This product works great and i would buy again.</li>
            <li> I swim and do water aerobics 4-5 times a week.  I also color my hair.  I am very happy with this product as a daily conditioner.  My hair feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> We always run out of conditioner before shampoo, so I started picking up extra conditioners when I can. I have very oily scalp and my husbands is more dry but this does not make either of our hair look or feel oily. It is a nice conditioner for the price and handy to keep for the next time we are running low on the stuff :)</li>
            <li> This conditioner is not moisturizing enough for my dry, color-treated hair. If you have healthy hair and do not need a deep conditioning, you will probably be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value, and I always appreciate the eco-friendly aspect of larger sized packaging. (Hopefully it will be recycled, and not in the landfill, but either way, it&#x27;s 1 bottle in place of 2 or more... :o)</li>
            <li> While trying to search for lower cost options, I have to say I keep coming back to Pantene. My hair is so manageable and soft after using it, and not dry or stick-tough. Even though it isn&#x27;t a deep conditioner, I leave it overnight once every few months and my hair is unbelievable. I have very thick, very curly hair, and I use a curling iron once a week, and my hair just continues to look healthy, not greasy or weighted down, week after week. I love their new Moisture Balance line!</li>
