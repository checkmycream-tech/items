            <li>Sipping took a little while, but great product</li>
            <li>Too busy looking at toy jug : )</li>
            <li>half of the package is &amp;#34;smeared&amp;#34; The smell is very strong!</li>
            <li>4oz to be exact... 8 tbsp.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I needed a large quantity.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>

            <li> This is no a really good quality product , but for the price is worthy!</li>
            <li> Buy a ton of acrylic powder for this bottle as you will run out of powder long before you run out of liquid.</li>
            <li> Came in earlier than expected but be careful when opening the envlosed space makes the smell trap inside so open in a ventelated area and leave there untill the scent wears off</li>
            <li> Recieved earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I got the bottle empty and my package was open</li>
            <li> smaller then expected, not very much product.</li>
            <li> yes people it might look like a BIG bottle but read the info before ordering IF yall had done that there wouldnt be so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> find it dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;small</li>
            <li> I thought the bottle was bigger its really small</li>
            <li> The smaller bottle that you get with the kits is just too small.</li>
            <li> Very small and comes out really slow or really fast.</li>
            <li> then i excepted and liquid bottle is half way empty.!!</li>
            <li> With this brand, I probably used less than an ounce.</li>
            <li> a waste of money</li>
            <li> YOU ITS SMALL.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> it is a small bottle</li>
            <li> Go to store to get monomer -  this monomer with correct polymer is hard and won&#x27;t come off...</li>
            <li> was a bit small but can&#x27;t wait to get started doing nails!</li>
            <li> waste of money... !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s illegal here</li>
            <li> this stuff stinks</li>
            <li> The product I wasn&#x27;t crazy about</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> So disappointed</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> I thought this was a larger container.&lt;br /&gt;So I was disappointed. +</li>
            <li> I used it with the KISS brand nail powder, and it works great! When I do my nails, I use the 2oz bottle that comes in the KISS package and usually end up using it all for a full set. With this brand, I probably used less than an ounce. :) I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> This is no a really good quality product , but for the price is worthy! I prefer to pay more but get a good quality product, it&#x27;s true .you get what you pay.</li>
            <li> Really small bottle but cute</li>
            <li> Packaged well and it is a great buy !!!!  Works great !!!</li>
            <li> Came in earlier than expected but be careful when opening the envlosed space makes the smell trap inside so open in a ventelated area and leave there untill the scent wears off</li>
            <li> Very small and comes out really slow or really fast. Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as products I can buy in the store. Spend your money on a better product. Made the nail powder lumpy and foggy.</li>
            <li> It was wasting out of the bottle in the package</li>
            <li> Recieved earlier than expected. I was going to give it a 5 star but could of been more liquid in the container but for the price I will not complain.</li>
            <li> Great thanks it took two months for me to get it but thanks.</li>
            <li> small but great quality!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> Not any better than what is in the store. I actually thought this was a large bottle. The picture is deceiving. My fault,  I should of read the ounces. It works just fine but I&#x27;ll probably just buy acrylic liquid when I go the store from now on.</li>
            <li> strong stuff wife lvs it</li>
            <li> Go to store to get monomer -  this monomer with correct polymer is hard and won&#x27;t come off...</li>
            <li> This is not a jug! Fits between thumb n ring finger. No handle on side to hold. Appears this is to promote sales, I guess. Has no function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description does read 120ml which is a very tiny amt... 4oz to be exact... 8 tbsp. Too busy looking at toy jug : )&lt;br /&gt;I needed a large quantity. Will look further...</li>
            <li> I got it  works jus like the salons</li>
            <li> great strong smell but works great</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the volume is great for the person who does their own tips. The smaller bottle that you get with the kits is just too small.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, I should have paid attention to how much came in the bottle looks like it would be bigger. But seems ton hold up good for tips.</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE IT . IT WORK SO GOOD . ^_^</li>
            <li> I got the bottle empty and my package was open</li>
            <li> doesnt work well with some product. find it dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;small bottle but was expecting it after i read reviews</li>
            <li> got this in about 6 day  it is a small bottle but if you are doing your nails you need this in your supplys</li>
            <li> The acrylic works ok but I feel it makes the acrylic powder dry too fast and the product looks bigger in the picturethan in real size the bottle is about 2 inches high my galaxy s5 is bigger than the liquid.</li>
            <li> smaller then expected, not very much product.</li>
            <li> The package was received like the bottle had leaked. half of the package is &amp;#34;smeared&amp;#34; The smell is very strong! stronger than any other acrylic liquid ive used.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise exactly what I was expecting. FOUR OUNCES!!! yes people it might look like a BIG bottle but read the info before ordering IF yall had done that there wouldnt be so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Great customer service! The product I wasn&#x27;t crazy about but the customer service was fantastic. Thank you</li>
