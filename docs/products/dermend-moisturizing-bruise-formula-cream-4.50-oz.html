            <li>I am very pleased to say the bruises are actually disappearing.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have had a tremendous change after completing the first tube.</li>
            <li>The cream is soothing and goes right into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have NO bruises on my right arm</li>
            <li>Saw the first signs fo healing in about 3 weeks.  </li>

            <li> My skin is very thin and consequently, I bruise very easily.</li>
            <li> There are other brands on the market, I think this one is the most expensive</li>
            <li> It took about a month of using DerMend twice daily, but when I bruise now, they are typically small (smaller than a pencil eraser rather than quarter-sized or bigger) and heal within a week.</li>
            <li> The last few years I have been developing the same skin as my Mother&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I put gobs of this cream on it last night and by this morning half of the bruise was gone.</li>
            <li> Within one week, that light brown spot had turned an ugly red and has been that way for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> does not work as well as i expected</li>
            <li> I purchase this and it seemed to help, but is not fast.  </li>
            <li> Though a little expensive, I feel it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Tried other products that did nothing -</li>
            <li> , It was so dark and was not healing.</li>
            <li> The slightest bump will create dark purple bruises, my skin is thin like tissue paper when it gets scraped and I am constantly hitting my arms into something, even a screen door</li>
            <li> I had a reaction to a drug that caused the skin on my forearms to become thin and very fragile; it would bruise or tear from a small bump often bleeding a lot.</li>
            <li> Noticed no difference in skin texture and bruised just as much as usual after using three weeks.</li>
            <li> a serious sun burn on my arms in the past week  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Der Mend twice a day for a month and have the really bad bruises from old age.  </li>
            <li> I like the cream, it was slow</li>
            <li> I have thin skin from medications.  </li>
            <li> Have used for 1 year and add a protective coat to my thin skin and moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful</li>
            <li> It is expensive, however what isn&#x27;t these days.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> This really works. Starts to fade bruises immediately .</li>
            <li> It is better than not using, but not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I had a reaction to a drug that caused the skin on my forearms to become thin and very fragile; it would bruise or tear from a small bump often bleeding a lot. Bruises would be large, red, and take weeks to disappear, while new ones continued to form. It took about a month of using DerMend twice daily, but when I bruise now, they are typically small (smaller than a pencil eraser rather than quarter-sized or bigger) and heal within a week. The lotion is very moisturizing. Though a little expensive, I feel it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Does not work as advertised, actually it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> The last few years I have been developing the same skin as my Mother&#x27;s. The slightest bump will create dark purple bruises, my skin is thin like tissue paper when it gets scraped and I am constantly hitting my arms into something, even a screen door and I am bruised immediately for weeks! I am tempted to wear bubble wrap around my arms especially on weekends. When seeing my dermatologist last week he mentioned that Bruise Creams will work to help protect the skin and lessen the time of the bruise. (never heard of the stuff before) I purchased this DerMend Bruise Moisturing Cream and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the stuff. I had a large dime sized bruise on my wrist from an injection for over a week, It was so dark and was not healing. I put gobs of this cream on it last night and by this morning half of the bruise was gone. It is now a light pink in 24 hrs. The cream is soothing and goes right into the skin. Light and glycerin feel to it. No fragrance. Unisex. CVS if you can find it runs $32 to $35. There are other brands on the market, I think this one is the most expensive but I notice is has more ingredients than the others.  Just thought I would pass it on to my fellow seniors!! Blessings..Keep safe</li>
            <li> I have been using the Der Mend twice a day for a month and have the really bad bruises from old age.  I am 75.  I am very pleased to say the bruises are actually disappearing.  I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Product has helped reduce the bruising on my husbands arms and he says it feels really great on your skin.</li>
            <li> Actually works over a period of time - took about two weeks to see results.</li>
            <li> Reduces skin discoloring within days.</li>
            <li> I like the cream, it was slow but, I see clear places om my arms and hands that I thought would not clear.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it.  I cannot find anything any better.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised when this stuff actually made the bruise fade! Tried other products that did nothing -</li>
            <li> does not work as well as i expected</li>
            <li> great product, works great, thanks.</li>
            <li> for the price it could be netter</li>
            <li> fairly good at bruise alleviation after a while.  I&lt;br /&gt; neeed to reorder</li>
            <li> I purchase this and it seemed to help, but is not fast.  Saw the first signs fo healing in about 3 weeks.  I tried it on some older, light brown spots and can only advise that you not do this.  Within one week, that light brown spot had turned an ugly red and has been that way for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> fast delivery and fair price</li>
            <li> Sure seems to work. I have NO bruises on my right arm but I keep beating the hell out of my left arm so I have some bruises on my it.  I will continue to use this product because it works.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working well ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not miraculous but does seem to break up the bruised spot somewhat.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product. Noticed no difference in skin texture and bruised just as much as usual after using three weeks. Pricey for just a moisturizer!!!!</li>
            <li> I chose this cream because I have bruises on my arms from getting infusions, and I tried one tube of this cream and some of the bruises started to disappear.  I think it is very effective.</li>
            <li> This product is effective in healing bruises and cuts.  It has also been beneficial&lt;br /&gt;healing a serious sun burn on my arms in the past week  The sunburn was first&lt;br /&gt;treated with white vinegar compresses and then with daily applications of Dermend.&lt;br /&gt;Within 6 days my sunburn turned to tan and no peeling!!  It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, arnica gel works better</li>
            <li> would work I think if my husband would use as he should!</li>
            <li> It is nice to have something to help with faster results</li>
            <li> I have had a tremendous change after completing the first tube.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. INTRODUCED TO ME BY MY DOCTOR.  I HAVE INTORDUCED TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND EVERYONE IS AMAZED. IT WILL TAKE CARE OF BOTH OLD AND NEW BRUISES.  HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li> Not enough product for the price.  It&#x27;s helping but not as fast as I thought it would.  I have thin skin from medications.  I still bruise very easily.</li>
            <li> This does well for me.</li>
            <li> Have used for 1 year and add a protective coat to my thin skin and moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful</li>
            <li> Product works well. Bruises go away faster. Doctor recommended.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what my wife wanted</li>
            <li> It has been the only cream that has helped me getting rid of my bruises. My skin is very thin and consequently, I bruise very easily. I apply it twice a day and do hope that soon I will be able to wear sleeveless blouses and dresses and don&#x27;t have to hide my arms. I have tried many other creams but DerMend is by far the best. It is expensive, however what isn&#x27;t these days.</li>
            <li> With aging, there are bruising and drying of skin. DerMend has changed much my skin bruises and dries.</li>
