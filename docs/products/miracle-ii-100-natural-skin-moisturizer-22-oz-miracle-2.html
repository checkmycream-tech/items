    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the first product that has actually soothed the eczema on my face.  I&#x27;ve tried creams and ointments from my regular physician, from the dermatologist, and from my naturopathic doctor, all to no avail.  In fact all of them made the situation worse.  Miracle lotion has removed the pain, the lesions have gone, the flakey patches hardly flake now.  This is the best my skin has looked in years.  I ordered more and keep one in my purse, one by the bed and one in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I have ever used with out an oily feel</li>
            <li> I used it for years and  the gel also and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I use both lotion and jel daily.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years. Excellent for skin</li>
            <li> I love it! Have used it for years and I feel that it&#x27;s by far the best fact lotion that I have ever used. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Very good and excellent for the skin.</li>
            <li> Miracle 2. Is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it for years .  However. The plastic bottle was cracked and leaking lotion when I got it ,</li>
            <li> My 7-year-old has really dry skin. When I put other lotions or facial creams on his face he would complain that it burned. This is the only lotion I have been able to use that he can tolerate.   I do not care for it as hand lotion though. It&#x27;s far too greasy for that purpose.</li>
            <li> The product is great but  the package was damaged</li>
            <li> I have used this product and the rest of the Miracle II products for 10 years...best ever, can use it on your animals...can dilute with water and use on plants for both bug spray and plant enhancer.</li>
            <li> Miracle II really is a miracle!  I have had trouble finding a cream that does not burn my eyes.  Miracle II moisturizer moistens skin without burning my eyes!  So convenient, I use it all over my face and neck (eyes included).</li>
            <li> Great value and and I love the benefits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but I need it to be a little thicker .... It&#x27;s great for average skin type</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Makes my sensitive skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Delivered quickly. Good product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> There are not a lot of choices for moisturizers that don&#x27;t use alcohols. This is a good one. It also is very stabile: the natural oils used keep for a long time without going rancid. Add to this no artificial colors or fragrance and you have a very nice, rich moisturizer which is absorbent enough for use on both body and face. And the price is not bad compared to fancy schmancy moisturizers.</li>

Pretty neat, I also use the green soap to wash with and the gel to fim up my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not as gentle as I first remembered it, and have used it for several years now. Perhaps there is an additive that is not listed. Now I will return to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Always the best. We will reorder.</li>
            <li> Excellent product -- keeps my skin moist &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the moisturizing velvety feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li> awesome for sensitive facial skin.  i use this as a base for all my moisturizing needs.  after 13 years, this product remains my #1 choice.  smooth, silky and never greasy.  it absorbs easily and has no odor/fragrance/smell.  i use it on my face.  for my husband, i blend it with other creams and he uses it on his rough dry hands.  it prevents cracking and dryness.  i recently purchased this huge bottle because it was a good deal.  if you keep it in a cool dry place, it should last over a year or more without spoiling.</li>
            <li> This produce is healthy for my skin.  It&#x27;s moisturizing capability is consistantly reliable.  I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken and leaking out of container</li>
