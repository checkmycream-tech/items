            <li>This is the best depilatory I have used so far</li>
            <li>I have used Magic Shave (powder) for years:</li>
            <li>B0000532Q5 Magic Skin Conditioning Shaving Powder with Aloe&amp;Vitamin E, 4.5 oz (127 g)]])</li>
            <li>Spouse likes the smell of this better</li>
            <li>However, he thinks the Gold cans do a better job of shaving.</li>
            <li>and it was usually ok</li>
            <li>im smooth as a baby&#x27;s rump!</li>
            <li>the cream wont be able to reach the roots.</li>
            <li>Better than</li>
            <li>5 starstars because I caled magic shave</li>
            <li>I have tried the other Magic powders and this one seems to be the best.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li>I used this and it smells extremely strong,  even after it is taken off.</li>
            <li>this is great, very easy to use and very effective, be careful in sensitive areas, use the recommended time.</li>
            <li>Follow directions, and you&#x27;ll soon have Silky Smooth skin where ever you decided to apply this...</li>
            <li>it should be smooth and consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>close shave, resulting in exceptionally smooth skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>makes his face smooth as a baby ,no ingrown hairs to fight with.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to mix until you get the hang of it (pack it to the side of your salsa bowl or whatever you&#x27;re using and then force the water into it with your finger) but get it into a nice paste, put it on any body part you want, find out the time to leave it on that works best for you (The directions say 5-7 minutes, but I have to leave it on for 8-10 minutes, because I have abnormally strong hairs.</li>
            <li>But overall a good product that was easy to use.</li>
            <li>hot wax fore sure.</li>
            <li>And I already have pretty fine hair</li>
            <li>but it subsides quickly.</li>
            <li>This works great on sensitive skin and sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I shave with a razor for quick shaves but every two days or so.</li>
            <li>The youtuber claimed that this product would keep my legs hair free for over a week...not so much.</li>
            <li>Smell is different, but, again, effective.</li>
            <li>give it a minute after the first signs of hair on the spoon and remove mixture quickly</li>
            <li>The hardest part I find is getting the right consistency</li>
            <li>Simple, fast effective.</li>
            <li>(I use a dinner knife but thanks to a quick search on Amazon after 8 years</li>
            <li>The heavy duty powder also was not as pleasant.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t vouch for the face, but I have used this only on my body multiple times and it is very effective.</li>
            <li>Tried many many times to shave with the typical razor, electric shaver with shaving cream, in the shower, with hair clippers and nothing ever really worked.</li>
            <li>Left it on a couple minutes more than the directions</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and the product did not work.</li>
            <li>Works well but test on your skin first.</li>
            <li>I am a female who has used the product for about 40 years or more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love for it to do the same for others.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m glad I also recently purchased a 13oz tub of vaseline because hoo BOY did this stuff burn the hell out of my balls.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even shave with a normal razor, I have to use the Schick Hydro 5 Power Select to be able to shave properly.</li>
            <li>Took off hair as it was supposed to, but i have found that this and every other product in the Magic Shave line will absolutely ruin your skin with the most excruciating burning sensation for a long time after use.</li>
            <li>It only burned the very front of my ballsack, and was fine everywhere else, but my skin right there was just too sensitive for this stuff.</li>
            <li>Much softer and smoother than shaving.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with spread on the area for men looking for precise application (shaping a goatee or moustache)</li>
            <li>I really hope this helps because I know th excrutiating pain and discomfort caused by razor bumps and this product really did save me</li>
            <li>I scraped it up really well, afterwards, just rinse it with water in the shower.</li>
            <li>He was a Caucasian dermatologist and might not of really understood my struggle.</li>
            <li>this really could be your answer.</li>
            <li>I cant really shave anymore because of that reason</li>
            <li>I also wear out razors way way faster than is normal, and yes I use shaving cream and take care of the razors.), make sure it doesn&#x27;t dry out</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try the magic shave razorless cream and after settling with the mild sensitive skin cream I felt like I finally found the answer.</li>
            <li>Perhaps others could get away with using this there, as I have pretty sensitive skin, but here&#x27;s your warning regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does two things it helps to keep the mixture most on the area being shaved so it doesn&#x27;t dry and also acts as a constant test, when the mixture is ready to be removed you&#x27;ll notice strands of hair coming off on the spoon</li>
            <li>After my first shave my face never felt smoother and with barely any irritation.</li>
            <li>This is gentle enough to use on your most sensitive areas, but I would recommend using it every other day.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Years ago Soft Sheen gave away a plastic tool that could be used to scrape the product off.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>it never dried.</li>
            <li>but it was no other way to mix it with water.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>It definitely took the hair off of my legs completely without over drying the skin.</li>
            <li>When my boys get old enough to shave I will pass this on to them</li>
            <li>I was given some of this product to use for my lady parts, it took me a few times to get the right consistency, and now know how often to use it (3 weeks)</li>
            <li>I was previously waxing and getting ingrown hair and spending way too much for it.</li>
            <li>Hydrates your skin phenomenally well and removes any dead or dry skin that may be giving you trouble.</li>

            <li> Hydrates your skin phenomenally well and removes any dead or dry skin that may be giving you trouble.</li>
            <li> found getting the right consistency was hard, and that if it was too thick or liquidy it would dry really quickly</li>
            <li> I recommend doing this in your shower, standing outside of the water so the air is very humid, and you may daub a small amount of water onto wherever is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;-Will</li>
            <li> from personal experience here, do not use this for too long or else</li>
            <li> 90% of the time you are leaving the powder on too long, so here&#x27;s a trick I learnt over the years, once you&#x27;ve spread the mixture continue to dip the spoon back in the mixture and reapply over the areas already done.</li>
            <li> I do mean where ever too ;)</li>
            <li> It did not remove a single hair even though i was following the directions to a T.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> but I have got minor redness before</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s been kinda messy for me.</li>
            <li> Any black man having trouble shaving please try this it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t remove a single hair.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to leave on too long.</li>
            <li> I have used this once on my legs, fingers and groin after shaving my body regularly for about a year now, and it was much, MUCH less damaging to my skin, and even rejuvenated my dry and damaged skin as mentioned previously.</li>
            <li> Received and empty box...</li>
            <li> I just use the spoon and roughly shape out those areas.</li>
            <li> take hair off of ANY body part, so you have to be careful not to get it where you don&#x27;t want</li>
            <li> But I wasted literally the entire tube just trying to achieve the so called \\&quot;creamy mixture.\\</li>
            <li> One secret add the water slowly, start with a few drops and mix then as more.</li>
            <li> I was pumped to try this product as I heard other women raving about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it throughout the summer, not sure about the rest of the year.</li>
            <li> Very few ingrowns when I use in conjunction with isopropyl alcohol and especially Amlactin (a lactic acid lotion).</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve experimented with different viscosity and no matter what it seems it&#x27;s unable to clear the hair from my face/neck.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it has grown back and &amp;#34;softer.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth the mess or the time.</li>
            <li> (it needs to stay somewhat slippery) and then scrub off in the shower with a plastic loofa and it will leave your skin smoother than my ass when I was born, according to an authority on the subject</li>
            <li> The smell and slight burn is why I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> you ever had trouble shaving (black men)</li>
            <li> does not easily mix up creating a mess when shaving.</li>
            <li> It smells like a dead rotting animal.</li>
            <li> After using this I could not touch my face because it burns with even the slightest amount of contact, and i cannot wash off any residue because water makes the burning ten times worse.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product- even though it does what it says the aftereffects are worse than razor bumps could ever possibly be.</li>
            <li> : Its going to take a few shaves to get a system on how to mix it...</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because it is messy</li>
            <li> It actually might blister is how bad it is, and left a visible burn.</li>
            <li> The mixture had a thick creamy texture when done and should apply smoothly careful to not mix it too thick or too watery</li>
            <li> not sure what thats about.</li>
            <li> Wash off the remaining mixture and try not to apply any alcoholic products to your face for that day it will burn.</li>
            <li> I use a mini whisk to get it to mix, and use a small cup so it doesn&#x27;t get everywhere.</li>
            <li> It does have that awful odor associated with depilatory products, so make sure you have plenty of ventilation.</li>
            <li> , I usually ended up with a thick liquid</li>
            <li> It was really hard to mix this powder with water.</li>
            <li> Its a slow process</li>
            <li> The odor was not only bad</li>
            <li> Product is WAY TOO WEAK for me.</li>
            <li> The directions for mixture are kinda vague.</li>
            <li> Mixing: the instructions as someone put it are kinda vague hopefully this helps.</li>
            <li> &quot; No idea what I was doing wrong</li>
            <li> No clue what I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black man and had a terrible time shaving.</li>
            <li> so shaving is impossible for me and after seeing a youtube video of this product decided to give it try.</li>
            <li> but it was impossible to wash away from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I had to leave it on for like 9 minutes but the razor bumps were not that bad.</li>
            <li> I even tried putting the tiniest drop of water in a dish, adding a crap ton of the powder and shaking it vigorously</li>
            <li> I had terrible results with their premixed cremes.</li>
            <li> I threw it out and i will never touch this horrible product again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>
    </ol>

I&#x27;ve used this multiple times for armpits to lower areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found getting the right consistency was hard, and that if it was too thick or liquidy it would dry really quickly and i&#x27;d have to spray it with water for it to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now from personal experience here, do not use this for too long or else it&#x27;ll burn your skin and leave holes around your hair follicle.</li>
            <li> I have used Magic Shave (powder) for years: Best thing for my face ever!!  Platinum is the best of the line.  Have been frustrated that local stores carry it intermittently and delighted that I can get it through Amazon.([[ASIN:B0000532Q5 Magic Skin Conditioning Shaving Powder with Aloe&amp;Vitamin E, 4.5 oz (127 g)]]) CAUTION: Follow the direction for skin test! it&#x27;s NOT a panacea; some folks can not tolerate it.  But, I Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Spouse likes the smell of this better and it&#x27;s gentler on his skin.  However, he thinks the Gold cans do a better job of shaving.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t vouch for the face, but I have used this only on my body multiple times and it is very effective. I have tried the other Magic powders and this one seems to be the best. I had terrible results with their premixed cremes. The heavy duty powder also was not as pleasant. Left it on a couple minutes more than the directions and it was usually ok but I have got minor redness before but it subsides quickly. Used a spatula to scrape it off. Should be great for women too. Very few ingrowns when I use in conjunction with isopropyl alcohol and especially Amlactin (a lactic acid lotion). Much softer and smoother than shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product forever. He&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li> works really good for my hair.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my legs! I have very sensitive skin so shaving is impossible for me and after seeing a youtube video of this product decided to give it try. The only hassle is the mixing part but definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> 1. It smells like a dead rotting animal. The odor was not only bad but it was impossible to wash away from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. It was really hard to mix this powder with water. I had to do it by hand. I did not want to touch this smelly stuff with my hands but it was no other way to mix it with water.&lt;br /&gt;3. It did not remove a single hair even though i was following the directions to a T.&lt;br /&gt;4. I threw it out and i will never touch this horrible product again.</li>
            <li> Simple, fast effective. Does what it needs to do. Smell is different, but, again, effective. Would buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and the product did not work. It didn&#x27;t remove a single hair.</li>
            <li> Received and empty box... No option for refund besides a return which I obviously cannot do. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The directions for mixture are kinda vague. &amp;#34;Heaping&amp;#34; teaspoon... not sure what thats about. But I&#x27;ve experimented with different viscosity and no matter what it seems it&#x27;s unable to clear the hair from my face/neck. it will remove some from my neck and face and the rest feels almost rubbery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Works well but test on your skin first.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Tried multiple times and tried following Youtube tutorials.</li>
            <li> I kept this stuff on for 3 minutes before my face felt it was stung by 1000 fire ants. Avoid this junk</li>
            <li> I am a female who has used the product for about 40 years or more. One secret add the water slowly, start with a few drops and mix then as more. Its a slow process but you will learn.  Years ago Soft Sheen gave away a plastic tool that could be used to scrape the product off. I lost mine at recent hospital visit.</li>
            <li> I never bought this product from Amazon, but have been using it for just about 8 years. I went through all the reviews here and just thought I&#x27;d write a review on what I&#x27;ve found to work when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1). Mixing: the instructions as someone put it are kinda vague hopefully this helps. Two heaping teaspoons, follow those instructions. The trick is to add two teaspoons of water for every teaspoon of powder so that would be four teaspoons of water. When mixing be patient it does take some time for the powder to dissolve, however when it&#x27;s done you&#x27;ll know. The mixture had a thick creamy texture when done and should apply smoothly careful to not mix it too thick or too watery it should be smooth and consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2). Applying: to apply the powder I use the back of the spoon I mixed it with spread on the area for men looking for precise application (shaping a goatee or moustache) I&#x27;ve seen the use of artist paint brushes etc. I just use the spoon and roughly shape out those areas. For those reporting that they get burns especially using the Aloe and vitamin e 90% of the time you are leaving the powder on too long, so here&#x27;s a trick I learnt over the years, once you&#x27;ve spread the mixture continue to dip the spoon back in the mixture and reapply over the areas already done. This does two things it helps to keep the mixture most on the area being shaved so it doesn&#x27;t dry and also acts as a constant test, when the mixture is ready to be removed you&#x27;ll notice strands of hair coming off on the spoon give it a minute after the first signs of hair on the spoon and remove mixture quickly (I use a dinner knife but thanks to a quick search on Amazon after 8 years I&#x27;ve found the pseudo razor so about to give that a try). Wash off the remaining mixture and try not to apply any alcoholic products to your face for that day it will burn. I really hope this helps because I know th excrutiating pain and discomfort caused by razor bumps and this product really did save me I&#x27;d love for it to do the same for others.</li>
            <li> This stuff works by literally melting your hair off (it&#x27;ll do it to your fingernails, too so don&#x27;t leave it sitting on your nails). It&#x27;s difficult to mix until you get the hang of it (pack it to the side of your salsa bowl or whatever you&#x27;re using and then force the water into it with your finger) but get it into a nice paste, put it on any body part you want, find out the time to leave it on that works best for you (The directions say 5-7 minutes, but I have to leave it on for 8-10 minutes, because I have abnormally strong hairs. I can&#x27;t even shave with a normal razor, I have to use the Schick Hydro 5 Power Select to be able to shave properly. I also wear out razors way way faster than is normal, and yes I use shaving cream and take care of the razors.), make sure it doesn&#x27;t dry out (it needs to stay somewhat slippery) and then scrub off in the shower with a plastic loofa and it will leave your skin smoother than my ass when I was born, according to an authority on the subject (LOL). Hydrates your skin phenomenally well and removes any dead or dry skin that may be giving you trouble. I have used this once on my legs, fingers and groin after shaving my body regularly for about a year now, and it was much, MUCH less damaging to my skin, and even rejuvenated my dry and damaged skin as mentioned previously. My only issue with this product, as you may guess from my title, was when I decided to use this on my groin, as it had done such wonders for my legs. Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m glad I also recently purchased a 13oz tub of vaseline because hoo BOY did this stuff burn the hell out of my balls. It actually might blister is how bad it is, and left a visible burn. It only burned the very front of my ballsack, and was fine everywhere else, but my skin right there was just too sensitive for this stuff. Perhaps others could get away with using this there, as I have pretty sensitive skin, but here&#x27;s your warning regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;-Very close shave, resulting in exceptionally smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Rejuvenates skin exceptionally well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-Difficult to mix until proper technique is learned.&lt;br /&gt;-Must be kept moist at all times. It&#x27;ll be a hassle to some of the people who wish to use this on their body, instead of their face. I recommend doing this in your shower, standing outside of the water so the air is very humid, and you may daub a small amount of water onto wherever is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;-Will take hair off of ANY body part, so you have to be careful not to get it where you don&#x27;t want it.&lt;br /&gt;-Will probably damage some people&#x27;s skin if used too often, as it literally melts your hair.&lt;br /&gt;-BURNS THE HELL OUT OF YOUR BALLSACK.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible. Took off hair as it was supposed to, but i have found that this and every other product in the Magic Shave line will absolutely ruin your skin with the most excruciating burning sensation for a long time after use. I used this and it smells extremely strong,  even after it is taken off. After using this I could not touch my face because it burns with even the slightest amount of contact, and i cannot wash off any residue because water makes the burning ten times worse. I would not recommend this product- even though it does what it says the aftereffects are worse than razor bumps could ever possibly be. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> this is great, very easy to use and very effective, be careful in sensitive areas, use the recommended time. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was given some of this product to use for my lady parts, it took me a few times to get the right consistency, and now know how often to use it (3 weeks) I use a mini whisk to get it to mix, and use a small cup so it doesn&#x27;t get everywhere. I was previously waxing and getting ingrown hair and spending way too much for it. The smell and slight burn is why I give it 4 stars. Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> I was pumped to try this product as I heard other women raving about it. Yes women use it too!... It&#x27;s cheap and I don&#x27;t actually mind the smell. But I wasted literally the entire tube just trying to achieve the so called \\&quot;creamy mixture.\\&quot; No idea what I was doing wrong but I couldn&#x27;t get it to be anything but white water. It was so watery, it wouldn&#x27;t stay anywhere I put it and it never dried. I even tried putting the tiniest drop of water in a dish, adding a crap ton of the powder and shaking it vigorously and it still only came out as water. No clue what I&#x27;m doing wrong. It&#x27;s just not worth the mess or the time.</li>
            <li> This works great on sensitive skin and sensitive areas. The hardest part I find is getting the right consistency, I usually ended up with a thick liquid but it still worked - I scraped it up really well, afterwards, just rinse it with water in the shower.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  A must have. I shave with a razor for quick shaves but every two days or so. I gotta use the good ol releiable to prevent my face from bumping up.  When I shave with this im smooth as a baby&#x27;s rump! No smell with this and the gold can too..The best of all powders</li>
            <li> Purchased after seeing this product on a YouTube video. It definitely took the hair off of my legs completely without over drying the skin. It does have that awful odor associated with depilatory products, so make sure you have plenty of ventilation. The youtuber claimed that this product would keep my legs hair free for over a week...not so much. And I already have pretty fine hair so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it has grown back and &amp;#34;softer.&amp;#34;  But overall a good product that was easy to use. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it throughout the summer, not sure about the rest of the year.</li>
            <li> Does its job. Be careful not to leave on too long. If you have bumps than this stuff will get rid of them along with removing hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black man and had a terrible time shaving. Tried many many times to shave with the typical razor, electric shaver with shaving cream, in the shower, with hair clippers and nothing ever really worked. I even went to a dermatologist and all he did was give me some cream for the razor bumps (which didn&#x27;t help). He was a Caucasian dermatologist and might not of really understood my struggle. I finally decided to try the magic shave razorless cream and after settling with the mild sensitive skin cream I felt like I finally found the answer. I had to leave it on for like 9 minutes but the razor bumps were not that bad. Then one day i decided to use the powder and now I will never use anything else ever again. This is an answer to my shaving prayers. After my first shave my face never felt smoother and with barely any irritation. Any black man having trouble shaving please try this it really worked for me. When my boys get old enough to shave I will pass this on to them so they don&#x27;t have to struggle with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Its going to take a few shaves to get a system on how to mix it...so far it&#x27;s been kinda messy for me. I suggest getting a pseudo razor. It helps when removing creamy mixture. I&#x27;m using a TI razor (which you can also purchase here on amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever had trouble shaving (black men) this really could be your answer. It was mine</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that helps prevents ingrown hairs on me.  I cant really shave anymore because of that reason so I settle with this. This is gentle enough to use on your most sensitive areas, but I would recommend using it every other day. A tip for using this is before applying, find something to brush your whiskers so they are all standing up otherwise the cream wont be able to reach the roots. I gave this 4 stars because it is messy and I dont like the smell.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair disolve, but I thought it was like shaving, in that I would have had to use it daily. Better than hot wax fore sure.</li>
            <li> Product is WAY TOO WEAK for me. 5 starstars because I caled magic shave and they sent me a reimbursement check and made a recommendation  for me to use their max strength cream; that doesnt work well either bUT kudos to the customer service .</li>
            <li> makes his face smooth as a baby ,no ingrown hairs to fight with.&lt;br /&gt;He is a Happy Man, me too !!</li>
            <li> This is the best depilatory I have used so far but the water added to dilute the product does not easily mix up creating a mess when shaving.</li>
