            <li>She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I choose this product because it had a lot of good review both on Amazon and Valentines Day gift idea websites and because it is relatively inexpensive.&lt;br</li>

            <li>With this being said, if you&#x27;re looking for a pretty sweet fragrance this is it!</li>

            <li>:) It&#x27;s a very nice &amp; long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m forever attemtpting to find something that does, and well-this not only takes the cake for shipping to APO, but also for the price, the amazing smell, the packaging, and</li>
            <li>They came in the original box and sealed securely with clear wrap.</li>
            <li>The scent is soft, alluring, sexy, and everyone wants to know the name.  </li>

            <li>Very much a winner.</li>

            <li>This seller sold the perfume sold the perfume at a reasonable price which was discounted!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Someone would have to be pretty close to smell it on you after a while.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I was looking for something more along the lines of woody/musky.</li>
            <li>I had got it as a gift a few years back and lost the full bottle, so happy</li>
            <li>I happened to stumble upon this one at my sister in laws home, and have been in love with it ever since.</li>
            <li>smells good doesnt last long</li>
            <li>I am sure glad i did, this perfume is so romantic, it&#x27;s not to strong or to weak.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Too much competition..</li>
            <li>(words straight from my girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bottle is really cute as well (think chanel no 5 style with a little bling) and the packaging is also nothing to laugh at, it comes in an adorable little pinkish/purple box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this seller because of their high product quality standards and fast shipping service.</li>
            <li>And at that price, well-I think it just might have become one of my new favorites!  </li>
            <li>I typically like to wear Dolce and Gabbana, Burberry, and Danielle by Danielle Steele, but many perfume sellers dont&#x27; ship APO (Army Post Office, aka overseas)</li>
            <li>was satisfied to pay less on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am extremely particular when it comes to perfume.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes from reading the reviews</li>
            <li>WOW just freaking WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because I wanted to try something new, but didn&#x27;t want to break the bank in the process.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, and I&#x27;m so shocked at how cheap it is for what you get!  </li>
            <li>you ladies who are not sure , I promise you you will love it and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the good part:  this stuff smells like a very expensive, fun, playful scent...</li>
            <li>A very decent lasting power.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly surprised that it isn&#x27;t flying off the shelves...</li>
            <li>This perfume has a soft but distinguished smell.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this purchase is for my best girlfriend who is celebrating her birthday in a few days.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe I found it so cheap usually pay almost $50 for it at the store.</li>
            <li>It is a long lasting fragrance but not as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li>It lasts quite a while but not long enough for me, I would tattoo it on if I could.</li>

            <li> This is a nice and it&#x27;s name says sensual perfume I recommend.</li>
            <li> smells good doesnt last long</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for. 2 years and people call me to ask what it is and say they can still smell it 24 hours later on their clothing after a hug</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted to try something new, but didn&#x27;t want to break the bank in the process.  I&#x27;m currently in the middle east (Iraq) and there are plenty of \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; places out here, but they wear off quickly, and are seriously diluted with who-knows-what?  This stuff is amazing, and I&#x27;m so shocked at how cheap it is for what you get!  I&#x27;m honestly surprised that it isn&#x27;t flying off the shelves...well maybe it is, I have sort of been out of the loop for awhile  lol.  But the scent is really good, and I&#x27;m forever getting compliments on it. The bottle is really cute as well (think chanel no 5 style with a little bling) and the packaging is also nothing to laugh at, it comes in an adorable little pinkish/purple box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the good part:  this stuff smells like a very expensive, fun, playful scent...wonderful!  It is sort of floral with a little bit of sweet in there, perfect for literally any occasion.  And at that price, well-I think it just might have become one of my new favorites!  I typically like to wear Dolce and Gabbana, Burberry, and Danielle by Danielle Steele, but many perfume sellers dont&#x27; ship APO (Army Post Office, aka overseas) so I&#x27;m forever attemtpting to find something that does, and well-this not only takes the cake for shipping to APO, but also for the price, the amazing smell, the packaging, and you can&#x27;t forget the shipping speed!  I&#x27;m hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note-I am NOT affiliated in any way shape or form with any seller here on Amazon.  I write reviews because I want other people to know how the product worked out for me, and hopefully help them to make an informed decision.  I do not receive any compensation, and I&#x27;ll just as quickly give a 1 star review if I had a bad experience with the product/seller.  Good luck, and happy perfume hunting!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hannah</li>
            <li> I must say the last time a gentleman gave me a bottle of perfume - it was in a very beautiful bottle but the smell turned my stomach. Needless to say that was a turn off to me. One of my favorite thing is perfume so if you don&#x27;t have a real good noise for it  then just don&#x27;t do it - or how about you look at my dresser and see what is almost gone--most likely YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WORNG WITH THAT. (Smiling)  I just was given this bottle. I love that way the bottle looked and guess what the smell is Astonishing. Very Very Lady-like and feminine. I just Love it . And looking on here the price is not bad at all. This is a great pick.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts all day, which I like.  A little goes a long way.  It gives you a sexy and flirty feel, a nice perfume for the money.  I love how the bottle is shaped.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume!! Was very hard to find until it was suggested to try amazon. Glad that I listened.</li>
            <li> This perfume sparkle with bright and very seductive notes. Reminds me the Crystal Bright Perfume from Versace.</li>
            <li> Order from AAA Merchant through Amazon and got exactly what I wanted. The package was great, still in plastic and MUCH cheaper than I found anywhere else.  And oh it smells great!</li>
            <li> its a favorite fragrance of mine.  I love it !!</li>
            <li> I had no idea how great this perfume&#x27;s smell was.  I was just going off of what other people&#x27;s reviews were.  I am sure glad i did, this perfume is so romantic, it&#x27;s not to strong or to weak.  Other people will defiantly notice you, and. Want to get a second sniff.</li>

            <li> This perfume smells wonderful.  Every time I wear it, I get a lot of compliments.  This seller sold the perfume sold the perfume at a reasonable price which was discounted!  The product came to me within two weeks and it was in excellent condition.  I recommend this seller because of their high product quality standards and fast shipping service.</li>

            <li> I ordered this item from reading the reviews. I&#x27;m disappointed. But overall my buying experience was good. I received pkg on time and I will purchase again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is the quickest I have ever received a product I purchased through Amazon.  Honestly, my perfume got to me wihin two days.  It was shipped the same day I placed the order.  Great service!  This is my second time ordering Sensual by Johan B Perfume.  Unfortunately, this purchase is for my best girlfriend who is celebrating her birthday in a few days.  I wish I could have gotten two bottles because I love the perfume so much.  The scent is soft, alluring, sexy, and everyone wants to know the name.  I always feel sexy when wearing it.  I know that my girlfriend will also enjoy it.  Thanks again for such great service.</li>
            <li> I love it. Muy delicious</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Exactly what I was looking for !!!</li>
            <li> Got my perfume today and it&#x27;s packaged perfectly and I am very pleased! This is one of my many favorite scents!</li>
            <li> This perfume rocks! Its my fave! With the sweet but citrus notes, makes me so happy, confident, feeling, fresh and clean when I go out in public. It lasts quite a while but not long enough for me, I would tattoo it on if I could. Wish I could carry small one in my purse at all times!</li>
            <li> Just like its name. This fragance smells so delicious. Its kinda fruity and sweet. A very decent lasting power. Reminds me of the Coco Mademoiselle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just a total perfume addicted and this fragance has quickly become one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> WOW just freaking WOW!!!  I love this perfume so much.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very glamorous, sexy and playful scent.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me you will not be disappointed, at all! Now I want to try all the fragrances by Johan!</li>
            <li> been using this for years I always get complimented. can&#x27;t believe I found it so cheap usually pay almost $50 for it at the store.</li>
            <li> Yes it did my mom loves it</li>
            <li> Delicious , very good smell. I love it</li>
            <li> love this perfume it smells delicious and so does everybody who smells it on them</li>
            <li> was satisfied to pay less on Amazon. I fell in love with the scent when introduced to it. This one can be loved by almost anyone. Great for evening or day time. Elegant and not over powering. I really loved it and will soon order another as I gave the first away as a gift to a very good friend.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a soft but distinguished smell. It smells elegant and feminine. I have been wearing this perfume for 4 years now and I always get complimented on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great price, lovely smell. I have bought this a few times from Amazon and I love it. More a day time perfume.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Sweet smell, not bad for a day to day</li>
            <li> Smell is wonderful but it doesn&#x27;t last. I had high hopes from reading the reviews but I won&#x27;t reorder this.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells heavenly when you put it on HOWEVER, in a matter of a half hour the smell disappears.  I am unsure if I received a diluted version of this perfume and am a bit disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> always and forever the most amazing scent ever.</li>
            <li> I am extremely particular when it comes to perfume. I can never find the perfect scent. I happened to stumble upon this one at my sister in laws home, and have been in love with it ever since. I usually grow tired of perfumes after a short while, but not this one. It&#x27;s absolutely pretty and makes me feel glamorous when I wear it! For everyone who says that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last, you should buy a perfume optimizer. With this being said, if you&#x27;re looking for a pretty sweet fragrance this is it! This price only adds to the greatness of this scent.</li>
            <li> This Perfume is strong but smells AWESOME!.....Its Sexy....Passionate .....and alluring......A Friend of mine had on John B Black for Men.......It was so Sexy...smelled so Good , I looked for the Female Fregrances by John B.....Of course amazon has everything.....I took a chance on this and was not disapointed....</li>
            <li> Absolutely my one of my FAVORITE fragrances. I receive many compliments every time I wear this fragrance.... I can&#x27;t help smelling myself when I have it on lol. Very much a winner.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves this scent. It was also at a great price. Thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased Sensual because the reviews said it the scent was long lasting. It did smell good but it only lasted on me for an hour. I have a hard time finding a fragrance that last on my skin so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  It didn&#x27;t  work for me but it was inexpensive</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing. It is a sensual sweet floral scent. It is a long lasting fragrance but not as strong as I expected. Someone would have to be pretty close to smell it on you after a while. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I was looking for something more along the lines of woody/musky. My mistake there. That&#x27;s my personal idea of &amp;#34;sensual&amp;#34; scents. But it does smell very good and I will wear it for sure. Happy with my purchase. Price isn&#x27;t bad at all for what you get! Arrived in a timely manner as well.</li>
            <li> I must say, I LOVE THIS PERFUME! I had got it as a gift a few years back and lost the full bottle, so happy I found it online! Great smell and buy! Recommend!</li>
            <li> My coworker put me on to this perfume, and it smells great. It&#x27;s floral (but not in a granny way) and sensual. I got alot of compliments off of this perfume. A must have in your collection. And it lasts more than 5 hours.... Don&#x27;t give as a gift to be nice.... Too much competition..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for Valentines Day. She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I choose this product because it had a lot of good review both on Amazon and Valentines Day gift idea websites and because it is relatively inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to try to explain the scent it has, but it is very feminine and very appealing. My girlfriend love wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;The glass bottle also looks &amp;#34;pretty and stylish&amp;#34; (words straight from my girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product as a great gift. She will love it.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this perfume at the mall for a considerable amount and was extremely surprised to see it at a great price ($20) online. I ordered a couple but they arrived separately yet prompt. They came in the original box and sealed securely with clear wrap. They were not old/expired/dated. :) It&#x27;s a very nice &amp; long lasting fragrance. God bless.ðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œâ˜º</li>
            <li> I was blown away by the fragrance!!! I get complements for it all the time!!! Smells amazing. Wish it woud last little longer...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
            <li> AS SOON AS I OPENED THE PACKAGE , I REALIZED I HAD BOUGHT THE SAME THING ONCE BEFORE BASED UPON REVIEWS HERE AND ELESWHERE. THIS FRAGRANCE IS JUST BAD, I USED IT FOR BATHROOM DEODORIZER. DO NOT RECOMMEND. I QUESS THATS WHY PRICE IS SO LOW.</li>
