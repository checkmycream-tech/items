            <li>Gave it to my husband and he smells lovely with this cologne, he also smells wonderful without it!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite and best picks.</li>

            <li>My brother loves this cologne and I am always able to get a great price for this at Christmas time!</li>
            <li>I think it smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be pleasantly deep-scented without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>It can be pricey, but what good cologne isnt now a days.</li>
            <li>but it smells good</li>
            <li>Sounded good to me.  </li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>Its good and smells really good.</li>
            <li>The price was really good too.  </li>
            <li>This is a fairly versatile cologne.</li>
            <li>He gets compliments on how good he smells</li>
            <li>Burberry is great, I am never disappointed and Amazon is great too.</li>
            <li>The lingering hours after that are okay, but not as great.</li>
            <li>This is a great young manly smelling scent that is perfect for date nights or even work.</li>
            <li>but i have no doubt it smells lovely!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to no one, so there is more for me!</li>

            <li>Great Smell, smoove relaxing not to strong...</li>
            <li>Amazing cologne.</li>
            <li>and when i opened it it was amazing</li>
            <li>I find that this fragrance is good for day, but is even better for evening wear.  </li>
            <li>It has ROSE kind of smell.</li>
            <li>If you work in a office this would be a nice one to wear that wouldn&#x27;t be overpowering.</li>
            <li>But could also be used for a nice dinner or night out on the town.</li>
            <li>but I find it is best appreciated in the evening during the fall/winter seasons.  </li>
            <li>Now this is one nicely scented men spray.</li>
            <li>The ladies are loving it.</li>
            <li>I remembered he liked this spray for men.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived just a day after i ordered it, in excellent conditions and the most important thing is that my husband and i love the smell of burberry brit.  </li>
            <li>This product is 100% real and a great price!</li>
            <li>Some too strong, others too fair.</li>
            <li>It smells delicious, it last all day and the price is good too.</li>
            <li>This perfume was the perfect gift for my husband who&#x27;s very peaky at this department</li>
            <li>This is by far the best EDT I have found.  </li>
            <li>Nice to be able to come to Amazon and grab it cheaper then in stores.</li>
            <li>It smells really sexy, no too strong, def a good gift for a man.</li>
            <li>price is right on Amazon and shipping is great.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to come off to strong!</li>
            <li>I have received more compliments with this fragrance than many others, which baffles me because it is so popular.</li>
            <li>I just tried this once, but it seems to be a great fragrance per that first time that I tried it.</li>
            <li>I love the fashionable bottle and the scent.</li>
            <li>just lovely.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and friends</li>
            <li>are in love with this one too.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>We both love the smell on this cologne</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells on my husband.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone that tends to get headaches from overwhelming scents of stronger cologne.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It smells sophisticated to me, but also youthful.</li>
            <li>I love Burberry&#x27;s bottle designs as well.</li>
            <li>I love the pricing that is offered, but question the authenticity of the cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright, but I won&#x27;t buy any more.</li>
            <li>It might be a tad more feminine</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Try it you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li>and I love the stuff.  </li>

            <li>Women all comment on it :-)</li>
            <li>The ladies love it.</li>
            <li>grab one and enjoy!</li>
            <li>and im sitting here smelling the scent more then writing this review because i love the smell that much.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>Got this for my husband for Christmas and absolutely LOVE it on him.</li>
            <li>In addition, women LOVE this scent.  </li>
            <li>I can say I&#x27;m glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li>absolutly love this cologne.</li>
            <li>Dad was pleased with the gift.</li>
            <li>I also bought ck eternity from this site but it seems like a replica it lasts 1 hour.. But smells way better than this product.</li>
            <li>from OKC, I&#x27;d have better results and prices ordering from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have had many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Women really love it.  </li>
            <li>I Love how it smells,  </li>
            <li>bottle smells like a nice light coat of baby powder.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for in a cologne?</li>
            <li>Favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Everyone seems to love the smell.</li>
            <li>Genuine Stuff, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>realy love this,,,,,,</li>
            <li>I will recommend to go to a store first before purchasing and smell it and try it on you to see if it suits you!!!</li>
            <li>It makes for a good first impression as well.</li>
            <li>He was really excited about the size !</li>
            <li>This product has a very good fragrance mild but gently kind of a fresh capturing scent every time you pass someone and it lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>Cheap is not always better</li>
            <li>and so do I, I am thinking about getting him the whole smell good collection.</li>
            <li>but quickly takes a very musky tone that is very, very nice.</li>
            <li>As to be expected by Burberry, Brit is the kind of scent that smells great on any man.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong to wear to work or an evening out.</li>
            <li>I thought it came on too strong and</li>
            <li>It lasts more than any other cologne I have used and the smell is incredibly awesom.</li>
            <li>Beautiful scent which I can not get enough of!</li>
            <li>love love it&lt;br /&gt;Big bottle cam very fast</li>
            <li>The scent is a beautiful mixture of clean, warm, sophisticated, masculine and soft.</li>
            <li>smells rich, moderately strong, lasts 1/2 to 1 day.</li>
            <li>Great smell, last long,love the smell of it and so do the ladies.</li>
            <li>Women seem to enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much this scent grows on you.</li>
            <li>Not as mature smelling as most Burberrys; it&#x27;s perfect for younger men.  </li>
            <li>I wonder is it because I bought this from Amazon on a discount and is there a reason why it&#x27;s discounted in first place!!</li>
            <li>it seems I smell hits of baby powder, its a very fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>the transaction was quick and easy and they delivered the product as soon as they promised.  </li>
            <li>Not met expectations as per original that I tested at Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I find it fresh and people have asked me what I have on!</li>
            <li>I first got a sample when I bought another cologne and fell in love with this.</li>
            <li>This is not the original.</li>
            <li>Well, it came in a package that resembled original packaging</li>
            <li>original.</li>
            <li>It has a rich, gourmet smell that reminds you of fall.</li>
            <li>smell rich?</li>
            <li>Accurate description and quick turnaround.</li>
            <li>It is a well rounded yet unique scent for men who do not want to smell off the rack but like something special.</li>
            <li>Very clean and crisp but manly.  </li>
            <li>Its got pretty good projection, im new to this one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s juuuuust Right!</li>
            <li>It was shipped right away !</li>
            <li>that because of the powdery sweet scent the cologne has bothered one of my friends and makes them sneeze a lot.</li>
            <li>it is fairly sweet so</li>
            <li>Real breezy, Refreshing, &amp; Mild.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are considering buying one such thing, this one must be a good buy.</li>
            <li>handled my complaint perfect.</li>
            <li>It smelled good and lasting power.</li>
            <li>It projects well and last for a good 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily for work and get complemented on how good it smells .</li>
            <li>But time try something new and so far response has been great.  </li>
            <li>I hesitate to speculate what is actually in the scent, but it is certainly distinct in a pleasant way.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend says it smells too strong when first applied, but once it has a chance to blend with (my) body chemistry</li>
            <li>Brit&#x27;s strength is that it is the perfect subtle blend spicy, powdery, sweet scents which do not overpower the senses.  </li>
            <li>I can only describe it as a bitter-spicy first impression which rapidly gives away to a sophisticated, spicy/sweet kind of \\&quot;powderish\\&quot; after-smell.</li>
            <li>but the strength of scent fading away quick makes me suspicious.</li>
            <li>As for the fragrance, I love this one, personal favorite.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and expediant and the price almost made this a steal for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping is very fast !</li>
            <li>If your special someone has an overly sensitive nose I would suggest an alternative cologne with more musk.</li>
            <li>its a very strong odor, its no bad, but better for an old person, i expected a better odor from burberry</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It is very masculine and elegant.</li>
            <li>It was awesome way better then going to the mall &amp; dealing with the people there who try to sell you all kinds of other colognes &amp; other things.</li>
            <li>And I think it&#x27;s good for single men !&lt;</li>
            <li>Save your money and get the real deal, as this smells like a cheap rubbing alcohol, not Burberry Brit.</li>
            <li>A fresh oriental woody fragrance.</li>
            <li>This scent is woodsy but fresh, young and yet sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying out.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of it, but unaware how would it smell on me.</li>
            <li>, the mist is nice and big, the smell is identical and for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Its worth the buy and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>fresh scent&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>recommend this to guys from 18-39, 40 onwards we need more mature smell.</li>
            <li>This has just the right mix, and my wife loves it on me.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of spice and musk in it.</li>
            <li>overall its not bad either, It is ok.</li>
            <li>The middle and later scents are my favorite and are kind of rosy and musky.</li>
            <li>I dont like this Burbery as much as London or Touch, but its not bad.</li>
            <li>It is really nice and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>All Burberry fragrances are unique and have a particular signature.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it arrived so quickly in its original, sealed packaging.</li>
            <li>and i seem to like it more and more every few minutes.</li>
            <li>Great for the special moments, work and other social gathering events.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice but does not last long and almost fades away quickly.</li>
            <li>The fragrance has good staying power; a single, well-placed application easily lasts for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>and it is had very gentle smell to it,</li>
            <li>Wears out very fast too.</li>
            <li>The price here is great as I know there are some other websites where it is nearly $30 costlier than here.</li>
            <li>i personally think is one of my favorite .</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 mins.</li>
            <li>first time I buy it online and the last!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>This is the longest lasting and most versatile Burberry fragrance for men.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of a cologne.</li>
            <li>the words of Goldielocks: \\&quot;It&#x27;s Not to Hot...</li>
            <li>Okay, definitely feminine.</li>
            <li>Burberry also has a Summer scent, but they change the formula periodically, so I won&#x27;t purchase it without trying t first.</li>
            <li>Burberry Brit is consistently a winner.</li>
            <li>I wish i could describe the scent better but definitely a manly cologne.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying fragrances from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because I had read some reviews regarding people receiving inauthentic fragrance or having fragrances diluted with alcohol.  </li>
            <li>This one at first breaks into its opening notes with a bit of a powdery aroma, which can give off a bit of a feminine vibe, however, allow it to settle a bit</li>
            <li>I was expecting &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; but found it to be more like generic Brut cologne or something along those lines.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing the bottle when he first opened it</li>
            <li>My first try with this spray.</li>
            <li>New packaging, full bottle, no issues.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is ok to wear year round but make sure you use less spritz during the warmer months since warm weather can make scents seem stronger and this one already has some strength (not too much though).</li>
            <li>After a 15 min wait, the Lady at the other side suggested to sell on my own to recover my money as Amazon does not return perfumes.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products and could never find one that my wife liked the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love this cologne, and it is going to be hard for me to find one that I like better than this.</li>
            <li>I was able to buy this much cheaper on Amazon that I would have at my local stores!</li>
            <li>Looking forward for some more products like this.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance stays for a long time.</li>
            <li>Really good classic fragrance that is not too heavy.</li>
            <li>This another Cologne to add to my collection for daily use, highly recommended, and of course the girls love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,Leo.</li>
            <li>I thought i was ordering a certain product i was used to</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t strong enough (not like the real one).</li>
            <li>Thanks for the Suggestion AMAZON..</li>
            <li>He really likes it.  </li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>This fragrance captures a ruff and tuff sense with a modern flair.</li>
            <li>Until this moment, I have thrown five empty bottles and I am ordering two more in the way.</li>
            <li>It smells too much like a woman&#x27;s perfume...</li>
            <li>very like...</li>
            <li>Its very suttle</li>
            <li>especially if you get free shipping with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, and much appreciated by co-workers.</li>
            <li>All that&#x27;s needed is 1 to 2 sprays &amp; your straight for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I really like this spray....</li>
            <li>Absolute junk.  </li>
            <li>It was a reasonable price</li>
            <li>It is not an overbearing scent, but really makes you just want to keep smelling it.  </li>
            <li>so i can&#x27;t comment to much about its staying power</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>very musky.  </li>
            <li>The scent lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>He likes it so much</li>
            <li>This is a cologne you really just need to smell</li>
            <li>thanks to the reviwes it saw online.</li>
            <li>The point being that each individual has a unique body chemistry which melds well with certain scents.</li>
            <li>The cologne smells very sweet, but has a little bit of a powdery fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li>I added this to my rotation due to its striking difference from the majority of the scents I wear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dark, but gives off a nice classy scent.</li>
            <li>they also included a nice little gift as a thank you!  </li>
            <li>But I will get another one from Amazon.com as long as it has free shipping.</li>
            <li>Very stylish without being too overbearing for the other person and also not generic or soapy.</li>
            <li>This is most definitely the real deal and would definitely recommend...</li>
            <li>, he now loves it more than the previous.</li>
            <li>This is a classic.  </li>
            <li>My older boys wanted me to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the best parts of the cologne can only be smelled for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>People love it and it can be worn year round, from the office to the club.  </li>
            <li>Most colognes don&#x27;t last very long these days either.</li>
            <li>So as long as you purchase DIRECTLY from Amazon and not a third party seller you will be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have chosen this my new signature scent.</li>
            <li>So I was getting a new suite at the Men&#x27;s Wearhouse for my sister&#x27;s wedding.  </li>
            <li>i live in the caribbean.&lt;br /&gt;Sillage and projection are average.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it does not smell very strong or dull.</li>
            <li>I only wish they had larger bottles available.</li>
            <li>the scent wasn&#x27;t as pleasing or subtle as I would have liked it to.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have purchased cologne online - normally I spend time at a counter and smell a bunch to finally</li>
            <li>I have been noticed this Fragrances for long time, I got it for $35.00 plus shipping fee here, and its actually a good deal, cuz the small ones are sometimes sold in Marshall with this price, but not every time you can find this Fragrances there...  </li>
            <li>This cost almost twice as much at the major department stores.  </li>
            <li>The product spray head is actually nice and dispenses a clean spray where some colognes spray small messy sprays.</li>
            <li>I definitely would not have bought this cologne if I had tried it first.</li>
            <li>I order about two items a week on Amazon, and this was the first and only time I&#x27;ve been sold something that wasn&#x27;t what it claimed to be.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what it was supposed to be and at only a fraction of the cost that you would pay in dept. stores.</li>
            <li>Very soft yet masculine.</li>
            <li>This product arrived in its original box, factory sealed, in typical Amazon packaging to protect from the turbulence of shipping.</li>
            <li>This is some old stock and amazon does not accept returns.&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>After looking in some perfume/cologne stores, this was much cheaper online and smells just the same!</li>
            <li>The natural phermones in my skin mix with the cologne</li>
            <li>I like it so much that my husband actually puts it on when he RETURNS home from work!  </li>
            <li>if your in highschool, its to mature a smell for that.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>This product smells like old people do.</li>
            <li>Manly scent yet soft and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Lasts pretty long too, on me anyway.</li>
            <li>old son.  </li>
            <li>He thinks it is to be used more for formal occasions than for everyday use, and will not use it for &#x27;hanging out&#x27;, possibly for work on some days.</li>
            <li>So as long as you use it in a reasonable time frame and keep the fragrance in a cool, dark environment, it will have the longevity and maintain the pungency one is looking for.  </li>
            <li>Wish the smell would last for a couple more hours at least.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, but he thought it smelled a little too clean or something, so I sprayed it on me, and it smells completely different!</li>
            <li>It is one of those scents that last all day long, really.  </li>
            <li>then Macy&#x27;s, only to realize that Burberry is a Old Stock when I got the shipment.</li>
            <li>Amazon makes everything simple to order and offers competitive pricing.</li>
            <li>I wear it to work most of the time and never get tired of the smell.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and after opening the packaging it felt like the bottle was not original and the fragrance was strong and not like the other original product I&#x27;ve used in past.</li>
            <li>but one I don&#x27;t really like - probably due to the sensory overload.  </li>
            <li>okay, some I hated, but this one is my favorite formal scent.</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve tried about two dozen different colognes (sample vials) from just about all the major designers, and none have topped it.  </li>
            <li>Women don&#x27;t normally say that to me, so I consider this money well spent.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> It smells great on my man, and settles into a delicious, warm, manly, but somehow vanilla like scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Added bonus: you can find it for dirt cheap on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice and it stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> Its very nice.  </li>
            <li> This is the best smelling cologne that I have come across, keeps me smelling great but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my husband and he smells lovely with this cologne, he also smells wonderful without it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite and best picks.</li>
            <li> Packaging was perfect, after Christmas I will be able to review sent, I purchased off others rating recomendation.</li>
            <li> My brother loves this cologne and I am always able to get a great price for this at Christmas time!</li>
            <li> I think it smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be pleasantly deep-scented without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> It can be pricey, but what good cologne isnt now a days.</li>
            <li> but it smells good</li>
            <li> Sounded good to me.  </li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> Its good and smells really good.</li>
            <li> The price was really good too.  </li>
            <li> This is a fairly versatile cologne.</li>
            <li> He gets compliments on how good he smells</li>
            <li> Burberry is great, I am never disappointed and Amazon is great too.</li>
            <li> The lingering hours after that are okay, but not as great.</li>
            <li> This is a great young manly smelling scent that is perfect for date nights or even work.</li>
            <li> but i have no doubt it smells lovely!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to no one, so there is more for me!</li>

            <li> Amazing cologne.</li>
            <li> and when i opened it it was amazing</li>
            <li> I find that this fragrance is good for day, but is even better for evening wear.  </li>
            <li> It has ROSE kind of smell.</li>
            <li> If you work in a office this would be a nice one to wear that wouldn&#x27;t be overpowering.</li>
            <li> But could also be used for a nice dinner or night out on the town.</li>
            <li> but I find it is best appreciated in the evening during the fall/winter seasons.  </li>
            <li> Now this is one nicely scented men spray.</li>
            <li> The ladies are loving it.</li>
            <li> I remembered he liked this spray for men.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived just a day after i ordered it, in excellent conditions and the most important thing is that my husband and i love the smell of burberry brit.  </li>
            <li> This product is 100% real and a great price!</li>
            <li> Some too strong, others too fair.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious, it last all day and the price is good too.</li>
            <li> This perfume was the perfect gift for my husband who&#x27;s very peaky at this department</li>
            <li> This is by far the best EDT I have found.  </li>

            <li> It smells really sexy, no too strong, def a good gift for a man.</li>
            <li> price is right on Amazon and shipping is great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to come off to strong!</li>
            <li> I have received more compliments with this fragrance than many others, which baffles me because it is so popular.</li>
            <li> I just tried this once, but it seems to be a great fragrance per that first time that I tried it.</li>
            <li> I love the fashionable bottle and the scent.</li>

            <li> I love the way it smells on my husband.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone that tends to get headaches from overwhelming scents of stronger cologne.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It smells sophisticated to me, but also youthful.</li>
            <li> I love Burberry&#x27;s bottle designs as well.</li>
            <li> I love the pricing that is offered, but question the authenticity of the cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, but I won&#x27;t buy any more.</li>
            <li> It might be a tad more feminine</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Try it you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li> and I love the stuff.  </li>

            <li> and im sitting here smelling the scent more then writing this review because i love the smell that much.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and absolutely LOVE it on him.</li>
            <li> In addition, women LOVE this scent.  </li>
            <li> I can say I&#x27;m glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li> absolutly love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Dad was pleased with the gift.</li>
            <li> I also bought ck eternity from this site but it seems like a replica it lasts 1 hour.. But smells way better than this product.</li>
            <li> from OKC, I&#x27;d have better results and prices ordering from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have had many compliments.  </li>
            <li> Women really love it.  </li>
            <li> I Love how it smells,  </li>
            <li> bottle smells like a nice light coat of baby powder.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for in a cologne?</li>
            <li> Favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Everyone seems to love the smell.</li>
            <li> Genuine Stuff, I really liked it.</li>
            <li> realy love this,,,,,,</li>
            <li> I will recommend to go to a store first before purchasing and smell it and try it on you to see if it suits you!!!</li>
            <li> It makes for a good first impression as well.</li>
            <li> He was really excited about the size !</li>
            <li> This product has a very good fragrance mild but gently kind of a fresh capturing scent every time you pass someone and it lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> Cheap is not always better</li>
            <li> and so do I, I am thinking about getting him the whole smell good collection.</li>
            <li> but quickly takes a very musky tone that is very, very nice.</li>
            <li> As to be expected by Burberry, Brit is the kind of scent that smells great on any man.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong to wear to work or an evening out.</li>
            <li> I thought it came on too strong and</li>
            <li> It lasts more than any other cologne I have used and the smell is incredibly awesom.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent which I can not get enough of!</li>
            <li> love love it&lt;br /&gt;Big bottle cam very fast</li>
            <li> The scent is a beautiful mixture of clean, warm, sophisticated, masculine and soft.</li>
            <li> smells rich, moderately strong, lasts 1/2 to 1 day.</li>
            <li> Great smell, last long,love the smell of it and so do the ladies.</li>
            <li> Women seem to enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much this scent grows on you.</li>
            <li> Not as mature smelling as most Burberrys; it&#x27;s perfect for younger men.  </li>
            <li> I wonder is it because I bought this from Amazon on a discount and is there a reason why it&#x27;s discounted in first place!!</li>
            <li> it seems I smell hits of baby powder, its a very fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> the transaction was quick and easy and they delivered the product as soon as they promised.  </li>
            <li> Not met expectations as per original that I tested at Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I find it fresh and people have asked me what I have on!</li>
            <li> I first got a sample when I bought another cologne and fell in love with this.</li>
            <li> This is not the original.</li>
            <li> Well, it came in a package that resembled original packaging</li>
            <li> original.</li>
            <li> It has a rich, gourmet smell that reminds you of fall.</li>
            <li> smell rich?</li>
            <li> Accurate description and quick turnaround.</li>
            <li> It is a well rounded yet unique scent for men who do not want to smell off the rack but like something special.</li>
            <li> Very clean and crisp but manly.  </li>
            <li> Its got pretty good projection, im new to this one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s juuuuust Right!</li>
            <li> It was shipped right away !</li>
            <li> that because of the powdery sweet scent the cologne has bothered one of my friends and makes them sneeze a lot.</li>
            <li> it is fairly sweet so</li>
            <li> Real breezy, Refreshing, &amp; Mild.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are considering buying one such thing, this one must be a good buy.</li>
            <li> handled my complaint perfect.</li>
            <li> It smelled good and lasting power.</li>
            <li> It projects well and last for a good 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily for work and get complemented on how good it smells .</li>
            <li> But time try something new and so far response has been great.  </li>
            <li> I hesitate to speculate what is actually in the scent, but it is certainly distinct in a pleasant way.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says it smells too strong when first applied, but once it has a chance to blend with (my) body chemistry</li>
            <li> Brit&#x27;s strength is that it is the perfect subtle blend spicy, powdery, sweet scents which do not overpower the senses.  </li>
            <li> I can only describe it as a bitter-spicy first impression which rapidly gives away to a sophisticated, spicy/sweet kind of \\&quot;powderish\\&quot; after-smell.</li>
            <li> but the strength of scent fading away quick makes me suspicious.</li>
            <li> As for the fragrance, I love this one, personal favorite.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and expediant and the price almost made this a steal for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping is very fast !</li>
            <li> If your special someone has an overly sensitive nose I would suggest an alternative cologne with more musk.</li>
            <li> its a very strong odor, its no bad, but better for an old person, i expected a better odor from burberry</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It is very masculine and elegant.</li>
            <li> It was awesome way better then going to the mall &amp; dealing with the people there who try to sell you all kinds of other colognes &amp; other things.</li>
            <li> And I think it&#x27;s good for single men !&lt;</li>
            <li> Save your money and get the real deal, as this smells like a cheap rubbing alcohol, not Burberry Brit.</li>
            <li> A fresh oriental woody fragrance.</li>
            <li> This scent is woodsy but fresh, young and yet sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying out.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of it, but unaware how would it smell on me.</li>
            <li> , the mist is nice and big, the smell is identical and for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Its worth the buy and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> fresh scent&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> recommend this to guys from 18-39, 40 onwards we need more mature smell.</li>
            <li> This has just the right mix, and my wife loves it on me.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of spice and musk in it.</li>
            <li> overall its not bad either, It is ok.</li>
            <li> The middle and later scents are my favorite and are kind of rosy and musky.</li>
            <li> I dont like this Burbery as much as London or Touch, but its not bad.</li>
            <li> It is really nice and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> All Burberry fragrances are unique and have a particular signature.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it arrived so quickly in its original, sealed packaging.</li>
            <li> and i seem to like it more and more every few minutes.</li>
            <li> Great for the special moments, work and other social gathering events.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice but does not last long and almost fades away quickly.</li>
            <li> The fragrance has good staying power; a single, well-placed application easily lasts for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> and it is had very gentle smell to it,</li>
            <li> Wears out very fast too.</li>
            <li> The price here is great as I know there are some other websites where it is nearly $30 costlier than here.</li>
            <li> i personally think is one of my favorite .</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 mins.</li>
            <li> first time I buy it online and the last!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This is the longest lasting and most versatile Burberry fragrance for men.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of a cologne.</li>
            <li> the words of Goldielocks: \\&quot;It&#x27;s Not to Hot...</li>
            <li> Okay, definitely feminine.</li>
            <li> Burberry also has a Summer scent, but they change the formula periodically, so I won&#x27;t purchase it without trying t first.</li>
            <li> Burberry Brit is consistently a winner.</li>
            <li> I wish i could describe the scent better but definitely a manly cologne.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying fragrances from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because I had read some reviews regarding people receiving inauthentic fragrance or having fragrances diluted with alcohol.  </li>
            <li> This one at first breaks into its opening notes with a bit of a powdery aroma, which can give off a bit of a feminine vibe, however, allow it to settle a bit</li>
            <li> I was expecting &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; but found it to be more like generic Brut cologne or something along those lines.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing the bottle when he first opened it</li>
            <li> My first try with this spray.</li>
            <li> New packaging, full bottle, no issues.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is ok to wear year round but make sure you use less spritz during the warmer months since warm weather can make scents seem stronger and this one already has some strength (not too much though).</li>
            <li> After a 15 min wait, the Lady at the other side suggested to sell on my own to recover my money as Amazon does not return perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and could never find one that my wife liked the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love this cologne, and it is going to be hard for me to find one that I like better than this.</li>
            <li> I was able to buy this much cheaper on Amazon that I would have at my local stores!</li>
            <li> Looking forward for some more products like this.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> Really good classic fragrance that is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This another Cologne to add to my collection for daily use, highly recommended, and of course the girls love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,Leo.</li>
            <li> I thought i was ordering a certain product i was used to</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t strong enough (not like the real one).</li>
            <li> Thanks for the Suggestion AMAZON..</li>
            <li> He really likes it.  </li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance captures a ruff and tuff sense with a modern flair.</li>
            <li> Until this moment, I have thrown five empty bottles and I am ordering two more in the way.</li>
            <li> It smells too much like a woman&#x27;s perfume...</li>
            <li> very like...</li>
            <li> Its very suttle</li>
            <li> especially if you get free shipping with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, and much appreciated by co-workers.</li>
            <li> All that&#x27;s needed is 1 to 2 sprays &amp; your straight for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I really like this spray....</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.  </li>
            <li> It was a reasonable price</li>
            <li> It is not an overbearing scent, but really makes you just want to keep smelling it.  </li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t comment to much about its staying power</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> very musky.  </li>
            <li> The scent lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> He likes it so much</li>
            <li> This is a cologne you really just need to smell</li>
            <li> thanks to the reviwes it saw online.</li>
            <li> The point being that each individual has a unique body chemistry which melds well with certain scents.</li>
            <li> The cologne smells very sweet, but has a little bit of a powdery fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li> I added this to my rotation due to its striking difference from the majority of the scents I wear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark, but gives off a nice classy scent.</li>
            <li> they also included a nice little gift as a thank you!  </li>
            <li> But I will get another one from Amazon.com as long as it has free shipping.</li>
            <li> Very stylish without being too overbearing for the other person and also not generic or soapy.</li>
            <li> This is most definitely the real deal and would definitely recommend...</li>
            <li> , he now loves it more than the previous.</li>
            <li> This is a classic.  </li>
            <li> My older boys wanted me to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the best parts of the cologne can only be smelled for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> People love it and it can be worn year round, from the office to the club.  </li>
            <li> Most colognes don&#x27;t last very long these days either.</li>
            <li> So as long as you purchase DIRECTLY from Amazon and not a third party seller you will be satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I have chosen this my new signature scent.</li>
            <li> So I was getting a new suite at the Men&#x27;s Wearhouse for my sister&#x27;s wedding.  </li>
            <li> i live in the caribbean.&lt;br /&gt;Sillage and projection are average.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does not smell very strong or dull.</li>
            <li> I only wish they had larger bottles available.</li>
            <li> the scent wasn&#x27;t as pleasing or subtle as I would have liked it to.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have purchased cologne online - normally I spend time at a counter and smell a bunch to finally</li>
            <li> I have been noticed this Fragrances for long time, I got it for $35.00 plus shipping fee here, and its actually a good deal, cuz the small ones are sometimes sold in Marshall with this price, but not every time you can find this Fragrances there...  </li>
            <li> This cost almost twice as much at the major department stores.  </li>
            <li> The product spray head is actually nice and dispenses a clean spray where some colognes spray small messy sprays.</li>
            <li> I definitely would not have bought this cologne if I had tried it first.</li>
            <li> I order about two items a week on Amazon, and this was the first and only time I&#x27;ve been sold something that wasn&#x27;t what it claimed to be.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what it was supposed to be and at only a fraction of the cost that you would pay in dept. stores.</li>
            <li> Very soft yet masculine.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in its original box, factory sealed, in typical Amazon packaging to protect from the turbulence of shipping.</li>
            <li> This is some old stock and amazon does not accept returns.&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li> After looking in some perfume/cologne stores, this was much cheaper online and smells just the same!</li>
            <li> The natural phermones in my skin mix with the cologne</li>
            <li> I like it so much that my husband actually puts it on when he RETURNS home from work!  </li>
            <li> if your in highschool, its to mature a smell for that.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> This product smells like old people do.</li>
            <li> Manly scent yet soft and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Lasts pretty long too, on me anyway.</li>
            <li> old son.  </li>
            <li> He thinks it is to be used more for formal occasions than for everyday use, and will not use it for &#x27;hanging out&#x27;, possibly for work on some days.</li>
            <li> So as long as you use it in a reasonable time frame and keep the fragrance in a cool, dark environment, it will have the longevity and maintain the pungency one is looking for.  </li>
            <li> Wish the smell would last for a couple more hours at least.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, but he thought it smelled a little too clean or something, so I sprayed it on me, and it smells completely different!</li>
            <li> It is one of those scents that last all day long, really.  </li>
            <li> then Macy&#x27;s, only to realize that Burberry is a Old Stock when I got the shipment.</li>
            <li> Amazon makes everything simple to order and offers competitive pricing.</li>
            <li> I wear it to work most of the time and never get tired of the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and after opening the packaging it felt like the bottle was not original and the fragrance was strong and not like the other original product I&#x27;ve used in past.</li>
            <li> but one I don&#x27;t really like - probably due to the sensory overload.  </li>
            <li> okay, some I hated, but this one is my favorite formal scent.</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve tried about two dozen different colognes (sample vials) from just about all the major designers, and none have topped it.  </li>
            <li> Women don&#x27;t normally say that to me, so I consider this money well spent.  </li>
            <li> A soft seductive scent that last very long!!</li>
            <li> Burberry Brit is classic cologne with sweet floral and citrus first notes followed by oriental spice and woodsy base notes.  </li>
            <li> so much, long story short</li>
            <li> long it last and works - That - I do not know.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes it, the scent also is long lasting.</li>
            <li> The cologne is fantastic--doesn&#x27;t appear to be old or watered down.</li>
            <li> last long !</li>
            <li> Smells like Wood, Bergamot and Cardomom and Nutmeg and  Grey Musk .</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was not disappointed with this cologne.</li>
            <li> If you receive something other than what Amazon advertised, send it back.</li>
            <li> will last about 4 -7 hours depending on how active you are.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it if you aren&#x27;t single....</li>
            <li> The salesman who was helping me suggested that I might shop around and find it for less and get a bigger bottle too.  </li>
            <li> While buying perfume at my local Macy&#x27;s store, curiously I checked the price in Amazon and it was half the price.</li>
            <li> I might buy it a little later.  </li>
            <li> Not baby powder in a bad way more like in an enhancing way.  </li>
            <li> alot faster than expected.</li>
            <li> What I have received has always smelled correct, however after a few reviewers pointed out, the potency seems to be lack luster and not last.</li>
            <li> There was arabic writing on the bottom, but the obvious dead giveaway was the smell.  </li>
            <li> I use it only when I am going out, - Its not for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> not a head turner, but is little above average.</li>
            <li> Brit has a scent of sophistication so a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li> It has a sour citrus bitter tobacco smell to it that by no means turns me on or makes me swoon.</li>
            <li> Think it may have lost some of it&#x27;s strength due to shelf life</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any other man.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because he had told me that he was running low and wanted a change just not sure what to get.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other brand names I have used, the smell on this one runs off in about 6 hours - and I work in an office, so its not like I am sweating it out during the day.</li>
            <li> A bigger size and less pricey than the small bottle at the Wearhouse.  </li>
            <li> watered down imitation feel.</li>
            <li> thanks for the expensive water though.</li>
            <li> that is until it died down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It starts off gingery and citrusy then gets to a musky scent (i dont like musks) and dries down to a powdery scent.</li>
            <li> Everything on Amazon is cheaper than retail, but my guess is the fragrances are overstock from the previous year, hence the surplus and knock down of price per ounce.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what my wife said, and a few of the other ladies in my life.</li>
            <li> It has no character even compared to other mass-produced and heavily worn colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I decided to order online along with Aqua Di Gio, which was also 10% less</li>
            <li> I could give it less than one star I would.</li>
            <li> and it was half the price&lt;</li>
            <li> It lasts all day (6-8 hours in ac ool room) and I do \\&quot;like\\&quot; the smell, but it is very typical and bland.</li>
            <li> Either it was fake or really, really old.</li>
            <li> At one point in time, I purchased about 10 colognes within a few months, scent un-smelled.</li>
            <li> He is not even down the stairs yet and I can small his cologne already.</li>
            <li> This is THE WORST do not buy unless you want to smell like a women because it reminds me of my grandmothers white diamonds as soon as I smelled this I called up a friend and told him I had a present, so if you value your money and MANHOOD then buy another kind, not to mention IT IS BOOTLEG!!</li>
            <li> It smells like aftershave when you first spray it on, which is bad.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what caused the other people to have issues, but do not hesitate to order based on the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> After reading various reviews about this product being fake I became a little bit scared about purchasing it.</li>
            <li> It is not sweet in the least.</li>
            <li> It is watered down cologne!!</li>
            <li> I have used Allure by Chanel the past couple of years and was always well received.  </li>
            <li> But It works at least for few hours.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It is a bad combination of several so called manly scents that have turned sour in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to not get this order correct.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is similar...definitely not satisfied!</li>
            <li> and it will produce subtle woodsy, aromatic notes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s ridiculous</li>
            <li> Gotta say, was a little skeptical buying cologne online.</li>
            <li> I have read a few reviews saying this was fake.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to sell a knock off, you should at least put a bit of effort in it!  </li>
            <li> When I first bought this, I thought it smelled like baby powder and was disgusted...</li>
            <li> This is going to be his staple cologne from now on, no more changing!!  </li>
            <li> and I only use one spray from the base of my neck up to my beard line.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product and after a couple of weeks when I used it maybe for the 10th time, the mechanism got broken.</li>
            <li> its not a great deal&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I got a fake version.</li>
            <li> My biggest worry was that it was fake as others have said in these reviews.</li>
            <li> Mine does not seem fake.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I smelled this fragrance before at the store, but was insecure about it.</li>
            <li> Also women come up to me and say random things just to start a conversation.</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this selection.</li>
            <li> still doubt if it is a fake one or not</li>
            <li> Worst of all the smell goes away in less then 10 mins.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to Cold...</li>
            <li> im stuck with it :(</li>
            <li> I hate every time my husband wears this.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t very bad either.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not met expectations as per original that I tested at Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;But overall its not bad either, It is ok.</li>
            <li> its a very strong odor, its no bad, but better for an old person, i expected a better odor from burberry</li>
            <li> I hate every time my husband wears this. It smells horrible. I actually get a headache from it. It&#x27;s gross.</li>
            <li> While buying perfume at my local Macy&#x27;s store, curiously I checked the price in Amazon and it was half the price. So I decided to order online along with Aqua Di Gio, which was also 10% less then Macy&#x27;s, only to realize that Burberry is a Old Stock when I got the shipment. Worst of all the smell goes away in less then 10 mins.My wife did not even realize i used this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried returning from Amazon dot com; only to find out that perfumes are not returnable. Called the Amagzon customer service to return both items oh which one is unopened. After a 15 min wait, the Lady at the other side suggested to sell on my own to recover my money as Amazon does not return perfumes. Thanks for the Suggestion AMAZON..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY FROM DISCOUNTED PERFUMES. YOU MAY BE CURSING YOURSELF ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to not get this order correct. You know what something smells like and you order it. Amazon makes everything simple to order and offers competitive pricing.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my husband and he smells lovely with this cologne, he also smells wonderful without it!</li>
            <li> My son loves this cologne.  I bought it as a gift and he was very pleased!</li>
            <li> i have yet to open the cologne but i have no doubt it smells lovely! especially the brand it is.  it&#x27;s a gift for my dad. the transaction was quick and easy and they delivered the product as soon as they promised.  they also included a nice little gift as a thank you!  i would buy from amazon.com and this vendor again!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He really likes it.  I think it smells pleasant.  I was able to buy this much cheaper on Amazon that I would have at my local stores!</li>
            <li> I guess you could say I&#x27;m a cologne enthusiast and I bought this cologne never having tried it before. Needless to say I was not disappointed with this cologne. I love the fashionable bottle and the scent. The cologne smells very sweet, but has a little bit of a powdery fresh scent to it. It&#x27;s one of those colognes that you want to be wearing when you snuggle up to or hug someone. I will note however that because of the powdery sweet scent the cologne has bothered one of my friends and makes them sneeze a lot. If your special someone has an overly sensitive nose I would suggest an alternative cologne with more musk.</li>
            <li> This is THE WORST do not buy unless you want to smell like a women because it reminds me of my grandmothers white diamonds as soon as I smelled this I called up a friend and told him I had a present, so if you value your money and MANHOOD then buy another kind, not to mention IT IS BOOTLEG!! Read some comments before you buy I wish I would have</li>
            <li> The perfume lasts for appro. 8 hours on me. It is very masculine and elegant. The sillage is relative close. IMO, it works well on middle-aged men.</li>
            <li> Compre de regalo a mi hijo y quedo maravillado al igual que sus amigas. El aroma es divino y le perdura en el cuerpo, se siente  desde lejos, a el le favorece mucho y si el esta conforme, yo lo estoy mucho m&amp;aacute;s.</li>
            <li> The cologne Burberry Brit is one of my favourites now as I bought it to try it out and it is had very gentle smell to it, just lovely.</li>
            <li> Great smell, last long,love the smell of it and so do the ladies. I get the \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot; alot. I would recommend this purchase, it also got to the house in two days alot faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, but he thought it smelled a little too clean or something, so I sprayed it on me, and it smells completely different! (maybe it&#x27;s a girl thing!) ANYWAY! I find it fresh and people have asked me what I have on!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my son. He really likes it. He thinks it is to be used more for formal occasions than for everyday use, and will not use it for &#x27;hanging out&#x27;, possibly for work on some days. I find it to be pleasantly deep-scented without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s Burberry Brit.This fragrance captures a ruff and tuff sense with a modern flair. A fresh oriental woody fragrance. Smells like Wood, Bergamot and Cardomom and Nutmeg and  Grey Musk .</li>
            <li> This is a great young manly smelling scent that is perfect for date nights or even work. The product spray head is actually nice and dispenses a clean spray where some colognes spray small messy sprays. Great deal as always buying on Amazon!</li>
            <li> As to be expected by Burberry, Brit is the kind of scent that smells great on any man. It is not too strong to wear to work or an evening out.</li>
            <li> This product has a very good fragrance mild but gently kind of a fresh capturing scent every time you pass someone and it lasts the whole day. Excellent indeed</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was. I thought i was ordering a certain product i was used to but it wasnt now im stuck with it :(</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is the most foul smelling perfume for men I have ever had the unfortunate chance to smell on my husband. I bought this for him for Christmas because I was going by all the rave reviews on Amazon. It is not sweet in the least. It has a sour citrus bitter tobacco smell to it that by no means turns me on or makes me swoon. It causes me to have a headache every time he puts it on. It is a bad combination of several so called manly scents that have turned sour in the bottle. Take my advice, DON&#x27;T BUY IT!If I could give it less than one star I would.</li>
            <li> I first got a sample when I bought another cologne and fell in love with this. It lasts more than any other cologne I have used and the smell is incredibly awesom. I love the smell and friends are in love with this one too. The price here is great as I know there are some other websites where it is nearly $30 costlier than here.</li>
            <li> everybody tells me it smell great. i personally think is one of my favorite .</li>
            <li> It is my favorite perfume. Until this moment, I have thrown five empty bottles and I am ordering two more in the way. Although it is toilette spray, it is fragrance stay for along time.</li>
            <li> Everyone i know loves this cologne fragrance. I only wish they had larger bottles available. It can be pricey, but what good cologne isnt now a days.</li>
            <li> I had to give this product 3 stars. The product wasn&#x27;t very good and it wasn&#x27;t very bad either. I probably won&#x27;t ever buy this again, if I ever go through this bottle or don&#x27;t give it away. If I would have smelled it in the store then I don&#x27;t I would&#x27;ve ever bought it. It smells too much like a woman&#x27;s perfume...very like...um, baby powderish I guess. As for the 3 stars, this is considering the following since amazon doesn&#x27;t give any set guidelines for them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star: horrible&lt;br /&gt;2 stars: below average&lt;br /&gt;3 stars: average&lt;br /&gt;4 stars: above average&lt;br /&gt;5 stars: great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- D.</li>
            <li> I got a fake version. The package was opened before and was resealed with scotch tape... Bar Code was glued on.</li>
            <li> This perfume was the perfect gift for my husband who&#x27;s very peaky at this department the only 2 perfumes he has used before were Allure Sport an d Hugo Boss. I wanted him to try something different and this was just perfect, he now loves it more than the previous.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what my wife said, and a few of the other ladies in my life. So nothing else is required to be said.</li>
            <li> It was awesome way better then going to the mall &amp; dealing with the people there who try to sell you all kinds of other colognes &amp; other things. Great price as well you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Think it may have lost some of it&#x27;s strength due to shelf life but it smells good and it was half the price&lt;br /&gt;if i bought it at the a store. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have to say this cologne is great.  It is one of those scents that last all day long, really.  My girlfriend says it smells too strong when first applied, but once it has a chance to blend with (my) body chemistry it is intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the flavor of the smell, it is musky with semi-sweetness in the background.  I find that this fragrance is good for day, but is even better for evening wear.  I also like the plaid bottle design; it gives it that \\&quot;British\\&quot; staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So go ahead, purchase Burberry Brit and get your British on.</li>
            <li> I I have used Allure by Chanel the past couple of years and was always well received.  But time try something new and so far response has been great.  Its very suttle and I only use one spray from the base of my neck up to my beard line.  Brit has a scent of sophistication so a little can go a long way. Don&#x27;t want to come off to strong!</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and could never find one that my wife liked the smell.  We both love the smell on this cologne and I have been wearing it for the last two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right on Amazon and shipping is great.</li>
            <li> This is a manly scent that is not over-powering. I wear it to work most of the time and never get tired of the smell. Others will notice and comment about this scent. It makes for a good first impression as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last week, I trusted the purchase because it is sold by Amazon. The smell doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 mins. This is some old stock and amazon does not accept returns.&lt;br /&gt;Stay away.</li>
            <li> This is not the original. It is watered down cologne!! first time I buy it online and the last!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it so much, long story short it feels like lime when i use it. Wears out very fast too.</li>
            <li> This is the longest lasting and most versatile Burberry fragrance for men. The value of this item on Amazon is unbeatable.....especially if you get free shipping with Amazon Prime. Burberry is great, I am never disappointed and Amazon is great too. This scent is woodsy but fresh, young and yet sophisticated. It is a well rounded yet unique scent for men who do not want to smell off the rack but like something special. This fragrance is ok to wear year round but make sure you use less spritz during the warmer months since warm weather can make scents seem stronger and this one already has some strength (not too much though). A great buy since department stores sell this size Brit for over $60.</li>
            <li> I dont like this Burbery as much as London or Touch, but its not bad.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells on my husband.  A soft seductive scent that last very long!! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice but does not last long and almost fades away quickly. I wonder is it because I bought this from Amazon on a discount and is there a reason why it&#x27;s discounted in first place!! Well, it came in a package that resembled original packaging so I doubt but the strength of scent fading away quick makes me suspicious.</li>
            <li> I found Brit about a year ago.  Since then, I&#x27;ve tried about two dozen different colognes (sample vials) from just about all the major designers, and none have topped it.  Brit&#x27;s strength is that it is the perfect subtle blend spicy, powdery, sweet scents which do not overpower the senses.  Women seem to enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li> This scent has been well received by all the ladies that I know.  Very soft yet masculine. I would recommend to anyone that tends to get headaches from overwhelming scents of stronger cologne.</li>
            <li> I have chosen this my new signature scent. Not overpowering, and much appreciated by co-workers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much this scent grows on you. I absolutely love it. It smells sophisticated to me, but also youthful. Very nice. I love Burberry&#x27;s bottle designs as well. Definitely worth trying out.</li>
            <li> I definitely would not have bought this cologne if I had tried it first. I thought it came on too strong and the scent wasn&#x27;t as pleasing or subtle as I would have liked it to. I can only describe it as a bitter-spicy first impression which rapidly gives away to a sophisticated, spicy/sweet kind of \\&quot;powderish\\&quot; after-smell. This change in mood is the reason why I won&#x27;t get rid of Brit by Burberry - it truly becomes a pleasing, all day fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a classic.  Not as mature smelling as most Burberrys; it&#x27;s perfect for younger men.  People love it and it can be worn year round, from the office to the club.  Warning:  it is fairly sweet so do not buy if you want something musky and traditional.&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus: you can find it for dirt cheap on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I used to buy all of my cologne on Amazon, but reading peer reviews now I am second guessing my decision. I love the pricing that is offered, but question the authenticity of the cologne. What I have received has always smelled correct, however after a few reviewers pointed out, the potency seems to be lack luster and not last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, but I won&#x27;t buy any more. guess my chemistry or season is off. I do not what to think.  My older boys wanted me to give it a try.  I might buy it a little later.  Ron</li>
            <li> This is one of the best perfumes I have ever used. It is really nice and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I know what Burberry Brit smells like, and this 100% was not it.  There was arabic writing on the bottom, but the obvious dead giveaway was the smell.  Drop in to any Macy&#x27;s to get a sample smell of Burberry Brit.  If you&#x27;re going to sell a knock off, you should at least put a bit of effort in it!  I order about two items a week on Amazon, and this was the first and only time I&#x27;ve been sold something that wasn&#x27;t what it claimed to be.  Save your money and get the real deal, as this smells like a cheap rubbing alcohol, not Burberry Brit.</li>
            <li> This another Cologne to add to my collection for daily use, highly recommended, and of course the girls love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,Leo.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of a cologne. My biggest worry was that it was fake as others have said in these reviews. Mine does not seem fake. The smell lasts anywhere between 4-5 hours and develops as it should. I am going to go to Macy&#x27;s and sample it just to double check but I&#x27;m pretty sure it is the real deal. Anyway I like the smell a lot and find my self smelling my wrist. The middle and later scents are my favorite and are kind of rosy and musky. It might be a tad more feminine than I would have like but no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of colognes over the years. Some too strong, others too fair. This has just the right mix, and my wife loves it on me.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I smelled this fragrance before at the store, but was insecure about it. Took a big risk by purchasing it. I liked the smell of it, but unaware how would it smell on me. Just going to say the risk I took turned out to be AMAZING!!!! Perfect fragrance for the fall, or going out at night, Women will go nuts and guys too. I will recommend to go to a store first before purchasing and smell it and try it on you to see if it suits you!!!</li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price we could find for this product. Really good classic fragrance that is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and after a couple of weeks when I used it maybe for the 10th time, the mechanism got broken. Never hepent this in a Burberry Brit and is the 5th time when I buy same one. I onestly doubt on quality for this seller: it&#x27;s the only explanation!</li>
            <li> Great Smell, smoove relaxing not to strong... Real breezy, Refreshing, &amp; Mild.&lt;br /&gt;·Just visualize being in the Bahamas...... #It&#x27;sOnChill. Ya Dig!  It could worn for any Occasion. All that&#x27;s needed is 1 to 2 sprays &amp; your straight for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;In the words of Goldielocks: \\&quot;It&#x27;s Not to Hot... It&#x27;s not to Cold... It&#x27;s juuuuust Right!</li>
            <li> I love this product. This is one of my favorite and best picks. I would recommend this colonge to anyone. Try it you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li> So I was getting a new suite at the Men&#x27;s Wearhouse for my sister&#x27;s wedding.  I&#x27;d been w/o a calogne 4 months.  They happened to have this Burberry Brit which I tried.  Wow! I like it.  The salesman who was helping me suggested that I might shop around and find it for less and get a bigger bottle too.  Sounded good to me.  I thanked him and headed to the Amazon site.  There it was.  A bigger size and less pricey than the small bottle at the Wearhouse.  So I&#x27;m very happy with the fragrance and I get complements too!  Win, win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it you&#x27;ll like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for two months and I love the stuff.  After looking in some perfume/cologne stores, this was much cheaper online and smells just the same!</li>
            <li> Nice item and works great! If you are considering buying one such thing, this one must be a good buy.</li>
            <li> Okay, definitely feminine. But still it gives off a gentlemens vibe. I feel way more polite and just try to be a \\&quot;gentleman\\&quot; whilst wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still would recommend this because it gets tons of compliments and isnt so ubiquitous</li>
            <li> The product: My favourite scent - I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now. Well packaged. Burberry also has a Summer scent, but they change the formula periodically, so I won&#x27;t purchase it without trying t first. Burberry Brit is consistently a winner. Women all comment on it :-) The price is the best here. Accurate description and quick turnaround.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray....in the morning I put some on my wrists and rub it on my neck and head out. The natural phermones in my skin mix with the cologne and I get lots of compliments. Also women come up to me and say random things just to start a conversation. Don&#x27;t buy it if you aren&#x27;t single....this one will make your girlfriend jealous</li>
            <li> Good. I like it. Its good and smells really good.It has ROSE kind of smell. I use it only when I am going out, - Its not for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;How long it last and works - That - I do not know. But It works at least for few hours.&lt;br /&gt;Will I get another one - Ans is no. But I will get another one from Amazon.com as long as it has free shipping.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.  Either it was fake or really, really old. Smelled like a cologne would buy at the grocery store.  I bought from Amazon and notified them of my dissatisfaction and customer service handled my complaint perfect.</li>
            <li> It smelled good and lasting power. The price was really good too.  I would recommend this product to any other man.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments when I&#x27;m out on the town. The ladies love it. I would say this is a great smell for a man that cares about his appearance.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling cologne that I have come across, keeps me smelling great but isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I recommend this to no one, so there is more for me!</li>
            <li> I already knew how this product was going to smell. So I just went ahead and brought it. The 5 stars are for the price for the quantity.</li>
            <li> smell last for hours. if you had this cologne before you know its wonderful. will last about 4 -7 hours depending on how active you are. and depending on what environment your in.  original.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have purchased cologne online - normally I spend time at a counter and smell a bunch to finally but one I don&#x27;t really like - probably due to the sensory overload.  I based my decision on the ratings for this and I am very happy.  The scent is very nice and it stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because he had told me that he was running low and wanted a change just not sure what to get.  My daughter has always been a big fan of Burberry so I thought I would check out the reviews of others who have tried this one.  It was a reasonable price so I thought I would give it a try thinking that if he didn&#x27;t like it (or I didn&#x27;t) then we could give it to our daughter for her boyfriend.  I like it so much that my husband actually puts it on when he RETURNS home from work!  It is not an overbearing scent, but really makes you just want to keep smelling it.  Very clean and crisp but manly.  This is going to be his staple cologne from now on, no more changing!!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this, I thought it smelled like baby powder and was disgusted...that is until it died down. It has a rich, gourmet smell that reminds you of fall. It has just the right amount of spice and musk in it. For this price, I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle.</li>
            <li> Burberry Brit is classic cologne with sweet floral and citrus first notes followed by oriental spice and woodsy base notes.  It projects well and last for a good 8 hours.  You can not go wrong with this selection.</li>
            <li> I got this, didn&#x27;t realise it was a &amp;#34;vaporizer&amp;#34; and not a standard bottle of cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, the mist is nice and big, the smell is identical and for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a win win.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wanna smell rich? grab one and enjoy! lol</li>
            <li> Amazing cologne. Im giving it 4 stars. But that could change to 5 if i keep smelling this wonderful cologne. It smells like aftershave when you first spray it on, which is bad. but quickly takes a very musky tone that is very, very nice. it changes the longer it sits on your skin and i seem to like it more and more every few minutes. I wish i could describe the scent better but definitely a manly cologne. I sprayed it on my wrist to write this review and im sitting here smelling the scent more then writing this review because i love the smell that much.&lt;br /&gt;  This is a fairly versatile cologne. If you work in a office this would be a nice one to wear that wouldn&#x27;t be overpowering. But could also be used for a nice dinner or night out on the town. Not something if your in highschool, its to mature a smell for that.&lt;br /&gt;  3 sprays should do it with this one. Its got pretty good projection, im new to this one so i can&#x27;t comment to much about its staying power but i will say this. When i got this delivered to my house. I opened it up, sprayed it on my wrist one time. Went to sleep soon after and when i woke up, still could smell this one on my wrist. Good stuff, very good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and after opening the packaging it felt like the bottle was not original and the fragrance was strong and not like the other original product I&#x27;ve used in past.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and absolutely LOVE it on him. He is not even down the stairs yet and I can small his cologne already. The scent is a beautiful mixture of clean, warm, sophisticated, masculine and soft. Very stylish without being too overbearing for the other person and also not generic or soapy. Beautiful scent which I can not get enough of!</li>
            <li> watered down imitation feel. wasn&#x27;t strong enough (not like the real one). thanks for the expensive water though. not what I wanted</li>
            <li> I just tried this once, but it seems to be a great fragrance per that first time that I tried it.</li>
            <li> A woman hugged me and said my cologne smelled \\&quot;seductive.\\&quot;  Women don&#x27;t normally say that to me, so I consider this money well spent.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes it, the scent also is long lasting. Cheaper than I could find in the stores, so I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s a win.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying fragrances from Amazon.  And with that being said, buy the fragrances FROM Amazon LLC. I was hesitant at first because I had read some reviews regarding people receiving inauthentic fragrance or having fragrances diluted with alcohol.  This product arrived in its original box, factory sealed, in typical Amazon packaging to protect from the turbulence of shipping. So as long as you purchase DIRECTLY from Amazon and not a third party seller you will be satisfied.  In some reviews I read some have speculated and cried product fraud because they are cheaper than department stores.  Everything on Amazon is cheaper than retail, but my guess is the fragrances are overstock from the previous year, hence the surplus and knock down of price per ounce. However fragrance, especially EDT, has a shelf life of 3-5 years.  So as long as you use it in a reasonable time frame and keep the fragrance in a cool, dark environment, it will have the longevity and maintain the pungency one is looking for.  As for the fragrance, I love this one, personal favorite.  All Burberry fragrances are unique and have a particular signature. This one at first breaks into its opening notes with a bit of a powdery aroma, which can give off a bit of a feminine vibe, however, allow it to settle a bit and it will produce subtle woodsy, aromatic notes.  It is not overbearing and does not produce a dominating presence.  However fragrance should never be worn to drown peoples&#x27; olfactory, and we all know that guy.  In addition, women LOVE this scent.  I have received more compliments with this fragrance than many others, which baffles me because it is so popular. It can be worn during the day but I find it is best appreciated in the evening during the fall/winter seasons.  But bottom line, buy with confidence FROM Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been noticed this Fragrances for long time, I got it for $35.00 plus shipping fee here, and its actually a good deal, cuz the small ones are sometimes sold in Marshall with this price, but not every time you can find this Fragrances there...  so this it a very good deal for 3.3 oz bottle&lt;br /&gt;It smells great ! last long ! And I think it&#x27;s good for single men !&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is very fast ! It was shipped right away !</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent! It smells great on my man, and settles into a delicious, warm, manly, but somehow vanilla like scent. You don&#x27;t need much. This bottle should last awhile!</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews about inferior product received, I was a bit hesitant when ordering this.  Paired with Amazon&#x27;s no 2 day shipping and no return&#x27;s on fragrances, I felt as I was taking a bit of a risk when I ordered this. I can say I&#x27;m glad I took the chance. Well worth it. New packaging, full bottle, no issues. I am not sure what caused the other people to have issues, but do not hesitate to order based on the negative reviews. If you receive something other than what Amazon advertised, send it back. You received the incorrect item</li>
            <li> very musky.  I was expecting &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; but found it to be more like generic Brut cologne or something along those lines.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, and it is going to be hard for me to find one that I like better than this. The shipping was quick and expediant and the price almost made this a steal for me. I will definitely be buying from again in the future.</li>
            <li> Longevity is about 6 hrs.. i live in the caribbean.&lt;br /&gt;Sillage and projection are average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts off gingery and citrusy then gets to a musky scent (i dont like musks) and dries down to a powdery scent. I wear this to the office when i dont feel like wearing anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because when i tested it the citrus had stayed on my skin, but that wasnt the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its not a head turner, but is little above average.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what it was supposed to be and at only a fraction of the cost that you would pay in dept. stores.</li>
            <li> If you want your man to smell great buy him this. My hubby loves it and so do I. This is also a really great price !</li>
            <li> I purchased as a gift and the recipient was very happy with the choice.&lt;br /&gt;Good value too for the money.</li>
            <li> This cost almost twice as much at the major department stores.  Great bargain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Burberry Brit before and the bottle I bought from Amazon is quite a bit weaker. The fragrance is similar...definitely not satisfied!</li>
            <li> I have read a few reviews saying this was fake.  This is most definitely the real deal and would definitely recommend... however everybody has a different scent with colognes.</li>
            <li> Now this is one nicely scented men spray. Wow. The scent lasts the whole day.The ladies are loving it. Great for the special moments, work and other social gathering events. Will recommend it for all of the guys.Its worth the buy and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend for his birthday and our anniversary gift and he loves it. He gets compliments on how good he smells and I love the way it smells on him. I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing the bottle when he first opened it and now I cant stop sniffing him. It smells really sexy, no too strong, def a good gift for a man. He likes it so much and so do I, I am thinking about getting him the whole smell good collection.</li>
            <li> I bought it before and my husband was happy with this product. So, I bought it again from amazon.it is very good product.</li>
            <li> absolutly love this cologne. quality of the product great, usage everyday,would recommend to any one because it has an exquisite aroma to it</li>
            <li> Arrived in time for Christmas.  Speedy shipment.  Dad was pleased with the gift.</li>
            <li> This product smells like old people do. I do NOT recommend this cologne. I gave it away to my roommate after using it for two days. I also bought ck eternity from this site but it seems like a replica it lasts 1 hour.. But smells way better than this product. Cheap is not always better</li>
            <li> the quality is so low and you cant return it&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s ridiculous&lt;br /&gt;The smell is so so&lt;br /&gt;So its not a great deal&lt;br /&gt;but still doubt if it is a fake one or not</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other brand names I have used, the smell on this one runs off in about 6 hours - and I work in an office, so its not like I am sweating it out during the day. Wish the smell would last for a couple more hours at least.</li>
            <li> el producto llego a tiempo, son de muy buena calidad, igual a las fotos, lo recomiendo a toda la comunidad</li>
            <li> This was what one of my sons wanted for Christmas.  I knew living 45 min. from OKC, I&#x27;d have better results and prices ordering from Amazon.  He likes the gift and it saved me time and money!!!</li>
            <li> I added this to my rotation due to its striking difference from the majority of the scents I wear.  Its very nice.  I hesitate to speculate what is actually in the scent, but it is certainly distinct in a pleasant way.</li>
            <li> My first try with this spray. It will not be my last!!!  My daughter clued me on to this stuff and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best EDT I have found.  I have had many compliments.  Women really love it.  Manly scent yet soft and not overpowering.  I would recommend Brit to anyone!</li>
            <li> I Love how it smells,  I use it daily for work and get complemented on how good it smells .</li>
            <li> This is a cologne you really just need to smell it seems I smell hits of baby powder, its a very fresh scent.  Not baby powder in a bad way more like in an enhancing way.  Lasts pretty long too, on me anyway.</li>
            <li> It smells \\&quot;good,\\&quot; but for gosh sake its a cologne, that doesnt get it any stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle smells like a nice light coat of baby powder. That&#x27;s it. It lasts all day (6-8 hours in ac ool room) and I do \\&quot;like\\&quot; the smell, but it is very typical and bland. It has no character even compared to other mass-produced and heavily worn colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it to work because its very simple, unoffensive, and... well... I cant return it, so I may as well use it. If I were going on a date or out on the town, this would be my last choice.</li>
            <li> 1 day, that&#x27;s all it took! Packaging was perfect, after Christmas I will be able to review sent, I purchased off others rating recomendation.</li>
            <li> One of the best men cologne&#x27;s on the market. This bottle size last about six months and the scent has lasting power.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves the smell! He was really excited about the size !</li>
            <li> Great price for this item. My brother loves this cologne and I am always able to get a great price for this at Christmas time!</li>
            <li> This cologne has overtones of vanilla and spice, making it an excellent fragrance for late-fall and winter.  The fragrance has good staying power; a single, well-placed application easily lasts for the entire day.  As with any fragrance, do yourself an immense favor and try it out at the store before buying it.  The point being that each individual has a unique body chemistry which melds well with certain scents.</li>
            <li> During Christmas time I didn&#x27;t know what to get for my 30 yr. old son.  I remembered he liked this spray for men.  I bought it and he couldn&#x27;t thank me enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it arrived so quickly in its original, sealed packaging. The cologne is fantastic--doesn&#x27;t appear to be old or watered down. I thought this was a great value for a Burberry cologne.</li>
            <li> The product arrived just a day after i ordered it, in excellent conditions and the most important thing is that my husband and i love the smell of burberry brit.  This is the second time he buys this product.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for in a cologne? Bought this for my bro for Christmas, and the ladies have been all over him ever since.</li>
            <li> Favorite cologne. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years. Everyone seems to love the smell. Nice..clean..but grabs people attention. Nice to be able to come to Amazon and grab it cheaper then in stores.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious, it last all day and the price is good too. It arrived in two days and very good packaging</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lasting fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;Very fresh scent&lt;br /&gt;Love love love it&lt;br /&gt;Big bottle cam very fast</li>
            <li> Genuine Stuff, I really liked it. Looking forward for some more products like this.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> At one point in time, I purchased about 10 colognes within a few months, scent un-smelled. Some we okay, some I hated, but this one is my favorite formal scent. It&#x27;s dark, but gives off a nice classy scent. Unfortunately, the best parts of the cologne can only be smelled for a couple of hours. The lingering hours after that are okay, but not as great. I still give it a 5 though because of the initial scent. Most colognes don&#x27;t last very long these days either.</li>
            <li> thanks to the reviwes it saw online. i was looking for something diferent so i can wear every day to work i purchased it and when i opened it it was amazing .i realy love this,,,,,,</li>
            <li> El perfume es delicioso, lo compre para mi novio y a el le encanta y a mi tambi&amp;eacute;n, el aroma perdura hasta que se lave la ropa y hasta se queda en mi pelo. No entiendo por que tiene comentarios negativos.</li>
            <li> Gotta say, was a little skeptical buying cologne online. However once I opened the package and tried it on, smells just like the one&#x27;s I bought at the department store, just a heck of alot cheaper. Great product.</li>
            <li> After reading various reviews about this product being fake I became a little bit scared about purchasing it. After receiving it, it smells identical to the samples I received from Nordstroms. This product is 100% real and a great price!</li>
            <li> smells rich, moderately strong, lasts 1/2 to 1 day. it does not smell very strong or dull. does have a punch to it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to guys from 18-39, 40 onwards we need more mature smell.</li>
