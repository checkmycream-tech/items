            <li>It is good.</li>
            <li>It does smell good though.</li>
            <li>The pads for underneath the band smell amazing and leave your skin silky.i saw an immediate difference after I took everything off.</li>
            <li>and I liked that you could easily adjust it to your liking.</li>
            <li>but u get a warm sensation which i enjoy....</li>
            <li>Otherwise it would be a five star review for sure...</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>(i wish it was a bigger size in here tho) and the strap that u wear is comfortable and durable but the best part is the neck patches...</li>
            <li>My face is slimmer after use, I highly recommend this seller, fast shipping and awesome product .</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed, my chin is tighter, belt is not so comfortable, but results are good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a great experience so far with customer service as well as the product.</li>
            <li>I found the mask easy to apply on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly comfortable to wear</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>Sure it still takes time, it won&#x27;t be perefect in one day but this really really helps!.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best neck firming product I have used and I have tried several.</li>
            <li>i knew how to purchase more without purchasing the whole set with the strap again....</li>
            <li>I ordered different mask from this seller and have a good experience.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It shipped very fast and packaging was secure and well preserved.  </li>
            <li>This really helped to smooth out my chin and neck area</li>
            <li>but well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So hot her</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I tried the band on first</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over five month and the difference was noticeable after the first use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Would not recommend to anybody cost to much to see no results.</li>
            <li>Never heard of this brand decided to try something new for my jawline</li>
            <li>i was surprised with my results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 yrs old and have the chin of a much younger woman.</li>

            <li> It is on the expensive side</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t have a bad neck just a fatpad under my mouth/neck area  that all of the women in my family seem to inherit</li>

            <li> It is good. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I looooooooooooove these products! .... Never heard of this brand decided to try something new for my jawline and i&#x27;m happy that i did... It&#x27;s been 3 days and i see improvement... I&#x27;m 33 and i don&#x27;t have a bad neck just a fatpad under my mouth/neck area  that all of the women in my family seem to inherit and i am seeing changes already.... I like the neck cream (i wish it was a bigger size in here tho) and the strap that u wear is comfortable and durable but the best part is the neck patches... U can feel them working! It doesn&#x27;t hurt and i had no irritation but u get a warm sensation which i enjoy.... I just wish thst i knew how to purchase more without purchasing the whole set with the strap again.... Please if anyone knows contact me... Otherwise it would be a five star review for sure...</li>
            <li> Works great I hate my wife&#x27;s double chin So hot her this now LOOKS GREAT!!</li>
            <li> not satisfied. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times and see 0 results. Disappointed. In fact...i feel like my neck/chin area has just gotten worse since using this product. It does smell good though.</li>
            <li> I ordered different mask from this seller and have a good experience.&lt;br /&gt;This masks work a well  , I SAW results. Now my slight double chin is less noticeable and my jaw line has tightened up, I think it makes me look younger.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results. I found the mask easy to apply on.&lt;br /&gt;  My under chin looks tighten and slimmer, Will use again. Recommended .</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied. This is exactly what I needed, my chin is tighter, belt is not so comfortable, but results are good. Recommended.</li>
