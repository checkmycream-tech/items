            <li> I ordered this product on the 17th December, 2010. Arrived on 28th December to my Miami FL address, taken into account it may arrive after the Christmas long weekend. I live in Trinidad and Tobago and the package was delivered to me on the 29th from my courier. Condition of it was ok/safe came in a small sealed envelope. I got the same colour as in the picture (pinkish purple) I was surprised by how short the tools are though. I thought they would be longer. but I&#x27;m happy I got my dotting tools finally!!</li>
            <li> These arrived so fast I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Product was exactly as described and completely intact.  I&#x27;ve used these several times now with no problems.  You actually get 10 different sizes of dotting tools so its a great bargain.  Cleans easily with a little bit of polish remover.</li>

            <li> The Dotting tool came very quick in the mail. When I open it the Number # dotting tool came off, so what I did was hot glude it back on and thats it. Other than that I recommend this product to everyone I also give it all 5 stars. I tryed it and it works great.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional, but I love to draw dotted designs on my toenails.  This set made it much easier to make little flowers and dots.  The product is made well and has 10 different sizes.</li>
            <li> Use these for putting crystals on badges. They are the perfect size for it and are good quality, as opposed to some others I have tried.</li>
            <li> They work great. I can do fancy designs that I see online. I like that they have all the different sizes.</li>

            <li> I know the argument&#x27;s been made that you can improvise something similar, but at this cost, why not get yourself the proper tools? They&#x27;ve held up great, even after being dropped a few times, and having a wide range of sizes at my disposal is incredibly helpful.</li>
