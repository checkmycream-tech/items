            <li>For a brow pencil I am (drumroll) happy to say that I have no complaints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think it works great for me now.</li>
            <li>but I have decided to shell out the money because the color looks great.</li>
            <li>Great pencil, use it every day.</li>

            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>This pencil is amazing!</li>
            <li>This item was packaged with great care and the product is just as good</li>
            <li>Fills in my brows and helps me feel confident and beautiful!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tool to make my eye browns flawless.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and the color is perfect.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly, and matches the color of my brows perfectly.  </li>
            <li>looks good on all three of us.  </li>
            <li>It has good coverage and staying power.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and blends in perfectly.</li>
            <li>it might be good for filling in but not defining.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The shade blends perfectly with my natural brow color and the brush does a great job of blending the strokes into the brown.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This pencil does the job beautifully and accurately.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and great results.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and great quality.</li>
            <li>Great color for me and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The pencil itself is very nice, goes on easily and stays.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing....</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OKAY, but not as good as the Dior one.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s probably my own mistake).</li>
            <li>c: I&#x27;m very picky with my brow pencils, but this one is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>But nice color, after using the wand to blend.</li>
            <li>Nice color choice,  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>Liked this a lot.</li>
            <li>awesome product looks very natural, not like a crayon or like your eyebrows are drawn on.</li>
            <li>This was very classy, I am impressed and will order again!!!</li>
            <li>The color is nice and it goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s self-sharpening, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about a sharpener, and the consistency of the crayon is perfect - not too brittle, not too soft and smudgy.  </li>
            <li>okay, brush is nice.</li>
            <li>By far the BEST brow coloring system I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do squat to my brows, as they are near perfect</li>
            <li>I think it would be great for someone with darker brows or want darker brows right this minute.</li>
            <li>So easy to throw this one item (rather than a pencil and a brush) into the make-up bag for traveling too!</li>
            <li>this is the best eyebrow pencil  ever, it is the most natural looking!</li>
            <li>That being said, with a very light hand I was able to use the product, and I liked the brush that comes attached.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly</li>
            <li>but I use a very light touch</li>
            <li>This little crayon like pencil blends perfectly- and is kind of amazing.</li>
            <li>I really love it and will</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this pencil.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>I love this pencil.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, though a lot lighter in color than I thought.</li>
            <li>I love this pencil.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it three stars because the quality of the ingredients is excellent; it makes the brow hairs stand out individually</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s retractable..</li>
            <li>I love this brow pencil -</li>
            <li>I love this pencil.  </li>
            <li>But more than anything it ticks me off that i still paid $18 for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure some could solve this problem with a setting spray or something, but I don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>Love how there is a built in brow brush.</li>
            <li>This brow pencil goes on more like a gel.</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>Just use lighter strokes and blend more for blondes.</li>
            <li>I would pay $20 for the pencil alone, maybe more.</li>
            <li>They need to have more variety&lt;br /&gt;in choices.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I love the Dior brow pencil, but wanted something more inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Love this pencil.</li>
            <li>This is not my favorite brow pencil.  </li>
            <li>Once you are better at doing your brows</li>
            <li>More crayon (waxy)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>The package was wrapped all cute and</li>
            <li>It completes your facial makeup perfectly!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but it is just too pricey for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this brow pencil.  </li>
            <li>I have stopped coloring my hair and was hoping for a color that would look better with my gray.  </li>
            <li>For the money I was expecting a much better product.</li>
            <li>love the product and the price......</li>
            <li>better than the others....</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this pencil.  </li>
            <li>It is more of a chocolate color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended them to so many people since I get asked questions all the time.</li>
            <li>and since she has ordered 3 more (it&#x27;s been 6 months..)</li>
            <li>love this and will order again</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really more of an auburn in hair color.  </li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>great product would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I think most people will want color variety and a more fine application.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s reviews - good filler for all brow colors and shapes, and great value compared to other brow pencils.</li>
            <li>It should start out light and progressively get darker the more we apply.</li>
            <li>Order and delivery was excellent, but the pencil wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li>maybe my favorite brow pencil of all time, the color goes on very smoothly whicch I love, the brush at the other end is convient, I think a great product</li>
            <li>Practical and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to feather color in the sparse places on your eyebrow</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>I think the company is trying to get more profit by manufacturing the pencil in Mexico, but still charging the same amount (it was $18 before too, and I know this because it had been on my wishlist forever, lol).</li>
            <li>Stays on during the day, doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to blend in.</li>
            <li>This type of eyebrow color is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and evenly and it stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>and then the brush on the opposite end blends it all beautifully.  </li>
            <li>have very light skin with freckles and red/auburn hair and this barely works for me color wise.</li>
            <li>This blended just fine.  </li>
            <li>Have been using for over a year and it  is easy to apply and does not look &amp;#34;fakey&amp;#34; if you use a feathering application and then lightly brush.</li>
            <li>The color is fine, but the pencil itself is faulty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as fine of a tip as what is pictured either.</li>
            <li>BBBs goes on easily and smooth</li>
            <li>I have very dark brown eyebrows and the color works perfect.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair, and my eyebrows need filled in because they&#x27;re a lot lighter.</li>
            <li>I have light to medium brown hair</li>
            <li>I tried pressing really lightly and still end up with unnatural looking brows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too light for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair.  </li>
            <li>The universal brow pencils is great.</li>
            <li>I used to be a devoted BrowPower user but this product is far superior.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to work with and again, it just looks absolutely natural which I really love.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good pencil if you are just starting out because it does apply easily and wears all day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li>Completely worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>I will use it, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>As a fair to medium-skinned blonde, the color of the brow pencil does not enhance my features.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad product, just the execution needs some work.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking and easy to apply!  </li>
            <li>Wonderfully subtle yet covers flawlessly!</li>
            <li>I use Ardell powder which is easier to apply but not as bold / defined as this brow pencil.</li>
            <li>My order came quickly with a personalized thank</li>
            <li>But this product blends in perfectly; whether you apply it with a light or heavy hand, the color looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I have very sparse brows and light brown hair.</li>
            <li>Another brow pencil gets most of the action.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised and glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>I will go back to that kind of a pencil eye brow liner.</li>
            <li>it is a soft wax and more crayon-like.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat oily skin and even after 10+ hours, this stuff still looks freshly applied.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I really liked my It cosmetics universal brow pencil, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $30 on a replacement.</li>
            <li>but this is just the right color.</li>
            <li>Well, she was right.</li>
            <li>This universal color blends in perfectly on my brows which are a dark brown.</li>
            <li>The brow pencil may be a little much for every day but is great for events.</li>
            <li>I am very blonde but have darker eyebrows, this pencil works great for me and the brush at the end works well not only to straighten your brows but to blend after penciling them in.</li>
            <li>It has good reviews and is half the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I purchased a &amp;#34;Billion Dollar Brow&amp;#34; kit for a very reasonable price from Groupon, $20 for the pencil, gel, brow booster, and brow shaper.</li>
            <li>However, used it up very fast</li>
            <li>So many pencils have just a touch of red in the browns and this one doesn&#x27;t, thank goodness.  </li>
            <li>I will probably buy this again even though I didn&#x27;t like it at first.</li>
            <li>I love the universal color.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, I like the color, and so I will like just go to Sephora when I have used more of it and have them give me a pencil that has the same color.</li>
            <li>I love it cuz it actually colors the brow hairs, rather than just coloring the skin in between the brows.</li>
            <li>It goes on soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was my first brow pencil.</li>
            <li>Exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I imagined &amp;#34;universal brown&amp;#34; to be a bit more universal.  </li>
            <li>The pencil has the twist that actually works so you have more control.</li>
            <li>but she got me interested, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>It looks way more natural than other pencils and also looks better than powders I have tried.</li>
            <li>The addition of a brow brush on the other end is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>(well, fill in half and draw the arches) with the pencil, then I apply the brow concealer and highlighter, then blend the concealer a bit with the smudge brush they sell, and use the RAVEN brow powder on top with the powder brush, I then clean it up by using the smudge brush to blend the concealer and shape my brows..</li>
            <li>But after being forced to use it after I ran out of my favorite pencil and came to like it more.</li>
            <li>Even better, the color really does seem universal.</li>
            <li>Took a star away because it is too long and it does not fit very good in my makeup case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using a lit of makeup in generally and really love the natural look.</li>
            <li>The color fit my light brown brows and also my mom&#x27;s dark brown.  </li>
            <li>Also, the little &amp;#34;brow brush&amp;#34; quickly became stuck in the top</li>
            <li>Quality and with a smart pen is work together.</li>
            <li>This pencil was large and on the darker side of what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a similar pencil to the Dior Universal Brow pencil which has a fine point and is the perfect color for almost everyone with blonde to dark brunette hair.  </li>
            <li>If u want a decent brow pencil, u have to pay for it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look drawn on (if used reasonably)</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smear (if handled reasonably).</li>
            <li>This brow pencil isn&#x27;t really a pencil-</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this eyebrow pencil!</li>
            <li>I really like this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>the tip is too blunt to do much defining of your eyebrows - beware.  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>If I apply too much I just use the spooly brush to blend it in.  </li>
            <li>The pencil really lasts too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much darker than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Go with this one or one of a similar color for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting, goes on easily and completes my daily makeup routine with a nice finish.  </li>
            <li>that so closely matches my hair color, not too black, not a ridiculous red tint, just a beautiful, soft brown.  </li>
            <li>Love the brush on the other end.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush on the other side of the pencil</li>
            <li>but I LOVE the other two products.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and natural looking.</li>
            <li>Might be OK for those with really dark brows.</li>
            <li>I purchased a more expensive eyebrow pencil from Ulta and this one is much better.</li>
            <li>Even if you try to apply it lightly, the color is dark and I would not recommend for blonde or even light brown eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Liked it for a few days then the pencil started to break easily and the brush isn&#x27;t as stiff as it should be.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse natural eyebrows...</li>
            <li>I think the color is much darker than the taupey color of the It cosmetics pencil, and this formula is so soft</li>
            <li>and so I have this lovely pencil to work with on my pale face</li>
            <li>I already have fairly dark, strong eyebrows, so I won&#x27;t buy this one again.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s there doesn&#x27;t show up due to light color.  </li>
            <li>But I put my old caps on the new pencil, and so the pencil works a little bit better now.</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d come with some instructions, for some of us that are new at this...</li>
            <li>I have been using Mac brow pencil, but decided to try a new one.  </li>
            <li>It goes on lightly and only darkens with further application - as instructed!</li>
            <li>The universal color may work for many, but blondes should be careful.  </li>
            <li>The pencil is truly universal--it looks very natural with brows of any color, and it solved my problem.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this when I ordered it because I usually use a powder.  </li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t like this at first.</li>
            <li>I got my first Billion Dollar Brows as a christmas present.</li>
            <li>On the first one, it says Made in USA, and on the second, it says it was made in Mexico.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it universal.  </li>
            <li>My sister gave me my first BDB Universal Brow Pencil to try.  </li>
            <li>I went from shaving my entire eyebrows off for YEARS to deciding to grow them out and this company has helped me through the process so much!</li>
            <li>Light and long lasting.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s where people mess up, just do light strokes repeadily to get the colour you desire.</li>
            <li>Would try a clear brow wax over though to avoid smearing.  </li>
            <li>Then when I applied it, the pencil was slightly softer than before and it smears when I blend it, so i have to clean up my face after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>recommend this to all if you are wanting that natural looking brow.  </li>
            <li>Looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this pencil for brunettes looking for a natural brow filler.</li>
            <li>The pencil &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; is soft and pieces fall off.</li>
            <li>It also lasted a pretty long time</li>
            <li>Natural looking too.</li>
            <li>but it blends in so well with my natural brows</li>
            <li>It just does not appear as natural as I would prefer.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 84 year old mom whose brows have gotten sparce.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural and lasts the day.</li>
            <li>I have used other so called universal pencils and they have been fine.  </li>
            <li>It is the only product I have found that lasts, looks natural, and others have come right off when I perspire at the gym, or just throughout a long day.  </li>
            <li>Billion Dollar Brows Universal color is a nice dark color but will be too dark for a lot of people.</li>
            <li>It is fine for filling in the wider part of the brow, but not very good for creating definition along the edges.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t make little individual brush strokes to mimic little hairs, it&#x27;s just kind of blendy and blurry.</li>
            <li>However, as usual, sister was right!  </li>
            <li>Second, the crayon doesn&#x27;t blend smoothly so it leaves tiny little flakes that look like you peppered your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>and then I follow up with the tube of clear stuff which not only brushes the color thru it</li>
            <li>When I think of Universal, I think for every natural shade of brow.</li>
            <li>It is the only pencil I&#x27;ve used that looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be too dark when it first arrived</li>
            <li>I spent so much $$ on a pencil.</li>
            <li>and I end up over lining my brows if I am not careful.</li>
            <li>I paid $12.20 for barely anything.</li>
            <li>The lead was broken a bit on the top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using brow powder my whole &amp;#34;make up life&amp;#34; and was a little uneasy about trying something new, like a pencil.</li>
            <li>I use the pencil lightly and try not to put too much because then it will look fake and drawn on.</li>
            <li>I gave this 4 stars only because you can&#x27;t sharpen the tip for a more defined thin line.  </li>
            <li>no matter how lightly I pressed down, the result was too dark.  </li>
            <li>Eyebrow pens and pencils are such a hassle since most of them clearly look fake or they fade after one or two hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a universal color, so only press lightly if you&#x27;re blonde and press a little harder if you&#x27;re brunette.</li>
            <li>I have tried to make it go on lighter, but not able to accomplish the right look.  </li>
            <li>I have very dark brown to almost black eyebrow hairs, so this pencil was too light.</li>

            <li> For a brow pencil I am (drumroll) happy to say that I have no complaints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think it works great for me now.</li>
            <li> but I have decided to shell out the money because the color looks great.</li>
            <li> Great pencil, use it every day.</li>

            <li> This pencil is amazing!</li>
            <li> This item was packaged with great care and the product is just as good</li>
            <li> Fills in my brows and helps me feel confident and beautiful!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tool to make my eye browns flawless.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and the color is perfect.  </li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly, and matches the color of my brows perfectly.  </li>
            <li> looks good on all three of us.  </li>
            <li> It has good coverage and staying power.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and blends in perfectly.</li>
            <li> it might be good for filling in but not defining.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The shade blends perfectly with my natural brow color and the brush does a great job of blending the strokes into the brown.  </li>

            <li> Easy to use and great results.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and great quality.</li>
            <li> Great color for me and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The pencil itself is very nice, goes on easily and stays.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing....</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OKAY, but not as good as the Dior one.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s probably my own mistake).</li>
            <li> c: I&#x27;m very picky with my brow pencils, but this one is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> But nice color, after using the wand to blend.</li>
            <li> Nice color choice,  </li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> Liked this a lot.</li>
            <li> awesome product looks very natural, not like a crayon or like your eyebrows are drawn on.</li>
            <li> This was very classy, I am impressed and will order again!!!</li>
            <li> The color is nice and it goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s self-sharpening, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about a sharpener, and the consistency of the crayon is perfect - not too brittle, not too soft and smudgy.  </li>
            <li> okay, brush is nice.</li>
            <li> By far the BEST brow coloring system I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do squat to my brows, as they are near perfect</li>
            <li> I think it would be great for someone with darker brows or want darker brows right this minute.</li>
            <li> So easy to throw this one item (rather than a pencil and a brush) into the make-up bag for traveling too!</li>
            <li> this is the best eyebrow pencil  ever, it is the most natural looking!</li>
            <li> That being said, with a very light hand I was able to use the product, and I liked the brush that comes attached.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly</li>
            <li> but I use a very light touch</li>
            <li> This little crayon like pencil blends perfectly- and is kind of amazing.</li>
            <li> I really love it and will</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this pencil.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> I love this pencil.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, though a lot lighter in color than I thought.</li>
            <li> I love this pencil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it three stars because the quality of the ingredients is excellent; it makes the brow hairs stand out individually</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s retractable..</li>
            <li> I love this brow pencil -</li>
            <li> I love this pencil.  </li>
            <li> But more than anything it ticks me off that i still paid $18 for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure some could solve this problem with a setting spray or something, but I don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Love how there is a built in brow brush.</li>
            <li> This brow pencil goes on more like a gel.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Just use lighter strokes and blend more for blondes.</li>
            <li> I would pay $20 for the pencil alone, maybe more.</li>
            <li> They need to have more variety&lt;br /&gt;in choices.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love the Dior brow pencil, but wanted something more inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Love this pencil.</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite brow pencil.  </li>
            <li> Once you are better at doing your brows</li>
            <li> More crayon (waxy)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> The package was wrapped all cute and</li>
            <li> It completes your facial makeup perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but it is just too pricey for me.  </li>
            <li> I love this brow pencil.  </li>
            <li> I have stopped coloring my hair and was hoping for a color that would look better with my gray.  </li>
            <li> For the money I was expecting a much better product.</li>
            <li> love the product and the price......</li>
            <li> better than the others....</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this pencil.  </li>
            <li> It is more of a chocolate color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended them to so many people since I get asked questions all the time.</li>
            <li> and since she has ordered 3 more (it&#x27;s been 6 months..)</li>
            <li> love this and will order again</li>
            <li> I love the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really more of an auburn in hair color.  </li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> great product would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I think most people will want color variety and a more fine application.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s reviews - good filler for all brow colors and shapes, and great value compared to other brow pencils.</li>
            <li> It should start out light and progressively get darker the more we apply.</li>
            <li> Order and delivery was excellent, but the pencil wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li> maybe my favorite brow pencil of all time, the color goes on very smoothly whicch I love, the brush at the other end is convient, I think a great product</li>
            <li> Practical and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to feather color in the sparse places on your eyebrow</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> I think the company is trying to get more profit by manufacturing the pencil in Mexico, but still charging the same amount (it was $18 before too, and I know this because it had been on my wishlist forever, lol).</li>
            <li> Stays on during the day, doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to blend in.</li>
            <li> This type of eyebrow color is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and evenly and it stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> and then the brush on the opposite end blends it all beautifully.  </li>
            <li> have very light skin with freckles and red/auburn hair and this barely works for me color wise.</li>
            <li> This blended just fine.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for over a year and it  is easy to apply and does not look &amp;#34;fakey&amp;#34; if you use a feathering application and then lightly brush.</li>
            <li> The color is fine, but the pencil itself is faulty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as fine of a tip as what is pictured either.</li>
            <li> BBBs goes on easily and smooth</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown eyebrows and the color works perfect.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair, and my eyebrows need filled in because they&#x27;re a lot lighter.</li>
            <li> I have light to medium brown hair</li>
            <li> I tried pressing really lightly and still end up with unnatural looking brows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too light for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair.  </li>
            <li> The universal brow pencils is great.</li>
            <li> I used to be a devoted BrowPower user but this product is far superior.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to work with and again, it just looks absolutely natural which I really love.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good pencil if you are just starting out because it does apply easily and wears all day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li> Completely worth it!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> I will use it, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> As a fair to medium-skinned blonde, the color of the brow pencil does not enhance my features.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad product, just the execution needs some work.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking and easy to apply!  </li>
            <li> Wonderfully subtle yet covers flawlessly!</li>
            <li> I use Ardell powder which is easier to apply but not as bold / defined as this brow pencil.</li>
            <li> My order came quickly with a personalized thank</li>
            <li> But this product blends in perfectly; whether you apply it with a light or heavy hand, the color looks natural.  </li>
            <li> I have very sparse brows and light brown hair.</li>
            <li> Another brow pencil gets most of the action.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised and glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I will go back to that kind of a pencil eye brow liner.</li>
            <li> it is a soft wax and more crayon-like.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat oily skin and even after 10+ hours, this stuff still looks freshly applied.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I really liked my It cosmetics universal brow pencil, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $30 on a replacement.</li>
            <li> but this is just the right color.</li>
            <li> Well, she was right.</li>
            <li> This universal color blends in perfectly on my brows which are a dark brown.</li>
            <li> The brow pencil may be a little much for every day but is great for events.</li>
            <li> I am very blonde but have darker eyebrows, this pencil works great for me and the brush at the end works well not only to straighten your brows but to blend after penciling them in.</li>
            <li> It has good reviews and is half the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased a &amp;#34;Billion Dollar Brow&amp;#34; kit for a very reasonable price from Groupon, $20 for the pencil, gel, brow booster, and brow shaper.</li>
            <li> However, used it up very fast</li>
            <li> So many pencils have just a touch of red in the browns and this one doesn&#x27;t, thank goodness.  </li>
            <li> I will probably buy this again even though I didn&#x27;t like it at first.</li>
            <li> I love the universal color.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, I like the color, and so I will like just go to Sephora when I have used more of it and have them give me a pencil that has the same color.</li>
            <li> I love it cuz it actually colors the brow hairs, rather than just coloring the skin in between the brows.</li>
            <li> It goes on soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was my first brow pencil.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I imagined &amp;#34;universal brown&amp;#34; to be a bit more universal.  </li>
            <li> The pencil has the twist that actually works so you have more control.</li>
            <li> but she got me interested, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> It looks way more natural than other pencils and also looks better than powders I have tried.</li>
            <li> The addition of a brow brush on the other end is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> (well, fill in half and draw the arches) with the pencil, then I apply the brow concealer and highlighter, then blend the concealer a bit with the smudge brush they sell, and use the RAVEN brow powder on top with the powder brush, I then clean it up by using the smudge brush to blend the concealer and shape my brows..</li>
            <li> But after being forced to use it after I ran out of my favorite pencil and came to like it more.</li>
            <li> Even better, the color really does seem universal.</li>
            <li> Took a star away because it is too long and it does not fit very good in my makeup case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using a lit of makeup in generally and really love the natural look.</li>
            <li> The color fit my light brown brows and also my mom&#x27;s dark brown.  </li>
            <li> Also, the little &amp;#34;brow brush&amp;#34; quickly became stuck in the top</li>
            <li> Quality and with a smart pen is work together.</li>
            <li> This pencil was large and on the darker side of what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a similar pencil to the Dior Universal Brow pencil which has a fine point and is the perfect color for almost everyone with blonde to dark brunette hair.  </li>
            <li> If u want a decent brow pencil, u have to pay for it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look drawn on (if used reasonably)</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smear (if handled reasonably).</li>
            <li> This brow pencil isn&#x27;t really a pencil-</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this eyebrow pencil!</li>
            <li> I really like this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> the tip is too blunt to do much defining of your eyebrows - beware.  </li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> If I apply too much I just use the spooly brush to blend it in.  </li>
            <li> The pencil really lasts too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much darker than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Go with this one or one of a similar color for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting, goes on easily and completes my daily makeup routine with a nice finish.  </li>
            <li> that so closely matches my hair color, not too black, not a ridiculous red tint, just a beautiful, soft brown.  </li>
            <li> Love the brush on the other end.  </li>
            <li> I love the brush on the other side of the pencil</li>
            <li> but I LOVE the other two products.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Might be OK for those with really dark brows.</li>
            <li> I purchased a more expensive eyebrow pencil from Ulta and this one is much better.</li>
            <li> Even if you try to apply it lightly, the color is dark and I would not recommend for blonde or even light brown eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Liked it for a few days then the pencil started to break easily and the brush isn&#x27;t as stiff as it should be.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse natural eyebrows...</li>
            <li> I think the color is much darker than the taupey color of the It cosmetics pencil, and this formula is so soft</li>
            <li> and so I have this lovely pencil to work with on my pale face</li>
            <li> I already have fairly dark, strong eyebrows, so I won&#x27;t buy this one again.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there doesn&#x27;t show up due to light color.  </li>
            <li> But I put my old caps on the new pencil, and so the pencil works a little bit better now.</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d come with some instructions, for some of us that are new at this...</li>
            <li> I have been using Mac brow pencil, but decided to try a new one.  </li>
            <li> It goes on lightly and only darkens with further application - as instructed!</li>
            <li> The universal color may work for many, but blondes should be careful.  </li>
            <li> The pencil is truly universal--it looks very natural with brows of any color, and it solved my problem.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this when I ordered it because I usually use a powder.  </li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t like this at first.</li>
            <li> I got my first Billion Dollar Brows as a christmas present.</li>
            <li> On the first one, it says Made in USA, and on the second, it says it was made in Mexico.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it universal.  </li>
            <li> My sister gave me my first BDB Universal Brow Pencil to try.  </li>
            <li> I went from shaving my entire eyebrows off for YEARS to deciding to grow them out and this company has helped me through the process so much!</li>
            <li> Light and long lasting.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s where people mess up, just do light strokes repeadily to get the colour you desire.</li>
            <li> Would try a clear brow wax over though to avoid smearing.  </li>
            <li> Then when I applied it, the pencil was slightly softer than before and it smears when I blend it, so i have to clean up my face after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> recommend this to all if you are wanting that natural looking brow.  </li>
            <li> Looks natural.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this pencil for brunettes looking for a natural brow filler.</li>
            <li> The pencil &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; is soft and pieces fall off.</li>
            <li> It also lasted a pretty long time</li>
            <li> Natural looking too.</li>
            <li> but it blends in so well with my natural brows</li>
            <li> It just does not appear as natural as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 84 year old mom whose brows have gotten sparce.  </li>
            <li> It looks natural and lasts the day.</li>
            <li> I have used other so called universal pencils and they have been fine.  </li>
            <li> It is the only product I have found that lasts, looks natural, and others have come right off when I perspire at the gym, or just throughout a long day.  </li>
            <li> Billion Dollar Brows Universal color is a nice dark color but will be too dark for a lot of people.</li>
            <li> It is fine for filling in the wider part of the brow, but not very good for creating definition along the edges.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t make little individual brush strokes to mimic little hairs, it&#x27;s just kind of blendy and blurry.</li>
            <li> However, as usual, sister was right!  </li>
            <li> Second, the crayon doesn&#x27;t blend smoothly so it leaves tiny little flakes that look like you peppered your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> and then I follow up with the tube of clear stuff which not only brushes the color thru it</li>
            <li> When I think of Universal, I think for every natural shade of brow.</li>
            <li> It is the only pencil I&#x27;ve used that looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be too dark when it first arrived</li>
            <li> I spent so much $$ on a pencil.</li>
            <li> and I end up over lining my brows if I am not careful.</li>
            <li> I paid $12.20 for barely anything.</li>
            <li> The lead was broken a bit on the top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using brow powder my whole &amp;#34;make up life&amp;#34; and was a little uneasy about trying something new, like a pencil.</li>
            <li> I use the pencil lightly and try not to put too much because then it will look fake and drawn on.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars only because you can&#x27;t sharpen the tip for a more defined thin line.  </li>
            <li> no matter how lightly I pressed down, the result was too dark.  </li>
            <li> Eyebrow pens and pencils are such a hassle since most of them clearly look fake or they fade after one or two hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a universal color, so only press lightly if you&#x27;re blonde and press a little harder if you&#x27;re brunette.</li>
            <li> I have tried to make it go on lighter, but not able to accomplish the right look.  </li>
            <li> I have very dark brown to almost black eyebrow hairs, so this pencil was too light.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find the right color</li>
            <li> The It pencil has a flattened shape to the &#x27;lead&#x27; part, making it an oval which made it easy to do small areas, this is a round shape</li>
            <li> Her brows are a medium brown with little bits of grey, and mine are super dark brown</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think all makeup colors look odd on me, but this looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Was unable to find light enough color in local stores and thought I&#x27;d try online.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s twice as big as other more expensive Dior universal color pencils I&#x27;ve bought at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> First, the crayon is too thick</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a pencil, it looks very natural and the color is soft and doesn&#x27;t look dark and harsh.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical as it has mixed reviews but excited because it says universal.  </li>
            <li> If you have dark brows and get a black pencil it will look very unnatural when you fill them in.  </li>
            <li> Its pretty dark if you press down so be careful.</li>
            <li> I am African American with a medium brown complexion and black eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> All of the other pencils that I&#x27;ve tried have made my eyebrows look red.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> and I used it every single day.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law has dark brown hair, my daughter has blonde and I have auburn/brown hair.  </li>
            <li> This is just too dark for my blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> For example, I can completely color un my brows with no problem, but when I did my sister&#x27;s brows, I had to make small wispy</li>
            <li> too dark others have a red tone</li>
            <li> So, I think it can work for various different hair colors, but it is key that you slowly build the amount of color with consideration to your hair color and skin color.</li>
            <li> Recently, I had my eyebrows reshaped professionally and the woman who did them left them way too thin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;if not better than some of the more expensive.</li>
            <li> This pencil doesn&#x27;t have even a little bit of red in it.</li>
            <li> When I reordered the brow pencil, it seemed a little different.</li>
            <li> Also, the universal brown is a little on the ashy side</li>
            <li> This shouldn&#x27;t be called a universal brow pencil because its too dark for my already dark brows.  </li>
            <li> I think this pencil has the same pigment, but overall is made of cheaper products and that is why my experience with it was worse the second time around.</li>
            <li> It does rub off if you sweat a lot or rub your forehead (like at the gym), but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> but it is darker than I expected, so</li>
            <li> than that, it only gets dark when you apply it so heavily</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s impossible to get a fine line in the area where your brow tapers.  </li>
            <li> I like the retractable color on one end &amp; an eyebrow brush on the other end.</li>
            <li> The cap that protects the pencil end was too loose, while the cap that protects the brush was too tight.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it is not quite as thin as I would like it to be, but I can usually get it right.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not too dark, either.</li>
            <li> This brow pencil starts out to dark for my lighter brows.</li>
            <li> I have dark auburn hair and dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bit too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I like the quality and consistency of this product but the coloring is too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> it is for dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I feel the color of the brow was way too dark after&lt;</li>
            <li> This pencil is dark</li>
            <li> This is just too dark for that.  </li>
            <li> I have dark almost black hair, and I use it with no problem.</li>
            <li> I tried to use black and brown pencils to make them look thicker and neither color  </li>
            <li> I have black hair</li>
            <li> Less than a half inch of product in this twist up pencil.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be harsh and dark</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out and get hard like the Dior pencil.</li>
            <li> I have trichotillomania and you cannot tell that half my eyebrow is missing when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I think $14 is a little pricey for an eyebrow pencil, but I&#x27;m hooked, so I pay.</li>
            <li> I use it, but just a little to blend in and darken my brows.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it was a little of the brittle side and would snap every so often, wasting product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Anastasia, as well as other brands in the past for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s a little timely to apply.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little softer to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy, and it&#x27;s darker than I thought (</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown brows</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are very dark</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair</li>
            <li> Very dark.</li>
            <li> but that was too narrow for my taste</li>
            <li> keep me going everyday</li>
            <li> and it was harsh on me if I did not have any sort of tan.</li>
            <li> It goes on heavy</li>
            <li> Even let a few friends try and and it matches their color too.</li>
            <li> Too bad because I really like the way it goes on.  </li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t need to use a brow pencil.  </li>
            <li> I am not pleased with the billion dollar eye brow pencil.  </li>
            <li> I usually order 2 at a time</li>
            <li> and I am lazy-</li>
            <li> Not sure if just my skin or what</li>
            <li> I usually use the Dior universal brow pencil, which works for my thin &amp; dark brows but it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brow pencil :(....I guess its the consistancy and the way it goes on the brows that I dont like...and the fact that if I returned it the seller would keep 20% of what i paid for it.</li>
            <li> the color works for me, so that isn&#x27;t my complaint.</li>
            <li> It is too &#x27;thick&#x27;, and does not apply well.  </li>
            <li> The pencil is too thick therefore not alot of control.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only pencil I have found that doesn&#x27;t look fake!</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to several friends who are now using it - and no one has had anything bad to say about it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this pencil.</li>
            <li> Not particularly impressed.</li>
            <li> It still looks too brown for my brows, which makes them look fake</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that crazy about the pencil.  </li>
            <li> because she is afraid they will stop making them and she will never find anything that works as well.</li>
            <li> Frustrated</li>
            <li> I am slightly disappointed with this brow pencil.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful, all-in-one brow pencil.  The shade blends perfectly with my natural brow color and the brush does a great job of blending the strokes into the brown.  So easy to throw this one item (rather than a pencil and a brush) into the make-up bag for traveling too!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best brow pencil&#x27;s I have ever used. It is universal and can be used by anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all if you are wanting that natural looking brow.  It is also great for filling in areas where needed.</li>
            <li> This item was packaged with great care and the product is just as good&lt;br /&gt;if not better than some of the more expensive. I really love it and will&lt;br /&gt;order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this pencil. I have light brown hair, and my eyebrows need filled in because they&#x27;re a lot lighter. All of the other pencils that I&#x27;ve tried have made my eyebrows look red. This pencil doesn&#x27;t have even a little bit of red in it. But it&#x27;s not too dark, either. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments about my eyebrows recently, and all of the women in my family have purchased this pencil as well. It&#x27;s wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Best brow pencil! Goes with almost every eyebrow color</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have trichotillomania and you cannot tell that half my eyebrow is missing when I use this product. Fills in my brows and helps me feel confident and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I love this pencil.  It&#x27;s long lasting, goes on easily and completes my daily makeup routine with a nice finish.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tool to make my eye browns flawless. I has the perfect color that could go lighter or darker depending on you want. Practical and easy to use. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Best brow pencil ever.  It goes on so smoothly, and matches the color of my brows perfectly.  I think $14 is a little pricey for an eyebrow pencil, but I&#x27;m hooked, so I pay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using brow powder my whole &amp;#34;make up life&amp;#34; and was a little uneasy about trying something new, like a pencil. I thought it was going to be harsh and dark but it&#x27;s really a great match. Easy to use and great results.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this eyebrow pencil.  It goes on very smoothly and I don&#x27;t know how they do it but it seems this color is really universal.  My daughter-in-law has dark brown hair, my daughter has blonde and I have auburn/brown hair.  We all three use the same color and the color looks good on all three of us.  It&#x27;s really easy to feather color in the sparse places on your eyebrow and then the brush on the opposite end blends it all beautifully.  I will definitely keep this as a staple in my beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> I love this pencil. I have very dark brown eyebrows and the color works perfect. The consistency is perfect.</li>
            <li> For a brow pencil I am (drumroll) happy to say that I have no complaints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance on buying this pencil solely from reviews that I read. I am African American with a medium complexion and red undertone. Sometimes I think all makeup colors look odd on me, but this looks very natural. It goes on lightly and only darkens with further application - as instructed! It doesn&#x27;t look drawn on (if used reasonably) and it doesn&#x27;t smear (if handled reasonably). I&#x27;d buy again. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, though a lot lighter in color than I thought. I wish they&#x27;d come with some instructions, for some of us that are new at this...</li>
            <li> great product would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Very natural looking and easy to apply!  I wasn&#x27;t sure about this when I ordered it because I usually use a powder.  But I just tried it and am very pleased!  Even though it&#x27;s a pencil, it looks very natural and the color is soft and doesn&#x27;t look dark and harsh.  So many pencils have just a touch of red in the browns and this one doesn&#x27;t, thank goodness.  This is the perfect color.  I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Blends perfectly and fills in where I need it!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by the salon where I get by eyebrows done. I started using it daily and won&#x27;t go back. Its easy to use and great quality.</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown brows but this still blends in perfectly.  If you have dark brows and get a black pencil it will look very unnatural when you fill them in.  Go with this one or one of a similar color for a more natural look.  I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried every pencil and brow kit on the market!  I love this pencil.  The color intensifies depending on the pressure you use. Blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a universal brow pencil; it is a brown brow pencil, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it three stars because the quality of the ingredients is excellent; it makes the brow hairs stand out individually but the color is brown.  As a fair to medium-skinned blonde, the color of the brow pencil does not enhance my features.  I&#x27;m not returning the pencil since my friend likes it.</li>
            <li> This is just too dark for my blonde hair.  I have tried to make it go on lighter, but not able to accomplish the right look.  Gave it to my sister.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brow pencil :(....I guess its the consistancy and the way it goes on the brows that I dont like...and the fact that if I returned it the seller would keep 20% of what i paid for it.</li>
            <li> awesome product looks very natural, not like a crayon or like your eyebrows are drawn on. will continue to buy</li>
            <li> So easy to use. Love that it&#x27;s retractable.. No sharpening! The lighter your hand the lighter the color, the heavier your hand, the darker. I am very blonde but have darker eyebrows, this pencil works great for me and the brush at the end works well not only to straighten your brows but to blend after penciling them in. Now all I need is some brow gel to set them.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t like this at first. But after being forced to use it after I ran out of my favorite pencil and came to like it more. I still don&#x27;t care for the comb at the bottom. Because the pencil is a stick I think its just not feasible to use the stick like comb to comb my eyebrow. I use a disposable eye lash brush and then this pencil. I use the pencil lightly and try not to put too much because then it will look fake and drawn on. Its pretty dark if you press down so be careful. I will probably buy this again even though I didn&#x27;t like it at first. I think it works great for me now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that crazy about the pencil.  First, the crayon is too thick so it&#x27;s impossible to get a fine line in the area where your brow tapers.  Second, the crayon doesn&#x27;t blend smoothly so it leaves tiny little flakes that look like you peppered your eyebrows.  I use it, but just a little to blend in and darken my brows.  Another brow pencil gets most of the action.</li>
            <li> My sister the make-up maven recommended this to me.  Since our brows are not the same color and this product comes in only one color, I was a bit leery.  However, as usual, sister was right!  I love this brow pencil - my brows don&#x27;t look \\&quot;penciled in\\&quot; - in fact they look great!  I have recommended this to several friends who are now using it - and no one has had anything bad to say about it!</li>
            <li> I love this pencil.  It&#x27;s self-sharpening, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about a sharpener, and the consistency of the crayon is perfect - not too brittle, not too soft and smudgy.  I had been using the Sephora pencil with the comb on the end but that was too narrow for my taste - it took forever to fill in my brows.  Plus, it was a little of the brittle side and would snap every so often, wasting product.  I&#x27;d re-order this in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> pencil doesnt break, applies evenly, brush works well, color is as advertised in product display, looks like it will last awhile</li>
            <li> I love the universal color.  Looks natural.  Would try a clear brow wax over though to avoid smearing.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> This is my go to eyebrow pencil.  It is the perfect color and it goes on perfect.  The only problem is its a bit pricey but I have decided to shell out the money because the color looks great.</li>
            <li> Oooops, not a billion in my make up drawer. When I think of Universal, I think for every natural shade of brow. It should start out light and progressively get darker the more we apply. This brow pencil starts out to dark for my lighter brows. I think it would be great for someone with darker brows or want darker brows right this minute. Stays put okay, brush is nice.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and natural looking. I&#x27;m not using a lit of makeup in generally and really love the natural look. This pencil does the job beautifully and accurately. It&#x27;s very easy to work with and again, it just looks absolutely natural which I really love. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got my first Billion Dollar Brows as a christmas present. I have dark almost black hair, and I use it with no problem. I also applied to my sister&#x27;s eyebrows, and it even worked for her even though she has blonde hair. So, I think it can work for various different hair colors, but it is key that you slowly build the amount of color with consideration to your hair color and skin color. For example, I can completely color un my brows with no problem, but when I did my sister&#x27;s brows, I had to make small wispy lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the color works for me, so that isn&#x27;t my complaint. When I reordered the brow pencil, it seemed a little different. The cap that protects the pencil end was too loose, while the cap that protects the brush was too tight. I thought I would break the pencil trying to get that side off. But I put my old caps on the new pencil, and so the pencil works a little bit better now. Then when I applied it, the pencil was slightly softer than before and it smears when I blend it, so i have to clean up my face after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was looking at it, I devolved a theory as to why the second pencil is different. On the first one, it says Made in USA, and on the second, it says it was made in Mexico. I think the company is trying to get more profit by manufacturing the pencil in Mexico, but still charging the same amount (it was $18 before too, and I know this because it had been on my wishlist forever, lol). I think this pencil has the same pigment, but overall is made of cheaper products and that is why my experience with it was worse the second time around. But more than anything it ticks me off that i still paid $18 for it. Not cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I like the color, and so I will like just go to Sephora when I have used more of it and have them give me a pencil that has the same color. But just a heads up about the quality.</li>
            <li> Great pencil, use it every day. Works wonders, makes the perfect brow. Will continue to order, I even got one for my sister and she loves it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this pencil!!!  I love it cuz it actually colors the brow hairs, rather than just coloring the skin in between the brows. By far the BEST brow coloring system I&#x27;ve used. Would never use anything else!</li>
            <li> This is the best brow pencil I have ever used. It looks way more natural than other pencils and also looks better than powders I have tried. I like than you can adjust the amount you apply simply by adjusting the pressure. I have dark auburn hair and dark eyebrows. I use this pencil only to fill in and &#x27;sharpen up&#x27; the line of my brow. I can&#x27;t comment on how it would look if you used this pencil to draw in your brows. It does rub off if you sweat a lot or rub your forehead (like at the gym), but that is to be expected. I&#x27;m sure some could solve this problem with a setting spray or something, but I don&#x27;t bother. For the purpose I use it for, it is excellent. I would recommend this pencil for brunettes looking for a natural brow filler.</li>
            <li> The brush is great! The pencil &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; is soft and pieces fall off. Even with that I like the pencil and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars only because you can&#x27;t sharpen the tip for a more defined thin line.  As you use it, the tip becomes rounded, henceforth, wider lines.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product to use on the wider parts of your brow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind my gray hair, just gray brows and so I have this lovely pencil to work with on my pale face</li>
            <li> Works well for about any hair color. My hair happens to be red.  I also use it as an eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I like the brow pencil but it is darker than I expected, so I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it universal.  Also, the little &amp;#34;brow brush&amp;#34; quickly became stuck in the top and I can&#x27;t use it until I take the time to figure out how to get it out.</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown eyebrows. This brow pencil is a perfect match, but would work well with lighter or darker brows as well. Stays on during the day, doesn&#x27;t smudge easily. Love how there is a built in brow brush.</li>
            <li> maybe my favorite brow pencil of all time, the color goes on very smoothly whicch I love, the brush at the other end is convient, I think a great product</li>
            <li> This universal color blends in perfectly on my brows which are a dark brown. It&#x27;s twice as big as other more expensive Dior universal color pencils I&#x27;ve bought at Macy&#x27;s. My only complaint would be that it is not quite as thin as I would like it to be, but I can usually get it right. It goes on soft and smooth so it&#x27;s easy to blend in. I think it&#x27;s a bargain for its size and it doesn&#x27;t dry out and get hard like the Dior pencil.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for those who like to shape there eyes with a brow pencil. It is so hard to find the right color some are too dark others have a red tone but this is just the right color.</li>
            <li> Not particularly impressed. Don&#x27;t know how they can say it&#x27;s a universal brown. I have light to medium brown hair and it&#x27;s a bit too dark for me. I will use it, but it&#x27;s nothing special. I do like the brush for blending.</li>
            <li> Was unable to find light enough color in local stores and thought I&#x27;d try online.  I like the quality and consistency of this product but the coloring is too dark for me.  If I can find in lighter color will purchase again</li>
            <li> This shouldn&#x27;t be called a universal brow pencil because its too dark for my already dark brows.  I tried pressing really lightly and still end up with unnatural looking brows.</li>
            <li> This brow pencil goes on more like a gel. I would say it is NOT universal- it is for dark eyebrows. Even if you try to apply it lightly, the color is dark and I would not recommend for blonde or even light brown eyebrows. It has good coverage and staying power. I put powder (by Ardell) over it and then brush it out to even it out. I use Ardell powder which is easier to apply but not as bold / defined as this brow pencil. The brow pencil may be a little much for every day but is great for events.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pencil. It goes on smooth and blends in perfectly. I used to be a devoted BrowPower user but this product is far superior.</li>
            <li> I am African American with a medium brown complexion and black eyebrows.  This blended just fine.  I was quite surprised and glad I gave it a try.  It gets a four simply because it takes some practice to get used to the type, and pressure of the strokes to use when applying.  It has a bit of a &amp;#34;crayon&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> A MUA must have in my opinion.  Used it on several different girls with different skin types and it worked. Just use lighter strokes and blend more for blondes.</li>
            <li> This is the best brow pencil I&#x27;ve ever used...and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried them all.  It&#x27;s a universal color, so only press lightly if you&#x27;re blonde and press a little harder if you&#x27;re brunette.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are very dark and I usually don&#x27;t need to use a brow pencil.  Recently, I had my eyebrows reshaped professionally and the woman who did them left them way too thin.  I tried to use black and brown pencils to make them look thicker and neither color  worked.  My sister uses this Universal brow pencil and recommended it to me. The pencil is truly universal--it looks very natural with brows of any color, and it solved my problem.  The addition of a brow brush on the other end is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I purchased a &amp;#34;Billion Dollar Brow&amp;#34; kit for a very reasonable price from Groupon, $20 for the pencil, gel, brow booster, and brow shaper. All the products are great but this pencil is amazing!!! I would pay $20 for the pencil alone, maybe more. It is the only pencil I&#x27;ve used that looks so natural. It also lasted a pretty long time and I used it every single day. Love it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be without brow pencil!</li>
            <li> I usually use the Dior universal brow pencil, which works for my thin &amp; dark brows but it&#x27;s so expensive so I decided to try this one. It&#x27;s OKAY, but not as good as the Dior one. It still looks too brown for my brows, which makes them look fake</li>
            <li> keep me going everyday</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy, and it&#x27;s darker than I thought (but it&#x27;s probably my own mistake). I like the brush though.</li>
            <li> I feel the color of the brow was way too dark after&lt;br /&gt;application.  They need to have more variety&lt;br /&gt;in choices.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with the billion dollar eye brow pencil.  It is too &#x27;thick&#x27;, and does not apply well.  I have been used to a slim line pencil.  I will go back to that kind of a pencil eye brow liner.</li>
            <li> I like it. I have very sparse brows and light brown hair. This pencil is dark but I use a very light touch and it works perfectly on my brows. Natural looking too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, quick delivery. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love the Dior brow pencil, but wanted something more inexpensive.  This brow pencil isn&#x27;t really a pencil- it is a soft wax and more crayon-like.  It is fine for filling in the wider part of the brow, but not very good for creating definition along the edges. I already have fairly dark, strong eyebrows, so I won&#x27;t buy this one again.  That being said, with a very light hand I was able to use the product, and I liked the brush that comes attached.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse natural eyebrows...as in, I pluck 2 or 3 stray hairs on each side. Eyebrow pens and pencils are such a hassle since most of them clearly look fake or they fade after one or two hours. This pencil is amazing! I have somewhat oily skin and even after 10+ hours, this stuff still looks freshly applied. Even better, the color really does seem universal. I thought it would be too dark when it first arrived but it blends in so well with my natural brows (I have medium brown hair). I will definitely be buying this pencil from now on. Completely worth it!</li>
            <li> The only eye brow pencil for all hair color.  The only one I will use.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Wish i could keep this in stock!</li>
            <li> This type of eyebrow color is so easy to use. I like the retractable color on one end &amp; an eyebrow brush on the other end.</li>
            <li> Love this pencil. Also use it for under eye liner.  Love the brush on the other end.  If u want a decent brow pencil, u have to pay for it!</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite brow pencil.  The universal color may work for many, but blondes should be careful.  The crayon is not as slender as I would prefer for a brow pencil.  You cannot make feathery strokes.  But it does fill in sparse spots in your brow.  It just does not appear as natural as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> This was my first brow pencil. I have since switched to Chella. Billion Dollar Brows Universal color is a nice dark color but will be too dark for a lot of people. I have black/dark brown brows and it was harsh on me if I did not have any sort of tan. It is also a thicker point than I have become accustomed to. I think it&#x27;s a good pencil if you are just starting out because it does apply easily and wears all day. Once you are better at doing your brows I think most people will want color variety and a more fine application.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the color, at all. It&#x27;s too light for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Exactly like the picture. The lead was broken a bit on the top. :c&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it only gets dark when you apply it so heavily and that&#x27;s where people mess up, just do light strokes repeadily to get the colour you desire. c: I&#x27;m very picky with my brow pencils, but this one is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> Liked it for a few days then the pencil started to break easily and the brush isn&#x27;t as stiff as it should be. Not a bad product, just the execution needs some work.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me my first BDB Universal Brow Pencil to try.  OMGosh!  I love it!  It is the ONLY eyebrow pencil I have ever used that so closely matches my hair color, not too black, not a ridiculous red tint, just a beautiful, soft brown.  It goes on easily and evenly and it stays on all day.  Don&#x27;t ever stop selling it!</li>
            <li> this is the best eyebrow pencil  ever, it is the most natural looking! I highly recommend buying this eyebrow pencil!</li>
            <li> I really like this eyebrow pencil. The color is nice and it goes on very smooth. Took a star away because it is too long and it does not fit very good in my makeup case.</li>
            <li> More crayon (waxy) then I prefer. But nice color, after using the wand to blend.</li>
            <li> Love it. Best stuff I have ever used.</li>
            <li> no matter how lightly I pressed down, the result was too dark.  I have used other so called universal pencils and they have been fine.  Do not recommend this.  Might be OK for those with really dark brows.</li>
            <li> Great color and texture. Blends effortlessly. There&#x27;s something about the simplicity of this pencil, that I find perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Very glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> This thing give my brows that look you want your brows to always look like. The best eye brow pencil I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 84 year old mom whose brows have gotten sparce.  I used to use it years ago before I had micropigmentation (permanent makeup) touched up on my brows.  The color fit my light brown brows and also my mom&#x27;s dark brown.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone.  It also lasts a very long time.  I think I had my last one about a year.  Great product and seller!</li>
            <li> the tip is too blunt to do much defining of your eyebrows - beware.  it might be good for filling in but not defining.</li>
            <li> My order came quickly with a personalized thank you note. The package was wrapped all cute and a thank you gift was included. This was very classy, I am impressed and will order again!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a BDB fan for years!  I&#x27;ve tried Anastasia, as well as other brands in the past for eyebrows.  But this product blends in perfectly; whether you apply it with a light or heavy hand, the color looks natural.  I love the brush on the other side of the pencil, I find that I don&#x27;t need a gel to keep my brows in place - the brush does the trick.  I will continue to use this product.  It&#x27;s the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> Nice color choice,  thanks.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over a year and it  is easy to apply and does not look &amp;#34;fakey&amp;#34; if you use a feathering application and then lightly brush.It completes your facial makeup perfectly! Joan Bost</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but it is just too pricey for me.  If you have the bucks go for it.</li>
            <li> I love this brow pencil.  I have light brown hair.  If I apply too much I just use the spooly brush to blend it in.  It goes on nicely and stays on all day.  The pencil really lasts too.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brow pencil like this one for quite a while. I use it daily. It looks natural and lasts the day. I recommend it to anyone who is as eyebrow challenged as I am.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much darker than I thought it would be.  I imagined &amp;#34;universal brown&amp;#34; to be a bit more universal.  I have stopped coloring my hair and was hoping for a color that would look better with my gray.  This is just too dark for that.  Too bad because I really like the way it goes on.  The pencil itself is very nice, goes on easily and stays.</li>
            <li> I am slightly disappointed with this brow pencil. The color is fine, but the pencil itself is faulty. It chips away as I try to apply it, breaking at the tip. It&#x27;s not as fine of a tip as what is pictured either. I don&#x27;t recommend it for these reasons. For the money I was expecting a much better product. No future purchases from  me.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing....thank you for a great brow pencil....love the product and the price......better than the others....great product......and it&#x27;s delivered......</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as it has mixed reviews but excited because it says universal.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. I have very dark brown to almost black eyebrow hairs, so this pencil was too light. Also it&#x27;s a little timely to apply. Frustrated I spent so much $$ on a pencil. I&#x27;m just sticking with my shiseido brow powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years.  I love it.  It goes on easily and the color is perfect.  I order a couple at a time so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I purchased a more expensive eyebrow pencil from Ulta and this one is much better. The pencil has the twist that actually works so you have more control. I usually order 2 at a time so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The color is perfect for me.  I&#x27;m, ahem, at that age where I&#x27;ve lost a lot of brow and not from plucking, I don&#x27;t.  What&#x27;s there doesn&#x27;t show up due to light color.  BBBs goes on easily and smooth and then I follow up with the tube of clear stuff which not only brushes the color thru it seems to set the brow color all day and it doesn&#x27;t wipe off or smear.  I got the set which included the night time stuff which I forget to use but I LOVE the other two products.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully subtle yet covers flawlessly! Worth every penny!  I have very dark hair and this is the only pencil I have found that doesn&#x27;t look fake!</li>
            <li> I love this pencil.  It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Pencil is great.  Only thing is the shade varied a bit. Preferred my last pencil color</li>
            <li> I bought this because I really liked my It cosmetics universal brow pencil, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $30 on a replacement. Some of the reviews mentioned that pencil had changed formula, so I figured I would take a chance on this one. It has good reviews and is half the price.&lt;br /&gt;I received it yesterday, and it&#x27;s alright. I think the color is much darker than the taupey color of the It cosmetics pencil, and this formula is so soft I can&#x27;t make little individual brush strokes to mimic little hairs, it&#x27;s just kind of blendy and blurry. The It pencil has a flattened shape to the &#x27;lead&#x27; part, making it an oval which made it easy to do small areas, this is a round shape so it&#x27;s actually wider. Does that even make sense lol?&lt;br /&gt;I have very light skin with freckles and red/auburn hair and this barely works for me color wise. It is more of a chocolate color. I don&#x27;t see how this would work on anyone with lighter hair than I have.&lt;br /&gt;Edit to add - this pencil doesn&#x27;t stay on my brows. I will keep using it, but next time I will reorder the It pencil.</li>
            <li> I went from shaving my entire eyebrows off for YEARS to deciding to grow them out and this company has helped me through the process so much! The universal brow pencils is great. I have black hair so I draw on the eyebrow (well, fill in half and draw the arches) with the pencil, then I apply the brow concealer and highlighter, then blend the concealer a bit with the smudge brush they sell, and use the RAVEN brow powder on top with the powder brush, I then clean it up by using the smudge brush to blend the concealer and shape my brows.. Gnarly. I&#x27;ve recommended them to so many people since I get asked questions all the time.</li>
            <li> Order and delivery was excellent, but the pencil wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  The pencil is too thick therefore not alot of control.  Color works just like a thinner pointyer pencil.  But then again someone else might like this.</li>
            <li> Quality and with a smart pen is work together. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought her one last year for xmas- and since she has ordered 3 more (it&#x27;s been 6 months..) because she is afraid they will stop making them and she will never find anything that works as well. I don&#x27;t do squat to my brows, as they are near perfect and I am lazy- but she got me interested, so I tried it. Well, she was right. This little crayon like pencil blends perfectly- and is kind of amazing. She had me order one for my grandma, and her best friend. Her brows are a medium brown with little bits of grey, and mine are super dark brown and it works on both of our brows perfectly.</li>
            <li> I only use this product on my brows.  It is the only product I have found that lasts, looks natural, and others have come right off when I perspire at the gym, or just throughout a long day.  This is the best out there, in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I found this pencil to be a bit big. It goes on heavy and I end up over lining my brows if I am not careful. Also, the universal brown is a little on the ashy side so I did not like using it.</li>
            <li> love this and will order again</li>
            <li> Was not one color fits all. Very dark. With my white hair, I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow pencil - EVER!!</li>
            <li> I love the color. I wish it was a little softer to apply.</li>
            <li> Less than a half inch of product in this twist up pencil. I paid $12.20 for barely anything. Disappointed.  Never again.</li>
            <li> Liked this a lot. However, used it up very fast</li>
            <li> Best brow pencil you can purchase. Works great for all shades. Light and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mac brow pencil, but decided to try a new one.  The pencil part looks skinny in the picture, but it is much bigger and softer than Mac one.&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going back to Mac brow pencil...</li>
            <li> Not sure if just my skin or what but this brow pencil would not mark on my skin??</li>
            <li> I wanted a similar pencil to the Dior Universal Brow pencil which has a fine point and is the perfect color for almost everyone with blonde to dark brunette hair.  This pencil was large and on the darker side of what I was looking for.  I&#x27;m really more of an auburn in hair color.  Hope this review was helpful</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matches my color perfectly! Even let a few friends try and and it matches their color too. Have used it every day for 6 months and still have about 1/4 left.</li>
            <li> Billion Dollar Brows are as described.  I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size pencil and color</li>
            <li> This pencil lives up to it&#x27;s reviews - good filler for all brow colors and shapes, and great value compared to other brow pencils.</li>
            <li> Love this. Great color for me and easy to use.</li>
