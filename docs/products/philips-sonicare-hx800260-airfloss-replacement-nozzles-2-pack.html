            <li>Love this machine.</li>
            <li>Much better than a waterpik.</li>
            <li>The water tank could be better designed.  </li>
            <li>sounds better than it works in reality.  </li>
            <li>Beats flossing any day; does a better job, quicker.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I have it and will recommend it.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended the airfloss and I am so glad.  </li>
            <li>Love these nozzles on my airfloss machine.  </li>
            <li>Better exams at the dentist office.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done and that is important when its within the mouth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product, but it doesn;t leave me feeling secure that my teeth are clean in between.</li>
            <li>The nozzles work fine with the Sonicare airfloss.</li>
            <li>Works as expected and is very good quality.  </li>
            <li>FIT</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Water jet sprays quickly and easily and picks up particles toothbrush can miss.  </li>
            <li>Good design and fit, as they are standard OEM product.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare, recommended by my dentist, and am glad to have the extra nozzles, as I plan to use it forever!</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>time I use it, it&#x27;s like a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>only problem the nozzle easy pop off,&lt;br /&gt;the neck gap easy spill out water</li>
            <li>Great tool for people that have tight teeth!</li>
            <li>The shipment from Amazon was quick, complete and accurate.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and pricing was reasonable.</li>
            <li>This product was a total waste of money, not at  all in keeping with the excellent product line I&#x27;ve become accustomed to from this company.</li>
            <li>I am aware that the pamphlet that came in the box says that you need to change  the head every six months, but I refuse to believe it.</li>
            <li>pockets\\&quot; of 5-7 mm had shrunk by 2-3mm, the gums looked a healthy pink and there was only 1 bleeding point (whereas there were many before).</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say the device works better, or the original looked like it really needed replacing, but at this little money per nozzle, it couldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well with teeth spaced very close together.</li>
            <li>Fast too.</li>
            <li>Sold unit after a couple of months because it really did not replace any of the oral hygiene I was already doing.</li>
            <li>Sonicare really dropped the ball on this venture.</li>
            <li>I use mouth wash, instead of water, and it really blasts food particles from between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Although not easy to see, a person could share an air floss, and use their own nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I h ave other Sonicare products and love them all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and these replacement heads.</li>
            <li>but it would be better if it were not still a little pricey</li>
            <li>The head has no moving parts, no small nooks (like those between your tooth brush bristles) to hold excess bacteria, and no parts that break down and cause less effective cleaning (again think about the tooth</li>
            <li>Quality exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and needed for the airfloss machine.  </li>
            <li>Would be more useful if designed a little differently with a small brush.</li>
            <li>If you have more than 2 people in your household, you will have to devise a marking system since the nozzles only come with the same 2 small designs.</li>
            <li>Not much to say about these other than they are priced well and are exactly like the one that come with the flosser.</li>

            <li> These replacements for the Phillips Sonicare Airfloss are essential since the device only comes with a single nozzle.</li>
            <li> They last a long long time.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re concerned about germs you can always microwave you flosser head in a bowl of water, but if there aren&#x27;t nooks for the bacteria to grow in (which would mean your head is damaged and maybe does need to be replaced) that shouldn&#x27;t be much of an issue either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These might work fine, but we never used them because we took the Airfloss back to the store, as it was too expensive and not useful for teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t fall into one of the first two categories don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this</li>
            <li> the only reasons that sonicare has put this product on the market is to allow for a single body to be used among multiple people, to replace broken flosser heads (although I&#x27;m not sure its possible to break one of these) and to make a profit.</li>
            <li> Somewhat less than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The cost from Amazon was half the cost from Phillips (and Phillips was out of stock).</li>
            <li> I find this to be a poor excuse for a tooth cleaning device and certainly not a replacement for the water Pik.</li>
            <li> BUT IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME</li>
            <li> Water holder needs to be thoroughly dried out after each use and also cleaned with bleach solution once a week.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is nearly impossible to get all of the water out of the holder with each use and if left wet, mold is created.  </li>
            <li> I WAS TOO LAZY TO RETURN</li>
            <li> , there is a little gray circle at the base of the nozzle, one is solid the other just a circle.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> The flosser head on the sonicare air flosser is a hard piece of non porous plastic.</li>
            <li> There is a very small design on each</li>
            <li> Concern over cleaning of unit; somewhat difficult.  </li>
            <li> This works wonders at replacing floss string (which I hate to use).  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fit great with my Sonicare</li>
            <li> DIDNT WORK OR FIT WELL. I WAS TOO LAZY TO RETURN BUT IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME</li>
            <li> These replacements for the Phillips Sonicare Airfloss are essential since the device only comes with a single nozzle. The cost from Amazon was half the cost from Phillips (and Phillips was out of stock). The shipment from Amazon was quick, complete and accurate. The nozzles work fine with the Sonicare airfloss.</li>
            <li> This product is very effective in flossing. It works very well with teeth spaced very close together. Need four more words.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nozzles. Look good, and function as they should. I will continue to use until I need more, than reorder.</li>
            <li> I find this to be a poor excuse for a tooth cleaning device and certainly not a replacement for the water Pik.</li>
            <li> Got these and am very happy. Works as expected and is very good quality.  Would definitely buy again. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> Love this machine. Much better than a waterpik. Fast too. Would recommend this to anyone. Some pain and bleeding but does the job.</li>
            <li> These replacement nozzles work with the Philips Sonicare Airfloss which only comes with one nozzle.  The replacement nozzles come in a 2-pack.  Both are the same color.  There is a very small design on each but it is hard to tell the difference.  It would be easier to distinguish if the design was either larger or if the nozzles were different colors.  If you have more than 2 people in your household, you will have to devise a marking system since the nozzles only come with the same 2 small designs.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare airfloss seems to work well. The water tank could be better designed.  Overall I&#x27;m happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> The Airfloss machine works as advertised. After 3 months of using generic Listerine in it twice daily, my dental technician said my \\&quot;deep pockets\\&quot; of 5-7 mm had shrunk by 2-3mm, the gums looked a healthy pink and there was only 1 bleeding point (whereas there were many before). I&#x27;m now a believer!</li>
            <li> Quality exactly what I expected.  They are used on a daily basis.  Would be more useful if designed a little differently with a small brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great; I love it...Now, I can share one with my husband.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use it, it&#x27;s like a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> Replacement part for Sonicare Air Floss.  They fit perfectly and now have happy teeth.  Quick shipping and pricing was reasonable.Would recommend any Sonicare product, They are great and make your teeth feel so clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> We find this product is so nec&#x27;y but it would be better if it were not still a little pricey</li>
            <li> If you own a Philips Sonicare air floss, the instructions suggest replacing the nozzles every six months. I&#x27;ve had my air floss for just over six months now, and did the replacement. Can&#x27;t say the device works better, or the original looked like it really needed replacing, but at this little money per nozzle, it couldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One nice thing about this two pack, there is a little gray circle at the base of the nozzle, one is solid the other just a circle. Although not easy to see, a person could share an air floss, and use their own nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004Y9AINC Philips Sonicare HX8111/02 Airfloss]]</li>
            <li> sounds better than it works in reality.  Sold unit after a couple of months because it really did not replace any of the oral hygiene I was already doing.</li>
            <li> Great product for those of us who don&#x27;t like to floss.  Water jet sprays quickly and easily and picks up particles toothbrush can miss.  My only complaint is that it is nearly impossible to get all of the water out of the holder with each use and if left wet, mold is created.  Water holder needs to be thoroughly dried out after each use and also cleaned with bleach solution once a week.</li>
            <li> Beats flossing any day; does a better job, quicker.  Concern over cleaning of unit; somewhat difficult.  Over all a good product.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare, recommended by my dentist, and am glad to have the extra nozzles, as I plan to use it forever!</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money, not at  all in keeping with the excellent product line I&#x27;ve become accustomed to from this company. Sonicare really dropped the ball on this venture.</li>
            <li> The flosser (not the nozzles) is very ineffective and sits unused in the cabinet below the bathroom sink - a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Glad I have it and will recommend it.  I h ave other Sonicare products and love them all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Extremely happy with purchase. Bought as a stocking stuffer for my fiancé. He didn&#x27;t know replacement nozzles existed for the Airfloss!</li>
            <li> These fit the Airfloss just perfect and worked well.  Would recommend to everyone. Good design and fit, as they are standard OEM product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband ( a non-flosser) and he loves it and uses it faithfully.  Great purchase!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product, but it doesn;t leave me feeling secure that my teeth are clean in between. I still floss.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the airfloss and I am so glad.  It does a thorough job of getting all the debris between the teeth.  I started with using mouthwash in it, but now just use tap water.</li>
            <li> They last a long long time.</li>
            <li> These might work fine, but we never used them because we took the Airfloss back to the store, as it was too expensive and not useful for teeth.  Might work find for blowing dust out of your keyboard or navel though.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these other than they are priced well and are exactly like the one that come with the flosser.</li>
            <li> Somewhat less than I expected.  Still have to revert back to flossing after using the airfloss. Definitely something I could have done without.</li>
            <li> Save your money. The flosser head on the sonicare air flosser is a hard piece of non porous plastic. I am aware that the pamphlet that came in the box says that you need to change  the head every six months, but I refuse to believe it. The head has no moving parts, no small nooks (like those between your tooth brush bristles) to hold excess bacteria, and no parts that break down and cause less effective cleaning (again think about the tooth brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my eyes the only reasons that sonicare has put this product on the market is to allow for a single body to be used among multiple people, to replace broken flosser heads (although I&#x27;m not sure its possible to break one of these) and to make a profit. If you don&#x27;t fall into one of the first two categories don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re concerned about germs you can always microwave you flosser head in a bowl of water, but if there aren&#x27;t nooks for the bacteria to grow in (which would mean your head is damaged and maybe does need to be replaced) that shouldn&#x27;t be much of an issue either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;2 stars&lt;br /&gt;Why:&lt;br /&gt;The head does serve a purpose for some, but probably not the purpose thats driving the majority of sales</li>
            <li> Love these nozzles on my airfloss machine.  Better exams at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> They are back-ups for the Sonicare flosser, which is most convenient to use and does a good job. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> only problem the nozzle easy pop off,&lt;br /&gt;the neck gap easy spill out water</li>
            <li> This works wonders at replacing floss string (which I hate to use).  I use mouth wash, instead of water, and it really blasts food particles from between the teeth.  I highly recommend this product and these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and needed for the airfloss machine.  Came when said and had no problems with the dealer.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well and does the job.......</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and that is important when its within the mouth! Great tool for people that have tight teeth!</li>
