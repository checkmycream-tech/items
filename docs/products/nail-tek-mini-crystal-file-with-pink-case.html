            <li>Convenience likeable gift good  for traveling easy to wipe clean Thanks</li>
            <li>I have used crystal nail files for some years and this one works just fine.</li>
            <li>so they fit in my purse well.</li>
            <li>I have given them as gifts and are very well liked by the recipients.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a file, I liked it so much that I&#x27;m about to shell out the dough to buy a replacement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to clean too--just run the file under a faucet as water will not damage it.</li>
            <li>Glass &amp; crystal files are light years beyond metal or emery board files.  </li>
            <li>This, overall, is a great nail file.</li>
            <li>I love that they give your nail a crisp line.</li>
            <li>The fact that it comes in a stylish little case is great.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to clean with soap, hot water &amp; a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>The file is not too rough and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I think I may opt for a full size one to keep at home</li>
            <li>One of the better on market , but very brittle and breakable , even in protective case.</li>
            <li>The bright pink color makes it easy to find it in my handbag.</li>
            <li>it is also very pretty.</li>
            <li>I use it a LOT, but it&#x27;s still like new:)</li>
            <li>However, the cheap plastic case does not hold up very well.</li>
            <li>I work in an art room, so always have my hands in paint, plaster and glue, not much chance for my nails to stay looking good,</li>
            <li>Reading rave reviews for crystal files, I purchased this and another larger file for home; I agree 100% with other reviews that these are the best files I have ever used.</li>
            <li>love that this cute nail file, unlike many inexpensive glass/crystal nail files, has nice traction and is rough enough to actually file your nails instead of slip all over the place.</li>
            <li>This file is so great, works really well and seems like it will never wear down.</li>
            <li>Great small shape for carrying in purse.</li>
            <li>Size is perfect for purse, gentle file for my thin nails.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is more an emergency nail file for the handbag than for extensive manicure sessions.</li>
            <li>Husband gave it to me for Christmas, and I have to say that I really like it!  </li>
            <li>The recipient was very excited...perfect size!</li>
            <li>Much better than any regular file or emery</li>
            <li>Easily carried in your purse and good for an emergency broken or cracked finger nail.  </li>
            <li>Nice nail file, although you have to be very careful because it is glass.  </li>
            <li>Metal files leave my nails rough, while crystal files leave a smooth finish and you can even smooth out ridges.</li>
            <li>love the crystal files, and have a great set I bought elsewhere, but they only come with velvet slip-on cases, and I&#x27;ve had them slide out before (in my purse) and then get broken--</li>
            <li>They can also can be washed ,dried and be good as new again.  </li>
            <li>That being said, glass works really well for a file</li>
            <li>I really like this very hand tool.  </li>
            <li>Really like that they  come with a case.</li>
            <li>These crystal files seem to be easier on my nails &amp; I enjoy not hearing that &amp;#34;rasping or fingernails on a blackboard&amp;#34; noise of regular emery boards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Much cheaper here than if you purchased from your salon.</li>
            <li>I really like the way the crystal files my nails.</li>
            <li>There are other glass/crystal files out there, but be sure to get one with a case.  </li>
            <li>No more emery boards:) i have naturals nails, so you may take it to condideration!</li>
            <li>The older file of mine still works well.</li>
            <li>I like the Nail Tek files in particular because of the cases.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend also.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this file.</li>
            <li>Oh, but yes I love these little guys.  </li>
            <li>She hates normal files &amp; emery boards but doesn&#x27;t mind this one.</li>
            <li>Small and easy to have with you everywhere you go!</li>
            <li>I end up dropping it about once a year and get a new one.  </li>
            <li>glad to get this and have it at my fingertips when i need it-it is long lasting and gentle enough for a childs hands!!!</li>
            <li>The case is pretty but doesn&#x27;t stay closed very well</li>
            <li>I really like the case too, as it is hard and sturdy and will be easy to find in my purse, plus keep the file from breaking.</li>
            <li>love the hard container, means I can protect the file as I dropped my 1st crystal nail file  on tiles and it broke into 4 pieces.</li>
            <li>Instead, the two that I received came in a rectangular clear plastic box that does not correspond with my order.</li>
            <li>I have natural nails.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough though so that your nails won&#x27;t shred or split or peel or flake.</li>
            <li>But, this can fit in your evening bag or your everyday purse.  </li>
            <li>It does the job better than emery board but a bit thick for nail corners like some reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the two that I ordered from this company did not come with the nice Pink Case that protects my file and is small enough to fit into my purse easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really small and convenient--I think it would easily fit in a pocket for on-the-go use or tossed in purse (even if it fell to the bottom).</li>
            <li>(Just for example, right now, I have a nail file in a basket on the couch, in a drawer in the kitchen, in the half bath, in my bedroom, in my purse, in my travel bag, and in the glove box of my husband&#x27;s car.</li>
            <li>And after keeping this in my pocket for a while, the case ends up opening on its own and the file slips out every single day (which can be problematic since it the glass could be easily broken).</li>
            <li>Glass files are so much easier on the nails and the carrying case makes it less likely to break if in my purse and provides safer/cleaner storage akso</li>

            <li> I work in an art room, so always have my hands in paint, plaster and glue, not much chance for my nails to stay looking good,</li>
            <li> Reading rave reviews for crystal files, I purchased this and another larger file for home; I agree 100% with other reviews that these are the best files I have ever used.</li>
            <li> love that this cute nail file, unlike many inexpensive glass/crystal nail files, has nice traction and is rough enough to actually file your nails instead of slip all over the place.</li>
            <li> This file is so great, works really well and seems like it will never wear down.</li>
            <li> Great small shape for carrying in purse.</li>
            <li> Size is perfect for purse, gentle file for my thin nails.  </li>
            <li> thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is more an emergency nail file for the handbag than for extensive manicure sessions.</li>
            <li> Husband gave it to me for Christmas, and I have to say that I really like it!  </li>
            <li> The recipient was very excited...perfect size!</li>
            <li> Much better than any regular file or emery</li>
            <li> Easily carried in your purse and good for an emergency broken or cracked finger nail.  </li>
            <li> Nice nail file, although you have to be very careful because it is glass.  </li>
            <li> Metal files leave my nails rough, while crystal files leave a smooth finish and you can even smooth out ridges.</li>
            <li> love the crystal files, and have a great set I bought elsewhere, but they only come with velvet slip-on cases, and I&#x27;ve had them slide out before (in my purse) and then get broken--</li>
            <li> They can also can be washed ,dried and be good as new again.  </li>
            <li> That being said, glass works really well for a file</li>
            <li> I really like this very hand tool.  </li>
            <li> Really like that they  come with a case.</li>
            <li> These crystal files seem to be easier on my nails &amp; I enjoy not hearing that &amp;#34;rasping or fingernails on a blackboard&amp;#34; noise of regular emery boards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Much cheaper here than if you purchased from your salon.</li>
            <li> I really like the way the crystal files my nails.</li>
            <li> There are other glass/crystal files out there, but be sure to get one with a case.  </li>
            <li> No more emery boards:) i have naturals nails, so you may take it to condideration!</li>
            <li> The older file of mine still works well.</li>
            <li> I like the Nail Tek files in particular because of the cases.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend also.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this file.</li>
            <li> Oh, but yes I love these little guys.  </li>
            <li> She hates normal files &amp; emery boards but doesn&#x27;t mind this one.</li>
            <li> Small and easy to have with you everywhere you go!</li>
            <li> I end up dropping it about once a year and get a new one.  </li>
            <li> glad to get this and have it at my fingertips when i need it-it is long lasting and gentle enough for a childs hands!!!</li>
            <li> The case is pretty but doesn&#x27;t stay closed very well</li>
            <li> I really like the case too, as it is hard and sturdy and will be easy to find in my purse, plus keep the file from breaking.</li>
            <li> love the hard container, means I can protect the file as I dropped my 1st crystal nail file  on tiles and it broke into 4 pieces.</li>
            <li> Instead, the two that I received came in a rectangular clear plastic box that does not correspond with my order.</li>
            <li> I have natural nails.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough though so that your nails won&#x27;t shred or split or peel or flake.</li>
            <li> But, this can fit in your evening bag or your everyday purse.  </li>
            <li> It does the job better than emery board but a bit thick for nail corners like some reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the two that I ordered from this company did not come with the nice Pink Case that protects my file and is small enough to fit into my purse easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really small and convenient--I think it would easily fit in a pocket for on-the-go use or tossed in purse (even if it fell to the bottom).</li>
            <li> (Just for example, right now, I have a nail file in a basket on the couch, in a drawer in the kitchen, in the half bath, in my bedroom, in my purse, in my travel bag, and in the glove box of my husband&#x27;s car.</li>
            <li> And after keeping this in my pocket for a while, the case ends up opening on its own and the file slips out every single day (which can be problematic since it the glass could be easily broken).</li>
            <li> Glass files are so much easier on the nails and the carrying case makes it less likely to break if in my purse and provides safer/cleaner storage akso</li>
            <li> I also file the dry skin around my nails in the winter time, which works very well when you use little water on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She said to get the short one because the Long ones break.</li>
            <li> Should last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> But if you are careful and return it to its case every time you finish using it, it will last you for a very long time.</li>
            <li> There are no rough edges, which means less chance of snags.</li>
            <li> and the other was very coarse.</li>
            <li> (the pointed ones are so sharp they&#x27;ve actually been taken from me at airport security checkpoints).</li>
            <li> figured I&#x27;d start small, and get one with a full case as other reviews said these suckers can snap in two.  </li>
            <li> I can find it easily in my purse, and it doesn&#x27;t get all dirty from being shuffled around in the bottom of the purse.</li>
            <li> I bought this (and a larger Nail Tek file) after my previous crystal nail file broke.</li>
            <li> a little better crystal files less expensive</li>
            <li> The cases were NOT what I ordered; the Nail Tek Mini Crystal Files were what I expected and ordered.</li>
            <li> The size is plenty long to file my nails from any angle and yet not so long it&#x27;s unwieldy in my small hands.</li>
            <li> I play guitar, and other files don&#x27;t keep my nails from splitting when I play as well as this file does.</li>
            <li> I am very rough on my hands</li>
            <li> Knowing that, I&#x27;ve been very careful about when and where I press on things while I&#x27;m filing.  </li>
            <li> It has a ROUNDED TIP instead of the typical sharp pointed end that breaks</li>
            <li> The one caveat is that, being glass, it is quite fragile; drop it on a hard surface (as I did a moment ago) and it may break.</li>
            <li> I am that woman that has to have a nail file within a 10&#x27; radius at all times because I&#x27;m forever nicking a nail or getting a jagged edge...and if I don&#x27;t file it down immediately, chances are I will end up ripping it or biting it off.</li>
            <li> so I can file down any snags or tears while I&#x27;m at school all day.  </li>
            <li> I have had it in my purse for less than a week, and it&#x27;s already getting scratched up.</li>
            <li> It is convenient and seems to be less abrasive on my nails.</li>
            <li> The texture of the file works well for filing nails and mine seem less prone to splitting with the crystal files.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit bulkier than I expected but the file and case are solid and I can now touch up a broken nail when I am out and about.</li>
            <li> I keep this little one in my purse.</li>
            <li> One would be hard put to find a flashier pink...</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just have to be careful not to drop it on a hard surface (like the floor), as it is glass</li>
            <li> I had a crystal file a few years ago and it disappeared</li>
            <li> Problem is that the file is slightly too thick</li>
            <li> Also the file itself is a little too thick.</li>
            <li> They are small</li>
            <li> I keep this in my small cross-body bag</li>
            <li> No more Emory boards.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for years for a small nail file with case for my car; I found nothing in stores</li>
            <li> This version solves that problem by coming in a small, metal case.  </li>
            <li> Its very short that a bit awkward to file my small nails.</li>
            <li> These are sometimes hard to find and my wife was quite chagrined when her file broke</li>
            <li> A little expensive compared to others.  </li>
            <li> so it is difficult to file the nail edges.</li>
            <li> Crazy about this product!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Must have... very good product....</li>
            <li> Easily carried in your purse and good for an emergency broken or cracked finger nail.  Gave them as stocking stuffers to daughters and grand daughters.</li>
            <li> Is ok. a little better crystal files less expensive</li>
            <li> glad to get this and have it at my fingertips when i need it-it is long lasting and gentle enough for a childs hands!!!</li>
            <li> Crazy about this product! Glass files are so much easier on the nails and the carrying case makes it less likely to break if in my purse and provides safer/cleaner storage akso</li>
            <li> Convenience likeable gift good  for traveling easy to wipe clean Thanks</li>
            <li> One would be hard put to find a flashier pink... And after keeping this in my pocket for a while, the case ends up opening on its own and the file slips out every single day (which can be problematic since it the glass could be easily broken). That being said, glass works really well for a file and it&#x27;s perfectly sized for travel.</li>
            <li> I am a recent Convert to crystal nail files. I love that they give your nail a crisp line. There are no rough edges, which means less chance of snags. I can go a week without filing, amazing! I am very rough on my hands I work in an art room, so always have my hands in paint, plaster and glue, not much chance for my nails to stay looking good, but since using the nail file, my nails look so much better and have kept the smooth edge.&lt;br /&gt;I love the hard container, means I can protect the file as I dropped my 1st crystal nail file  on tiles and it broke into 4 pieces. The container protects the file in my handbag. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The cases were NOT what I ordered; the Nail Tek Mini Crystal Files were what I expected and ordered. I purchased them to give to friends as I have one that I keep in my purse at all times. Unfortunately, the two that I ordered from this company did not come with the nice Pink Case that protects my file and is small enough to fit into my purse easily. Instead, the two that I received came in a rectangular clear plastic box that does not correspond with my order. I do not recommend ordering from this company as what they sent is NOT what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I love these mini crystal files. They are small so they fit in my purse well. I have given them as gifts and are very well liked by the recipients.</li>
            <li> Love this nail file. After you use this file, you will never use anything else. I have natural nails. Never any cracks or peeling of nails when using this file. Very effective, never wears out. Will break, but that&#x27;s what the case is for. And Nail Tek has a lifetime warranty if you do break it. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I am that woman that has to have a nail file within a 10&#x27; radius at all times because I&#x27;m forever nicking a nail or getting a jagged edge...and if I don&#x27;t file it down immediately, chances are I will end up ripping it or biting it off. (Just for example, right now, I have a nail file in a basket on the couch, in a drawer in the kitchen, in the half bath, in my bedroom, in my purse, in my travel bag, and in the glove box of my husband&#x27;s car. See, I told you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the crystal files, and have a great set I bought elsewhere, but they only come with velvet slip-on cases, and I&#x27;ve had them slide out before (in my purse) and then get broken--so I wanted something with a bit sturdier case. And I found this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really small and convenient--I think it would easily fit in a pocket for on-the-go use or tossed in purse (even if it fell to the bottom). It fits in the case nicely and snaps shut easily (almost a bit too easily, but I shook it and it didn&#x27;t come apart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll be ordering these in the larger sizes for at-home use.</li>
            <li> Excellent given as a gift because i LOVE the one that I have owned for over ten years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a classical guitarist and need to keep my nails well-manicured to play my instrument. This file does an excellent job of quickly and precisely shaping the nail. The one caveat is that, being glass, it is quite fragile; drop it on a hard surface (as I did a moment ago) and it may break. While it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a file, I liked it so much that I&#x27;m about to shell out the dough to buy a replacement. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best nail file I&#x27;ve used in a long time. Love it. Fits perfect in my cosmetic bag in my purse!</li>
            <li> I have used crystal nail files for some years and this one works just fine. Problem is that the file is slightly too thick so it is difficult to file the nail edges. The case comes in handy for traveling. I&#x27;d say this is more an emergency nail file for the handbag than for extensive manicure sessions. And maybe a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Husband gave it to me for Christmas, and I have to say that I really like it!  The fact that it comes in a stylish little case is great. I can find it easily in my purse, and it doesn&#x27;t get all dirty from being shuffled around in the bottom of the purse. Great for the price! Might get a second one to keep elsewhere.</li>
            <li> it is not just practical. it is also very pretty. it is my favorite file and i might have to get me a second one for the road. would make a good gift also. would definitely buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> This is a handy nail file to keep in your purse for emergencies. However, the cheap plastic case does not hold up very well. I have had it in my purse for less than a week, and it&#x27;s already getting scratched up. Also the file itself is a little too thick.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect item to add to a Christmas box for a gift.  The recipient was very excited...perfect size!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter.  She hates normal files &amp; emery boards but doesn&#x27;t mind this one.</li>
            <li> This was bought on advice of daughter. I highly recommend also.</li>
            <li> I am replacing this for the 3rd time.  Oh, but yes I love these little guys.  I end up dropping it about once a year and get a new one.  It is convenient and seems to be less abrasive on my nails. I think I may opt for a full size one to keep at home so when my travel one breaks I will have a constant backup.</li>
            <li> I really like this very hand tool.  It works like a charm and is easy to carry around with me anywhere.</li>
            <li> The best type of nail file---it leaves no jagged edges, and is so compact. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love these. Bought 2 more for gifts. Also smaller size for my purse. Really like that they  come with a case.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these. The size is plenty long to file my nails from any angle and yet not so long it&#x27;s unwieldy in my small hands. These crystal files seem to be easier on my nails &amp; I enjoy not hearing that &amp;#34;rasping or fingernails on a blackboard&amp;#34; noise of regular emery boards.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the second one so I&#x27;d have 1 in my purse &amp; 1 at home. The older file of mine still works well. They&#x27;re easy to clean with soap, hot water &amp; a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Good value, packed well &amp; arrived on time.</li>
            <li> My sister had two nail tek files, one just like this and the other was very coarse. I didn&#x27;t care for the coarse one. This is perfect size for your purse. I bought the larger one as well. Much cheaper here than if you purchased from your salon. I think my sister paid $25 for one!</li>
            <li> I love that this file shapes my nails easily and leaves a smooth finish. The bright colored case makes it easy to see in my purse.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, perfect small size and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail file in both the larger version (for home) and this mini version (for my purse.)  This is one of the best files I&#x27;ve ever owned for keeping the tips of my  nails smooth and snag-free.  There are other glass/crystal files out there, but be sure to get one with a case.  If you just dump stuff in the bottom of your purse (like I do!) the glass/crystal file is likely to snap in two if not protected by the case.  Plus, the bright color makes it easier to find in the black hole that my purse has become, LOL!</li>
            <li> Best files ever.  I keep this size in my purse and have let many friends use it.  Much better than any regular file or emery board.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered extras.</li>
            <li> Great nail file for shaping and super smoothing without chipping your nails. Great small shape for carrying in purse. Bright case color helps file be easily found in purse.</li>
            <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;I love that this cute nail file, unlike many inexpensive glass/crystal nail files, has nice traction and is rough enough to actually file your nails instead of slip all over the place. It is gentle enough though so that your nails won&#x27;t shred or split or peel or flake. I really like the case too, as it is hard and sturdy and will be easy to find in my purse, plus keep the file from breaking. I like the short length and find it perfect for my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean too--just run the file under a faucet as water will not damage it. It can be sterilized with heat (up to 483F), boiling water, alcohol and UVB lighting. It can even be put in the dishwasher to sterilize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just have to be careful not to drop it on a hard surface (like the floor), as it is glass and it could break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a Lifetime Replacement Guarantee. Who could ask for more than this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
            <li> It may work well if you need touching up on the go. Its very short that a bit awkward to file my small nails. It does the job better than emery board but a bit thick for nail corners like some reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> This nail file was a great deal. I really like the way the crystal files my nails. The case is an added bonus because I keep it in my purse and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the file breaking.</li>
            <li> Very nice, quick delivery, just the right size. I&#x27;ve always had very fragile nails that would peel and split.  Metal files leave my nails rough, while crystal files leave a smooth finish and you can even smooth out ridges. They can also can be washed ,dried and be good as new again.  This crystal file files on both sides . Works great and you can groom your nails quick.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I carry this every day in my purse.  It&#x27;s the perfect size to tote around so I can file down any snags or tears while I&#x27;m at school all day.  This will probably get a ton of use now that the weather is turning colder! Makes your nail edges so so smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had anything like this! It doesn&#x27;t have an end!!! I use it a LOT, but it&#x27;s still like new:) have it with me all the time and use it gladly! No more emery boards:) i have naturals nails, so you may take it to condideration! You try it for the first time, and you never going to use anything else again!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received my mini crystal file about 5 minutes ago... I love it.  Perfect for my purse, files nails just fine. I would highly recommend this file.</li>
            <li> Glass &amp; crystal files are light years beyond metal or emery board files.  They have the perfect amount of abrasiveness and the result is a perfectly smooth surface on your nail.  A nice protective case tops it all off.</li>
            <li> Small and easy to have with you everywhere you go! I love the carrying case that it comes in.</li>
            <li> Crystal nail files?  Hmmm, I was intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I&#x27;d start small, and get one with a full case as other reviews said these suckers can snap in two.  Knowing that, I&#x27;ve been very careful about when and where I press on things while I&#x27;m filing.  I also file the dry skin around my nails in the winter time, which works very well when you use little water on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal nail files?  Who knew?</li>
            <li> The texture of the file works well for filing nails and mine seem less prone to splitting with the crystal files. I keep this in my small cross-body bag so I always have a nail file. I bought this (and a larger Nail Tek file) after my previous crystal nail file broke. The case is essential for protecting the nail file and has held up after almost 3 years. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Once I got this glass file from my manicurists I can do my nails easily and perfectly.  No more Emory boards.  And price so much better than her charge,  I have two one for purse one for home.  She said to get the short one because the Long ones break.</li>
            <li> Size is perfect for purse, gentle file for my thin nails.  Case is flimsy. This, overall, is a great nail file.</li>
            <li> A little expensive compared to others.  But, this can fit in your evening bag or your everyday purse.  It looks good, very nice sturdy case.  Should last a very long time.  Makes an attractive gift to someone you want to spend under $10 on, yet looks &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This made a great stocking stuffer. It can be put in a purse for emergency filing or used at home.</li>
            <li> Very different from traditional emery boards. Very fine.</li>
            <li> This file is so great, works really well and seems like it will never wear down. Just have to rinse it off occasionally. My nails also seem to be growing better from using this... thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I had a crystal file a few years ago and it disappeared so I ordered this one. It&#x27;s a bit bulkier than I expected but the file and case are solid and I can now touch up a broken nail when I am out and about.</li>
            <li> I keep this little one in my purse. It&#x27;s convenient and I can find it easily because of it&#x27;s color.</li>
            <li> Love this. I have tried several glass files. The Nail Tek works best for me.  This one fits in my purse easily, so it is always handy when a nail needs attention.</li>
            <li> This nail file is the perfect size for my purse. The file is not too rough and does a great job. The case is just plastic, but does the job. I would definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best nail files I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> Great file for my purse.  Also have the larger version for home.  The case works great too!</li>
            <li> Nice nail file, although you have to be very careful because it is glass.  But if you are careful and return it to its case every time you finish using it, it will last you for a very long time.</li>
            <li> reall handy to carry n ones purse</li>
            <li> The crystal files are the best. I play guitar, and other files don&#x27;t keep my nails from splitting when I play as well as this file does. I got the files in two sizes. I like the Nail Tek files in particular because of the cases.</li>
            <li> Very nice to have a case for the glass nail file.</li>
            <li> I love this nail file! I have been looking for years for a small nail file with case for my car; I found nothing in stores so tried Amazon. Reading rave reviews for crystal files, I purchased this and another larger file for home; I agree 100% with other reviews that these are the best files I have ever used. At three inches it is perfect size for a nook in my car, files swiftly and always leaves smooth finish.  I&#x27;d prefer a different color case (being a guy) but then again, it&#x27;s only for my car.</li>
            <li> I like this file for carrying in my purse. It doesn&#x27;t abrade the inside of my purse since it&#x27;s inside its own case. Very nice file.</li>
            <li> I like crystal nail files and this one is ideal because it comes in what seems to be a pretty sturdy plastic case.  The bright pink color makes it easy to find it in my handbag.</li>
            <li> Excellent file! Not only is the 3\\&quot; length a super-convenient purse size, but...Hello! It has a ROUNDED TIP instead of the typical sharp pointed end that breaks (the pointed ones are so sharp they&#x27;ve actually been taken from me at airport security checkpoints). I hope the manufacturer makes these 3\\&quot; files forever!</li>
            <li> One of the better on market , but very brittle and breakable , even in protective case. Still I will get a replacement it works that well.  Chuck&#x27;s wife</li>
            <li> After being introduced to crystal nail files by my cousin, nothing else will do.  Problem with carrying them in my purses is that they tend to break.  This version solves that problem by coming in a small, metal case.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> The file is very nice. The case is pretty but doesn&#x27;t stay closed very well</li>
            <li> These are sometimes hard to find and my wife was quite chagrined when her file broke and she could not find one locally.  This is just what she wanted.</li>
