            <li>I love all the scents by Liz.</li>
            <li>i am not a fan of most of this fragrance line...</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most perfumes (even in detergents, soaps, etc.).  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of both</li>
            <li>it was an awesome present for my aunt</li>
            <li>I gave it to my granddaughter because her favorite color is purple.  </li>
            <li>A good spritz makes the gorgeous floral smell apparent.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a beautiful soft flowery scent.</li>
            <li>scent has a good amount of longevity and smells very feminine and fresh.</li>
            <li>At the time I spotted the bottle, it was more than I was looking to spend right then, so I didn&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
            <li>after about an hour , its gone,i dont mind paying alittle more for a higher quality scent,only if it lasts longer,</li>
            <li>Anyhow, the scent was actually quite nice!</li>
            <li>it has to me a nice clean scent that is not going to enter a room before you do.it has a soft feminine scent that is not too floral or spicy.i have gotten alot of friends telling me..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all too sweet, but you&#x27;ll appreciate the mild fruitiness it has.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a smidge of frutiness to it, but mainly it&#x27;s a mild floral fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, the pretty color of the bottle caught my eye!</li>
            <li>I received my order super quick and the product was exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my body chemistry or my sensitive nose, but most perfumes make me sneeze</li>
            <li>Okay, I am not a big Fan of Elizabeth Taylor perfumes, but Violet Eyes is NOT a disappointment!</li>
            <li>This is just right.</li>
            <li>although the scent is great ,it doesnt last long .</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and she likes it also;)</li>
            <li>I never really thought of buying an Elizabeth Taylor fragrance before because quite honestly, I associated her scents with being for  older women.</li>
            <li>I AM REALLY UPSET</li>
            <li>,I REALLY DO BELIEVE</li>
            <li>Smells a lot like D&amp;G Light Blue.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>You can pick up the jasmine and rose, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>Its very fresh smelling and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>If you like a warm, subtle scent, go for it.</li>
            <li>but this one surprised me!</li>
            <li>So far I have worn it two hours without sneezing or feeling like I can&#x27;t breathe.  </li>
            <li>Also tried the White Diamonds without negative reaction but love the Violet Eyes.</li>
            <li>I usually get nasal congestion, sneezing, shortness of breath around many colognes or perfumes and have only worn Red Door or Giorgio for Women for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my bottle right down to the end, and I cannot remember the last time I&#x27;ve done that.</li>

            <li> Smells nice my mom loved it</li>
            <li> I AM REALLY UPSET THAT I SPENT MY MONEY ON THIS PERFUME,I REALLY DO BELIEVE IT WAS A KNOCK OFF OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE SMELL, SMELLED LIKE PERFUME YOU BUT FROM THE DOLLAR TREE!! BEEN HAD IT FOR 2 MONTH&#x27;S AND HAVE NOT USE 1 DROP OF IT BECAUSE IT SMELL SO STANKY!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a birthday gift for my mother she loves it. I will definitely order again..</li>
            <li> I never really thought of buying an Elizabeth Taylor fragrance before because quite honestly, I associated her scents with being for  older women. I was very wrong! I spotted a bottle at Kohl&#x27;s a month ago and sprayed a bit on my wrist. I&#x27;ll admit, the pretty color of the bottle caught my eye! Anyhow, the scent was actually quite nice! There&#x27;s a smidge of frutiness to it, but mainly it&#x27;s a mild floral fragrance. You can pick up the jasmine and rose, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all. You can also detect a little bit of amber, for some depth.  At the time I spotted the bottle, it was more than I was looking to spend right then, so I didn&#x27;t purchase it. When I was here on Amazon looking through the perfumes and saw it - for $9.99, I decided it was too good of a deal to pass up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent has a good amount of longevity and smells very feminine and fresh. It&#x27;s not at all too sweet, but you&#x27;ll appreciate the mild fruitiness it has.  This is an excellent choice if you want a scent that flat out smells great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice love it</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most perfumes (even in detergents, soaps, etc.).  I usually get nasal congestion, sneezing, shortness of breath around many colognes or perfumes and have only worn Red Door or Giorgio for Women for years.  I received Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds and Violet Eyes for Xmas and hesitantly decided to try it.  I love the smell of both but especially the Violet Eyes which to me seems to be on the spicy side vs. flowery.  So far I have worn it two hours without sneezing or feeling like I can&#x27;t breathe.  Also tried the White Diamonds without negative reaction but love the Violet Eyes.</li>
            <li> Greatest perfume ever.</li>
            <li> Mmmm nice fragance very clean scent</li>
            <li> Violet Eyes has become one of my favorites ;) I shared this with my Mom and she likes it also;)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with perfume thank you it was an awesome present for my aunt</li>
            <li> Please do not ever stop selling Violet Eyes by Elizabeth Taylor. I plan to wear this forever. The local stores only sell it around the holidays.</li>
            <li> Smells a lot like D&amp;G Light Blue. Nice for spring/summer and not &amp;#34;old lady-like&amp;#34;  (Which is what I think when I hear it was made by Elizabeth Taylor)</li>
            <li> Okay, I am not a big Fan of Elizabeth Taylor perfumes, but Violet Eyes is NOT a disappointment! The 1 ounce bottle is a perfect&lt;br /&gt;size for those who don&#x27;t pour the bottle all over themselves. A good spritz makes the gorgeous floral smell apparent. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift.  I gave it to my granddaughter because her favorite color is purple.  When she opened it and smelled the fragrance, she was thrilled!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my body chemistry or my sensitive nose, but most perfumes make me sneeze or I just hate the fragrance. For instance, I don&#x27;t like anything else in Miss Taylor&#x27;s line of perfumes, or Estee Lauder. They are too loud, too sharp, too funky, or whatever. This is just right. It&#x27;s feminine and mellow and just seems to sink in and become part of you (well, me anyway). Great for daytime because it doesn&#x27;t overpower. Not too flowery or fruity. I&#x27;ve used my bottle right down to the end, and I cannot remember the last time I&#x27;ve done that. They usually \\&quot;turn\\&quot; before I use them up, or I just get tired of them. If you like a warm, subtle scent, go for it.</li>
