            <li>They look amazing with or without primer.</li>
            <li>I received the 88 warm color palette in the mail today.</li>
            <li>I just received my 88 color warm palette in the mail today.</li>
            <li>All of the colors are super pigmented and great quality.</li>
            <li>These eye shadows are nice, love the colors.</li>
            <li>It was in a large letter envelope!!!!</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful, highly pigmented with a lovely creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>( I love the colors</li>
            <li>This is sure fire winner.</li>
            <li>you have a much better chance with coastal scents, they wrap there palletes in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>I have seen tutorials using this palette, and wasn&#x27;t too sure about it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I decided to get it.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, if I order it again, it will be mailed with better protection</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>but, there are WAY better quality eye shadows out there.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>the application itself works better with an eyelid promer.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a mixture of shimmer colors and matte.</li>
            <li>I love the colors but when it came there was powered everywhere</li>
            <li>sooo many colours, matter and shimmer, every shade, you could match every skin tone.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging as well.</li>
            <li>I love using this on my sister to figure out what I&#x27;m going to wear each day.</li>
            <li>and she still uses them daily and has not even finished the first palette yet, just an incredible purchase and great product</li>
            <li>I love it packaging was great just what I was looking for highly recommended</li>
            <li>and the colors are very vibrant on their own!</li>
            <li>Love my BH neutral palette, the colors are perfect for my very pink skin tone.</li>
            <li>, product works great and does exactly as it is supposed to, would highly recommend both this product and this seller to anyone and everyone 10/10 A+!!!</li>
            <li>I think what I love the most is that these colors really do look amazing on every skin tone (which is why they make such great gifts).</li>
            <li>I received it quick, and to my surprise, it was all wrapped up so the eyeshadows wouldn&#x27;t break in transit!</li>
            <li>I guess that just means I will have to use the cracked ones first! :)</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and I love the price, but not worth it if it isn&#x27;t usable.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic shadow palette.</li>
            <li>I love makeup and love to try differant colors, so overall I was pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>I was so excited to recieve this pallette.</li>
            <li>Normally I love the BH Cosmetics line because of the pigment.it&#x27;s so strong and true to it&#x27;s color without needing a whole lot of it</li>
            <li>It definitely can hold it&#x27;s own with some of the top brands.  </li>
            <li>Love the colors, I like to wear more mature colors with my skin complexion and this has alot of variety for me.</li>
            <li>And so far I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>but it is very disapointing, should have packaged it better.</li>
            <li>Amazon rocks tho, because they issued me a full refund and paid return shipping.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery  </li>
            <li>:  The palette comes in a box which was wrapped securely, but the palette itself was very scratched.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna have SO much fun</li>
            <li>Nothing was cracked or broken and was packed very good!</li>
            <li>Our youngest daughter bought this with her own money for her big sister.</li>
            <li>So worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth it</li>
            <li>totally worth it</li>
            <li>I ordered from Amazon, instead directly from BH, hoping for better results.</li>
            <li>My product didn&#x27;t have any kind of protection on all it came in was a flat box.</li>
            <li>I noticed right away it was ruined.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that BH will do what is right.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for this smooth and quick process.</li>
            <li>It has been resolved for the most part, but it still was a major inconvenience.    </li>
            <li>, 2 days later, I had a brand new one, in good condition.</li>
            <li>You get 120 beautiful long lasting colors for under $30- the price of just two MAC eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Luckily, they r easy to place back.</li>
            <li>I was pretty exited to order</li>
            <li>I would suggest buying it for a teenager for her first neutral palette.  </li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON &amp; BH COSMETICS!</li>
            <li>and then I can actually use the product and give a better rating.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s just enough color contrast to use for a party and every day school attire without looking like a street walker. :)</li>
            <li>Thanks BHCostmetics!</li>
            <li>I actually just received an email this morning saying it would be here in a week and the postman just delivered it :)</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>because it was most likely come out defected like this one.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li>very surprised it came so quickly</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to receive this palette a full week earlier than the original date!     </li>
            <li>There is a great balance of shimmer and matte, light and dark, sheer and opaque, and not a single unusable color.</li>
            <li>The colors are just what I wanted - a warm neutral that&#x27;s not too overpowering, but has a little bit of life in them.</li>
            <li>and i cant believe that I got all these amazing colors for such a low price.</li>
            <li>As an AMAZON PRIME member this is really dissaponting and frustraiting.</li>
            <li>that I prob wouldn&#x27;t use too much of anyway.</li>
            <li>very upset</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and well packagedl.</li>
            <li>i own the 120 palette 2nd edition and obviously the 88 neutral palette.</li>
            <li>the following day to writing the feedback i received a call from bh cosmetics saying they saw the review and were willing to send me a new one free.</li>
            <li>I just received my palette in the mail and was so excited to open it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product in the hopes that most of the other reviewers were incorrect on the condition that these items will be in once they are shipped to me.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the package this particular item was full with white dust all over, so I tooked off the item box and plastic bag</li>
            <li>Combination of the scratched palette case, 1 broken color and my card being hacked, wasn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li>I received the palette within 3 days of the purchase so that was impressing, NONE of the shadows were broken, and the packing was fair decent.</li>
            <li>and plan on getting a few more as gifts for the holiday season.</li>
            <li>Two of the light colors had small chips in them, however the excess powder was easily wiped away and it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li>Other than that everything else was fine.</li>
            <li>You do get a lot for your money here and the company sends the package without trouble (i.e.: crumbling shadows and mess as I have experienced with Shany.  </li>
            <li>I will most likely be sending these back to the seller and asking for my money back, which is a shame because I really like all of the colors in the kit.</li>
            <li>there wasn&#x27;t one single color full in place.</li>
            <li>so when I opened it a few of the eyeshadows were smashed and the entire top fell of because parts of the hinge were cracked of, although the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>and they apologized and sent me a new one.   </li>
            <li>I have had the 2nd edition for several months now, use them every day, and there is still plenty left of the colors that I use most often.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>the 120 palette has amazing red shadows as we all know hard to find.</li>
            <li>The plastic wrap covering the case was completely covered in eye shadow dust.</li>
            <li>I wrote to amazon directly regarding this problem</li>
            <li>I really want the product and only want to order it from amazon</li>
            <li>However, the tools are rubbish and the powders are SOFT.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the makeup itself, maybe too soft?  </li>
            <li>i first left seller feedback and noted that my 88 neutral palette had come with many broken shadows.</li>
            <li>and i love the pigmentation, however I was very dissapointed today when i finally recieved it and 3 colors were broken.  </li>
            <li>this product was mailed in barely any packaging</li>
            <li>You cannot go wrong with the price, selection of shades and nice color pay off.  </li>
            <li>so it last very long, but this pallet is so light the pigment is slightly weaker.</li>
            <li>There was other shades of colors all over the whole palette</li>
            <li>I dug in with one of the rough applicators and wasted a fourth of the light champagne color.</li>
            <li>You can add me to the list of people who ordered this palette despite the negative reviews hoping that I would be one of the lucky ones that received it intact because I get two day shipping....  </li>
            <li>they are very soft and extremely pigmented.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It has been resolved for the most part, but it still was a major inconvenience.    </li>
            <li> , 2 days later, I had a brand new one, in good condition.</li>
            <li> You get 120 beautiful long lasting colors for under $30- the price of just two MAC eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Luckily, they r easy to place back.</li>
            <li> I was pretty exited to order</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying it for a teenager for her first neutral palette.  </li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON &amp; BH COSMETICS!</li>
            <li> and then I can actually use the product and give a better rating.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s just enough color contrast to use for a party and every day school attire without looking like a street walker. :)</li>
            <li> Thanks BHCostmetics!</li>
            <li> I actually just received an email this morning saying it would be here in a week and the postman just delivered it :)</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> because it was most likely come out defected like this one.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> very surprised it came so quickly</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to receive this palette a full week earlier than the original date!     </li>
            <li> There is a great balance of shimmer and matte, light and dark, sheer and opaque, and not a single unusable color.</li>
            <li> The colors are just what I wanted - a warm neutral that&#x27;s not too overpowering, but has a little bit of life in them.</li>
            <li> and i cant believe that I got all these amazing colors for such a low price.</li>
            <li> As an AMAZON PRIME member this is really dissaponting and frustraiting.</li>
            <li> that I prob wouldn&#x27;t use too much of anyway.</li>
            <li> very upset</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and well packagedl.</li>
            <li> i own the 120 palette 2nd edition and obviously the 88 neutral palette.</li>
            <li> the following day to writing the feedback i received a call from bh cosmetics saying they saw the review and were willing to send me a new one free.</li>
            <li> I just received my palette in the mail and was so excited to open it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the hopes that most of the other reviewers were incorrect on the condition that these items will be in once they are shipped to me.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the package this particular item was full with white dust all over, so I tooked off the item box and plastic bag</li>
            <li> Combination of the scratched palette case, 1 broken color and my card being hacked, wasn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> I received the palette within 3 days of the purchase so that was impressing, NONE of the shadows were broken, and the packing was fair decent.</li>
            <li> and plan on getting a few more as gifts for the holiday season.</li>
            <li> Two of the light colors had small chips in them, however the excess powder was easily wiped away and it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> Other than that everything else was fine.</li>
            <li> You do get a lot for your money here and the company sends the package without trouble (i.e.: crumbling shadows and mess as I have experienced with Shany.  </li>
            <li> I will most likely be sending these back to the seller and asking for my money back, which is a shame because I really like all of the colors in the kit.</li>
            <li> there wasn&#x27;t one single color full in place.</li>
            <li> so when I opened it a few of the eyeshadows were smashed and the entire top fell of because parts of the hinge were cracked of, although the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> and they apologized and sent me a new one.   </li>
            <li> I have had the 2nd edition for several months now, use them every day, and there is still plenty left of the colors that I use most often.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> the 120 palette has amazing red shadows as we all know hard to find.</li>
            <li> The plastic wrap covering the case was completely covered in eye shadow dust.</li>
            <li> I wrote to amazon directly regarding this problem</li>
            <li> I really want the product and only want to order it from amazon</li>
            <li> However, the tools are rubbish and the powders are SOFT.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the makeup itself, maybe too soft?  </li>
            <li> i first left seller feedback and noted that my 88 neutral palette had come with many broken shadows.</li>
            <li> and i love the pigmentation, however I was very dissapointed today when i finally recieved it and 3 colors were broken.  </li>
            <li> this product was mailed in barely any packaging</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with the price, selection of shades and nice color pay off.  </li>
            <li> so it last very long, but this pallet is so light the pigment is slightly weaker.</li>
            <li> There was other shades of colors all over the whole palette</li>
            <li> I dug in with one of the rough applicators and wasted a fourth of the light champagne color.</li>
            <li> You can add me to the list of people who ordered this palette despite the negative reviews hoping that I would be one of the lucky ones that received it intact because I get two day shipping....  </li>
            <li> they are very soft and extremely pigmented.</li>
            <li> Several of the shadows are broken, and the \\&quot;top\\&quot; half of the black shadow (which appears to be the bottom row, third from the left) has completely detached and is sitting on top of the color second from the left.  </li>
            <li> The colors were very pretty, but several of the eyeshadows were broken.</li>
            <li> only downfall I had was when I opened the package a couple of the shades were cracked and it dusted the whole pallet... sucked to clean it... :(</li>
            <li> I waited so long.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to buy eyeshadow for a long time, this has every color you will ever need.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving my order and when I did, I opened the box and all of the eyeshadow was crumbled and broken before I even opened the plastic wrap for the actual palette.  </li>
            <li> I have dark blue eyes</li>
            <li> Only one color was cracked which is a dark color</li>
            <li> The palette case is fragile, and some pots had &#x27;less&#x27; than others.</li>
            <li> It is such a mess that I would rather just return it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to know that this item came 3 days early onto to be disappointed by the product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t fret because I figured probably on the distance the box traveled, they had just gotten a little mixed up.</li>
            <li> Even though it has many bad reviews I ignored them and decided to get it.</li>
            <li> Also, one color arrived broken, which wasn&#x27;t as bad as what others have experienced</li>
            <li> When I opened the case, there were at least 8-10 eyeshadows that had completely fallen apart to the point where they were not usable at all.  </li>
            <li> Only sad part of the whole experience was a few colors came cracked.</li>
            <li> I was suprised that it was sent to me in just a small envelope, no fragile stickers or any other wording on the outside of the package at all that would let the shipper know that the contents inside are very delicate and need to be handled with extra care.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy from bh cosmetics, they packgage there makeup poorly, so when it finely gets to u, u cant use it, its broken, powder everywhere, its not worth it...</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box that actually holds the case with all the eyeshadows in it, there were dusty eyeshadow colors mixed all over it.</li>
            <li> However, like half of the other reviews on here, mind came damaged.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit weary on buying such a dull palette but the colors are just right.&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
            <li> Not only did my package arrive 3 days late...</li>
            <li> them for my girlfriend over a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> They are a little shallow, therefore not having enough shadow.</li>
            <li> I received it with other 2 items in a small box without any protection at all.</li>
            <li> It is a total inconvenience, not happy with the damage to my product.</li>
            <li> When I opened up the case there were multiple colors all broken up.</li>
            <li> Even a few muted greens, blues, and purples.</li>
            <li> The lid came off in my hands when I opened it because a pin was missing.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time buying from this seller.  </li>
            <li> and when I finally opened the palette I realized the closure was broken and 2 eyeshadows destroyed.</li>
            <li> Too bad the palette was crap, it woulda been a great addition to my collection . .</li>
            <li> Sadly, I had to send back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Sadly about 4 of my eyeshadow colors were cracked and had spilled, but overall I cannot wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> Love Bh Cosmetics and hate UPS!!!</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with the experience.</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this makeup to come, but when it did I was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The palette arrived with about one third of the eyeshadows broken and the lid was also broken off.  </li>
            <li> not worth $20 for broken eye shadow</li>
            <li> and I was really looking forward to using this :(.</li>
            <li> I received My product late, and when i received it, almost half of the inside was broken..</li>
            <li> Also, the case was a little difficult to open, and because it was difficult, one of the trays popped out.</li>
            <li> Which sucks because I had to take it off.</li>
            <li> My shadows were broken and missing 😒</li>
            <li> For one a few of my shadows were broken, and the color circles were VERY small.</li>
            <li> That was a bummer because the broken ones made a mess all over the place!</li>
            <li> I really wish I would of listened to the reviews on this one because I am very unhappy with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased with the shipment at all!!</li>
            <li> i didnt even have to pay shipping or handling and didnt have to send in the broken one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived with a broken lid (the shadows were intact).</li>
            <li> It had been poorly packaged for shipment, no bubble wrap</li>
            <li> JUST LIKE EVERYONE SAID MY PALETTE IS BROKEN, EVEN THE MIRROR</li>
            <li> I knew some would be broken, but I didn&#x27;t expect 10 of them to be broken.</li>
            <li> I ordered the neutral eyeshadow and when i got it, 5 eyeshadows were completely broken.</li>
            <li> Although my pallet was broken when it got here</li>
            <li> We had to call and have it replaced twice and all three were badly broken.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging.</li>
            <li> Have had them since may, it is now august and havent had any broken colors.</li>
            <li> i am not a happy customer at all.</li>
            <li> my palette was completely broken too.  </li>
            <li> Today when my package arrived I was very disappointed to find that every single shadow is broken and there was make up pigment everywhere;</li>
            <li> I apologize that I&#x27;m giving a mediocre review.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with make-up</li>
            <li> the mirror was broken :(</li>
            <li> and I even had 2 day shipping opened it and some of the colors were completely broken and gone :(</li>
            <li> sorry!)</li>
            <li> Even coming out of the box it was so bad.</li>
            <li> So by the time it got to my house it had been so badly damaged</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not too disappointed in that.    </li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I AM SO DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I would like to say that I hate receive my products by UPS.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed:(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in my purchase.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was pretty exited to order this considering I&#x27;ve bought palettes from BH cosmetics before. Today when my package arrived I was very disappointed to find that every single shadow is broken and there was make up pigment everywhere; Terrible handling. It is a total inconvenience, not happy with the damage to my product.</li>
            <li> I never feel the need to write reviews but I just wanted to tell you how dissatisfied I was. Not only did my package arrive 3 days late...( which wasn&#x27;t a big issue to me) but my colors were also all busted up:( I love the colors but I was very disappointed:(</li>
            <li> While I do tend to fancy MAC eye shadows, this palette is a must-have for any make up enthusiast or a beginner.  I would suggest buying it for a teenager for her first neutral palette.  You cannot go wrong with the price, selection of shades and nice color pay off.  You do get a lot for your money here and the company sends the package without trouble (i.e.: crumbling shadows and mess as I have experienced with Shany.  This is sure fire winner.</li>
            <li> i first left seller feedback and noted that my 88 neutral palette had come with many broken shadows. the following day to writing the feedback i received a call from bh cosmetics saying they saw the review and were willing to send me a new one free. i didnt even have to pay shipping or handling and didnt have to send in the broken one. i was so impressed! i removed the feedback and now am writing this review.so obviously the service is great.now for the product. i own the 120 palette 2nd edition and obviously the 88 neutral palette. they are very soft and extremely pigmented. the 120 palette has amazing red shadows as we all know hard to find. if u want to see some swatches watch this video. [...]. it is of the 88 palette but all the shadows are of the same excelence!hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I received the 88 warm color palette in the mail today. I noticed right away it was ruined. The plastic wrap covering the case was completely covered in eye shadow dust. When I opened up the case there were multiple colors all broken up. I&#x27;m not pleased with the shipment at all!!</li>
            <li> I apologize that I&#x27;m giving a mediocre review.  Positives:  Great color selection, all of it work for me! Great pigmentation. I am happy I chose the 88! Quick delivery  Negatives:  The palette comes in a box which was wrapped securely, but the palette itself was very scratched. The palette case is fragile, and some pots had &#x27;less&#x27; than others. Also, one color arrived broken, which wasn&#x27;t as bad as what others have experienced so I&#x27;m not too disappointed in that.    THEN, whether it was amazon or BH, or my internet, but my credit card was hacked. It has been resolved for the most part, but it still was a major inconvenience.    Final note:  The palette colors are great, love that. Combination of the scratched palette case, 1 broken color and my card being hacked, wasn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have dark blue eyes so I prefer neutral shadows. When I saw this, I knew it was the palette for me. The colors are gorgeous! Every neutral shade I&#x27;ll ever need. Even a few muted greens, blues, and purples. I&#x27;m gonna have SO much fun experimenting with these shadows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived with a broken lid (the shadows were intact). The lid came off in my hands when I opened it because a pin was missing. I e-mailed BH and, 2 days later, I had a brand new one, in good condition. Personally, I think a defective case was shipped without anyone checking for problems. It was bubble-wrapped 3 times and packed with butcher paper. The box was undamaged.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to know that this item came 3 days early onto to be disappointed by the product. The 88 colors palette neutral eyeshadow was wrapped in plastic no bubble wrap with shadow everywhere. I don&#x27;t want to even take the palette out of the plastic wrap I am hoping that BH will do what is right.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this palette for my sister&#x27;s b-day (which is in 2 days) andi received it today BUUUT not only did they just leave it outside when its freaking raining it was also DAMAGED! there wasn&#x27;t one single color full in place. I am so upset! &amp; they can&#x27;t replace it, i have to get a refund in 3 days! What am i suppose to do now? THANKS AMAZON &amp; BH COSMETICS! &gt;&#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to receive this palette a full week earlier than the original date!     The colors are beautiful, highly pigmented with a lovely creamy consistency. Two of the light colors had small chips in them, however the excess powder was easily wiped away and it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. I&#x27;m having a great time experimenting with colors.    Thanks so much for this smooth and quick process. I will definitely order again from BHCosmetics in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this about a month ago. I do like the colors however when I received my palette the mirror was broken :( Which sucks because I had to take it off. I tried to glue it back on but it didn&#x27;t work. Other than that everything else was fine. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this eye shadow today, and when I opened it, they were completly shattered. they eye shadow was everywhere. Even coming out of the box it was so bad. i know this is not there fault but it is very disapointing, should have packaged it better. i think i will return. not worth $20 for broken eye shadow</li>
            <li> I just received my 88 color warm palette in the mail today. It had been poorly packaged for shipment, no bubble wrap and it wasn&#x27;t even in a box!! It was in a large letter envelope!!!! So by the time it got to my house it had been so badly damaged it&#x27;s usuable. I&#x27;m so bummed I&#x27;m an MUA and I was really looking forward to using this :(.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy from bh cosmetics, they packgage there makeup poorly, so when it finely gets to u, u cant use it, its broken, powder everywhere, its not worth it...you have a much better chance with coastal scents, they wrap there palletes in bubble wrap. Avoid bh cosmetics, everyone who orders from them has the same issue, I think they send it to u damaged already but dont care.</li>
            <li> You can add me to the list of people who ordered this palette despite the negative reviews hoping that I would be one of the lucky ones that received it intact because I get two day shipping....  Well, I wasn&#x27;t.  The palette arrived with about one third of the eyeshadows broken and the lid was also broken off.  Please don&#x27;t waste your time buying from this seller.  Sadly, I had to send back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I have seen tutorials using this palette, and wasn&#x27;t too sure about it. I am so glad that I decided to get it. The color pay off is wonderful, and not to mention the price! I received it quick, and to my surprise, it was all wrapped up so the eyeshadows wouldn&#x27;t break in transit! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I am so PISSED!!!!! JUST LIKE EVERYONE SAID MY PALETTE IS BROKEN, EVEN THE MIRROR I WILL RETURN THIS PRODUCT AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK..</li>
            <li> I just received my palette in the mail and was so excited to open it. Upon opening the box that actually holds the case with all the eyeshadows in it, there were dusty eyeshadow colors mixed all over it. I didn&#x27;t fret because I figured probably on the distance the box traveled, they had just gotten a little mixed up. Sadly about 4 of my eyeshadow colors were cracked and had spilled, but overall I cannot wait to try them out. The colors are just what I wanted - a warm neutral that&#x27;s not too overpowering, but has a little bit of life in them. The variety is perfect. I am so happy with this product! I guess that just means I will have to use the cracked ones first! :)</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving my order and when I did, I opened the box and all of the eyeshadow was crumbled and broken before I even opened the plastic wrap for the actual palette.  There was no bubble wrap in the box to protect it.  I received it today and will be sending it back tomorrow.  Hopefully, if I order it again, it will be mailed with better protection and then I can actually use the product and give a better rating.</li>
            <li> Received my palette today. When I pulled it out of the box I noticed eyeshadow dust all over the packaging. I knew some would be broken, but I didn&#x27;t expect 10 of them to be broken. It is such a mess that I would rather just return it. The colors are beautiful and I love the price, but not worth it if it isn&#x27;t usable.</li>
            <li> I bought this item ten days ago to give it to my sister as a present. I received it with other 2 items in a small box without any protection at all. When I opened the package this particular item was full with white dust all over, so I tooked off the item box and plastic bag and when I finally opened the palette I realized the closure was broken and 2 eyeshadows destroyed. I wrote to amazon directly regarding this problem and I have been waiting for an answer for several days now, but still nothing. As an AMAZON PRIME member this is really dissaponting and frustraiting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay. If you wanna play around with colors and looks then this would do but, there are WAY better quality eye shadows out there. Ended up giving o my niece.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the makeup itself is wonderful.  However, like half of the other reviews on here, mind came damaged.  When I removed the palette from its box, I immediately was covered in eye shadow dust.  Several of the shadows are broken, and the \\&quot;top\\&quot; half of the black shadow (which appears to be the bottom row, third from the left) has completely detached and is sitting on top of the color second from the left.  I&#x27;m so upset over this.</li>
            <li> I was a bit weary on buying such a dull palette but the colors are just right.&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s just enough color contrast to use for a party and every day school attire without looking like a street walker. :)</li>
            <li> I love this palette. Bh Cosmetics has a excellent quality and the customer&#x27;s service is very very good.  When I received my palette two colors were broke. Imediately I called to BH Cosmetics explaining what happened and they apologized and sent me a new one.   I would like to say that I hate receive my products by UPS. The worst service in USA. I had two problems and my friends too.    Love Bh Cosmetics and hate UPS!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this and LOVED the colors. They work brilliantly. Only sad part of the whole experience was a few colors came cracked. Great buy otherwise.</li>
            <li> I cannot even explain how much I love these products! All of the colors are super pigmented and great quality. They look amazing with or without primer. Plus- the various palettes have every color you would ever need or dream of! I have had the 2nd edition for several months now, use them every day, and there is still plenty left of the colors that I use most often. I&#x27;ve given these as gifts to several girlfriends and every one loves them- and plan on getting a few more as gifts for the holiday season. I get complimented on my makeup all the time- and i cant believe that I got all these amazing colors for such a low price. You get 120 beautiful long lasting colors for under $30- the price of just two MAC eyeshadows. I think what I love the most is that these colors really do look amazing on every skin tone (which is why they make such great gifts). The shipping is also very quick and they have great customer service. Thanks BHCostmetics!</li>
            <li> I received My product late, and when i received it, almost half of the inside was broken..There was other shades of colors all over the whole palette I&#x27;m just not satisfy with my product...I waited so long. My product didn&#x27;t have any kind of protection on all it came in was a flat box.</li>
            <li> this product was mailed in barely any packaging so when I opened it a few of the eyeshadows were smashed and the entire top fell of because parts of the hinge were cracked of, although the colors are pretty. I am not pleased with the experience.</li>
            <li> love the colors they are just the perfect shades of nude that I love !</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in my purchase.  My shadows were broken and missing 😒</li>
            <li> These eye shadows are nice, love the colors. I just wish the. Eye shadows were placed in deeper trays. They are a little shallow, therefore not having enough shadow. Also, the case was a little difficult to open, and because it was difficult, one of the trays popped out. Luckily, they r easy to place back.</li>
            <li> The colors were very pretty, but several of the eyeshadows were broken. That was a bummer because the broken ones made a mess all over the place!</li>
            <li> These warm colors are part of a great collection. the application itself works better with an eyelid promer. but all in all this is a great product</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to buy eyeshadow for a long time, this has every color you will ever need. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Just got my eyeshadow! Like 2 days after ordering it! very surprised it came so quickly.. I actually just received an email this morning saying it would be here in a week and the postman just delivered it :) wow! nice! as for the condition when recieved.. Nothing was cracked or broken and was packed very good! Colors are great.. cant wait to try them out :) 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li> Awesome! I received it within 2 days of ordering. Only one color was cracked which is a dark color that I prob wouldn&#x27;t use too much of anyway. I love that it has a mixture of shimmer colors and matte. I would def order from this company again! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Normally I love the BH Cosmetics line because of the pigment.it&#x27;s so strong and true to it&#x27;s color without needing a whole lot of it so it last very long, but this pallet is so light the pigment is slightly weaker.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product before purchasing it! And so far I&#x27;m in love! I received the palette within 3 days of the purchase so that was impressing, NONE of the shadows were broken, and the packing was fair decent. I will be purchasing from BH again!! Thank you BH love it!</li>
            <li> I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. I ordered the neutral eyeshadow and when i got it, 5 eyeshadows were completely broken. I messaged amazon and they told me theirs nothing i could do but return it. I really want the product and only want to order it from amazon but im scared to order it again because it was most likely come out defected like this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the hopes that most of the other reviewers were incorrect on the condition that these items will be in once they are shipped to me.  The seller does a very good job describing the eyeshadows, and I think for the price I paid for the amount of eyeshadow colors that I received it is an amazing deal!  What I am not so happy about is the condition in which the eyeshadows were in when they arrived to me in the mail.  I was suprised that it was sent to me in just a small envelope, no fragile stickers or any other wording on the outside of the package at all that would let the shipper know that the contents inside are very delicate and need to be handled with extra care. When I removed the case from the packaging I noticed immediately that there was eyeshadow dust surrounding the entire outside of the case.  When I opened the case, there were at least 8-10 eyeshadows that had completely fallen apart to the point where they were not usable at all.  I will most likely be sending these back to the seller and asking for my money back, which is a shame because I really like all of the colors in the kit.</li>
            <li> I love makeup and love to try differant colors, so overall I was pleased with my purchase only downfall I had was when I opened the package a couple of the shades were cracked and it dusted the whole pallet... sucked to clean it... :(</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this makeup to come, but when it did I was very disappointed! For one a few of my shadows were broken, and the color circles were VERY small. I really wish I would of listened to the reviews on this one because I am very unhappy with it!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shadow palette. There is a great balance of shimmer and matte, light and dark, sheer and opaque, and not a single unusable color. However, the tools are rubbish and the powders are SOFT. I dug in with one of the rough applicators and wasted a fourth of the light champagne color. I&#x27;ll be using my pinky finger and a brush to blend until I can find the softest shadow applicator possible to use with these. Still, I may not ever buy another shadow palette.</li>
            <li> Although my pallet was broken when it got here it didnt stop me from returning it i was satisfied with my purchase because the shadows were well pigmented!</li>
            <li> Love this set!  Great price point and the quality is superb.  It definitely can hold it&#x27;s own with some of the top brands.  This is a makeup lovers dream!!</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product and price, fast shipment, product works great and does exactly as it is supposed to, would highly recommend both this product and this seller to anyone and everyone 10/10 A+!!! AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought them for my girlfriend over a year and a half ago and she still uses them daily and has not even finished the first palette yet, just an incredible purchase and great product would highly recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I love the colors but when it came there was powered everywhere and I even had 2 day shipping opened it and some of the colors were completely broken and gone :( very upset</li>
            <li> Our youngest daughter bought this with her own money for her big sister. We had to call and have it replaced twice and all three were badly broken. Poor packaging. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, I like to wear more mature colors with my skin complexion and this has alot of variety for me. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I tried these out because of Carli beble (i know that is worng! sorry!) on youtube. As always her word holds strong, great product, great company. I would also recomend the BH 10 color blush palette, it is awesome as well.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews AFTER i purchased and I was dreading opening the box and finding a cracked makeup pallet.&lt;br /&gt;BUT my order arrived perfectly intact and the colors are wonderful nude and earth tones i wanted. So worth the price. Have had them since may, it is now august and havent had any broken colors. Shipping was fast and well packagedl. Worth it</li>
            <li> sooo many colours, matter and shimmer, every shade, you could match every skin tone. and the colors are very vibrant on their own! totally worth it homie</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve this pallette. Even though it has many bad reviews I ignored them and decided to get it. The colors are awesome  and i love the pigmentation, however I was very dissapointed today when i finally recieved it and 3 colors were broken.  :( i am not a happy customer at all.</li>
            <li> Great color selection! Love the packaging as well. Great for travel.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with make-up and this is the perfect palette for those who love creating awesome combinations. I love using this on my sister to figure out what I&#x27;m going to wear each day.</li>
            <li> Love my BH neutral palette, the colors are perfect for my very pink skin tone.</li>
            <li> Add me to the list too. . my palette was completely broken too.  I ordered from Amazon, instead directly from BH, hoping for better results. I think it&#x27;s the makeup itself, maybe too soft?  Anyhow, my palette was a total ruin. Amazon rocks tho, because they issued me a full refund and paid return shipping. Too bad the palette was crap, it woulda been a great addition to my collection . .😕</li>
            <li> I love it packaging was great just what I was looking for highly recommended</li>
