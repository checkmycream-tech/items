            <li>So happy I found it online because they have discontinued this shade.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>I would recommend some good moisturizer while wearing it.</li>
            <li>have always loved this lipstick but cn&#x27; find it in the store</li>

            <li>Love, love, love this product!!!</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>You cannot remove this type of color( in any color) very easily</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lipstick for its&#x27; staying power.  </li>
            <li>Because I love the color,  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>Love this lasts for hours and sometimes all day.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of lipstick</li>
            <li>I am no longer able to purchase this product in my area</li>
            <li>Love the product and the color.</li>
            <li>It will wear almost all day without touching up</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Easily the grossest thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my lips.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and stays  true to color all day.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite lipstick brand and color.</li>
            <li>I wear this almost every day and came back to stock up to make sure I don&#x27;t miss out on it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome, the color exactly as I asked for, and it last all day long!</li>
            <li>This is my current favorite color of the Revlon Colorstay  bunch.  </li>
            <li>It was the exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I bought several colors and love them all.</li>
            <li>I love how the color actually stays on.</li>
            <li>Knowing that information, though, it&#x27;s very easy to avoid by choosing foods that are not high in oil content...or by placing the food into your mouth in a manner not to smear it over your lips.  </li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t too deep as most lip stains but it really does stay on.</li>
            <li>I presume it does stay on a long time, but I sure wouldn&#x27;t want it to.</li>
            <li>I loved the color, and y last very long time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for having it</li>
            <li>I really recomend for who don&#x27;t have time for re- applying.</li>
            <li>Not only is this a very neutral color that is lovely on everyone, but it stays exactly where you place it and will not come off onto your glass or anything until you actively remove it.  </li>
            <li>Its getting harder to fine .</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t have enough lipsticks to find the right shade you want for the day.  </li>
            <li>Although these Revlon Colorstay lipsticks are fantastic, they are a little drying.</li>
            <li>It is either old or when there is frost in the lipstick it changes texture drastically from the others I have used.</li>
            <li>It really does last all day</li>
            <li>but in the tube, it appears exactly like the photo, pink infused with nude.</li>
            <li>Too light for me, which is hard to tell from a computer screen.</li>
            <li>The only warning I can provide is that if you consume a meal that is high in oils/grease, the oils will break down this product and it will then rub off.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;The one star is due to the terrific seller, well packaged and definitely sealed!</li>
            <li> A+ on the shipping, arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I am STILL looking for a lip color that lasts as long as it says it does.</li>
            <li> There were several other colors I had in mind if this one worked out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lipstick is clumpy and dry.  </li>
            <li> The color stays well and to add a little shine, I just apply lip gloss or lip balm over it later in the day.</li>
            <li> I can put it on in the morning after lining lips and it usually will stay all day it had been the only brand that I have stuck with for the last few years.</li>
            <li> cannot keep any other lip color on my lips longer than an hour because I must nibble it off.  </li>
            <li> But it dry yours lips a little</li>
            <li> It can dry a little bit but a lip balm takes care of that.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Wow, did I just get a bad one?</li>
            <li> for the short time it was on my lips, it was painfully drying.</li>
            <li> I hate the color as it appears on me (frosty day-glo pink, yikes!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sorry they have stop making it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is getting VERY  difficult to find color #070.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived factory sealed and unused, but maybe this was a bad batch of product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad about the money</li>
            <li> I did allow it time (30 minutes) to set, but it didn&#x27;t stop feeling painfully sticky.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite lipstick for its&#x27; staying power.  I love this color!</li>
            <li> Love it! Stays on great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teacher and I appreciate a lipstick that I don&#x27;t have to reapply every hour. The color isn&#x27;t too deep as most lip stains but it really does stay on. Sometimes I wake up with color still on my lips. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I apply it once in the morning and it lasts all day. No need to worry about what I eat or drink. So happy I found it online because they have discontinued this shade. A+ on the shipping, arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Because I love the color,  I&#x27;ve used it for years. But the last time I went to buy it  they had discontinued it so I found it here and purchased 5.  don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when its gone.  Thanks for having it</li>
            <li> Not only is this a very neutral color that is lovely on everyone, but it stays exactly where you place it and will not come off onto your glass or anything until you actively remove it.

            <li> &amp;#34;Colorstay&amp;#34; might be a bit of a misnomer ... I am STILL looking for a lip color that lasts as long as it says it does.</li>
            <li> have always loved this lipstick but cn&#x27; find it in the store any moe so gl ifound i on line lonest lasting lipsik i hav ever wo</li>
            <li> Love this lasts for hours and sometimes all day. Lasts thru eating and drinking. Revlon has quality products and an array of colors.</li>
            <li> Well, actually, I do leave home without it.  I apply this product before I leave for work and never have to reapply it during the entire day.  The only thing I do, once the initial application dries, is apply a gloss.  I do bring the gloss along to reapply throughout the day, but the color stays on wonderfully.  The only warning I can provide is that if you consume a meal that is high in oils/grease, the oils will break down this product and it will then rub off.  Knowing that information, though, it&#x27;s very easy to avoid by choosing foods that are not high in oil content...or by placing the food into your mouth in a manner not to smear it over your lips.  Love, love, love this product!!!</li>

            <li> It works great. The color stays well and to add a little shine, I just apply lip gloss or lip balm over it later in the day.</li>
            <li> This is my current favorite color of the Revlon Colorstay  bunch.  Unfortunately it is getting VERY  difficult to find color #070.&lt;br /&gt;It works with my fair and freckled face.  I put it on in the morning.......forget it..........and use make-up remover before bed to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot keep any other lip color on my lips longer than an hour because I must nibble it off.  You cannot remove this type of color( in any color) very easily and it stays put.&lt;br /&gt;Revlon.........bring back #070</li>
            <li> This lipstick is clumpy and dry.  It is either old or when there is frost in the lipstick it changes texture drastically from the others I have used.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. I&#x27;m really sorry they have stop making it. Its getting harder to fine . It really does last all day</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t have enough lipsticks to find the right shade you want for the day.  Always used Colorstay liquid Lipstick.</li>
            <li> I am no longer able to purchase this product in my area so I was very excited to find it on Amazon.  It was the exactly what I was looking for.  It stays on for the entire day without having to reapply it.  Perfect for anyone.  I bought several colors and love them all.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the color. Just wish they made it again.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite lipstick brand and color. I wear this almost every day and came back to stock up to make sure I don&#x27;t miss out on it! It can dry a little bit but a lip balm takes care of that. It will wear almost all day without touching up</li>
            <li> I love how the color actually stays on.</li>
            <li> Wow, did I just get a bad one? It arrived factory sealed and unused, but maybe this was a bad batch of product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is not how I remember it. While it still applies evenly, it&#x27;s totally sticky and stays sticky. Easily the grossest thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my lips. I did allow it time (30 minutes) to set, but it didn&#x27;t stop feeling painfully sticky. I hate the color as it appears on me (frosty day-glo pink, yikes!) but in the tube, it appears exactly like the photo, pink infused with nude. I&#x27;ve never had a lip product appear so differently on me than it does in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even for the short time it was on my lips, it was painfully drying. Meanwhile, it was so sticky that my lips stuck together like glue. I felt like I had a speech impediment trying to talk with this stuff on. Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed it by wiping it with several applications of lotion and tissue. I presume it does stay on a long time, but I sure wouldn&#x27;t want it to. I guess I&#x27;ll donate it. It&#x27;s too bad about the money but I learned never to order this product again. There were several other colors I had in mind if this one worked out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one star is due to the terrific seller, well packaged and definitely sealed!</li>
            <li> Too light for me, which is hard to tell from a computer screen.</li>
            <li> Wonderful wonderful product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, the color exactly as I asked for, and it last all day long! I really recomend for who don&#x27;t have time for re- applying.</li>
