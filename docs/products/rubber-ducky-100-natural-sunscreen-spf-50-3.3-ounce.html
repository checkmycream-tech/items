    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It IS the best sunscreen I ever used without any doubt.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s advertised as a tinted sunscreen and indeed inside the tube it perfectly tinted.</li>
            <li>We all have very fair skin and did not get sunburned.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is incredible.</li>
            <li>As a sunscreen it worked great.</li>
            <li>Great for the environment - not greasy or oily</li>
            <li>Great coverage.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t look well on my fair skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good protection from sun though -</li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin and it looks nice too.</li>
            <li>and I want to support their products as they&#x27;re non-toxic and extremely effective.</li>
            <li>that might or might not match your own skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I recommend letting the product warm up a bit</li>
            <li>(you can put it in the sun to warm up) and massage the bottle so that the product throughly mixes before applying it.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise you kind of get the effect of a ketchup bottle that hasn&#x27;t been shaken: water will dribble out.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and applies nicely.</li>
            <li>This worked great on all 7 of us who snorkeled in the hot sun in the Caribbean for hours each day.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Primarily because of all of the wonderful, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I found this company</li>
            <li>Big thumbs up for Rubber Ducky, hoping they will release a vegan, more aesthetic version one day: for now, the best sunscreen out there.</li>
            <li>It does make brown marks where it touches clothing although I was able to get them out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Was more than a bit daunted by the price(which</li>
            <li>was more than what Amazon charges), but it was all the cruise company shop had.</li>
            <li>It smells like real fresh lavender, but the scents fades quickly to a very light fragrance that even my husband doesn&#x27;t mind wearing it.</li>
            <li>As a result, it spreads easily.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily and leaves a dewy finish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Functionally as a sunscreen it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and the color almost matches my light tan complexion.</li>
            <li>Rubber Ducky doesn&#x27;t feel overly greasy so it is comfortable under clothing.  </li>
            <li>The tint will show up on light clothing.  </li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d put it on right away instead of waiting till most of the way thru our cruise when I was already wet(and probably burned).</li>
            <li>sunburn free on full day boat trips in and out the water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it left my skin feeling surprisingly moisturized for all the sun and sea water exposure it got.</li>
            <li>Definitely a loyal customer here.</li>
            <li>It was also super greasy.</li>
            <li>Soaks it quickly.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest: this sunscreen will be more or less flattering depending on your skin tone.</li>
            <li>(I rarely wear make up over it, but it works well with make up if needed.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found that using Oxy Clean Baby Stain Fighter helped remove much of the staining though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: yes, the smell is not my personal favorite, it is a little bit oily and the color sometimes is not perfect (they also use beeswax which I don&#x27;t really like either), but it works beautifully and protects your skin like nothing else, and I&#x27;m sure they will keep up the good work!</li>
            <li>This a good sunscreen, I like that this is all natural physical sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to launder as soon as possible to avoid permanent staining.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first step is sunblock to go under the spf clothes.  </li>
            <li>And as our tour guide had pretty much said if all you have is spray-on stuff...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried countless different sunscreens and I&#x27;ve found my favorite, definately re-ordering and have shared my feedback with all my friends here in Hawai&#x27;i which are all buying this product!</li>
            <li>It also felt very greasy...</li>
            <li>I spent most of the day outside in a very hot weather and did not get any sunburns.</li>
            <li>First off, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>Full coverage, very smooth, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>To avoid this, we put the sunblock on in the cool shade so it gets a chance to dry for five minutes before we even leave the house.  </li>
            <li>It is also easy to see where it has been applied, as the tint shows up quite clearly for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>However it goes on clear.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin recovering from acne scars and my skin feels soothed and protected</li>
            <li>(For my busy toddler, this is after a swim to tire her out</li>
            <li>My burn rapidly faded into a nice subtle tan, as did the rest of my lily white skin.</li>
            <li>It works, but this cream is extremely oily and leaves your skin so greasy, you would want to wash it off right away...</li>
            <li>Do be careful around light colored clothing until its had a chance to dry</li>
            <li>I have been using natural mineral (zinc oxide based) sunscreens for a couple years now, but I defintely see a big difference when using this one.</li>
            <li>unlike my two travel companions who used a normal drug store brand with the same SPF who burned numerous times and had to deal with</li>
            <li>Unlike most mineral sunscreens I have tried, this is quite a thin consistency.  </li>
            <li>Four hours later you can still feel its silky smoothness (and slightly sticky), but I reapply frequently to spots that get rubbed, washed, or are particularly exposed.  </li>
            <li>In addition to being pretty pale</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m putting something good on my face and my children&#x27;s faces and not something full of nasty chemicals.</li>

            <li> But I used just this stuff for the next two weeks, putting it on in the morning (a little thicker on the burned parts) and only reapplied if I&#x27;d been in the water for awhile.</li>

            <li> I typically wear a hat surfing as I have no hair on my head.  </li>
            <li> and this seems to cover well enough that it doesn&#x27;t get worse, plus the slight tint in it seems to make it less noticeable</li>
            <li> The tint is not attractive on Asian skin.  </li>
            <li> Washing it off is not easy as well.</li>
            <li> The bonus was knowing we weren&#x27;t hurting the coral which we would have done if we had used our usual sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I use it before surfing which means I am in the ocean for a least an hour.</li>
            <li> product is rather thick and can separate before it arrives to you.  </li>

            <li> I love this. Primarily because of all of the wonderful, natural ingredients. It feels good on the skin and it looks nice too. I feel like I&#x27;m putting something good on my face and my children&#x27;s faces and not something full of nasty chemicals. Definitely a loyal customer here.</li>
            <li> Greasy and darker than the one in the tin. Didn&#x27;t look well on my fair skin</li>
            <li> I have to be honest: this sunscreen will be more or less flattering depending on your skin tone. I have an olive complexion, so the color was not a problem for me. It is also a little greasy, but if you live in a cold climate like me, the oils really help to protect your skin. I have been using natural mineral (zinc oxide based) sunscreens for a couple years now, but I defintely see a big difference when using this one. It IS the best sunscreen I ever used without any doubt. I have sensitive skin recovering from acne scars and my skin feels soothed and protected: it&#x27;s like the sun rays never reach it. I&#x27;m really glad I found this company and I want to support their products as they&#x27;re non-toxic and extremely effective. I know they can still make some progress with their formulation: yes, the smell is not my personal favorite, it is a little bit oily and the color sometimes is not perfect (they also use beeswax which I don&#x27;t really like either), but it works beautifully and protects your skin like nothing else, and I&#x27;m sure they will keep up the good work! Big thumbs up for Rubber Ducky, hoping they will release a vegan, more aesthetic version one day: for now, the best sunscreen out there.</li>
            <li> The tint is not attractive on Asian skin.  It was also super greasy.</li>
            <li> Be forewarned that this product is tinted a &amp;#34;skin color&amp;#34; that might or might not match your own skin tone.  Also, the tinting can potentially stain light-colored clothing.  Be sure to launder as soon as possible to avoid permanent staining.  I tried to wash my white rash guard every night in the hotel sink while on vacation but it would not come out with regular soap or my shampoo.  I was on vacation for a week so by the time I got home and could use my washing machine the tinting had set in.  I found that using Oxy Clean Baby Stain Fighter helped remove much of the staining though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is rather thick and can separate before it arrives to you.  I recommend letting the product warm up a bit (you can put it in the sun to warm up) and massage the bottle so that the product throughly mixes before applying it.  Otherwise you kind of get the effect of a ketchup bottle that hasn&#x27;t been shaken: water will dribble out.  Warming the product will also help with the application because the texture of the product resembles the thickness of a facial clay mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionally as a sunscreen it worked fine.  I docked a star because of the staining.</li>
            <li> We were in Mexico in June and used this sunscreen. Neither of us ever had a sunburn even though we were in the or on the water for hours. I have only one complaint. It does make brown marks where it touches clothing although I was able to get them out. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and applies nicely. Soaks it quickly.</li>
            <li> As a sunscreen it worked great. However it&#x27;s advertised as a tinted sunscreen and indeed inside the tube it perfectly tinted. However it goes on clear. I was looking for a tinted sunscreen</li>
            <li> It works, but this cream is extremely oily and leaves your skin so greasy, you would want to wash it off right away... It&#x27;s a good protection from sun though - I spent most of the day outside in a very hot weather and did not get any sunburns. Washing it off is not easy as well.</li>
            <li> Unlike most mineral sunscreens I have tried, this is quite a thin consistency.  As a result, it spreads easily.  It is also easy to see where it has been applied, as the tint shows up quite clearly for a few minutes.  This has kept us (kids and adults) sunburn free on full day boat trips in and out the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step is sunblock to go under the spf clothes.  Rubber Ducky doesn&#x27;t feel overly greasy so it is comfortable under clothing.  The tint will show up on light clothing.  To avoid this, we put the sunblock on in the cool shade so it gets a chance to dry for five minutes before we even leave the house.  (No sand, bonus!)  Four hours later you can still feel its silky smoothness (and slightly sticky), but I reapply frequently to spots that get rubbed, washed, or are particularly exposed.  (For my busy toddler, this is after a swim to tire her out so she will sit still for a few minutes to let it dry again!)</li>
            <li> Great for the environment - not greasy or oily</li>
            <li> My order arrived a week ago and have used this product on a couple different occasions.  I typically wear a hat surfing as I have no hair on my head.  I used Rubber Ducky and didn&#x27;t wear the hat and I had no signs of burning after multiple 2 hour surf sessions here on Maui.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tinted sunscreen blends in well with you skin and doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy and stays on for as long as advertised (4hrs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried countless different sunscreens and I&#x27;ve found my favorite, definately re-ordering and have shared my feedback with all my friends here in Hawai&#x27;i which are all buying this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this sunscreen. First off, it&#x27;s all natural. When they say &amp;#34;natural tint&amp;#34; it means it&#x27;s like skintone color, but basically rubs in virtually colorless, almost like a BB cream. It smells like real fresh lavender, but the scents fades quickly to a very light fragrance that even my husband doesn&#x27;t mind wearing it. It takes a few minutes to feel dry on your skin. It does feel like you&#x27;re actually putting on something beneficial. Lasts forever in the sun and water. Will definitely be buying this again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> The tinted color in the product stained the cushions on sailboat as well as clothes we were wearing, basically everything it became in contact with.  It also felt very greasy...did not absorb well into the skin.  Truly understand what you are purchasing!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is incredible. Full coverage, very smooth, a little goes a long way. I chose this one because I have &#x27;pregnancy mask&#x27; from my previous pregnancies (dark spots on my forehead) and this seems to cover well enough that it doesn&#x27;t get worse, plus the slight tint in it seems to make it less noticeable (I rarely wear make up over it, but it works well with make up if needed.)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all of my friends. LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a last minute emergency sunscreen purchase before heading out on a 5 hour zodiac snorkeling cruise in Hawaii. Was more than a bit daunted by the price(which was more than what Amazon charges), but it was all the cruise company shop had. And as our tour guide had pretty much said if all you have is spray-on stuff...don&#x27;t even bother. Wish I&#x27;d put it on right away instead of waiting till most of the way thru our cruise when I was already wet(and probably burned). Burned my butt and the backs of my legs. But I used just this stuff for the next two weeks, putting it on in the morning (a little thicker on the burned parts) and only reapplied if I&#x27;d been in the water for awhile. My burn rapidly faded into a nice subtle tan, as did the rest of my lily white skin. No peeling and I didn&#x27;t burn again...unlike my two travel companions who used a normal drug store brand with the same SPF who burned numerous times and had to deal with peeling.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is pretty thick, but doesn&#x27;t feel gross or sticky, and a little goes a long way. Do be careful around light colored clothing until its had a chance to dry/settle in a bit as it can color transfer(though it washes out). In addition to being pretty pale I also have cranky, acne prone skin and this stuff did not irritate even when I put it on my face and it left my skin feeling surprisingly moisturized for all the sun and sea water exposure it got. Also didn&#x27;t have any issues with blending into my completion...even when it was the paler version I started out with.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again, and obviously, recommend to others. Guess I understand why that cruise company doesn&#x27;t bother carrying any other product...this one is all you need...</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and the color almost matches my light tan complexion. I use it before surfing which means I am in the ocean for a least an hour. I have noticed at night when I wash my fact that the sunscreen is still on hours later.</li>
            <li> This worked great on all 7 of us who snorkeled in the hot sun in the Caribbean for hours each day. We all have very fair skin and did not get sunburned. The bonus was knowing we weren&#x27;t hurting the coral which we would have done if we had used our usual sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This a good sunscreen, I like that this is all natural physical sunscreen.  The tint from the sunscreen blends into the skin but it stains your clothes and swimwear.  I tried contacting the USA distributor on how to removed the tint from my clothes but never got a response.  I personally would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Great coverage. Goes on easily and leaves a dewy finish. Must cover with finishing powder if you dislike that shiny look.</li>
