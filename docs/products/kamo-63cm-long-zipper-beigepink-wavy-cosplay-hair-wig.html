            <li>Thick, gorgeous and perfect</li>
            <li>Yes, this is a keeper and will make you look and feel fabulous and confident.  </li>
            <li>Cheap wig, I could buy better at a costume shop.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried putting it up in a ponytail or braiding or or styling it in any other way, but I doubt one would want to as the curls are a wonderful style as it is.</li>
            <li>Very cute, full, and fun.  </li>
            <li>arrived fast very lovely.</li>
            <li>I love that it arrived as described and the colors are true to the photo.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was very soft, a good length, and fit my head perfectly.</li>
            <li>Super cute i was so worried that my wig wouldn&#x27;t come on time for halloween</li>
            <li>It comes perfectly styled and looks and feels so natural and soft!</li>
            <li>It gets tangly but lightly brushing it helps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it got here.</li>
            <li>I own several wigs and this one is just ok.</li>
            <li>albeit when I got the package, the blonde wasn&#x27;t as bright as it was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>, I had MANY compliments and even questions on if it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>haha Will be ordering more by this seller.</li>
            <li>I cute mine into straight across bangs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cuteüçÉüíû</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and perhaps my favorite wig.  </li>
            <li>it looks exactly like the picture its soft and adorable!</li>
            <li>And despite being so cheap everyone thinks it is my real hair.</li>
            <li>The wig is very soft and the curls are easy to brush.</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought this one first.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tangle and the first day I wore it, people asked if I&#x27;d dyed my hair.</li>
            <li>the pink is nice</li>
            <li>it looks pretty much exactly what they advertise</li>
            <li>First of all...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty-</li>
            <li>Wig came in longer than I expected but overall great product pleasure doing buisness with you</li>
            <li>Is not exactly as pictured, does not have the bow and the bangs do not lay the way it does in the picture, but it was a fun wig to wear, nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Very thick, great coverage;</li>
            <li>Cute wig, fits well, color as to be expected.</li>
            <li>,also there&#x27;s a lot more pink than there is blond.</li>
            <li>Just style and you&#x27;re ready to go</li>
            <li>She wears it to school and some people even thought it was her real hair.</li>
            <li>SO much hair and fast shipping</li>
            <li>It was really soft and the color is true to the picture which surprised me because it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Good quality, can become frizzy but easy to brush out, bangs are really awkward</li>
            <li>the bangs are a lot shorter, and it&#x27;s came less curly and more wavy.</li>
            <li>The blonde is more yellow than the picture.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The wig has adjustable straps but absolutely no combs or clips so even with a stocking cap underneath it slips and does not stay securely on your head.</li>
            <li>Use a little dry shampoo or baby powder to take care of the shine and youre good to go.</li>
            <li>Only issue is that the underlining shows a bit right where the part is.  </li>
            <li>I live in the United States.</li>
            <li>The blonde color is pretty shiny, but I easily toned that down with some baby powder (thoroughly sprinkle all of the hair that is shiny with baby powder then comb it through with a paddle brush or wig brush).</li>
            <li>It was a little difficult to put on by myself, but with a friends help it was a nice secure all night!</li>
            <li>The coloring is light blonde and a pastel, carnation pink.</li>
            <li>Ive ordered 5 wigs so far from Amazon.</li>
            <li>, i fixed it of course</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by the color and texture of the hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 16 year old daughter because she is into cosplay.</li>
            <li>the blonde part is much yellower than shows in the picture.</li>
            <li>Soft and pretty long too.</li>
            <li>Bangs are a little long, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I mean I easily covered it up</li>
            <li>Relatively thin on top.</li>
            <li>The hair is a bit thin, and you could see the top of the wig through the hair when it was on.  </li>
            <li>its an ok wig, it came really knotty, so when i  tried brushin it out it shedded like crazy &amp; it still sheds everwhere, i straightened it aswell.</li>
            <li>I love this wig, very serious party hair here.</li>
            <li>I ended up just buying some wig/extension clips and sewing them in near the front (center front and sides near the ears) and in the back to help keep it in place.</li>

            <li> I ended up just buying some wig/extension clips and sewing them in near the front (center front and sides near the ears) and in the back to help keep it in place.</li>
            <li> tangles a little badly but its still very nice and soft.</li>
            <li> There honestly isn&#x27;t anything wrong with it other than the off colouring in the blonde.</li>
            <li> So thick and looks really REAL!</li>
            <li> but it couldn&#x27;t fit someone who  have thick long hair, it was to small.</li>
            <li> Bangs are really long.  </li>
            <li> This one was a second shot at something usable for a Princess Peach costume (the first wig I ordered I have also reviewed, it was too thin to be usable).</li>
            <li> And the bangs are VERY long!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, and so soft!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a little big in my head</li>
            <li> It was a little bit big on my head, but it was never a problem while I was wearing it.  </li>
            <li> The wig is a bit small for those with larger heads.</li>
            <li> just detangle with conditioning spray to keep it from getting excessively tangled at the bottom and in the back.</li>
            <li> Though the wig description says 4-5 days to ship, when you get down to the purchase process, it notes you will received the item in 17-28 days.</li>
            <li> My disappointment with this wig is that is is pretty thin (you can see the tracks when the hair is moved and near the parted area of the bangs), and its sheds a lot.</li>
            <li> Not a good timeline for last minute Halloween costumes.</li>
            <li> and it go a little frizzy at the bottom when I tried to brush it</li>
            <li> but it barely hides your real hair and where the hair parts you can see the base :/</li>
            <li> , this looks like when I had my hair done a few months</li>
            <li> I think you can get a few uses out of this wig...</li>
            <li> I literally have nothing negative to sat about this wig!</li>
            <li> But the thickness is very hard to brush through sometimes.</li>
            <li> I am now obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I cant yet</li>
            <li> but..when i opened the box and took out the wig..it was in really bad condition..</li>

            <li> Wig came in longer than I expected but overall great product pleasure doing buisness with you</li>
            <li> Its very nice for the pice! Just got it today. Soft and pretty long too. I&#x27;d def be buying more wigs from this seller ! (:</li>
            <li> Ive ordered 5 wigs so far from Amazon. This one was a second shot at something usable for a Princess Peach costume (the first wig I ordered I have also reviewed, it was too thin to be usable). I wish I had bought this one first.  Thick, gorgeous and perfect, I had MANY compliments and even questions on if it was my real hair. Yes, this is a keeper and will make you look and feel fabulous and confident.  The coloring is light blonde and a pastel, carnation pink. Highly recommended and perhaps my favorite wig.  It saved Princess Peach from a bad hair day!</li>
            <li> I love this!! I have never owned a wig before and I feel like a mermaid!! It is super soft looks great!! Bought 2 more by this company so impressed!</li>
            <li> arrived fast very lovely. tangles a little badly but its still very nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best. I own several wigs and this one is just ok. I feel the cap is big. It&#x27;s overpriced for the quality of the wig.</li>
            <li> The wig feels great for the price but it couldn&#x27;t fit someone who  have thick long hair, it was to small.</li>
            <li> Cute wig, fits well, color as to be expected.</li>
            <li> So thick and looks really REAL!</li>
            <li> I love this wig! it looks exactly like the picture its soft and adorable! I will admit its sheds a lot and it go a little frizzy at the bottom when I tried to brush it ,also there&#x27;s a lot more pink than there is blond. Just somethings to keep in mind before buying</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it thank you.&lt;br /&gt;fast delivery!</li>
            <li> its an ok wig, it came really knotty, so when i  tried brushin it out it shedded like crazy &amp; it still sheds everwhere, i straightened it aswell.</li>
            <li> Its a really cute wig but it barely hides your real hair and where the hair parts you can see the base :/</li>
            <li> my roomate hates it but my cheerleaders loved it was much fun to play and wear</li>
            <li> I just got this and I love it! The color is perfect and so is the length. Bangs are a little long, but that&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful. Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be sugh amazing quality. I am now obsessed with it. haha Will be ordering more by this seller.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome wig! It holds up incredibly well to abuse. And despite being so cheap everyone thinks it is my real hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I literally have nothing negative to sat about this wig! It is everything I wanted it to be! Perfect color, perfect length. It&#x27;s full and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Super cute! Bangs are really long.  I have to pull them back so that I can see but with a cute clip it works well!</li>
            <li> Colors were wonderful!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Relatively thin on top. Great if you wear a hat or head dress.</li>
            <li> does not look as good as photo</li>
            <li> When I looked at this, I figured \\&quot;hell yeah, this looks like when I had my hair done a few months ago.\\&quot; So I bought it so I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep bleaching and colouring my hair, albeit when I got the package, the blonde wasn&#x27;t as bright as it was shown in the picture. Other than that it was very soft, a good length, and fit my head perfectly. There honestly isn&#x27;t anything wrong with it other than the off colouring in the blonde. Otherwise I would&#x27;ve gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Is not exactly as pictured, does not have the bow and the bangs do not lay the way it does in the picture, but it was a fun wig to wear, nice and soft. I absolutely loved it for the look I was going for.  It was a little difficult to put on by myself, but with a friends help it was a nice secure all night!</li>
            <li> I love this wig. For the price the quality is great and it&#x27;s really fun!</li>
            <li> Super cute i was so worried that my wig wouldn&#x27;t come on time for halloween but on the 30 of October it was waiting for me at my door great timeing i love it !</li>
            <li> Love it! But it&#x27;s a little big in my head so I had to pin it with bobby pins</li>
            <li> I love this wig, very serious party hair here. I love that it arrived as described and the colors are true to the photo. Use a little dry shampoo or baby powder to take care of the shine and youre good to go. Very thick, great coverage; but it sheds and tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly for my Princess Peach cosplay.  It was a little bit big on my head, but it was never a problem while I was wearing it.  The bow does not come with it, FYI.  The hair is a bit thin, and you could see the top of the wig through the hair when it was on.  It wasn&#x27;t an issue for me since I had a crown on that covered it.  I received lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! Great cosplay wig!</li>
            <li> Okay so i bought this wig for my junko enoshima cosplay and when it arrived i was so exited..but..when i opened the box and took out the wig..it was in really bad condition..like, the hair was falling out, and it was nappy, i fixed it of course but im sorta disapointed..</li>
            <li> this is a great wig!! the feel and the style is the best!!! Purchased for Madonna Rebel Heart Tour!!! very very happy thank you!</li>
            <li> This wig is absolutely perfect and just what I wanted! It comes perfectly styled and looks and feels so natural and soft! It doesn&#x27;t tangle and the first day I wore it, people asked if I&#x27;d dyed my hair. They didn&#x27;t even know it was a wig! It fits great and doesn&#x27;t get too hot on my head. Everything I wanted. I haven&#x27;t tried putting it up in a ponytail or braiding or or styling it in any other way, but I doubt one would want to as the curls are a wonderful style as it is. Overall, everything I hoped for.</li>
            <li> The wig is very soft and the curls are easy to brush. The blonde is more yellow than the picture. Just style and you&#x27;re ready to go</li>
            <li> It does not look the photo at all</li>
            <li> I love this wig. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I did not buy this wig. Just wanted to note for anyone trying to put their Meghan Trainor Halloween costume together, this wig may not be for you. I live in the United States. Though the wig description says 4-5 days to ship, when you get down to the purchase process, it notes you will received the item in 17-28 days. Not a good timeline for last minute Halloween costumes. Just giving you a heads up.</li>
            <li> great wig, really pretty and just as pictured :)</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the color and texture of the hair. It was really soft and the color is true to the picture which surprised me because it was so inexpensive. The blonde color is pretty shiny, but I easily toned that down with some baby powder (thoroughly sprinkle all of the hair that is shiny with baby powder then comb it through with a paddle brush or wig brush). The wig is a bit small for those with larger heads. My disappointment with this wig is that is is pretty thin (you can see the tracks when the hair is moved and near the parted area of the bangs), and its sheds a lot. The wig has adjustable straps but absolutely no combs or clips so even with a stocking cap underneath it slips and does not stay securely on your head. I ended up just buying some wig/extension clips and sewing them in near the front (center front and sides near the ears) and in the back to help keep it in place. For the price its ok but this wig should at a minimum have a comb or two in the front for out of the package wear.  I think you can get a few uses out of this wig...just detangle with conditioning spray to keep it from getting excessively tangled at the bottom and in the back.</li>
            <li> Cheap wig, I could buy better at a costume shop.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter.  She loves it.  Very cute, full, and fun.  She wears it to school and some people even thought it was her real hair. Only issue is that the underlining shows a bit right where the part is.  You can see it if you are close. However, it could just be this one since each wig will be slightly different.</li>
            <li> Great wig for the price. I bought this for my 16 year old daughter because she is into cosplay.</li>
            <li> Good Quality! will buy from this seller again and would recommend this to anyone looking for great prices...</li>
            <li> Wife bought it. Very cute but the blonde part is much yellower than shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it got here. Obviously took a picture took it out it was beautiful I love the colors the blond is nice the pink is nice it looks pretty much exactly what they advertise the only thing is that is soon as I put on the Wig stand I noticed that there was a bald spot I mean I easily covered it up but my heart was like awe no. Then I put the wig on and I was trying to find a good way to part the bangs try to find the good feel for it unfortunately I cant yet and I can see the the wig under the hair where ever I part.</li>
            <li> SO much hair and fast shipping</li>
            <li> First of all... It&#x27;s so pretty!! I love the quality of this wig. It&#x27;s thick, and so soft! But the thickness is very hard to brush through sometimes. And the bangs are VERY long! But you could always cut them. I cute mine into straight across bangs. It&#x27;s super cuteüçÉüíû</li>
            <li> This wig is beautiful, but it came so damn ratty. I tried washing it, brushing it.... everything i could. I cannot fix it at all. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Good quality, can become frizzy but easy to brush out, bangs are really awkward but I gave them a trim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty- but doesn&#x27;t look like the photo- the bangs are a lot shorter, and it&#x27;s came less curly and more wavy.</li>
            <li> The colors match quite closely to the description pic. It gets tangly but lightly brushing it helps. Great for the price and it&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li> Would buy from seller again, very good quality product</li>
