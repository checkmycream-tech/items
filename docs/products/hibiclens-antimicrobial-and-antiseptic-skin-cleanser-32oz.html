            <li>I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li>AMAZING Stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I must say, it has made an amazing difference b/c I no longer have acne.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling, liquid soap that helps to keep germs at bay.</li>
            <li>My mom used this on her leg after her car accident she liked it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>For me this wasn&#x27;t an over night cure, it took a couple weeks of using it twice a day, but has cleared up my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>To be honest I don&#x27;t think it makes a difference b/c</li>
            <li>Excellent product &amp; highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Product came on time and was packaged nicely &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Does not sting, the smell is pleasant but not flowery, lathers up well, you can use it to clean the skin after an injury.  </li>
            <li>It was almost too easy!</li>
            <li>For the expert, no problem, but for a novice, a more detailed intro would be good.    </li>
            <li>It worked great, and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Hibiclens is a better antiseptic than alcohol, and painless, i.e. with hibiclens, no tears, no crying/screaming when I treat his skin wounds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this item.  </li>
            <li>With the 32oz bottle be sure to order the pump.</li>
            <li>and he was able to tolerate the Percocet that supposedly had triggered the rash.</li>
            <li>I sure wish there was an alternative.</li>
            <li>This is 32 oz, the one gallon is priced better.</li>
            <li>Be sure to rinse it all off, haven&#x27;t had any skin irritations from it</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>After going for check-ups twice a year since my gum surgery 20 years ago, my gums have been better than ever.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Works better then</li>
            <li>Needed this to aid in infection control, Was so glad to find it in a 32 ounce container.</li>
            <li>Getting it at a store costs allot more.  </li>
            <li>Hibiclens cleans my skin even more then just using soap.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels and looks, it has a glow to it</li>
            <li>Best price I have found especially for this size.</li>
            <li>Much better than another course of antibiotics over and over again.</li>
            <li>it was more like $9</li>
            <li>It does not get any better.  </li>
            <li>I use these as refills for my smaller &amp;#34;foaming pump&amp;#34; dispenser, and it works great!  </li>
            <li>It smells OK.</li>
            <li>sooner then expected in excellent condition with an even better low-price</li>
            <li>Initially the doctor tried to blame this rash on the Percocet my husband had been taking, but we weren&#x27;t even sure if Percocet had been started before or after the rash was noticed, and my husband had never before experienced a rash while taking Percocet.</li>
            <li>Delivery was just fine.</li>
            <li>My skincare regimen is more rigorous than most but it is consistent</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the seller immediately replaced the shipment for free.</li>
            <li>be comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Go with quantity to reduce the cost per ounce and use it freely.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product that I&#x27;d recommend to all.</li>
            <li>This is the best skin cleanser out there to get rid of any bacteria that you might have trouble with.  </li>
            <li>I was having trouble with my skin and this product is awesome!</li>
            <li>I have recurrent staph infections on my face and legs, primarily my face.</li>
            <li>I have acne and use this to keep my face free from breakouts in the humid summer months.  </li>
            <li>decided to give a detailed explanation on my regimen &amp; experience b/c once upon a time</li>
            <li>It works great on skin irritations and is great for handwashing even though with regular use it may dry out your skin somewhat.</li>
            <li>It works great.to keep areas prone to breakouts clean and odor free.</li>
            <li>My advice: DON&#x27;T use this product pre-surgically unless you&#x27;re okay with wanting to rip your skin off, not being able to sleep (because of the itching) and not being able to take pain meds (since your doctor will likely explain the rash away as an allergy to your pain</li>
            <li>Of course you should get this checked out by the pediatrician first, but I do believe the soap will help for many skin ailments.  </li>
            <li>My doctor recommended this product and after using it consistently I&#x27;ve noticed many of my skin problems have been eliminated.</li>
            <li>I use hibiclens in replacement for 70% alcohol to clean skin wounds.</li>
            <li>It was prescribed to me by a doctor when I had a staff infection to clean the wound.  </li>
            <li>I have continued to use this product to clean wound since.  </li>
            <li>I also used it to wash my tattoos and keep them clean too while healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use Hibiclens to keep an area I had surgery on clean.</li>
            <li>Two or three days it started to clean up my persistent skin condition.</li>
            <li>I have used ti also to clean toys and countertops.</li>
            <li>This guy struggled to do all the right things for me!</li>
            <li>Same exact great product.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn and is bright red and liquidy.</li>
            <li>Product as advertised and good value considering sold locally for $10.00 for 16oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent antimicrobial that is commonly used in hospitals and surgical settings.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a really good antibacterial, this is what I used after surgery on a deep wound.  </li>
            <li>It must be true.</li>
            <li>The price was great for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Super deal.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely be using more of the product now</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who has suffered one or more outbreaks of any Staph infection or MRSA Staph infection...</li>
            <li>When another friend&#x27;s daughter was diagnosed with staph on a boil from diaper rash (first time diaper rash!), the pediatrician never told her to use Hibiclens but to follow a bleach-bath and antibiotic regimen.</li>
            <li>Also works great on everyday cuts scrapes, seems to speed up the healing process.</li>
            <li>If you add up the costs for your deodorants, body washes, foot washes and powders, cost of laundering or replacing shoes then the price is well worth it to use this</li>
            <li>It really helps to keep you clean.  </li>
            <li>This product is easy on the skin, smells nice, is effective, and used sparingly and appropriately, prevents spread of MRSA and other important bacterial pathogens usually encountered in medical and home health settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than the minor details noted, Amazon&#x27;s excellent customer service is evident.</li>
            <li>It did the job of ridding the hands of germs and viruses and left my hands soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>There are other antimicrobial and antiseptic skin cleaners available, but they cost more and stain clothing.  </li>
            <li>but this can keep your private parts clean and oder free for days.</li>
            <li>Free shipping, no hassles to buy unlike at my Kerr Drug which only carries the 4 ounce size and said I would have to &#x27;special order&#x27; this size.</li>
            <li>I also used it when I got a new tattoo to make sure it was extra clean.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Have had three staph infections over first six months this year.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle arrived with a smashed plastic cap, wrapped with packing tape.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The first inactive ingredient is \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Manuka Honey is expensive but is the best healer of all.</li>
            <li>Many reviewer have said not to use it daily</li>
            <li>that I found it does not cost as much here!</li>
            <li>Be aware that it doesn&#x27;t foam up like soap</li>
            <li>Most surgeons will ask you to shower prior to surgery with this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It heals them so fast!</li>
            <li>I would have appreciated a little more info in detailed product specs.</li>
            <li>After falling off my mountain bike time after time, I had to learn to deal with all the injuries and Neosporin was the first product I used and learned quickly that Neosporin can not be applied to wounds at all since after the body produces scab which is the natural healing process of the body tenting and covering the wound,</li>
            <li>That said, I will certainly consider Amazon for products like hibiclens again.</li>
            <li>Used this soap and have been fine last three months.  </li>
            <li>I found it here for SO much cheaper than any store I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>I really need to use a product like this for an upcoming surgery but am very allergic to perfume and fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I think it is really making a difference.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t use it with white or light colored wash cloths.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it helps or not, but at least it smells good.</li>
            <li>I have started scrubbing with Hibiclens and the first site of a lesion and it has kept them from going any further, and healing quickly.</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean well</li>
            <li>Earlier this year I was looking for something that will keep me clean all day.</li>
            <li>I order and continue to order this product to deal with folliculitis, trying to keep my skin as clean as possible.</li>
            <li>A dermatologist told my friend to use Hibiclens 2x/day to clean an open wound that had MRSA.</li>
            <li>here on Amazon through this seller it was only $17.89 for a full 32oz.</li>
            <li>This is a better deal considering you tend to use a lot of it if you are scrubbing down your body/hair.</li>
            <li>If bacteria and germs are of particular concern for you, this is THE product to have.</li>
            <li>Hibiclens is expensive but alcohol by itself although inexpensive, does more damage since it burns the skin and does more scaring.</li>
            <li>Also, I recently added homeopathy to my skin regimen (specifically designed for acne), which actually helped my skin even more.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, non irritating.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend that parents with children dealing with reoccurring skin infections try this soap.</li>
            <li>highly recommend you to buy the pump when you buy this product.</li>
            <li>This soap works very well and is antibacterial and is not harsh to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I thoroughly clean my face and pat dry.</li>
            <li>but he says the benefits are worth occasional dryness.</li>
            <li>I continued with the soap a few more times, and it was gone.    </li>
            <li>A definite bargain that&#x27;s worth taking if you need quality antiseptic soap.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you wash long enough, and rise well after washing.  </li>
            <li>I have high hopes for it so far!</li>
            <li>Also the product is pretty thin, and coming from a big bottle (we have the 32 oz), a fair amount easily slips down the drain.</li>
            <li>I think the Hebiclens helps a ton in the healing process and prevention of new pimples.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I live in a humid climate and sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>It clears the skin and prevents new blemishes, but I use Mederma for the scars, which in combination, I can leave the house without make-up on now.</li>
            <li>In a time when flu and infections are running rampant, this soap will do the job of thoroughly cleansing the hands particularly after touching shopping carts, door handles and other surfaces in public places.</li>
            <li>Then do a quick rinse and PAT dry.</li>
            <li>We use everyday and I am glad to state the infection has completely gone away.</li>
            <li>The soap does not &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; like typical soapsd, and that takes a little time to get used to, other than that awesome product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>At first, I was very nervous about the possibility of the strong antimicrobial soap interfering with the delicate balance of her lady parts, so I pumped (YES, BUY THE PUMP, PEOPLE!)</li>
            <li>What you must do first is to wash with regular soap, then rinse .</li>
            <li>and i recently got my first staph infection on my lip</li>
            <li>Sometimes I won&#x27;t use the other moisturizer if it&#x27;s real hot.</li>
            <li>Doctor visits were too costly, this helped to clear up a break out on my scalp (first and hopefully the last).</li>
            <li>Although I did not use this product very long, it will come in handy for other injuries later on maybe.</li>
            <li>helped clear my abscess up.  </li>
            <li>There are resistant strains of bacteria that have developed from the over-use of antibiotics and antibacterial products.</li>
            <li>(I believe this \\&quot;puncturing\\&quot; action is why the product documentation recommends scrubbing for X amount of time.)    </li>
            <li>This was prescribed by my Doctor  and so far  I have found it to be doing its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked wonders so far.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li>Wash your bath towels frequently in hot water and dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low online and off, trying all those \\&quot;promise to healthier skin\\&quot; gimmicks.</li>
            <li>Buying it on line was much cheaper than buying a tiny bottle for over $9 at the local store.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s varied from a bump or two on her inner thigh or back of knee to many small bumps on her bottom.</li>
            <li>I complained and received a new bottle quickly.</li>
            <li>But maybe I&#x27;ll try that in the future, as it seems to clear up</li>
            <li>Paired it with Soft &#x27;N Style Lotion Dispenser Bottle 16oz to put it in the shower (face wash for teenage son with acne).  </li>
            <li>Ironically enough, my daughter (age 4) had been having reoccuring skin infections that antibiotics didn&#x27;t seem to completely cure.  </li>
            <li>Later on, it naturally expelled whatever was in there, and I used Neosporin and a band-aid on it.  </li>
            <li>I am a 52 year old male diabetic.</li>
            <li>This product keeps the level of staph low on the surface of the skin thus allowing current wounds to heal and lowering occurrence of new sores.</li>
            <li>We lightly rinse her after, dry, and put lotion on every few nights, since the bleach is drying.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to note as well, for other concerned parents, that putting the soap directly into the water seems to be gentle enough for her.</li>
            <li>Although, Hibiclens is a surgical scrub, my doctors have me use it once to twice a week to make sure that \\&quot;super bugs\\&quot; don&#x27;t enter my skin via a cut, dry, or dirty skin.</li>
            <li>After washing with regular soap, I use the Hibiclens daily under my underarms, female private areas, and inner upper thigh area (Every other day or three times a week would be fine).  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that there are some dangers - the product can do permanent eye or ear damage under some limited circumstances, but which I suspect most people would not encounter (leaving it in your eyes for long periods such as during surgery; instilling into the middle ear due to a perforated ear drum).  </li>
            <li>Hibiclens is a serious product, not to be taken lightly.    </li>
            <li>The active ingredient, Chlorhexidine gluconate, works by puncturing the membrane of the bacterias responsible for the odor.</li>
            <li>We use it in the shower, and have rectified this by putting some into a much smaller pump dispenser left over from some soft soap.    </li>
            <li>There are other possible side effects as well, none of which were encountered in my household, but which should absolutely be read.  </li>
            <li>I happened to stumble upon this product somehow in my search for an adult acne cure.</li>
            <li>I finally took her to an Infectious Disease Specialist, and apparently I&#x27;d been using the Hibiclens incorrectly.</li>
            <li>After reading lots of other reviews, I thought it would just be useful to have for other things as well.  </li>
            <li>So we googled post hernia surgery rashes, and apparently a lot patients undergoing abdominal surgery and various other surgical procedures have developed itchy rashes following application of Hibiclens.</li>

            <li> IT WORKS GREAT and is the best price I&#x27;ve found thus far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li> AMAZING Stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I must say, it has made an amazing difference b/c I no longer have acne.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling, liquid soap that helps to keep germs at bay.</li>
            <li> My mom used this on her leg after her car accident she liked it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> For me this wasn&#x27;t an over night cure, it took a couple weeks of using it twice a day, but has cleared up my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> To be honest I don&#x27;t think it makes a difference b/c</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and was packaged nicely &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Does not sting, the smell is pleasant but not flowery, lathers up well, you can use it to clean the skin after an injury.  </li>
            <li> It was almost too easy!</li>
            <li> For the expert, no problem, but for a novice, a more detailed intro would be good.    </li>
            <li> It worked great, and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Hibiclens is a better antiseptic than alcohol, and painless, i.e. with hibiclens, no tears, no crying/screaming when I treat his skin wounds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this item.  </li>
            <li> With the 32oz bottle be sure to order the pump.</li>
            <li> and he was able to tolerate the Percocet that supposedly had triggered the rash.</li>
            <li> I sure wish there was an alternative.</li>
            <li> This is 32 oz, the one gallon is priced better.</li>
            <li> Be sure to rinse it all off, haven&#x27;t had any skin irritations from it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> After going for check-ups twice a year since my gum surgery 20 years ago, my gums have been better than ever.  </li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Works better then</li>
            <li> Needed this to aid in infection control, Was so glad to find it in a 32 ounce container.</li>
            <li> Getting it at a store costs allot more.  </li>
            <li> Hibiclens cleans my skin even more then just using soap.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels and looks, it has a glow to it</li>
            <li> Best price I have found especially for this size.</li>
            <li> Much better than another course of antibiotics over and over again.</li>
            <li> it was more like $9</li>
            <li> It does not get any better.  </li>
            <li> I use these as refills for my smaller &amp;#34;foaming pump&amp;#34; dispenser, and it works great!  </li>
            <li> It smells OK.</li>
            <li> sooner then expected in excellent condition with an even better low-price</li>
            <li> Initially the doctor tried to blame this rash on the Percocet my husband had been taking, but we weren&#x27;t even sure if Percocet had been started before or after the rash was noticed, and my husband had never before experienced a rash while taking Percocet.</li>
            <li> Delivery was just fine.</li>
            <li> My skincare regimen is more rigorous than most but it is consistent</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the seller immediately replaced the shipment for free.</li>
            <li> be comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Go with quantity to reduce the cost per ounce and use it freely.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product that I&#x27;d recommend to all.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin cleanser out there to get rid of any bacteria that you might have trouble with.  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble with my skin and this product is awesome!</li>
            <li> I have recurrent staph infections on my face and legs, primarily my face.</li>
            <li> I have acne and use this to keep my face free from breakouts in the humid summer months.  </li>
            <li> decided to give a detailed explanation on my regimen &amp; experience b/c once upon a time</li>
            <li> It works great on skin irritations and is great for handwashing even though with regular use it may dry out your skin somewhat.</li>
            <li> It works great.to keep areas prone to breakouts clean and odor free.</li>
            <li> My advice: DON&#x27;T use this product pre-surgically unless you&#x27;re okay with wanting to rip your skin off, not being able to sleep (because of the itching) and not being able to take pain meds (since your doctor will likely explain the rash away as an allergy to your pain</li>
            <li> Of course you should get this checked out by the pediatrician first, but I do believe the soap will help for many skin ailments.  </li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this product and after using it consistently I&#x27;ve noticed many of my skin problems have been eliminated.</li>
            <li> I use hibiclens in replacement for 70% alcohol to clean skin wounds.</li>
            <li> It was prescribed to me by a doctor when I had a staff infection to clean the wound.  </li>
            <li> I have continued to use this product to clean wound since.  </li>
            <li> I also used it to wash my tattoos and keep them clean too while healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Hibiclens to keep an area I had surgery on clean.</li>
            <li> Two or three days it started to clean up my persistent skin condition.</li>
            <li> I have used ti also to clean toys and countertops.</li>
            <li> This guy struggled to do all the right things for me!</li>
            <li> Same exact great product.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn and is bright red and liquidy.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised and good value considering sold locally for $10.00 for 16oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent antimicrobial that is commonly used in hospitals and surgical settings.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a really good antibacterial, this is what I used after surgery on a deep wound.  </li>
            <li> It must be true.</li>
            <li> The price was great for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Super deal.  </li>
            <li> I will most definitely be using more of the product now</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who has suffered one or more outbreaks of any Staph infection or MRSA Staph infection...</li>
            <li> When another friend&#x27;s daughter was diagnosed with staph on a boil from diaper rash (first time diaper rash!), the pediatrician never told her to use Hibiclens but to follow a bleach-bath and antibiotic regimen.</li>
            <li> Also works great on everyday cuts scrapes, seems to speed up the healing process.</li>
            <li> If you add up the costs for your deodorants, body washes, foot washes and powders, cost of laundering or replacing shoes then the price is well worth it to use this</li>
            <li> It really helps to keep you clean.  </li>
            <li> This product is easy on the skin, smells nice, is effective, and used sparingly and appropriately, prevents spread of MRSA and other important bacterial pathogens usually encountered in medical and home health settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than the minor details noted, Amazon&#x27;s excellent customer service is evident.</li>
            <li> It did the job of ridding the hands of germs and viruses and left my hands soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> There are other antimicrobial and antiseptic skin cleaners available, but they cost more and stain clothing.  </li>
            <li> but this can keep your private parts clean and oder free for days.</li>
            <li> Free shipping, no hassles to buy unlike at my Kerr Drug which only carries the 4 ounce size and said I would have to &#x27;special order&#x27; this size.</li>
            <li> I also used it when I got a new tattoo to make sure it was extra clean.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Have had three staph infections over first six months this year.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle arrived with a smashed plastic cap, wrapped with packing tape.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The first inactive ingredient is \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Manuka Honey is expensive but is the best healer of all.</li>
            <li> Many reviewer have said not to use it daily</li>
            <li> that I found it does not cost as much here!</li>
            <li> Be aware that it doesn&#x27;t foam up like soap</li>
            <li> Most surgeons will ask you to shower prior to surgery with this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It heals them so fast!</li>
            <li> I would have appreciated a little more info in detailed product specs.</li>
            <li> After falling off my mountain bike time after time, I had to learn to deal with all the injuries and Neosporin was the first product I used and learned quickly that Neosporin can not be applied to wounds at all since after the body produces scab which is the natural healing process of the body tenting and covering the wound,</li>
            <li> That said, I will certainly consider Amazon for products like hibiclens again.</li>
            <li> Used this soap and have been fine last three months.  </li>
            <li> I found it here for SO much cheaper than any store I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> I really need to use a product like this for an upcoming surgery but am very allergic to perfume and fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I think it is really making a difference.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t use it with white or light colored wash cloths.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helps or not, but at least it smells good.</li>
            <li> I have started scrubbing with Hibiclens and the first site of a lesion and it has kept them from going any further, and healing quickly.</li>
            <li> Not only does it clean well</li>
            <li> Earlier this year I was looking for something that will keep me clean all day.</li>
            <li> I order and continue to order this product to deal with folliculitis, trying to keep my skin as clean as possible.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist told my friend to use Hibiclens 2x/day to clean an open wound that had MRSA.</li>
            <li> here on Amazon through this seller it was only $17.89 for a full 32oz.</li>
            <li> This is a better deal considering you tend to use a lot of it if you are scrubbing down your body/hair.</li>
            <li> If bacteria and germs are of particular concern for you, this is THE product to have.</li>
            <li> Hibiclens is expensive but alcohol by itself although inexpensive, does more damage since it burns the skin and does more scaring.</li>
            <li> Also, I recently added homeopathy to my skin regimen (specifically designed for acne), which actually helped my skin even more.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, non irritating.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that parents with children dealing with reoccurring skin infections try this soap.</li>
            <li> highly recommend you to buy the pump when you buy this product.</li>
            <li> This soap works very well and is antibacterial and is not harsh to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I thoroughly clean my face and pat dry.</li>
            <li> but he says the benefits are worth occasional dryness.</li>
            <li> I continued with the soap a few more times, and it was gone.    </li>
            <li> A definite bargain that&#x27;s worth taking if you need quality antiseptic soap.</li>
            <li> Just be sure you wash long enough, and rise well after washing.  </li>
            <li> I have high hopes for it so far!</li>
            <li> Also the product is pretty thin, and coming from a big bottle (we have the 32 oz), a fair amount easily slips down the drain.</li>
            <li> I think the Hebiclens helps a ton in the healing process and prevention of new pimples.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I live in a humid climate and sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> It clears the skin and prevents new blemishes, but I use Mederma for the scars, which in combination, I can leave the house without make-up on now.</li>
            <li> In a time when flu and infections are running rampant, this soap will do the job of thoroughly cleansing the hands particularly after touching shopping carts, door handles and other surfaces in public places.</li>
            <li> Then do a quick rinse and PAT dry.</li>
            <li> We use everyday and I am glad to state the infection has completely gone away.</li>
            <li> The soap does not &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; like typical soapsd, and that takes a little time to get used to, other than that awesome product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> At first, I was very nervous about the possibility of the strong antimicrobial soap interfering with the delicate balance of her lady parts, so I pumped (YES, BUY THE PUMP, PEOPLE!)</li>
            <li> What you must do first is to wash with regular soap, then rinse .</li>
            <li> and i recently got my first staph infection on my lip</li>
            <li> Sometimes I won&#x27;t use the other moisturizer if it&#x27;s real hot.</li>
            <li> Doctor visits were too costly, this helped to clear up a break out on my scalp (first and hopefully the last).</li>
            <li> Although I did not use this product very long, it will come in handy for other injuries later on maybe.</li>
            <li> helped clear my abscess up.  </li>
            <li> There are resistant strains of bacteria that have developed from the over-use of antibiotics and antibacterial products.</li>
            <li> (I believe this \\&quot;puncturing\\&quot; action is why the product documentation recommends scrubbing for X amount of time.)    </li>
            <li> This was prescribed by my Doctor  and so far  I have found it to be doing its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked wonders so far.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li> Wash your bath towels frequently in hot water and dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low online and off, trying all those \\&quot;promise to healthier skin\\&quot; gimmicks.</li>
            <li> Buying it on line was much cheaper than buying a tiny bottle for over $9 at the local store.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s varied from a bump or two on her inner thigh or back of knee to many small bumps on her bottom.</li>
            <li> I complained and received a new bottle quickly.</li>
            <li> But maybe I&#x27;ll try that in the future, as it seems to clear up</li>
            <li> Paired it with Soft &#x27;N Style Lotion Dispenser Bottle 16oz to put it in the shower (face wash for teenage son with acne).  </li>
            <li> Ironically enough, my daughter (age 4) had been having reoccuring skin infections that antibiotics didn&#x27;t seem to completely cure.  </li>
            <li> Later on, it naturally expelled whatever was in there, and I used Neosporin and a band-aid on it.  </li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old male diabetic.</li>
            <li> This product keeps the level of staph low on the surface of the skin thus allowing current wounds to heal and lowering occurrence of new sores.</li>
            <li> We lightly rinse her after, dry, and put lotion on every few nights, since the bleach is drying.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to note as well, for other concerned parents, that putting the soap directly into the water seems to be gentle enough for her.</li>
            <li> Although, Hibiclens is a surgical scrub, my doctors have me use it once to twice a week to make sure that \\&quot;super bugs\\&quot; don&#x27;t enter my skin via a cut, dry, or dirty skin.</li>
            <li> After washing with regular soap, I use the Hibiclens daily under my underarms, female private areas, and inner upper thigh area (Every other day or three times a week would be fine).  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that there are some dangers - the product can do permanent eye or ear damage under some limited circumstances, but which I suspect most people would not encounter (leaving it in your eyes for long periods such as during surgery; instilling into the middle ear due to a perforated ear drum).  </li>
            <li> Hibiclens is a serious product, not to be taken lightly.    </li>
            <li> The active ingredient, Chlorhexidine gluconate, works by puncturing the membrane of the bacterias responsible for the odor.</li>
            <li> We use it in the shower, and have rectified this by putting some into a much smaller pump dispenser left over from some soft soap.    </li>
            <li> There are other possible side effects as well, none of which were encountered in my household, but which should absolutely be read.  </li>
            <li> I happened to stumble upon this product somehow in my search for an adult acne cure.</li>
            <li> I finally took her to an Infectious Disease Specialist, and apparently I&#x27;d been using the Hibiclens incorrectly.</li>
            <li> After reading lots of other reviews, I thought it would just be useful to have for other things as well.  </li>
            <li> So we googled post hernia surgery rashes, and apparently a lot patients undergoing abdominal surgery and various other surgical procedures have developed itchy rashes following application of Hibiclens.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now since discovering it after originally getting a few body piercings.</li>
            <li> Even when I was in Iraq, and I would frequently get allergy like, perhaps even pour nutrition related pimples on my back, Hibiclens cleared it up in a few days.</li>
            <li> Been looking for something for a long time that would keep me from smelling even after a workout and day outside.</li>
            <li> It is very watery and bottle is heavy, this way you won&#x27;t loose product and can control amount dispensed.</li>
            <li> the soap onto a wet washcloth and gently wiped the affected areas a few times before she got into the bath.   </li>
            <li> I have been scrubbing my \\&quot;susceptible\\&quot; areas daily ever since (about two years)and have not had a single problem.  </li>
            <li> If you feel the pump dispenses too much at a time, twist a rubber band or hair tie at the pump \\&quot;straw\\&quot; where it meets the bottle outside, and it&#x27;ll dispense a little less.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use daily to prevent problems- only if you are getting a MRSA like the other reviewer said- when the tingly-painful sensation starts.</li>
            <li> The only, and minor, issue is that delivery was not trackable, probably due to third party supplier.    </li>
            <li> Two days after surgery, while investigating the cause of his persistent itchiness, he noticed a severe rash - hundreds of little itchy bumps, and these bumps seemed to be concentrated in the areas in which Hibiclens was applied, with only an occasional itchy bump elsewhere (for instance, on his back).</li>
            <li> I had noticed that even just a few hours after a shower I developed an odor in the genital area.  </li>
            <li> It should NOT be used as an everyday body wash unless indicated by your healthcare professional.</li>
            <li> Now, I use 6 or 7 pumps directly into the tub water a few times a week to keep the infection at bay.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I continued using them is b/c of all the money I spent on them.</li>
            <li> Only when she added the Hibiclens did she start to notice a decrease in the size of the boil (she outlined it in permanent marker, as my other friend&#x27;s doc had done for her MRSA infection).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to take time out and specify that I used ALL of these products prior to using Hibiclens &amp; w/ very minimal results.</li>
            <li> It will dry your face, though.</li>
            <li> Once he finished the prednisone his rash began to dry up</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had any issues with dry skin or yeast infections, etc.   </li>
            <li> It does dry your skin out a lot</li>
            <li> After that I pat dry and then liberally apply Hibiclens on my face and let it dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a year and no new outbreaks...</li>
            <li> This is my go-to product every single time I get a MRSA outbreak.</li>
            <li> I have read all the reviews so far, so hopefully after using this product for a few days my infections will go away and STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li> The 32 oz bottle is inexpensive but large, I would suggest to transfer part of the content to a smaller bottle (I recycle my 70% alcohol bottle) because a small bottle is easier to handle and one would waste less content if accidentally spilled.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I have to use this all the time, just occasionally, or wiping out the bacteria once will last forever.</li>
            <li> It is a thin liquid and the pump makes it much easier to handle and use.</li>
            <li> my purchases appear on my doorstep, a few days later!</li>
            <li> Finally, one nurse suggested I start using Hibiclens just on that one spot in the shower for a few days to see what happened.  </li>
            <li> you will need antibiotics like Bactrin along with careful washing and rinsing infected areas-</li>
            <li> I have very oily, hormonal acne-prone skin that has gotten worse since I moved to a desert climate.</li>
            <li> Now, the only way that I treat any wound regardless of the size is 1) washing it with water 2)allowing it to dry for couple of minutes 3)applying Hibiclens few times a day for few days depending to the size of the wound 4)applying Manuka honey 5) applying almond and castor oil.</li>
            <li> There are other sellers of this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews that said they&#x27;d used this soap on their children, so I figured I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li> No more odor, even the next morning.</li>
            <li> Both my local pharmacies in the area sold the small 4oz.</li>
            <li> When I received it, it had some other liquid in it.</li>
            <li> Great for warding off MRSA and other little nasty bugs.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I felt a little prickle, which indicated it was back, so I did the Hibiclens thing again, and it disappeared.      </li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe noone bothered to check and see if the bottles were sealed properly.</li>
            <li> I am free from bad breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that something as simple as Hibiclens can work miracles, at least in my case.</li>
            <li> Just as previously purchased at other stores for less money.</li>
            <li> I seems to be watered down.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product!</li>
            <li> He says that it sometimes dries his skin out slightly</li>
            <li> Almond and castor oil help with removing any black spots, scars and moisturise my skin.</li>
            <li> I typically use this after shaving to avoid ingrown hairs and the like</li>
            <li> NONE of these cleansers did even HALF the job that Hibiclens has done to my skin.</li>
            <li> the added results &amp; I started using less Hibiclens on my face...</li>
            <li> My son is very active and skin abrasion happens quite often (playground, biking, swimming pool...).</li>
            <li> After dried I use my Prosonic, applying less than a dime size of cleanser on the brush.</li>
            <li> This was causing little cuts and even some abrasions to almost always become infected.  </li>
            <li> I stopped getting waxes and the infections eventually subsided a little after using EVERY acne/anti-bacterial product ever made.</li>
            <li> I was buying a little bottle 4 oz</li>
            <li> I actually got tired of going to the store with him</li>
            <li> There are quite a few variants on quantity and packaging.</li>
            <li> These are all expensive natural products but do the trick since help the scab do its job.</li>
            <li> I intend to do this for a few months and then give it a break and see if the infection returns.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried this product for my acne because I don&#x27;t want to waste it if it doesn&#x27;t work; I got it for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now rubbing it in and then leaving it on for a few minutes before I rinse.</li>
            <li> Ive used it 2-3 times on my daughters rash and it has dried it out and helped eliminate it.</li>
            <li> and it is a thin red liquid</li>
            <li> CVS sells this in 8oz for about $11, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This stuff was recomended on a few web sites about chronic cysts and bacterial infections.</li>
            <li> It is a little thin and could be messy but it only takes a small amount to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Each time doctor prescirbed a new antibiotic, but upon finishing the course boils always returned and situation got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> As a former surgical nurse, I KNOW that Hibiclens is the skin cleanser to use for cuts, scrapes, etc., especially if Iodine is too harsh or painful.</li>
            <li> My allergist recommended this product to me as I have been having hypersensitivity to common staph leading to irritating red bumps and breakouts on my neck, arms, and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> No more antibiotics for my MRSA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with boils in the past.</li>
            <li> I use a small soap dispenser and fill it with Hebiclens and take a shower.  </li>
            <li> Just a small dab of this soap while showering gets rid of any underarm or foot-odor since it eliminates the bacteria that causes body odor to begin with.</li>
            <li> A small swipe of antiperspirant helps with the moisture and you can say good-by to the deodorant all together.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it would burn because I had the (false) impression that the pink color meant it would feel like iodine.</li>
            <li> and I have tried endless brands all with the goals of getting rid of bad BO especially after a grooling workout.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely expensive to me with our limited income.</li>
            <li> It also keeps boils from coming up if you use it at least once a week in the shower.</li>
            <li> Over the last few years I developed 3 nasty painful carbuncles on back of my neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Chlorofresh (internal deodorant) along with Hibiclens for almost a month and have been odorless in 103-degree weather whereas before I would smell horrible within minutes of taking a bath or shower with traditional soap.   </li>
            <li> This bottle is half as expensive as ones you&#x27;ll find in pharmacies and twice the volume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive when purchased at the store, but I use this 32-oz bottle to refill my little store-bought one.</li>
            <li> This did wonders for a really bad case of MRSA on my face, hairline, chest and back-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin, hence, you need to buy the pump so as not to waste product.</li>
            <li> I used to get Brazilian waxes done every 3 or 4 weeks, and I started to get really nasty, infected ingrown hairs which would turn into large, tender, cyst-like bumps that resemble acne!</li>
            <li> After my initial use, I was so disappointed that I didn&#x27;t even try to use it again.  </li>
            <li> My son had staph infection in the fall and it&#x27;s very hard to control and get rid of--</li>
            <li> BUT BE REALLY CAREFUL with this stuff and PLEASE consult a doctor if you have a bad infection-</li>
            <li> I started using this product and my sweating decreased, and no odors!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Hibiclens manufacturer was guilty of sending me the defective product.</li>
            <li> To this day, I buy it and it hasn&#x27;t failed yet.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything else, including the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> The unit pricing on this item of $0.31/oz is wrong.</li>
            <li> I was that person desperate to find SOMETHING that would just work for my ugly situation.</li>
            <li> now so resistant to antibiotics that they have become nearly impossible to get rid of.</li>
            <li> However, it was packaged badly and leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> Never been disappointed once and always keep it stocked.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> These people are terrible vendors.</li>
            <li> whatever nasty infection she had.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for chronic skin issues like folliculitis. And I&#x27;m told it works great for smelly armpits. Yum! It will dry your face, though.</li>
            <li> I had recurring MRSA infections for about one year. Each time doctor prescirbed a new antibiotic, but upon finishing the course boils always returned and situation got worse and worse. Thank God I found Hibiclens, it&#x27;s a life saver. No more antibiotics for my MRSA. I use it every 2 weeks or so and it has been three months of no skin infections.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with boils in the past. This was is literally the only thing that works on them.I&#x27;ve used EVERYTHING. I have very sensitive skin too. It also keeps boils from coming up if you use it at least once a week in the shower. The shipping on this was good. However, it was packaged badly and leaked everywhere. Fortunately, the seller immediately replaced the shipment for free. I would buy from him again just because of the quality customer service.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. If bacteria and germs are of particular concern for you, this is THE product to have. It works great on skin irritations and is great for handwashing even though with regular use it may dry out your skin somewhat. I recommend getting the [[ASIN:B000WN58ZM Hibiclens Hand Pump For 32 Oz]] to go with this bottle. It is a thin liquid and the pump makes it much easier to handle and use. I can&#x27;t find a comparable value for this product locally and nothing beats having it delivered to your door-- no muss, no fuss! Excellent product &amp; highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use hibiclens in replacement for 70% alcohol to clean skin wounds. My son is very active and skin abrasion happens quite often (playground, biking, swimming pool...). Hibiclens is a better antiseptic than alcohol, and painless, i.e. with hibiclens, no tears, no crying/screaming when I treat his skin wounds. The 32 oz bottle is inexpensive but large, I would suggest to transfer part of the content to a smaller bottle (I recycle my 70% alcohol bottle) because a small bottle is easier to handle and one would waste less content if accidentally spilled.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised and good value considering sold locally for $10.00 for 16oz bottle.  Have had three staph infections over first six months this year.  Used this soap and have been fine last three months.  Use product in shower every three days.</li>
            <li> My pediatrician recommended I buy this online when my toddler ended up with a staph infection on his skin.  After reading lots of other reviews, I thought it would just be useful to have for other things as well.  So I went with the larger bottle.  Arrived as promised and seems to do its job!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who has suffered one or more outbreaks of any Staph infection or MRSA Staph infection...IT WORKS GREAT and is the best price I&#x27;ve found thus far!</li>
            <li> The first bottle arrived with a smashed plastic cap, wrapped with packing tape. The contents had leaked out and soaked through the box. I complained and received a new bottle quickly. Hibiclens is great for skin fungus, yeasts and bacteriological infections. It&#x27;s the only thing that heals a rash I&#x27;ve had on my foot. Now, I understand both bottles came from the manufacturer, with the seller administrating the deal. I&#x27;m satisfied. The Hibiclens manufacturer was guilty of sending me the defective product. This guy is the middle-man and he is doing a good job. I have been instructed to leave my defective box outside my door for UPS pick-up, for the insurance. I didn&#x27;t even need to send back the inventory form (which accidentaly got thrown out), nor did I need to write any address on the box. It was almost too easy! I order from Amazon because I can shop from home and my purchases appear on my doorstep, a few days later! This guy struggled to do all the right things for me! I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li> I actually got this product for my friend.  We would always end up going to a store to buy some because he gets boils on his skin and finds that this helps him a lot.  I actually got tired of going to the store with him so I checked Amazon because they have everything.  I found it here for SO much cheaper than any store I have ever seen. Same exact great product.  He says that it sometimes dries his skin out slightly but he says the benefits are worth occasional dryness.</li>
            <li> I love this item.  It makes me feel so fresh and clean.  It was prescribed to me by a doctor when I had a staff infection to clean the wound.  I have continued to use this product to clean wound since.  I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product!</li>
            <li> This soap works very well and is antibacterial and is not harsh to the skin.  The price was great for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> I found that Hibiclens is a great soap for controlling smelly sweat odor.  After washing with regular soap, I use the Hibiclens daily under my underarms, female private areas, and inner upper thigh area (Every other day or three times a week would be fine).  If you are looking for odor control, I recommend Hibiclens along with an internal or external deodorant that works for you.  I&#x27;ve been using Chlorofresh (internal deodorant) along with Hibiclens for almost a month and have been odorless in 103-degree weather whereas before I would smell horrible within minutes of taking a bath or shower with traditional soap.   With the 32oz bottle be sure to order the pump.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from Folliculitis for over 10 years and with a daily regimen of Hebiclens and clindamycin I am free from bad breakouts.  I think the Hebiclens helps a ton in the healing process and prevention of new pimples.  I use a small soap dispenser and fill it with Hebiclens and take a shower.  Works great</li>
            <li> My husband just had surgery for an umbilical hernia repair. Prior to his surgery, he was instructed to apply Hibiclens in all areas surrounding where the incision was to be made (around his belly button, around his waist, and towards his groin). Two days after surgery, while investigating the cause of his persistent itchiness, he noticed a severe rash - hundreds of little itchy bumps, and these bumps seemed to be concentrated in the areas in which Hibiclens was applied, with only an occasional itchy bump elsewhere (for instance, on his back). Initially the doctor tried to blame this rash on the Percocet my husband had been taking, but we weren&#x27;t even sure if Percocet had been started before or after the rash was noticed, and my husband had never before experienced a rash while taking Percocet. My husband stopped the Percocet, and the rash continues - in fact it is worsening. So we googled post hernia surgery rashes, and apparently a lot patients undergoing abdominal surgery and various other surgical procedures have developed itchy rashes following application of Hibiclens. My advice: DON&#x27;T use this product pre-surgically unless you&#x27;re okay with wanting to rip your skin off, not being able to sleep (because of the itching) and not being able to take pain meds (since your doctor will likely explain the rash away as an allergy to your pain meds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband saw another doctor, and as suspected, the rash was indeed caused by the Hibiclens. My husband had to be put on prednisone for 5 days to get rid of it. Once he finished the prednisone his rash began to dry up and he was able to tolerate the Percocet that supposedly had triggered the rash. So Percocet was not the cause of his rash. It was the Hibiclens, so beware.</li>
            <li> This is what we need.  It really helps to keep you clean.  Everyone in my house uses this once a week.</li>
            <li> I had a recurring skin infection (staph), which would go away for a couple of weeks with antibiotics, but it would always return.  It eventually stopped responding to one antibiotic, then another, and then we all got scared.  Finally, one nurse suggested I start using Hibiclens just on that one spot in the shower for a few days to see what happened.  It went away almost immediately!  After a few days, I felt a little prickle, which indicated it was back, so I did the Hibiclens thing again, and it disappeared.      As it turns out, I will probably always carry staph, and at different points in my life, it will return.  With this product, though, I can keep it under control and (finally!) be comfortable.  I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it.</li>
            <li> Well, my wife&#x27;s allergist insisted they she buy this product to bathe with. It&#x27;s extremely expensive to me with our limited income. I sure wish there was an alternative.</li>
            <li> AMAZING Stuff.  The only stuff that worked for my almost disfiguring reoccurances with facial cystic Acne. What a lifesaver. Hope this review helps others!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I ordered. I don&#x27;t have the resources to review the product itself. This review is about it&#x27;s description in Amazon and the delivery process.    I would have appreciated a little more info in detailed product specs. There are quite a few variants on quantity and packaging. For the expert, no problem, but for a novice, a more detailed intro would be good.    Delivery was just fine. The only, and minor, issue is that delivery was not trackable, probably due to third party supplier.    That said, I will certainly consider Amazon for products like hibiclens again. Other than the minor details noted, Amazon&#x27;s excellent customer service is evident.</li>
            <li> I really need to use a product like this for an upcoming surgery but am very allergic to perfume and fragrance.  The first inactive ingredient is \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;.  So, it isn&#x27;t going to work for me.  What a shame.</li>
            <li> Product is great, helped my family get through staph. Hopefully gone for good. Also works great on everyday cuts scrapes, seems to speed up the healing process.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to help treat a colonization with staph.  This was causing little cuts and even some abrasions to almost always become infected.  This product has greatly cleared up the issues.  It not only kills the germs during washing, but its effectiveness as a prophylactic remains for several hours.    The only downside is that there are some dangers - the product can do permanent eye or ear damage under some limited circumstances, but which I suspect most people would not encounter (leaving it in your eyes for long periods such as during surgery; instilling into the middle ear due to a perforated ear drum).  There are other possible side effects as well, none of which were encountered in my household, but which should absolutely be read.  Care must be used when using it.  Hibiclens is a serious product, not to be taken lightly.    Also the product is pretty thin, and coming from a big bottle (we have the 32 oz), a fair amount easily slips down the drain. We use it in the shower, and have rectified this by putting some into a much smaller pump dispenser left over from some soft soap.    You can buy a pump for the bottle as well.</li>
            <li> My family doctor recommended Hibiclens for some constantly recurring infections.  I have been scrubbing my \\&quot;susceptible\\&quot; areas daily ever since (about two years)and have not had a single problem.  Hibiclens works well where the antibacterial soaps I had been using did NOT.  Go with quantity to reduce the cost per ounce and use it freely.</li>
            <li> I had noticed that even just a few hours after a shower I developed an odor in the genital area.  Use of regular antibacterial bar soap didn&#x27;t help.  I bought and used Hibiclens and it worked like a charm.  One use and no odor even 30 hours after showering.  Not sure if I have to use this all the time, just occasionally, or wiping out the bacteria once will last forever.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for fighting bacteria. My dermatoligist told me about it a month ago, I &#x27;ve been using it since. What you must do first is to wash with regular soap, then rinse . Once you done that now you use Hibiclens onthe affected area or all over. I called the company and they don&#x27;t suggest using it above the neck or below the waist. My only warnig is DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM CIRCLEA, THEY ARE RIPOFFS.They advertise a low ball price ,but over charge you for shipping, $8.75 . But their website list shipping at $3.99. These people are terrible vendors. There are other sellers of this product on Amazon.Avoid CIRCLEA</li>
            <li> This is an excellent antimicrobial that is commonly used in hospitals and surgical settings. It should NOT be used as an everyday body wash unless indicated by your healthcare professional. There are resistant strains of bacteria that have developed from the over-use of antibiotics and antibacterial products. Daily showers with a standard (Dove-type) body wash and exfoliating loofah should be sufficient for proper hygiene for 99% of people. Wash your bath towels frequently in hot water and dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This is 32 oz, the one gallon is priced better. After falling off my mountain bike time after time, I had to learn to deal with all the injuries and Neosporin was the first product I used and learned quickly that Neosporin can not be applied to wounds at all since after the body produces scab which is the natural healing process of the body tenting and covering the wound, applying Neosporin softened the scab, removed the scab, delayed the healing process of the wound which caused some scaring on my body. That was the last tube of Neosporin I ever used. Now, the only way that I treat any wound regardless of the size is 1) washing it with water 2)allowing it to dry for couple of minutes 3)applying Hibiclens few times a day for few days depending to the size of the wound 4)applying Manuka honey 5) applying almond and castor oil. Hibiclens is expensive but alcohol by itself although inexpensive, does more damage since it burns the skin and does more scaring. Manuka Honey is expensive but is the best healer of all. These are all expensive natural products but do the trick since help the scab do its job. Almond and castor oil help with removing any black spots, scars and moisturise my skin.</li>
            <li> Super deal.  Paired it with Soft &#x27;N Style Lotion Dispenser Bottle 16oz to put it in the shower (face wash for teenage son with acne).  Add face scrubber pad and the zits are kept at bay.</li>
            <li> Product leaked all over inside of box. This is very disappointing. I find it hard to believe noone bothered to check and see if the bottles were sealed properly.</li>
            <li> I have had recurring staph infections on my skin for years- now so resistant to antibiotics that they have become nearly impossible to get rid of. This did wonders for a really bad case of MRSA on my face, hairline, chest and back- BUT BE REALLY CAREFUL with this stuff and PLEASE consult a doctor if you have a bad infection- you will need antibiotics like Bactrin along with careful washing and rinsing infected areas- If you over-use you will lose your skin where the infection used to be! Don&#x27;t use daily to prevent problems- only if you are getting a MRSA like the other reviewer said- when the tingly-painful sensation starts.</li>
            <li> I found out that this product may work against heat rashes or heat related bumps and breakouts, so I tried it and it worked like a miracle. Even when I was in Iraq, and I would frequently get allergy like, perhaps even pour nutrition related pimples on my back, Hibiclens cleared it up in a few days. To this day, I buy it and it hasn&#x27;t failed yet.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with infections forming from acne on my thighs. My Doctor recommended Hibiclens for treatment after a course of antibiotics. It seems to have done the trick. I have been months now without a recurrence.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Great price at Amazon, as this is pricey. Great for warding off MRSA and other little nasty bugs. Wash your underarms with this and you will never need deodorant. No bacteria, no odor.  As a side effect, it dries the skin some, again great for underarm sweating.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I happened to stumble upon this product somehow in my search for an adult acne cure. Ironically enough, my daughter (age 4) had been having reoccuring skin infections that antibiotics didn&#x27;t seem to completely cure.  I read some of the other reviews that said they&#x27;d used this soap on their children, so I figured I&#x27;d try it.  At first, I was very nervous about the possibility of the strong antimicrobial soap interfering with the delicate balance of her lady parts, so I pumped (YES, BUY THE PUMP, PEOPLE!) the soap onto a wet washcloth and gently wiped the affected areas a few times before she got into the bath.   The results were visible overnight! She had a bump that looked sort of like a pimple on her leg that was purplish around it, and the next day, the \\&quot;head\\&quot; came up on it. Later on, it naturally expelled whatever was in there, and I used Neosporin and a band-aid on it.  I continued with the soap a few more times, and it was gone.    Now, I use 6 or 7 pumps directly into the tub water a few times a week to keep the infection at bay. I intend to do this for a few months and then give it a break and see if the infection returns.  I&#x27;d like to note as well, for other concerned parents, that putting the soap directly into the water seems to be gentle enough for her. We haven&#x27;t had any issues with dry skin or yeast infections, etc.   I would highly recommend that parents with children dealing with reoccurring skin infections try this soap. My daughter&#x27;s varied from a bump or two on her inner thigh or back of knee to many small bumps on her bottom. Of course you should get this checked out by the pediatrician first, but I do believe the soap will help for many skin ailments.  The ONLY downside to this product that comes to mind is the consistency.  It&#x27;s very thin, hence, you need to buy the pump so as not to waste product. If you feel the pump dispenses too much at a time, twist a rubber band or hair tie at the pump \\&quot;straw\\&quot; where it meets the bottle outside, and it&#x27;ll dispense a little less.  Side note - I have not tried this product for my acne because I don&#x27;t want to waste it if it doesn&#x27;t work; I got it for my daughter. But maybe I&#x27;ll try that in the future, as it seems to clear up whatever nasty infection she had.  UPDATE 10/7: My daughter&#x27;s staph infection keeps coming back. I finally took her to an Infectious Disease Specialist, and apparently I&#x27;d been using the Hibiclens incorrectly. He told me you have to put it on the person from neck to toe and let it sit for five minutes.  Then do a quick rinse and PAT dry. The soap will leave a layer of antimicrobial ingredients on the skin that will continue to treat it after you&#x27;ve left the shower.  That seems to be a bit of a hassle to do to a five-year-old, so we&#x27;re opting for adding 1/4 c of bleach (Yes, household bleach) to her bath every night for 3 solid months. We lightly rinse her after, dry, and put lotion on every few nights, since the bleach is drying.   On another note, I have been using this on my acne, and it does seem to help a bit. I&#x27;m now rubbing it in and then leaving it on for a few minutes before I rinse.</li>
            <li> Been looking for something for a long time that would keep me from smelling even after a workout and day outside. No amount of soap could prevent an odor buildup later in the day. The active ingredient, Chlorhexidine gluconate, works by puncturing the membrane of the bacterias responsible for the odor. (I believe this \\&quot;puncturing\\&quot; action is why the product documentation recommends scrubbing for X amount of time.)    Buy this and one of those Dial foaming soap dispensers, and use in the shower daily after soap. I let it sit for about a minute after scrubbing, this may not be necessary. No more odor, even the next morning. Be sure to rinse it all off, haven&#x27;t had any skin irritations from it but some might.    Says not for use in groin area, haven&#x27;t had any problems; believe that warning is just for women.</li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old male diabetic. Over the last few years I developed 3 nasty painful carbuncles on back of my neck. Someone recommended this product and  I scrub neck with it daily. It&#x27;s been over a year and no new outbreaks... Absolutely love this product. If you are susceptible to carbuncles this product is a must</li>
            <li> I have been using Hibiclens for almost 20 years with a water pic diluted in water because of gum disease. After going for check-ups twice a year since my gum surgery 20 years ago, my gums have been better than ever.  My dentist is very proud of me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hibiclens for over 20 years. I use it to wash under my arms and I never need deorderant. Now I can buy it through Amazon and save money.</li>
            <li> This was prescribed by my Doctor  and so far  I have found it to be doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;This was received in good shape and on time</li>
            <li> Product worked great for my use.  I thought it would smell, but none of that happened.  Overall a great product that I&#x27;d recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my dogs paws (pododermatitis), it has not cured but the condition has not worsened.  the vet could only offer antibiotics &amp; cortisone again, and again.</li>
            <li> There are other antimicrobial and antiseptic skin cleaners available, but they cost more and stain clothing.  This product has not permanently stained any cloth that I have used to apply it.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  Not only does it clean well, it smells great and lasts.  I typically use this after shaving to avoid ingrown hairs and the like but I do not use all over.  Many reviewer have said not to use it daily and I do on my armpits and have had no issue.  It does dry your skin out a lot so I understand not using it as an all over body wash.</li>
            <li> Hidrendenitis Supporativa is a skin affliction of the groin, breasts, and armpits. This product keeps the level of staph low on the surface of the skin thus allowing current wounds to heal and lowering occurrence of new sores. I also use StaphAseptic after I shower or bathe to treat sores as they appear. The two products together have made this disease bearable.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now since discovering it after originally getting a few body piercings. I also used it to wash my tattoos and keep them clean too while healing.&lt;br /&gt;  It was then that I discovered how well this product works at helping to control under-arm body odor. Just a small dab of this soap while showering gets rid of any underarm or foot-odor since it eliminates the bacteria that causes body odor to begin with. Works better then any body wash I have tried on the market and I have tried endless brands all with the goals of getting rid of bad BO especially after a grooling workout. A small swipe of antiperspirant helps with the moisture and you can say good-by to the deodorant all together.&lt;br /&gt;  I received this item sooner then expected in excellent condition with an even better low-price then I could have imagined. Both my local pharmacies in the area sold the small 4oz. bottles for $7.99 ($8.48 w/tax) and here on Amazon through this seller it was only $17.89 for a full 32oz. bottle - that&#x27;&#x27;s a savings of almost $50.00! If you add up the costs for your deodorants, body washes, foot washes and powders, cost of laundering or replacing shoes then the price is well worth it to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;  I will most definitely be using more of the product now that I found it does not cost as much here!</li>
            <li> This product has been a life saver, I love it!!! Earlier this year I was looking for something that will keep me clean all day. I live in a humid climate and sweat a lot. I started using this product and my sweating decreased, and no odors!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you to buy the pump when you buy this product. Great product!</li>
            <li> When my dermatologist insisted that I use HIBICLENSE and he wrote a prescription for it, I had no idea what was ahead!  A 2oz bottle at the pharmacy cost me $65.00, that was with my insurance paying a percentage.  When I saw this on AMAZON I jumped on it.  Great deal and I will get more soon!!  Thank-you</li>
            <li> This stuff is medically amazing! And you dont need a prescription for it! I have made it a part of my daily regine.</li>
            <li> Needed this to aid in infection control, Was so glad to find it in a 32 ounce container. We use everyday and I am glad to state the infection has completely gone away. Best thing on the market...Was directed to use this item by dermatologist. Makes the skin glow!</li>
            <li> My husband gets staph infections on his thighs and groin several times a year and i recently got my first staph infection on my lip and my daughter got Impetigo as well. Our doctor suggested we all bathe with the Hibiclens once a week to ward off the bug and prevent future infections. Ive used it 2-3 times on my daughters rash and it has dried it out and helped eliminate it. My husband used it on one of his boils and it eliminated it within a couple of days. Great product!</li>
            <li> Getting it at a store costs allot more.  Get this larger bottle and pore it into the smaller size to refile.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice smelling, liquid soap that helps to keep germs at bay. Used in bathroom and kitchen alike for healthier families.</li>
            <li> As a former surgical nurse, I KNOW that Hibiclens is the skin cleanser to use for cuts, scrapes, etc., especially if Iodine is too harsh or painful. Great product and price.</li>
            <li> Smells good works great helped clear my abscess up.  My mom used this on her leg after her car accident she liked it.  Product came on time and was packaged nicely &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is the best skin cleanser out there to get rid of any bacteria that you might have trouble with.  I am a physician and we use this stuff in the hospital, and I use it at home.  It does have a drying effect so I recommend moisturizers after using it.</li>
            <li> I order and continue to order this product to deal with folliculitis, trying to keep my skin as clean as possible. I think it is really making a difference.</li>
            <li> This is the go to product for this purpose. I suggest the big bottle and buy the pump. It is very watery and bottle is heavy, this way you won&#x27;t loose product and can control amount dispensed.</li>
            <li> I work in the medical field and this is what we use to cleanse the skin before procedures. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> vet recommended I use this with a sponge instead of dog shampoo for his baths because of a skin bacterial problem.&lt;br /&gt;works wonderfully - sudses and spreads better than dog shampoo does, using sponge brilliant idea. dog&#x27;s skin eruptions and sores have almost disappeared after 3 baths.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product at my local Walgreens after my Esthetician told me to try it out. I used to get Brazilian waxes done every 3 or 4 weeks, and I started to get really nasty, infected ingrown hairs which would turn into large, tender, cyst-like bumps that resemble acne! I stopped getting waxes and the infections eventually subsided a little after using EVERY acne/anti-bacterial product ever made. I just got waxed again yesterday, and she told me to try this product because it works wonders. I have read all the reviews so far, so hopefully after using this product for a few days my infections will go away and STAY AWAY! I will come back and review this product again after about a week or so! I have high hopes for it so far!</li>
            <li> This product is easy on the skin, smells nice, is effective, and used sparingly and appropriately, prevents spread of MRSA and other important bacterial pathogens usually encountered in medical and home health settings.&lt;br /&gt;It should be used in the advice of a physician to prevent overuse and resistance, and hypersensitivity.</li>
            <li> Just as previously purchased at other stores for less money. Although, Hibiclens is a surgical scrub, my doctors have me use it once to twice a week to make sure that \\&quot;super bugs\\&quot; don&#x27;t enter my skin via a cut, dry, or dirty skin.</li>
            <li> product came in the promised time and was in good shape.  No problems what so ever, and this product is great.</li>
            <li> My allergist recommended this product to me as I have been having hypersensitivity to common staph leading to irritating red bumps and breakouts on my neck, arms, and shoulders.  I have tried numerous over the counter products to no avail.  Hibiclens WORKS.  I have been using it for only about a week, once a day in the shower.  My breakouts and irritations have vanished.  Be aware that it doesn&#x27;t foam up like soap and it is a thin red liquid so don&#x27;t use it with white or light colored wash cloths.  I recommend the bottle pump that is sold separately on Amazon for about $3.  Without it, you&#x27;d have to pour the product into your hands.  If you are having sensitivity to microbes or are even prone to breakouts, give Hibiclens a shot.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with my skin and this product is awesome! When washing leave on your skin for two minutes or longer before rinsing. Great results!.</li>
            <li> Although I did not use this product very long, it will come in handy for other injuries later on maybe.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about this product.  After my initial use, I was so disappointed that I didn&#x27;t even try to use it again.  It doesn&#x27;t even lather.  I don&#x27;t think it does what it is suppose to do (disinfect).  I seems to be watered down.  I had some out on my bathroom sink and a guest even asked if I had put water in the cleanser.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this years ago.  I don&#x27;t have the problems that I used to have since I started using it  No perfumes and no dyes.</li>
            <li> I use Hibiclens to keep an area I had surgery on clean. It&#x27;s worked wonders so far. This bottle is half as expensive as ones you&#x27;ll find in pharmacies and twice the volume. A definite bargain that&#x27;s worth taking if you need quality antiseptic soap.</li>
            <li> When I received it, it had some other liquid in it. Do not waste your time. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Hibiclens cleans my skin even more then just using soap. I love the way my skin feels and looks, it has a glow to it and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I would recommend this to anyone controlling germs, infections, etc.  My son had staph infection in the fall and it&#x27;s very hard to control and get rid of--but we did WITHOUT medication!</li>
            <li> I had some scalp sores, derma said to try this. I don&#x27;t know if it helps or not, but at least it smells good.</li>
            <li> The next time I order this I will be ordering the gallon size bottle. It has worked wonders of keeping the problems to a minimum</li>
            <li> Finally a product  that kills my acne.  This product has a cumulative effect so it keeps working after you wash with it for several days.  This is also the product that surgeons and hospitals use as a skin scrub for pre-op preps and during ICU stays to prevent infections in the bath water for patients.  Does not sting, the smell is pleasant but not flowery, lathers up well, you can use it to clean the skin after an injury.  Best price I have found especially for this size.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for pre op showers. Most surgeons will ask you to shower prior to surgery with this product. DO IT,</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a really good antibacterial, this is what I used after surgery on a deep wound.  It worked great, and the price was very reasonable.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had recurring bouts of MRSA infections on my skin. I have started scrubbing with Hibiclens and the first site of a lesion and it has kept them from going any further, and healing quickly. Much better than another course of antibiotics over and over again.</li>
            <li> We took our daughter to the doc 6times,antibiotics,creams &amp;dermatologist. Rash would not go away. I used this on her twice a day,lightly scrubbed and rinsed off. The 9 month rash was gone in a week!</li>
            <li> For me this wasn&#x27;t an over night cure, it took a couple weeks of using it twice a day, but has cleared up my skin nicely. I have tried everything else, including the expensive stuff. This is the only thing that has worked. It clears the skin and prevents new blemishes, but I use Mederma for the scars, which in combination, I can leave the house without make-up on now.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It covers well and rinses off.  It is a little thin and could be messy but it only takes a small amount to get the job done. I use it on my underarms and it has eliminated all odor (you need to soak your shirts in vinegar water before washing to remove te odor causing problem)</li>
            <li> Cleared my scalp up in about a week.  I have recurrent staph infections on my face and legs, primarily my face. Doctor visits were too costly, this helped to clear up a break out on my scalp (first and hopefully the last). CVS sells this in 8oz for about $11, don&#x27;t waste your money. This is a better deal considering you tend to use a lot of it if you are scrubbing down your body/hair.</li>
            <li> I was buying a little bottle 4 oz I think at Walmart and it was $6 at CVS or Walgreens it was more like $9</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I sweat a lot so I use it as an underarm deodorant. It keeps the smell at bay.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this product and after using it consistently I&#x27;ve noticed many of my skin problems have been eliminated. Pleasant smell, non irritating. Would reccomend.</li>
            <li> I have a skin disorder called Hidradenitis Suppurativa so it is neccesary for me to use a very good skin cleanser. This was reccomended to me by 2 plastic surgeons and a dermatologist. It works great.to keep areas prone to breakouts clean and odor free. Follow the directions on the bottle.</li>
            <li> The unit pricing on this item of $0.31/oz is wrong. The actual unit price is over $0.35/oz. BUYER beware. Vendor is math impaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT rely on vendor unit prices when comparing pricing!</li>
            <li> Free shipping, no hassles to buy unlike at my Kerr Drug which only carries the 4 ounce size and said I would have to &#x27;special order&#x27; this size.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist told my friend to use Hibiclens 2x/day to clean an open wound that had MRSA. Then after I had surgery, I got some for myself to help heal my surgical wounds. I thought it would burn because I had the (false) impression that the pink color meant it would feel like iodine. It was actually soothing. When another friend&#x27;s daughter was diagnosed with staph on a boil from diaper rash (first time diaper rash!), the pediatrician never told her to use Hibiclens but to follow a bleach-bath and antibiotic regimen. I told her to use Hibiclens, which she did in addition to the doc&#x27;s regimen. Only when she added the Hibiclens did she start to notice a decrease in the size of the boil (she outlined it in permanent marker, as my other friend&#x27;s doc had done for her MRSA infection). The package label says even after rinsing off the solution, some antimicrobial and antibiotic residual effects remain. It must be true. (Add some polysporin afterward, and I think the area is perfectly protected, although I&#x27;m not an MD. It&#x27;s expensive when purchased at the store, but I use this 32-oz bottle to refill my little store-bought one. The stuff is terrific!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help combat the acne on my back as body washes made for back acne were not working for me. This works great!</li>
            <li> If you work in areas where antiseptic washing is required, this is the proverbial &amp;#34;cat&#x27;s meow&amp;#34;.  It does not get any better.  I use these as refills for my smaller &amp;#34;foaming pump&amp;#34; dispenser, and it works great!  Just be sure you wash long enough, and rise well after washing.  You don&#x27;t want this stuff as residue on your hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff was recomended on a few web sites about chronic cysts and bacterial infections. It does seem to work well for me. Two or three days it started to clean up my persistent skin condition. It smells OK. I mix it with Benzyl Peroxide and that works good too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and it works like a dream! Never been disappointed once and always keep it stocked.</li>
            <li> :I am very pleased with my purchase of HIBICLENS. I have been using this for over a year and I feel it provides just enough suds to feel it is cleaning well. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome. I have acne and use this to keep my face free from breakouts in the humid summer months.  I also used it when I got a new tattoo to make sure it was extra clean.</li>
            <li> this product is required by my surgeon. Buying it on line was much cheaper than buying a tiny bottle for over $9 at the local store.  It dries out your skin, but I guess that is what a stong antiobiotic does.</li>
            <li> This soap repels germs for hours afterwards, a necessary perk for elemmenatry school teachers! The soap does not &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; like typical soapsd, and that takes a little time to get used to, other than that awesome product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t but this can keep your private parts clean and oder free for days. I found this out in the Hospital. I will use it from now on.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to product every single time I get a MRSA outbreak. It heals them so fast! I no longer need antibiotics for each outbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also much cheaper on Amazon. It doesn&#x27;t burn and is bright red and liquidy. It doesn&#x27;t suds up like soap does at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found its so great at knocking out bacteria thatif I wash my underarms with this, I have no sweat or smell for days afterwards.</li>
            <li> Years ago when I worked in a hospital I used this cleanser. It did the job of ridding the hands of germs and viruses and left my hands soft and smelling good. In a time when flu and infections are running rampant, this soap will do the job of thoroughly cleansing the hands particularly after touching shopping carts, door handles and other surfaces in public places. I have used ti also to clean toys and countertops. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hibiclens as a facial cleanser for about 3 months now and I must say, it has made an amazing difference b/c I no longer have acne. I have very oily, hormonal acne-prone skin that has gotten worse since I moved to a desert climate. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING you can think of for it: Murad, Philosophy, Neutrogena, Clinique, Oil of Olay, Boscia, Peter Thomas Roth, and on and on AND ON! NONE of these cleansers did even HALF the job that Hibiclens has done to my skin. My skincare regimen is more rigorous than most but it is consistent and I have found it to be VERY effective in my battle w/ acne. If I have makeup on, I wash it off w/ a cleanser (Neem face wash). After that I pat dry and then liberally apply Hibiclens on my face and let it dry. After dried I use my Prosonic, applying less than a dime size of cleanser on the brush. I thoroughly clean my face and pat dry. I was using Reviva&#x27;s Glycolic acid toner but I ran out so I substitute it w/ Hyaluronic Acid (consistency of water almost). To be honest I don&#x27;t think it makes a difference b/c I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin. After that I apply a light-weight moisturizer (ALA Vitamin C Ester &amp; DMAE Cream) and a fade cream (Nadinola) for my scarring. Every night during my shower, I apply a pumpkin honey glycolic mask after cleansing my skin (same regimen as above). For added protection during the daytime I also use Fenix SPF 30+. Sometimes I won&#x27;t use the other moisturizer if it&#x27;s real hot. Also, I recently added homeopathy to my skin regimen (specifically designed for acne), which actually helped my skin even more. I only took it for 2 weeks as that&#x27;s what the directions call for. Very impressed w/ the added results &amp; I started using less Hibiclens on my face... again, no changes except good ones. I&#x27;d like to take time out and specify that I used ALL of these products prior to using Hibiclens &amp; w/ very minimal results. The only reason why I continued using them is b/c of all the money I spent on them. Might as well incorporate them instead of letting them go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give a detailed explanation on my regimen &amp; experience b/c once upon a time I was that person desperate to find SOMETHING that would just work for my ugly situation. I searched high and low online and off, trying all those \\&quot;promise to healthier skin\\&quot; gimmicks. I cannot believe that something as simple as Hibiclens can work miracles, at least in my case. Hopefully by sharing this I&#x27;ve helped someone else w/ their struggle as well.</li>
