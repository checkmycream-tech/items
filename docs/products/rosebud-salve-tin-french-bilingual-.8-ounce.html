            <li>It&#x27;s easy to toss a tin in your purse, desk, by the chair in the den, so that no matter where you are, you have relief at hand!  </li>
            <li>The product is fine, nothing spectacular, but the tin is obtuse.  </li>
            <li>If anything I&#x27;d say this one is a bit thicker and definitely more available at a better price, too!</li>

            <li>I like this a lot, and I can&#x27;t imagine that it would be offensive or  bother many people.  </li>
            <li>I will keep buying more.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite lip balm of all time..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever find anything to top it.  </li>
            <li>I received this on time and love the product.</li>
            <li>I love rosebud salve</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more moisturizing than most lip moisturizer in a tube.</li>
            <li>I use it to soften cuticles or on my lips mostly.</li>
            <li>Why not put a screw top on it?  </li>
            <li>Love this salve.  </li>
            <li>I love it, the color is so lovely</li>
            <li>I love using rosebud salve.  </li>
            <li>love it  better than burt&#x27;s bees that one</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>and I get more kisses from my fiance than normal lol.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a very special treat for her.</li>
            <li>It is so secure, too secure!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been fun to put on elbows and knees - quite effective protection from dryness in winter!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This original tin is my favorite.</li>
            <li>So easy to carry around.  </li>
            <li>good, but do not put too high expectation.</li>
            <li>Soaks in and the smell is soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;ve tried it on my hands and haven&#x27;t felt like it was that great.  </li>
            <li>In addition to it making my lips feel smooth and hydrated without feeling greasy-</li>
            <li>Old brand, always good</li>
            <li>I bought this for a unique use.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my cuticles and dry skin on my knuckles with great success!</li>
            <li>If you get any dry patches in the winter it&#x27;s great for that as well.</li>
            <li>I love this for my lips &amp; cuticles, really helps keep them from chapping or splitting</li>
            <li>Works very well, even better than vasoline like products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, it&#x27;s sturdy, it&#x27;s secure but it is such a pain to pop off.</li>
            <li>I first learned about Rosebud Salve in the 70&#x27;s from an ex boyfriend!</li>
            <li>This stuff has been a gateway drug for me to dabble in other rose scented things- like rose water (which I also highly recommend.)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The salve has a very subtle, pleasant rose scent.  </li>
            <li>If you get it closed, good luck opening it.  </li>
            <li>I cannot possibly fathom what would make this product so popular when the tin is impenetrable.</li>
            <li>He worked outside so he liked carrying it around in his pocket to have on hand.</li>
            <li>But if I use this consistently (meaning, a few times per day), my lips stay nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My lips get very, very chapped in the winter.  </li>
            <li>So this isn&#x27;t my first time buying this.</li>
            <li>Bought it off all the glowing reviews on here, but in actual use, it was just OK.  </li>
            <li>love the packaging, reminiscent of Victorian times.</li>
            <li>Abrasions, hot spots, etc.  </li>
            <li>Seems to naturally heal and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use this for my chapped lips, dry eyelids, fly aways, cuticles, and dry elbows.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly in the winter, but it&#x27;s still lasted me a long time!  </li>
            <li>I also love to use it on my hands and cuticles during the winter when they&#x27;re dry.  </li>
            <li>This salve really works for me.</li>
            <li>The only product I&#x27;ll use to keep my lips smooth.</li>
            <li>Oops,I should really have looked at the I ingredient list.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and it really hydrates my lips</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>The texture is definitely a lil bit different than the lip therapy with rose and almond oil vaseline.</li>
            <li>It has a very, very slight rose scent and it slicks onto your lips, immediately offering relief from dryness and cracking.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine as long as she doesn&#x27;t eat too much.</li>
            <li>That is much better than I can say for Chapstick or other lip</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely effective at fighting dry lips, smells like roses, isn&#x27;t greasy, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips!</li>
            <li>I like the French Bilingual just because (smile).</li>
            <li>This is a nice product and it gives your lips a subtle shine.</li>
            <li>I also love their other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of the same product (strawberry and mint)!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tin&#x27;s directions also say that you can use the salve on your hands and cuticles, and I&#x27;ve read that you can use it to smooth down fly-aways in your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have really dry skin, I live in a hot climate, and I use lip gloss and etc all the time.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to open.</li>
            <li>However, it is kind of hard getting the tin open.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an old fashioned salve.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps lips moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>so I just don&#x27;t close it completely.</li>
            <li>I really like using this, especially on my lips.</li>
            <li>and I struggle for 10-15 minutes to reopen it if I close it completely.</li>
            <li>An added bonus is that it does not melt or become spoiled by the constant high temperatures of the environment where I live.  ,</li>
            <li>Lightly rose scented and the thick formula keeps my lips moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li>Natural enough that I don&#x27;t even mind if he licks it.</li>
            <li>the oil is good, but the box is TOO difficult to open, 2 friends help me to open it</li>
            <li>The product has an artificial smell I don&#x27;t really like that much, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, so it ends up being economical too.</li>
            <li>She uses it frequently because she has very dry lips, so it&#x27;s not the fault of the product.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, by which it means that it takes a little bit of time to really work.  </li>

            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really last long on the lips.</li>
            <li> , the tin lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t wait to see how long this lasts, will be buying again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s highly rated on all the beauty blogs and a but hard to find.</li>
            <li> Applied to lips during the day to keep moist, eyebrow area for shaping at night, and on dry spots on body.  </li>
            <li> and the pink color when put on your skin does not turn your skin pink, it only absorbs and heals!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite subtle, and you only smell it for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rubbing these ingredients into my skin is not really what I want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now because it has become the only lip balm I want to use!</li>
            <li> This product had me at &amp;#34;hello.&amp;#34; It is the only thing I use now - no more twist stick balms that can melt in your purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However there are lots of other uses for this product as you can see if you read the reviews</li>
            <li> I use it all the time for my lips and it doesn&#x27;t leave an extremely glossy feeling on my lips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to see if there are other packaging options as I like the product, just not the tin.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used it in a few years but since my lips have been very dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to open and close.  </li>
            <li> The tin is hard to open</li>
            <li> Hopefully, with time it&#x27;ll wear down a lil or if anyone has any suggestions, that&#x27;d be swell.</li>
            <li> This gives some relief immediately without that waxy stiff feeling with other products.</li>
            <li> My little dog LOVES the taste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little too chemical</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and then a few times during the day.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get a firm grasp on it too.</li>
            <li> She will do anything for just a small taste.</li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> I have temporarily stored it in a small bowl with a lid, but I have a feeling it will be headed to the trash.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a very thick tin</li>

            <li> Goodbto use. Has a beautiful color</li>
            <li> Just purchased for the fourth time. This salve really works for me. This product had me at &amp;#34;hello.&amp;#34; It is the only thing I use now - no more twist stick balms that can melt in your purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know how your lips feel when sun or wind burned? This gives some relief immediately without that waxy stiff feeling with other products.</li>
            <li> My lips get very, very chapped in the winter.  I have tried out all kinds of products, and this is my favorite.  I put it on at night and then a few times during the day.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, by which it means that it takes a little bit of time to really work.  But if I use this consistently (meaning, a few times per day), my lips stay nice and smooth.  That is much better than I can say for Chapstick or other lip balms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salve has a very subtle, pleasant rose scent.  I like this a lot, and I can&#x27;t imagine that it would be offensive or  bother many people.  It&#x27;s really quite subtle, and you only smell it for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the tin lasts for a long time.  I&#x27;ve had one tin for about 3 years.  I use it mostly in the winter, but it&#x27;s still lasted me a long time!  I&#x27;m only now buying my second tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin&#x27;s directions also say that you can use the salve on your hands and cuticles, and I&#x27;ve read that you can use it to smooth down fly-aways in your hair.  Personally, I&#x27;ve tried it on my hands and haven&#x27;t felt like it was that great.  But for my lips, it&#x27;s wonderful!  I will keep buying more.</li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ll use to keep my lips smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  I always have it in my purse.  It is a must have beauty product.</li>
            <li> best thing for eczema in your hands! luv this product</li>
            <li> works better than most lip balms/ chapsticks i&#x27;ve used to rehydrate my lips.</li>
            <li> Obsessed.  This is my favorite lip balm of all time.. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever find anything to top it.  In addition to it making my lips feel smooth and hydrated without feeling greasy- I also love to use it on my hands and cuticles during the winter when they&#x27;re dry.  The smell is so heavenly.. This stuff has been a gateway drug for me to dabble in other rose scented things- like rose water (which I also highly recommend.)  I&#x27;ll probably be using this stuff until I&#x27;m 90</li>
            <li> this stuff; appearence is not the one I bought,may be fake</li>
            <li> Have been using for years and it is the best.</li>
            <li> Hey Amazon..just got my 1st. dose of Rosebud Salve &amp; I must say my lips are not feeling gooey or tacky. I&#x27;m a believer..goodbye Chap &amp; Helloooo  Rose.&lt;br /&gt;Hugs.&lt;br /&gt;🌹 Lalinda 🌹</li>
            <li> I bought this for a unique use. My little dog LOVES the taste. I bought this for a very special treat for her. She will do anything for just a small taste. Not sure why, but my vet says it&#x27;s not toxic and it&#x27;s fine as long as she doesn&#x27;t eat too much.</li>
            <li> The salve is great.  The tins are a PITA.  If you get it closed, good luck opening it.  They should come with a can opener....</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm!!! This original tin is my favorite. Lightly rose scented and the thick formula keeps my lips moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan!  It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product for me - will keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to open.</li>
            <li> Oops,I should really have looked at the I ingredient list. Petrolatum, cotton seed oil--not organic cotton seed oil and we know the chemicals used on cotton. Rubbing these ingredients into my skin is not really what I want. My error :-(</li>
            <li> I received this on time and love the product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lip glossy stuff. It is very nice...helps prevent clapping.</li>
            <li> I use this for my chapped lips, dry eyelids, fly aways, cuticles, and dry elbows. This stuff is the best, and its not sticky like lipgloss type products. Soaks in and the smell is soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li> keeps them hydrated for about 2 hours then you need to reapply smells/tastes great and I get more kisses from my fiance than normal lol.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even open it without a screwdriver. The tin was bent when I received it. I love rosebud salve but I&#x27;m disappointed in how it was damaged and shipped.</li>
            <li> the oil is good, but the box is TOO difficult to open, 2 friends help me to open it</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s more moisturizing than most lip moisturizer in a tube.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. So this isn&#x27;t my first time buying this. She uses it frequently because she has very dry lips, so it&#x27;s not the fault of the product. And best of all, this lip salve doesn&#x27;t cause irritation for her, so it&#x27;s all good when she doesn&#x27;t look like some huge lip celebrity.</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff all the time!!! It&#x27;s good for so many things. I use it to soften cuticles or on my lips mostly. If you get any dry patches in the winter it&#x27;s great for that as well. Have been faithfully using this product for over 10yrs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now because it has become the only lip balm I want to use! It&#x27;s extremely effective at fighting dry lips, smells like roses, isn&#x27;t greasy, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips! I also use it on my cuticles and dry skin on my knuckles with great success! I throw this in with gifts to friends, cause who doesn&#x27;t love a good lip balm?! I highly recommend this product! I also love their other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of the same product (strawberry and mint)!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and it gives your lips a subtle shine. Good over lipstick or alone. I only wish the container was a bit easier to open.</li>
            <li> Bought it off all the glowing reviews on here, but in actual use, it was just OK.  I actually prefer the Blistex lip balm w/ menthol...This balm seems to wear off a bit easier.</li>
            <li> I love this for my lips &amp; cuticles, really helps keep them from chapping or splitting</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by this product because I thought I could use it for lips. It tastes nasty.&lt;br /&gt;It is an old fashioned salve.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like Petroleum Jelly with rose color and smell.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little too chemical smelling.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a salve, and you like the smell of roses, it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been fun to put on elbows and knees - quite effective protection from dryness in winter!&lt;br /&gt;I love the packaging, reminiscent of Victorian times.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how to open this tin like a sane person.  I had to severely dent the tin in order to get enough of a grip to open it, which means that the lid no longer functions.  I have temporarily stored it in a small bowl with a lid, but I have a feeling it will be headed to the trash.  I cannot possibly fathom what would make this product so popular when the tin is impenetrable.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, nothing spectacular, but the tin is obtuse.  Why not put a screw top on it?  It&#x27;s hard to open and close.  The product has an artificial smell I don&#x27;t really like that much, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Love this salve.  Applied to lips during the day to keep moist, eyebrow area for shaping at night, and on dry spots on body.  So easy to carry around.  Does melt and shifts around in tin, if left in the heat.</li>
            <li> The best product for almost any skin irritation or dryness. works on lips and eczema and dry-cracked noses from these horrible winter colds. highly recommended. and the pink color when put on your skin does not turn your skin pink, it only absorbs and heals! a .05oz tube for my lips has lasted over a year, used daily! i can&#x27;t wait to see how long this lasts, will be buying again</li>
            <li> I love it, the color is so lovely and it really hydrates my lips, I also like to use it for the bags underneath my eyes haha. The texture is definitely a lil bit different than the lip therapy with rose and almond oil vaseline. If anything I&#x27;d say this one is a bit thicker and definitely more available at a better price, too! The only issue I have with this product is the TIN, its a love/hate relationship. It&#x27;s nice, it&#x27;s sturdy, it&#x27;s secure but it is such a pain to pop off. I don&#x27;t know maybe I need to go workout my finger muscles at the gym or somethin but I have to do a lot of twisting and &amp;#34;clawing&amp;#34; to open it. It is so secure, too secure! Hopefully, with time it&#x27;ll wear down a lil or if anyone has any suggestions, that&#x27;d be swell.</li>
            <li> I like it but it doesn&#x27;t really last long on the lips. However there are lots of other uses for this product as you can see if you read the reviews and I don&#x27;t regret purchasing it. It has a wonderful fragrance and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love using rosebud salve.  I use it all the time for my lips and it doesn&#x27;t leave an extremely glossy feeling on my lips.  It is a great buy!!</li>
            <li> love it  better than burt&#x27;s bees that one</li>
            <li> You know that silly item that makes your daughter squeal when she pulls it out of her stocking? That was this lip balm.  It&#x27;s highly rated on all the beauty blogs and a but hard to find. My teenager was thrilled!!</li>
            <li> Keeps lips moist and soft.  Reapplication is necessary.</li>
            <li> good, but do not put too high expectation.</li>
            <li> Love this. Use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Works very well, even better than vasoline like products. The tin is hard to open so I just don&#x27;t close it completely. I took off one star because I don&#x27;t like the smell, though it&#x27;s not that bad. It definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like roses.</li>
            <li> I use this for my dog.  Abrasions, hot spots, etc.  Seems to naturally heal and smooth. Natural enough that I don&#x27;t even mind if he licks it.</li>
            <li> Old brand, always good</li>
            <li> I really like using this, especially on my lips. It smell wonderful and moisturizes well. The price is a pro too. However, it is kind of hard getting the tin open. For some reason it just gets caught in the track or something and I struggle for 10-15 minutes to reopen it if I close it completely. It isn&#x27;t a very thick tin so it&#x27;s hard to get a firm grasp on it too. I&#x27;m going to see if there are other packaging options as I like the product, just not the tin.</li>
            <li> I first learned about Rosebud Salve in the 70&#x27;s from an ex boyfriend! He worked outside so he liked carrying it around in his pocket to have on hand. I hadn&#x27;t used it in a few years but since my lips have been very dry, I thought I&#x27;d give it a retry. I now remember why I liked it! It has a very, very slight rose scent and it slicks onto your lips, immediately offering relief from dryness and cracking. It&#x27;s easy to toss a tin in your purse, desk, by the chair in the den, so that no matter where you are, you have relief at hand!  I like the French Bilingual just because (smile).</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, I live in a hot climate, and I use lip gloss and etc all the time. This rose petal lip balm is just wonderful. A little bit goes a long way, so it ends up being economical too. An added bonus is that it does not melt or become spoiled by the constant high temperatures of the environment where I live.  ,</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product!!</li>
