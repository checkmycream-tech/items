            <li>I love this make up set, i seen reviews on this from a beautiful stylist named tiara monet on you tube, all she uses is top-notch products and this was in her top ten lost, ladies</li>
            <li>The compact came in good shape and the product worked just fine.</li>

            <li>I love these concealers, they work great and very pigmented</li>
            <li>but overall, it&#x27;sa great product to have in your kit!</li>
            <li>I love love love this product</li>
            <li>I love this conceler palette.</li>
            <li>Im able to mix and match to get the color that works for me.</li>
            <li>Somehow i&#x27;m not at all satisfied with this palette</li>
            <li>It covers every flaw and I love the didfferent color shades to camoflauge any immprefections</li>
            <li>i use it for highlighting and color correcting darkness around my top lip&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i just love the concealer,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever tried, but it&#x27;s pretty decent for the price.</li>
            <li>this pallet is very versatile if u are fair skinned</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s good quality!</li>
            <li>the pink/peach shade is perfect for correcting dark under eye circles under concealer.</li>
            <li>the pink corrector is amazing!!</li>
            <li>just recieved it today and im going to use it before i go out with the hubby, thanks BHcosmetics!! :-)</li>
            <li>I would not suggest this as a concealer on your face for blemishes its coverage is medium to light.</li>
            <li>they apply smooth and are not greasy.</li>
            <li>nice concealer palette, wow!!!</li>
            <li>the fair colors are great for a hilight and pink tones as blush or lip color and for all with dark under eye circles the pink tones and samon color is great to conceal that over all this is a great product I would recommend</li>
            <li>Its very soft to the touch and works great and blends really well with my foundation when contouring.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got this product.</li>
            <li>but I think it is best for those with dry to normal skin</li>
            <li>but when applied it dryes to a powder kind of feel but definitely not drying it&#x27;s a great consistency that stays on long easy to buff in with a brush or apply with beauty sponge I like to apply with my fingers and just dab and pat it where I want it then set it with a powder I find it sets it</li>
            <li>really well done many skin tones</li>
            <li>Its a great concealor and use under my eyes to hide away the dark circles before applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>I will ordering again soon thanks!!</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be all that, but it is!</li>
            <li>Make-up is fun</li>
            <li>I was excited about the highlight colors, but they are entirely too light for my complexion.</li>
            <li>mix the colors to get an exact match also...</li>
            <li>My first BH cosmetics purchaase.</li>
            <li>While the product is good and I use it everyday to contour this</li>
            <li>I was suppose to buy the professional palette but was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from the Caribbean (caramel skin tone) and this works great to even out dark circles and red patches.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much problems with creasing</li>
            <li>the concealer feels rougher than the real concealer</li>
            <li>i really needed the orange tone it showed in the pic.</li>
            <li>Very drying and shows every winkle and flaw on my face.</li>
            <li>Then you can follow up with the tans to blend concealer and get that photo ready look.  </li>
            <li>very creamy...</li>
            <li>and it contours very well</li>
            <li>The peach color is my most used to hide that dark mustache area</li>
            <li>I really have fallen in live with this pallet.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly for contour, highlight, and color correcting.</li>
            <li>, it has 4 things I was looking for, creamy,  soft, light weight, and different colors to contour and this palettes has it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>What I really like about this product so far</li>
            <li>YOU ARE NOT ACTUALLY PURCHASING THE REAL BH CONCEALER PALETTE!</li>
            <li>Great product heavy duty thick creamy consistency</li>
            <li>this is very drying under my eyes, so I only use it as a highlighter and contour palate.</li>
            <li>Colors are so divine and natural.</li>
            <li>Excellent base for contouring and highlighting as well.  </li>
            <li>love the palette, but it starts to dry out a little bit..</li>
            <li>I honestly think I brought the wrong palette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got okay coverage, but I have a little trouble blending it on my skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who wants to hide any  unwanted dark spot</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who wants to hide any  unwanted dark spot</li>
            <li> last all day long.</li>
            <li> It last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> as a professional hair and make up consultant this little number was added to my lox of make up and sorts</li>
            <li> is a fake bh set because I have this same exact set that I ordered from bh&#x27;s actual website and it has different print on the case and</li>
            <li> this product alone is very long wear</li>
            <li> There is even a pink/salmon color which is key to camoflaging dark circles!</li>
            <li> my only con would be that this product can be a little too waxy</li>
            <li> like I did and the pink tones for cream blush and lip color and for the ladies of darker skin color</li>
            <li> I also use the pink shade as a blush and it works on all skin types.</li>
            <li> felt its a total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different concealers that have had me looking all kinds of cakey.</li>
            <li> The reds are for dark circles or discoloration, the lighter colors for highlighting and the darking for conealing.</li>
            <li> This product is hard and difficult if not impossible to apply.  </li>
            <li> I am a black woman</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not happy about my purchase, I wish I could send it back.</li>
            <li> with a setting powder i hardly have to retouch my makeup throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Feels like thick hard clay&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it at least 3-5 times a week.  </li>
            <li> Not good stuff.</li>
            <li> so it is sometimes difficult to find a pallete</li>
            <li> its becomes cakey and doesnt blend well wit the skin and doesnt camouflage :(</li>
            <li> the coverage is awful, and for the price, I do not ever recommend to anyone.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its a great concealor and use under my eyes to hide away the dark circles before applying my makeup. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to hide any  unwanted dark spot</li>
            <li> Not the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever tried, but it&#x27;s pretty decent for the price. It&#x27;s got okay coverage, but I have a little trouble blending it on my skin. I don&#x27;t have much problems with creasing IF I set it with a translucent powder, which you should be doing anyway. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> as a professional hair and make up consultant this little number was added to my lox of make up and sorts and i honestly could say, id buy t his again, in a heart beat, good value for the money. lots of colors to choose from and plenty of it.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for your make up kit! Great coverage and colors for EVERY skin color. There is even a pink/salmon color which is key to camoflaging dark circles! Easy to blend 2 or mor colors for perfect matching.</li>
            <li> this is very drying under my eyes, so I only use it as a highlighter and contour palate. Its just ok.</li>
            <li> While the product is good and I use it everyday to contour this is a fake bh set because I have this same exact set that I ordered from bh&#x27;s actual website and it has different print on the case and the concealer feels rougher than the real concealer palette.&lt;br /&gt;JUST BEWARE YOU ARE NOT ACTUALLY PURCHASING THE REAL BH CONCEALER PALETTE!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got this product. I had used it several times since I brought the product. I like the product but I am not in love with it. I honestly think I brought the wrong palette. I was suppose to buy the professional palette but was so excited to use it. Overall it&#x27;s good quality!</li>
            <li> Great product heavy duty thick creamy consistency but when applied it dryes to a powder kind of feel but definitely not drying it&#x27;s a great consistency that stays on long easy to buff in with a brush or apply with beauty sponge I like to apply with my fingers and just dab and pat it where I want it then set it with a powder I find it sets it longer tho this product alone is very long wear but I do find that this products makes me a bit oily through out the day which is why I stopped using it a lot I used to use it all the time I finished my skin tone in the pallet this pallet is very versatile if u are fair skinned u can use the darker colors for cream contour like I did and the pink tones for cream blush and lip color and for the ladies of darker skin color the fair colors are great for a hilight and pink tones as blush or lip color and for all with dark under eye circles the pink tones and samon color is great to conceal that over all this is a great product I would recommend but I think it is best for those with dry to normal skin I have combination oily and as I said through out the day it makes me oily but overal it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
            <li> I am a black woman so it is sometimes difficult to find a pallete were i can use every color. The reds are for dark circles or discoloration, the lighter colors for highlighting and the darking for conealing. Actually cheaper here than on the actual BH site.</li>
            <li> I love this pallete even though my purchase was made at BH Cosmetics site. Its good for brow highlighting and undereye highlighting. I would not suggest this as a concealer on your face for blemishes its coverage is medium to light. Its still  GOOD product..</li>
            <li> Colors are so divine and natural. Very good quality!</li>
            <li> this is an all over great product. I use this mainly for contour, highlight, and color correcting. when used with a cream foundation this stuff can make your skin look like silky butter. the pink/peach shade is perfect for correcting dark under eye circles under concealer. I also use the pink shade as a blush and it works on all skin types. as an under eye concealer i cover beautifully without looking cakey or settling into the creases. with a setting powder i hardly have to retouch my makeup throughout the day. my only con would be that this product can be a little too waxy but i know how to manipulate it to my liking. but for the price this is a great product, a lot of bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This product is great as a concealer palette or for contouring, which is what I use it for. The product came within 2 days of purchase. I love it and will be buying another when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> As an up an coming artist this palette has just the hues i need to get started. I love it</li>
            <li> I will ordering again soon thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love these concealers, they work great and very pigmented i would def. buy again and i get great use out of the product!</li>
            <li> love the palette, but it starts to dry out a little bit.. but overall, it&#x27;sa great product to have in your kit!</li>
            <li> I love this product , it look great on my skin and i received alot of compliments from friends and even stranger</li>
            <li> the color is nothing like the pic. this make up is not for African American skin tone.  i really needed the orange tone it showed in the pic. the color is not orange toned be ware.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not happy about my purchase, I wish I could send it back. I was excited about the highlight colors, but they are entirely too light for my complexion. I will not purchase this product this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago....I love love love this product and I am almost out. I will be ordering again....the different concealers makes all the difference.  Great Product..there is nothing to dislike....Make-up is fun</li>
            <li> I love this conceler palette. Im able to mix and match to get the color that works for me. came as described and packaged neatly. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Very drying and shows every winkle and flaw on my face. Not good stuff. Feels like thick hard clay&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this.</li>
            <li> Works great. The compact came in good shape and the product worked just fine. The colors work well on my brown african American skin.</li>
            <li> Somehow i&#x27;m not at all satisfied with this palette felt its a total waste of my money. its becomes cakey and doesnt blend well wit the skin and doesnt camouflage :(</li>
            <li> I have some acne scars &amp; some redness around my nose, &amp; this concealer palette GETS THE JOB DONE! At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be all that, but it is! I love it &amp; with concealing all my flaws, my face looks flawless.</li>
            <li> This is great to have at home or travel with.  It has the peachy reds to highlight under your eye.  Then you can follow up with the tans to blend concealer and get that photo ready look.  It last for a very long time.  I have had mine for almost a year.  I use it at least 3-5 times a week.  It has a nice darker color for contouring. No smell...very creamy...last all day long.</li>
            <li> this product will last me a while.  It covers every flaw and I love the didfferent color shades to camoflauge any immprefections</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from the Caribbean (caramel skin tone) and this works great to even out dark circles and red patches.  Excellent base for contouring and highlighting as well.  You can custom mix the colors to get an exact match also...they apply smooth and are not greasy. This is an excellent product....I recommend.</li>
            <li> nice concealer palette, wow!!! really well done many skin tones can work with this, you can also mix the colors to suit you...</li>
            <li> I really have fallen in live with this pallet. i use it for highlighting and color correcting darkness around my top lip&lt;br /&gt;Which is tricky to cover for women of color. the pink corrector is amazing!!</li>
            <li> This product is hard and difficult if not impossible to apply.  the coverage is awful, and for the price, I do not ever recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> My first BH cosmetics purchaase.This palette is good for beginers like myself .Great for contoring.I highly recommend this product.Great for the money</li>
            <li> Great for professionals</li>
            <li> I love this make up set, i seen reviews on this from a beautiful stylist named tiara monet on you tube, all she uses is top-notch products and this was in her top ten lost, ladies this is the truth, fash shipment and packaging was perfect, its good for any skin type and i just love the concealer,&lt;br /&gt;I just recieved it today and im going to use it before i go out with the hubby, thanks BHcosmetics!! :-)</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a creamy concealer and this palettes has it. Its very soft to the touch and works great and blends really well with my foundation when contouring.  What I really like about this product so far, it feels Like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup and it contours very well, it has 4 things I was looking for, creamy,  soft, light weight, and different colors to contour and this palettes has it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different concealers that have had me looking all kinds of cakey. I avoided all of that with this palette. The peach color is my most used to hide that dark mustache area and I love it!!</li>
