            <li>My fianc&amp;eacute; loved this</li>
            <li>This fragrance seems like a not as good copy of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>And good perfumes could have 80 ingredients, this one has like two accords.</li>
            <li>A good somewhat-blind investment.</li>

            <li>A easy choice for any occasion.</li>
            <li>its waaaaay too strong</li>
            <li>I love True Religion scents.  </li>
            <li>Very thankful to Amazon that I was able to find it here at such a great price!  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Women&#x27;s True Region scents.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, nicely packaged and the smell is exactly what I want.  </li>
            <li>i bought this for ~$28 after it went down from ~$40.. GREAT deal!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem watered down and was great to get this product at a non department store price!</li>
            <li>Always comes quick!</li>
            <li>, this is the second time that I buy this item and the good thing is its very genuine.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume and the price was really affordable!!</li>
            <li>light and doesn&#x27;t fade throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and the scent is just fabulous</li>
            <li>It was really cheap, and you can still buy it for $ 9 or $6 at ebay.</li>
            <li>Its light and wears well.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PERFUME AND LOVE THE AMAZING SAVINGS ON THE BIGGEST BOTTLE IVE EVER HAD AND PAID CLOSE TO SAME PRICE FOR THE SMALLEST BOTTLE</li>
            <li>so I assume it is as genuine as it should be.</li>
            <li>Was excited to find it on Amazon at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Very large size bottle, and cute dangling charms.</li>
            <li>The package was shipped very fast, and the packaging itself made sure that nothing would break my bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li>It Is the original.  </li>
            <li>Cheap smelling, good for a teen</li>
            <li>This was my birthday present to myself, thanks a ton for the wonderful &amp; fast service!</li>
            <li>very floral like scent  sweet and potent</li>
            <li>Good price, larger bottle.</li>
            <li>Smells of sweet raspberries</li>
            <li>My teen daughter loves this and it has been a good way to introduce her to wearing perfume and how to ware it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally the smell reminds me of standing in a field of sweet peas just after it has rained.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true to its name....</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and clean...</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly too.</li>
            <li>I  bought the lotion and two more of this scent to stock up since it is a decent price</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Maybe for this discount c.$40 will be OK for some people, but even for this price it is too high in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Complimented daily smells very refreshing</li>
            <li>My new favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li>This is a fresh, clean, crisp apple scent that makes me think of apple shampoo.</li>
            <li>This purchase was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Fresh but girly</li>
            <li>It is has a fresh smell for daytime.  </li>
            <li>It has a very clean and natural sent and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>My daughter has always loved this fragrance and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for $60.00 less than I paid for it in our local department store.</li>
            <li>For example[[ASIN:B004BPHCQ0 Penhaligon&#x27;s Artemisia Eau De Parfum Spray - 50ml/1.7oz]] is  a very nice fruity floral, with really excellent ingredients, and only a little bit more expensive than Hippie Chic original asking price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about fragrances and Euphoria is currently my favorite fall, winter choice and D&amp;G Light Blue for spring and summer.</li>
            <li>A very large bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>Love this mild scent - its very similar to Ralph by Ralph Lauren.  </li>
            <li>excellent fast shipping ,much bigger than I expected</li>
            <li>Not well done of a fragrance, probably really quick creation in order to put it fast on the market.</li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts only a few minutes at best.  </li>
            <li>Ralph by Ralph Lauren for Women, Eau De Toilette Natural Spray, 3.4 Ounce]], can check this out, and compare side by side on the wrists, Lauren is more complex and has more and better ingredients.</li>
            <li>i like it very much.</li>
            <li>Luckily, this fragrance cost here one third of the asking price,and in my opinion, it is the price range where this fragrance really belongs, no matter how clever the adds can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fruity and floral, which could be nice, even though I am not a friend of fruity fragrances.</li>
            <li>she loved the little charms and the smell.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find out that 3.4 oz is a LARGE bottle and much bigger than the one I bought last summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the comments I get from men and women is constant they love it</li>
            <li>their cherry flower fragrance is similar, and much better composed.</li>
            <li>But makes one appreciate  better fragrances in the same price range, they may seem like a bargain after experiencing  this one.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>The fragrance does not last more than 5 minutes after spraying it on.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I buy it through Amazon ONLY now! :)</li>
            <li>Exactly like the one I bought at Macy&#x27;s for $90</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>And the name is pretty catchy.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is fruity and bright but it is not super sweet or overly young.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely pay a couple bucks more for the real product.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, fresh, slightly fruity or sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, but it&#x27;s nice while it lasts!  </li>
            <li>only natural ingredients,  better lasting power, much better composition of the juice.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my hippie chic that I bought at a local store and was so diappointed that they stopped carrying True Religion perfumes!  </li>
            <li>&gt; Totally overpriced, initial asking price is rather ridiculous for the juice which if offered, it goes to the price range of mentioned Aqua Allegoria by Guerlain,who hired really a good nose for their series, and use good ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This is my new go to scent!!</li>
            <li>The product arrived in the same fun bottle and same fragrance as past purchases, so I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>A much better done flowery fruity complex fragrance without any traces of cheap chemical fragrant components.</li>
            <li>To me this is a great daily wear fragrance year round.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>I am very picky on women&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li>one is obviously very chemical.</li>
            <li>This smells even better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li>Not over powering very feminine.  </li>
            <li>I looked on Amazon and found just the perfume at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>will be ordering again very soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s earthy, but not too much so.</li>
            <li>I bought this product not knowing how much 3.4 oz truly got me.</li>
            <li>how much is in it).</li>
            <li>I was afriad to buy a perfume online due to the possibility of it not being authentic, however this one is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I love this scent on other people, not so much on me though.</li>
            <li>Not a happy customer on this one, I surely can&#x27;t regift it now!!</li>
            <li>Smell real good and it last for a long time and it is a big bottle too that will last you for a while</li>
            <li>Nice Cologne, doesn&#x27;t last to long with me tho</li>
            <li>Not long lasting at all, (which could be OK fro flowery fragrance).</li>
            <li>I had a smaller bottle of this that I bought last summer, and it was almost gone - and I really wanted more.</li>
            <li>Love their jeans, but this fragrance is a let down.</li>
            <li>My new signature sent!</li>
            <li>My new fave!</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same on me and it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours unless you don&#x27;t sweat a all.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend fell in love with this spray when she got the tiny size from Kohls, but everywhere it was around fifty dollars for a slightly smaller size.</li>
            <li>is definitely one of my favorite perfumes and My mom bought me a 1.7 oz bottle for my birthday last year</li>
            <li>so for a little bit more</li>
            <li>I have a few more to try to see if they like it.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s not really strong and</li>
            <li>As reasonable as the cost is I can make certain to order it regularly for my daughter.</li>
            <li>i just HAD to buy a new one!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Size was just as stated and was brand new.  </li>
            <li>I was on the hunt for a new scent and this one caught my eye.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, but the scent leaves after a few short hours.</li>
            <li>I really like this true religion scent , I have purchased it on a previous time but not through Amazon</li>
            <li>This is one of those fragrances to forget, it is more like Chance Mademoiselle without most expensive ingredients,(initial asking price is similar to Chanel), smells like a drink, soda.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last time I order cologne without smelling it first.</li>
            <li>I expected a full bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li>perfume smells amazing and lasts me through an entire day if not more.</li>
            <li>There is certain sharpness too, which is similar to aquatic notes, but it smells rather like some really cheap fragrances which don&#x27;t have much lasting power but have this sharp notes of I don&#x27;t know really what.</li>
            <li>the scent is too sweet...and my 14 yr old granddaughter didn&#x27;t like it either.  </li>
            <li>this is nearly identical at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>so I have it to my 26 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>Maybe its old?  </li>
            <li>This has the nicest, soft smell ever.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smells like an old hippie.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be coming back to buy for my significant other for the Holidays!!</li>
            <li>I received a perfume soaked box with a half full bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li>I got it brand new for more than half the price less than in the mall.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever indulged myself by sticking my nose into that curious perfumated fold in the magazine ruled by boredom&#x27;s choice.</li>
            <li>A very clean, subtle scent of class.</li>
            <li>a very expensive  perfume I always thought only the really expensivery perfumes smell good</li>
            <li>Smells very floral, not much of a musk in it.</li>
            <li>Lucky Brand has similar marketing niche fragrance for women( pink juice, flowery and slightly fruity,very much young women fragrance)</li>
            <li>Very sweet, but with a touch of mildness behind it.</li>

            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; loved this</li>
            <li> This fragrance seems like a not as good copy of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> And good perfumes could have 80 ingredients, this one has like two accords.</li>
            <li> A good somewhat-blind investment.</li>

            <li> I love all of the Women&#x27;s True Region scents.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, nicely packaged and the smell is exactly what I want.  </li>
            <li> i bought this for ~$28 after it went down from ~$40.. GREAT deal!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem watered down and was great to get this product at a non department store price!</li>
            <li> Always comes quick!</li>
            <li> , this is the second time that I buy this item and the good thing is its very genuine.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and the price was really affordable!!</li>
            <li> light and doesn&#x27;t fade throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and the scent is just fabulous</li>
            <li> It was really cheap, and you can still buy it for $ 9 or $6 at ebay.</li>
            <li> Its light and wears well.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PERFUME AND LOVE THE AMAZING SAVINGS ON THE BIGGEST BOTTLE IVE EVER HAD AND PAID CLOSE TO SAME PRICE FOR THE SMALLEST BOTTLE</li>
            <li> so I assume it is as genuine as it should be.</li>
            <li> Was excited to find it on Amazon at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Very large size bottle, and cute dangling charms.</li>
            <li> The package was shipped very fast, and the packaging itself made sure that nothing would break my bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> It Is the original.  </li>
            <li> Cheap smelling, good for a teen</li>
            <li> This was my birthday present to myself, thanks a ton for the wonderful &amp; fast service!</li>
            <li> very floral like scent  sweet and potent</li>
            <li> Good price, larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells of sweet raspberries</li>
            <li> My teen daughter loves this and it has been a good way to introduce her to wearing perfume and how to ware it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally the smell reminds me of standing in a field of sweet peas just after it has rained.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true to its name....</li>
            <li> It smells so fresh and clean...</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly too.</li>
            <li> I  bought the lotion and two more of this scent to stock up since it is a decent price</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Maybe for this discount c.$40 will be OK for some people, but even for this price it is too high in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Complimented daily smells very refreshing</li>
            <li> My new favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li> This is a fresh, clean, crisp apple scent that makes me think of apple shampoo.</li>
            <li> This purchase was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Fresh but girly</li>
            <li> It is has a fresh smell for daytime.  </li>
            <li> It has a very clean and natural sent and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> My daughter has always loved this fragrance and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for $60.00 less than I paid for it in our local department store.</li>
            <li> For example[[ASIN:B004BPHCQ0 Penhaligon&#x27;s Artemisia Eau De Parfum Spray - 50ml/1.7oz]] is  a very nice fruity floral, with really excellent ingredients, and only a little bit more expensive than Hippie Chic original asking price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about fragrances and Euphoria is currently my favorite fall, winter choice and D&amp;G Light Blue for spring and summer.</li>
            <li> A very large bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this mild scent - its very similar to Ralph by Ralph Lauren.  </li>
            <li> excellent fast shipping ,much bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> Not well done of a fragrance, probably really quick creation in order to put it fast on the market.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts only a few minutes at best.  </li>
            <li> Ralph by Ralph Lauren for Women, Eau De Toilette Natural Spray, 3.4 Ounce]], can check this out, and compare side by side on the wrists, Lauren is more complex and has more and better ingredients.</li>
            <li> i like it very much.</li>
            <li> Luckily, this fragrance cost here one third of the asking price,and in my opinion, it is the price range where this fragrance really belongs, no matter how clever the adds can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fruity and floral, which could be nice, even though I am not a friend of fruity fragrances.</li>
            <li> she loved the little charms and the smell.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find out that 3.4 oz is a LARGE bottle and much bigger than the one I bought last summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the comments I get from men and women is constant they love it</li>
            <li> their cherry flower fragrance is similar, and much better composed.</li>
            <li> But makes one appreciate  better fragrances in the same price range, they may seem like a bargain after experiencing  this one.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> The fragrance does not last more than 5 minutes after spraying it on.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I buy it through Amazon ONLY now! :)</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one I bought at Macy&#x27;s for $90</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> And the name is pretty catchy.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is fruity and bright but it is not super sweet or overly young.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely pay a couple bucks more for the real product.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, fresh, slightly fruity or sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, but it&#x27;s nice while it lasts!  </li>
            <li> only natural ingredients,  better lasting power, much better composition of the juice.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my hippie chic that I bought at a local store and was so diappointed that they stopped carrying True Religion perfumes!  </li>
            <li> &gt; Totally overpriced, initial asking price is rather ridiculous for the juice which if offered, it goes to the price range of mentioned Aqua Allegoria by Guerlain,who hired really a good nose for their series, and use good ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This is my new go to scent!!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in the same fun bottle and same fragrance as past purchases, so I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> A much better done flowery fruity complex fragrance without any traces of cheap chemical fragrant components.</li>
            <li> To me this is a great daily wear fragrance year round.</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> I am very picky on women&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li> one is obviously very chemical.</li>
            <li> This smells even better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li> Not over powering very feminine.  </li>
            <li> I looked on Amazon and found just the perfume at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> will be ordering again very soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s earthy, but not too much so.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not knowing how much 3.4 oz truly got me.</li>
            <li> how much is in it).</li>
            <li> I was afriad to buy a perfume online due to the possibility of it not being authentic, however this one is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I love this scent on other people, not so much on me though.</li>
            <li> Not a happy customer on this one, I surely can&#x27;t regift it now!!</li>
            <li> Smell real good and it last for a long time and it is a big bottle too that will last you for a while</li>
            <li> Nice Cologne, doesn&#x27;t last to long with me tho</li>
            <li> Not long lasting at all, (which could be OK fro flowery fragrance).</li>
            <li> I had a smaller bottle of this that I bought last summer, and it was almost gone - and I really wanted more.</li>
            <li> Love their jeans, but this fragrance is a let down.</li>
            <li> My new signature sent!</li>
            <li> My new fave!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same on me and it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours unless you don&#x27;t sweat a all.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend fell in love with this spray when she got the tiny size from Kohls, but everywhere it was around fifty dollars for a slightly smaller size.</li>
            <li> is definitely one of my favorite perfumes and My mom bought me a 1.7 oz bottle for my birthday last year</li>
            <li> so for a little bit more</li>
            <li> I have a few more to try to see if they like it.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s not really strong and</li>
            <li> As reasonable as the cost is I can make certain to order it regularly for my daughter.</li>
            <li> i just HAD to buy a new one!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Size was just as stated and was brand new.  </li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a new scent and this one caught my eye.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but the scent leaves after a few short hours.</li>
            <li> I really like this true religion scent , I have purchased it on a previous time but not through Amazon</li>
            <li> This is one of those fragrances to forget, it is more like Chance Mademoiselle without most expensive ingredients,(initial asking price is similar to Chanel), smells like a drink, soda.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last time I order cologne without smelling it first.</li>
            <li> I expected a full bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> perfume smells amazing and lasts me through an entire day if not more.</li>
            <li> There is certain sharpness too, which is similar to aquatic notes, but it smells rather like some really cheap fragrances which don&#x27;t have much lasting power but have this sharp notes of I don&#x27;t know really what.</li>
            <li> the scent is too sweet...and my 14 yr old granddaughter didn&#x27;t like it either.  </li>
            <li> this is nearly identical at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> so I have it to my 26 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> Maybe its old?  </li>
            <li> This has the nicest, soft smell ever.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smells like an old hippie.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be coming back to buy for my significant other for the Holidays!!</li>
            <li> I received a perfume soaked box with a half full bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> I got it brand new for more than half the price less than in the mall.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever indulged myself by sticking my nose into that curious perfumated fold in the magazine ruled by boredom&#x27;s choice.</li>
            <li> A very clean, subtle scent of class.</li>
            <li> a very expensive  perfume I always thought only the really expensivery perfumes smell good</li>
            <li> Smells very floral, not much of a musk in it.</li>
            <li> Lucky Brand has similar marketing niche fragrance for women( pink juice, flowery and slightly fruity,very much young women fragrance)</li>
            <li> Very sweet, but with a touch of mildness behind it.</li>
            <li> and I personally feel like it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> ~ long lasting.  </li>
            <li> this will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> If you think this perfume doesn&#x27;t last very long, try not to \\&quot;smell for it\\&quot; all the time.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to spray after a long day to freshen up on your way home</li>
            <li> And it was the big bottle for half the price of the smaller one</li>
            <li> This is a fraction of the price and it is much bigger than I had expected!</li>
            <li> then fragrances can be a  very subjective issue, quite often, like a fragrance which makes one person feel nauseated, or allergic can be scent of paradise to another person.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife over the holidays, the package arrived on time and was just what i expected.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me or spring, I&#x27;m not much on floral scents</li>
            <li> note starts harsh chemically,(has strong silage too), heart note is weak and last not long, weak silage, not a remarkable scent.</li>
            <li> Actually it is nothing wrong with simple fragrances, for example Aqua Allegoria series by Guerlain is based on simple botanical notes, but they are well balanced.</li>
            <li> It smells comparable to a pheromone perfume you can purchase in the small blue bottles.</li>
            <li> I believe it has a faint smell when you first spray</li>
            <li> The bottle was a bit empty and the box was wet and crinkly!!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order this at first thinking it could be stale.</li>
            <li> they never let me down</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s watered down or if it just water in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> and it lasted me about half a year</li>
            <li> Get tons of complimemts on it everyday!</li>
            <li> Sadly, today perfumers (noses) are often pushed to create fragrances in matter of weeks when earlier it could take two years to create a complex, well balanced perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lacking base note, which may mean that the parts of fragrance which allow fragrance to last longer are not present here at all.</li>
            <li> I was wary buying perfume on amazon after I had a bad experience with a different brand of perfume from a different seller.</li>
            <li> At least what we received was.</li>
            <li> delicate and distinguishable.</li>
            <li> and/or behind my ears.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I was wrong amd</li>
            <li> Not Happy!  </li>
            <li> It was not a good product!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> It is a very faint fragrence that lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> I was truly disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Just dissapointed it didn&#x27;t come with the charm :(</li>
            <li> Hippie Chic is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this fragrance!!</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;ll cause you to just keep spraying the crap on you all day, and you won&#x27;t notice it, but everyone else around you will.</li>
            <li> I hated it a lot</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

            <li> my favorite sent!!! fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love True Religion scents.  This scent is&lt;br /&gt;very light and doesn&#x27;t fade throughout the day. This purchase was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter has always loved this fragrance and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for $60.00 less than I paid for it in our local department store. As reasonable as the cost is I can make certain to order it regularly for my daughter. The product arrived in the same fun bottle and same fragrance as past purchases, so I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Arrived quickly too.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; loved this</li>
            <li> Omg Im in love with this scent I  bought the lotion and two more of this scent to stock up since it is a decent price and the scent is just fabulous the comments I get from men and women is constant they love it I love how it&#x27;s not really strong and a very expensive  perfume I always thought only the really expensivery perfumes smell good well boy I was wrong amd the scent stays on you which is always a plus but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to spray after a long day to freshen up on your way home</li>
            <li> Love it, smells like it should :). Came on time.</li>
            <li> Kinda smells like the blue bottle of ralph lauren for women. It&#x27;s awesome. LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!! I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell quite like the sample I got at a cosmetic store but is close enough.  Not sure if it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife and she loves it. I am very picky on women&#x27;s cologne and I think this is the best so far that I&#x27;ve smelled on her.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Will definitely 0rder again!</li>
            <li> Fruity and floral fragrance, could be better. Love their jeans, but this fragrance is a let down. Rimmel did almost identical fragrance, called Rimmel London Glam, and didn&#x27;t come with asking price of $79. It was really cheap, and you can still buy it for $ 9 or $6 at ebay. This fragrance seems like a not as good copy of [[ASIN:B000C1W3OS Ralph by Ralph Lauren for Women, Eau De Toilette Natural Spray, 3.4 Ounce]], can check this out, and compare side by side on the wrists, Lauren is more complex and has more and better ingredients. Luckily, this fragrance cost here one third of the asking price,and in my opinion, it is the price range where this fragrance really belongs, no matter how clever the adds can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fruity and floral, which could be nice, even though I am not a friend of fruity fragrances. Not long lasting at all, (which could be OK fro flowery fragrance). There is certain sharpness too, which is similar to aquatic notes, but it smells rather like some really cheap fragrances which don&#x27;t have much lasting power but have this sharp notes of I don&#x27;t know really what. Not well done of a fragrance, probably really quick creation in order to put it fast on the market.Sadly, today perfumers (noses) are often pushed to create fragrances in matter of weeks when earlier it could take two years to create a complex, well balanced perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is obviously very chemical. And good perfumes could have 80 ingredients, this one has like two accords. Actually it is nothing wrong with simple fragrances, for example Aqua Allegoria series by Guerlain is based on simple botanical notes, but they are well balanced.This is one of those fragrances to forget, it is more like Chance Mademoiselle without most expensive ingredients,(initial asking price is similar to Chanel), smells like a drink, soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head note starts harsh chemically,(has strong silage too), heart note is weak and last not long, weak silage, not a remarkable scent. It lacking base note, which may mean that the parts of fragrance which allow fragrance to last longer are not present here at all. Lucky Brand has similar marketing niche fragrance for women( pink juice, flowery and slightly fruity,very much young women fragrance) much better designed, and for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then fragrances can be a  very subjective issue, quite often, like a fragrance which makes one person feel nauseated, or allergic can be scent of paradise to another person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Totally overpriced, initial asking price is rather ridiculous for the juice which if offered, it goes to the price range of mentioned Aqua Allegoria by Guerlain,who hired really a good nose for their series, and use good ingredients.  Maybe for this discount c.$40 will be OK for some people, but even for this price it is too high in my opinion. I rather get something from Occitane: only natural ingredients,  better lasting power, much better composition of the juice.For ex. their cherry flower fragrance is similar, and much better composed. Hippie Chic is very disappointing. But makes one appreciate  better fragrances in the same price range, they may seem like a bargain after experiencing  this one. For example[[ASIN:B004BPHCQ0 Penhaligon&#x27;s Artemisia Eau De Parfum Spray - 50ml/1.7oz]] is  a very nice fruity floral, with really excellent ingredients, and only a little bit more expensive than Hippie Chic original asking price. A much better done flowery fruity complex fragrance without any traces of cheap chemical fragrant components.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my mom, she loves this fragrance.  Arrived on time.  Thank you !!!!!</li>
            <li> I heard of this scent from a customer who was wearing it. Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same on me and it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours unless you don&#x27;t sweat a all.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend fell in love with this spray when she got the tiny size from Kohls, but everywhere it was around fifty dollars for a slightly smaller size. Good price, larger bottle. she loved the little charms and the smell.</li>
            <li> Very good smell, not to strong.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the smell, it does smell really nice like floral.</li>
            <li> excellent fast shipping ,much bigger than I expected and it smells so goooood! just perfect! I should have bought me another one.</li>
            <li> Affordable and a wonderful scent! Will be repurchasing it for sure! :D</li>
            <li> Cheap smelling, good for a teen</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells!</li>
            <li> Great deal ... Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Love it! Exactly how I saw in store but for a much better price! And it was the big bottle for half the price of the smaller one</li>
            <li> This smells even better than I expected it to. First time I&#x27;ve ever indulged myself by sticking my nose into that curious perfumated fold in the magazine ruled by boredom&#x27;s choice. A good somewhat-blind investment. If you think this perfume doesn&#x27;t last very long, try not to \\&quot;smell for it\\&quot; all the time. Your senses block out a smell over\\&quot;sniffed\\&quot; for. Plus it&#x27;ll cause you to just keep spraying the crap on you all day, and you won&#x27;t notice it, but everyone else around you will. PHEWW!!</li>
            <li> Not Happy!  I was truly disappointed in this product.  It&#x27;s like spraying water.  The fragrance does not last more than 5 minutes after spraying it on.  Will not order this again.</li>
            <li> This bottle is 3.4 fl oz, it&#x27;s a very good size like any normal 50-70$ perfume. It smells amazing and I personally feel like it&#x27;s long lasting. I use to work at TJ maxx and we sold the 1.5oz bottles for 16.99 so for a little bit more the price was unbeatable. Would definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Not for me...the scent is too sweet...and my 14 yr old granddaughter didn&#x27;t like it either.  I have a few more to try to see if they like it.</li>
            <li> Was a great Christmas gift for girlfriend. Really enjoyed perfume and will continue to shop for more gifts. Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I always get compliments on it.  Not over powering very feminine.  This is my go to fragrance.</li>
            <li> I had been shopping for this perfume in department stores, but it came packaged with lotion that I didn&#x27;t want, especially at $80. I looked on Amazon and found just the perfume at a very affordable price. I was very skeptical. I thought it would be a knockoff, but I decided to risk the money. It arrived on time and I unwrapped it. The box was packaged in its cellophane, no dents, but I could hear rattling, which concerned me until I remembered the charm on the bottle! I wrapped it in gift paper and presented it as a Christmas gift. It was perfect!</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this fragrance!! Smells sooo good!! And this is an AMAZING deal!! I work for a Dept store who sells it and this size bottle is around $64. I buy it through Amazon ONLY now! :)</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes, the price is the best part and it smells amazing. Fresh but girly</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume ever!!!! ~ long lasting.  Smells of sweet raspberries</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this fragrance! Its light and wears well. Perfect for work or going out for the night.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter loves this and it has been a good way to introduce her to wearing perfume and how to ware it.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and loved the price</li>
            <li> Not my cup of tea but i know many who absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter &amp; she loves it.  It is a very faint fragrence that lasts for hours.  I have seen this in the stores for $30-$40 more than the amazon price so I fel that I also got a great deal.</li>
            <li> My best friend since 6 year old is a Hippie Chic..her nickname thru school. Got it for her Christmas. She loves it and me too! Going to buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good! Combo of flowers and fruit.</li>
            <li> needed a quick gift and this came in perfect timing! This is my daughters fav, couldn&#x27;t believe it was so easy to find!</li>
            <li> Smells very floral, not much of a musk in it. It smells comparable to a pheromone perfume you can purchase in the small blue bottles. Very large size bottle, and cute dangling charms.</li>
            <li> Fun and flirty has very good staying power. I just purchase this from Frangance.net  my go too site for all my perfumes they never let me down I&#x27;d definitely pay a couple bucks more for the real product.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES this!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but the scent leaves after a few short hours.</li>
            <li> This is a fresh, clean, crisp apple scent that makes me think of apple shampoo. It is so bright and sparkling that I feel happy whenever I wear it. Medium-strong sillage, wears most of the day. To me this is a great daily wear fragrance year round. Yes, it is fruity and bright but it is not super sweet or overly young.  If you are a fan of Ralph by Ralph Lauren this is nearly identical at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about getting Hippie Chic for a while now, but the dept. Store price was WAY out of my budget. This is a fraction of the price and it is much bigger than I had expected! It arrived on time and packaging is quite cute.&lt;br /&gt;Personally the smell reminds me of standing in a field of sweet peas just after it has rained. Very sweet, but with a touch of mildness behind it. Perfect for an end of summer, sort of a bittersweet mood.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife over the holidays, the package arrived on time and was just what i expected.  This is a huge discount, sure beats spending over 70.00 in the store.</li>
            <li> I bought it perfume for my girls friend she loves it and she wears it almost every day, this is the second time that I buy this item and the good thing is its very genuine.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume! It smells wonderful and lasts throughout the day. My new favorite scent. My husband cant keep his hands off me once he smells it</li>
            <li> love, love, love thank you</li>
            <li> Love this mild scent - its very similar to Ralph by Ralph Lauren.  Will definitely order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Amazing, my favorite scent. Great price!!</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good on my woman. And the price is practically a steal compared to retail stores. I WILL be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love excellent discounts on high quality items.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume smells amazing and lasts me through an entire day if not more. I get so many compliments on it and I spray it 2-3 times on my collarbone/neck and/or behind my ears.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely one of my favorite perfumes and My mom bought me a 1.7 oz bottle for my birthday last year (it was only a couple dollars cheaper than for what I got the 3.4 oz bottle for on this site!!!) and it lasted me about half a year so once it finished i just HAD to buy a new one!&lt;br /&gt;This is the real thing, and I&#x27;m one happy customer!</li>
            <li> Got it for a gift for my friend she loves it, and it was a great deal!</li>
            <li> It was not a good product!! The smell yes, but as for the packaging NO!! The bottle was a bit empty and the box was wet and crinkly!! Not a happy customer on this one, I surely can&#x27;t regift it now!!</li>
            <li> Awesome  and came quicklyðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It is has a fresh smell for daytime.  The smell actually goes with jeans and a t-shirt. I get lot&#x27;s of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I think I paid for a bottle of water on this.  I believe it has a faint smell when you first spray but minutes later it&#x27;s gone.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s watered down or if it just water in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal for this perfume! Paid basically 50% for this 3.4 oz bottle that I would have for 1.7 oz in a store!!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Receive complements on this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about fragrances and Euphoria is currently my favorite fall, winter choice and D&amp;G Light Blue for spring and summer. This just didn&#x27;t match my body chemistry so I have it to my 26 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts only a few minutes at best.  Not the quality perfume you get in the department store.  I think body spray has a longer lasting scent.  Maybe its old?  Hence the great price.  Too good to be true....</li>
            <li> Smell real good and it last for a long time and it is a big bottle too that will last you for a while</li>
            <li> I loved the perfume.  I got it brand new for more than half the price less than in the mall.</li>
            <li> quick delivery, loved the packaging and absolutely in love with this perfume. I get compliments everywhere I go whenever I wear this. will be ordering again very soon.</li>
            <li> I expected a full bottle of perfume. I received a perfume soaked box with a half full bottle of perfume. I tried to find a return option and it is not a returnable item. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Size was just as stated and was brand new.  Love this perfume</li>
            <li> WIFE LOVES IT.. WILL BUY MORE..</li>
            <li> Quickest delivery ever! Absolutely thrilled with product</li>
            <li> Love this perfune. Smells great and the price it great for the size.</li>
            <li> The smell is so fresh and light, it&#x27;s by far the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my current bottle that I was basically out of. I was a little hesitant to order this at first thinking it could be stale. I&#x27;m So glad I ordered it anyway. Great scent! Exactly like the one I bought at Macy&#x27;s for $90</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!!</li>
            <li> It lasts awhile, the bottle is large, stays on clothing and skin for a full day, smells great, no complaints</li>
            <li> I had gone back and forth between the Buckle and Amazon. This scent is fabulous! It&#x27;s earthy, but not too much so. It&#x27;s flowery, but not overpowering. The package was shipped very fast, and the packaging itself made sure that nothing would break my bottle of perfume. This was my birthday present to myself, thanks a ton for the wonderful &amp; fast service! Even though I realized after I placed the order that I had about $30 on a Buckle Gift Card, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. I will absolutely be coming back to buy for my significant other for the Holidays!!</li>
            <li> Its a feminine smell, flowers, fruit, and even a delightful light musk sent, all blended together to make a beautiful fragrance. I had never smelled this before i bought it, and I was NOT disappointed! My new signature sent!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I was wary buying perfume on amazon after I had a bad experience with a different brand of perfume from a different seller. This perfume is the same as what they sell in stores: size, smell, design etc. Smells wonderful and I saved a bunch of $$$ buying this on amazon instead of a retail store! Will buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!! LOVE THIS PERFUME AND LOVE THE AMAZING SAVINGS ON THE BIGGEST BOTTLE IVE EVER HAD AND PAID CLOSE TO SAME PRICE FOR THE SMALLEST BOTTLE IVE EVER BOUGHT, BUT THIS IS THE 1ST TIME IVE BOUGHT IT ONLINE, GOTTA LOVE AMAZON!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter asked for this for her birthday but insisted I buy it at Costco because there are too many people selling faked products online. I just researched the seller and opted to buy this one without telling her. She has no complaints so I assume it is as genuine as it should be.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my niece who had been wanting the perfume. I am a bargain shopper and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay the price I&#x27;d seen in stores. (Even at a discount perfume store!) I went online to my tried and true Amazon.com and found this at the best price I had seen anywhere else. Thanks! I am a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for myself. I could not find this perfume in stores, so I purchased this item on line. Love the bottle, Love the smell :)</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! But I found the kit with 3.4 oz  perfume, lotion, shower gel and a Mimi size perfume for 32.99 at Marshall&#x27;s and I paid 30 for this one size..</li>
            <li> Love love love this perfume!!! Got it as a doup for ralph by Ralph lauren.. I was very happy with the smell and the size for the price I payed :))</li>
            <li> Love it fast shipping &amp; smells so good. Get tons of complimemts on it everyday!</li>
            <li> I was afriad to buy a perfume online due to the possibility of it not being authentic, however this one is the real deal. I LOVE this scent!! Its so light and sexy!! Very clean and freash!!</li>
            <li> I ran out of my hippie chic that I bought at a local store and was so diappointed that they stopped carrying True Religion perfumes!  Very thankful to Amazon that I was able to find it here at such a great price!  Perfume smells great and lasts all day:)</li>
            <li> i bought this for ~$28 after it went down from ~$40.. GREAT deal! i was not expecting such a big bottle. this will last me a long time! plus it smells DELISH!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume!! Always comes quick!</li>
            <li> smells like bathroom perfume. its not the sellers fault. it&#x27;s the brands fault. its waaaaay too strong I hated it a lot</li>
            <li> This has the nicest, soft smell ever. I get a compliment EVERY DAY! I have never gotten complements on my perfume before. This was at a GREAT price and a HUGE bottle!!! Cant say enough!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome!  In my opinion, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, but it&#x27;s nice while it lasts!  I love all of the Women&#x27;s True Region scents.</li>
            <li> Great Purfume I bought 2</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Gf loves this perfume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true to its name....it&#x27;s smells like an old hippie. Last time I order cologne without smelling it first. Generous amount for the price but you better know you love it already. To each her own.</li>
            <li> Nice Cologne, doesn&#x27;t last to long with me tho</li>
            <li> I recieved this package very quickly and was so glad that I found it on amazon. Smelled it at Khols but I didnt want to pay such a steep price. Very glad about this.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. Was excited to find it on Amazon at such a great price. I will defiantly be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I really like this true religion scent , I have purchased it on a previous time but not through Amazon</li>
            <li> A very clean, subtle scent of class. A easy choice for any occasion.</li>
            <li> this was a gift and they were so happy to open the package and see this item, smells great, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not knowing how much 3.4 oz truly got me. I had a smaller bottle of this that I bought last summer, and it was almost gone - and I really wanted more. So I went for the 3.4 oz bottle (since it doesn&#x27;t state on the bottle itself how much is in it). I was happy to find out that 3.4 oz is a LARGE bottle and much bigger than the one I bought last summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be set for quite some time</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it.  Not a knockoff product.  It Is the original.  At least what we received was.</li>
            <li> A very large bottle for the price. Scent Seems to not last all day. Guess that&#x27;s why such a big bottle</li>
            <li> Got this for my aunt as a wedding present and she says it is her favorite perfume. She constantly receives compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Real deal, smells great</li>
            <li> this product came on time and unopened! it doesn&#x27;t seem watered down and was great to get this product at a non department store price!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the way this smells. It has a very clean and natural sent and lasts forever. Several days after I sprayed it on my scarf the scent was still there and smelled amazing!</li>
            <li> Very nice !! Very fast shipping !!! It reminds me or spring, I&#x27;m not much on floral scents but I do like this one!! Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li> Complimented daily smells very refreshing</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. I bought 5 of them all at once so I could give to my friends as gifts. This perfume is great.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Smells good, but more like Paris Hilton perfume than true religion still smells nice!</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this perfume at a discount store months ago.  When it ran out, the store was also out so I ordered from Amazon.  Arrived quickly, nicely packaged and the smell is exactly what I want.  Not too strong, fresh, slightly fruity or sweet smelling.  My new fave!</li>
