            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t say Supertape on it, it&#x27;s not going to be as great.</li>
            <li>thiss stuff is awesome and it holds more than just hair in place.</li>

            <li>Love it .</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased these items.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using the scalp protector and the C22 Citrus Solvent (great product see review) when using this product will save lots of tears and hairs.</li>
            <li>I tried out the super tape and love the way it holds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a roller coaster &amp; in a windstorm wearing a full wig secured with Supertape &amp; wasn&#x27;t worried one bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sticky &amp; may hurt when removing, but your &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t going anywhere when secured with this tape.</li>
            <li>Supertape is definitely the tape to use if you need a very secure hold on your hairpiece &amp; even full wig.</li>
            <li>In some cases they stuck good in at other times they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Was good the way I expected fast delivery too</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li>This tape works very well with my lace units alone.  </li>
            <li>These tapes work very well</li>
            <li>I used a little oil when I was ready to remove and it came right off.  </li>
            <li>But be careful not to get any of the tape on your real hair, as it may pull your hair out on removal.</li>
            <li>Barely stayed put.</li>

            <li> Also this product is shiny under the lace so a little concealer or foundation may be needed to give a natural look.</li>
            <li> for long term use .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased others at my local wig shop &amp; they were a waste.</li>
            <li> I wasted hours applying and reapplying these strips because I didn&#x27;t put them on properly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by other tapes.</li>
            <li> i prefer this over the glue because it isn&#x27;t as messy and it stays on longer.</li>
            <li> I would say that when you decide to put your wig on, do so a few hrs before your event because it does take the tape time to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; and once it does the wig wont move.  </li>
            <li> It holds my lace wigs very tight even when sweatign from working out at the gym.</li>
            <li> they bond from the heat of your head but are not too hard to tear off</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it,it&#x27;s useless</li>

            <li> thiss stuff is awesome and it holds more than just hair in place. i prefer this over the glue because it isn&#x27;t as messy and it stays on longer. I oder it everytime I run low.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li> Good product and will purchase agin</li>
            <li> Super tape is the best</li>
            <li> Love this tape.Once it is apply, it will not move. Hold for 3 weeks. Will buy this product again. Love it .</li>
            <li> for long term use . I have gone back to the daily tape</li>
            <li> This tape works very well with my lace units alone.  Add this tape with your glue adhesives it gives a longer, stronger hold when applying your lace unit  especially if you work out, or sweat a lot. You can cut tape to desired size.</li>
            <li> The items arrived as promised. I tried out the super tape and love the way it holds. It doesn&#x27;t give off the shiny look either. I am glad I purchased these items.</li>
            <li> These tapes work very well they bond from the heat of your head but are not too hard to tear off and they last for close to a week if you don&#x27;t sweat.</li>
            <li> This super tape is GREAT!! It holds my lace wigs very tight even when sweatign from working out at the gym. I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews of this tape on youtube and it worked well.  I would say that when you decide to put your wig on, do so a few hrs before your event because it does take the tape time to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; and once it does the wig wont move.  I used a little oil when I was ready to remove and it came right off.  But be careful not to get any of the tape on your real hair, as it may pull your hair out on removal.</li>
            <li> Was good the way I expected fast delivery too</li>
            <li> The hold is great on this product quick delivery and good price. To keep the freshness of this product I suggest putting in the refrigerator in a plastic Baggie.</li>
            <li> Supertape is definitely the tape to use if you need a very secure hold on your hairpiece &amp; even full wig. It&#x27;s super sticky &amp; may hurt when removing, but your &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t going anywhere when secured with this tape. I&#x27;ve been on a roller coaster &amp; in a windstorm wearing a full wig secured with Supertape &amp; wasn&#x27;t worried one bit. Don&#x27;t be fooled by other tapes. If it doesn&#x27;t say Supertape on it, it&#x27;s not going to be as great. I&#x27;ve purchased others at my local wig shop &amp; they were a waste. Barely stayed put.</li>
            <li> I finally recieved this tape and it&#x27;s defective. The side with the panels you remove after putting it in place is not cut so you can&#x27;t grab the peices and pull them off,you rip off parts.Don&#x27;t buy it,it&#x27;s useless</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used this product before, I recommend you get a friend to help you. I wasted hours applying and reapplying these strips because I didn&#x27;t put them on properly. In some cases they stuck good in at other times they didn&#x27;t. Highly recommend using the scalp protector and the C22 Citrus Solvent (great product see review) when using this product will save lots of tears and hairs. Also this product is shiny under the lace so a little concealer or foundation may be needed to give a natural look.</li>
