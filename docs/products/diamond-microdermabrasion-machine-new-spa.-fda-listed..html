            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and customer service was great when i called with a question.</li>
            <li>The suction is amazing.</li>
            <li>An amazing product.</li>
            <li>The quality of the machine is great, and the huge saving of time and money can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>My face feels and looks amazing after I do a treatment.  </li>
            <li>This machine is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>my skin looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>This does not glide as nicely across the skin.</li>
            <li>the diamonds tips are nice to work.</li>
            <li>Nice choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it compares nicely to the doctor&#x27;s office version considering the price.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to do my own face, and use on the family as well.</li>
            <li>Nice choice of tips and the hand piece is very easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>The machine is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The instruction booklet is geared towards using this product in a salon environment, but is very easy to understand.    </li>
            <li>When it comes to the power and/or suction of the machine, it is very strong but you can set the suction between min-max.</li>
            <li>This is still an excellent buy and delivers a professional quality microderm.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that i chose Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine NEW SPA.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome performance and easy to use.</li>
            <li>this is a very good, professional unit.</li>
            <li>I received this product and it is so awesome in my personal opionon.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is looking better</li>
            <li>and I preferred this model to the cheaper one because it gives you more suctioning power.</li>
            <li>However, if done properly this machine is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>but my face feels and looks better after doing the microdermabrasion treatment.</li>
            <li>really works great if you have any age spots  to get rid of</li>
            <li>/&gt;Notice the electrical plug connects ON TOP of the machine, and when you move the wand it tends to tap on it.</li>
            <li>(they wanted me to give them MORE</li>
            <li>The suction is great and the heads are very durable.</li>
            <li>The silver *HOME* kit seems to come with a couple more items in it and</li>
            <li>Take your time with this, do not rush, play around with the settings to see what works best...and in the end, I think you&#x27;ll love this unit too.      </li>
            <li>AND IN ADDITION--if you&#x27;re reading this on your cell phone (like I do :)</li>
            <li>and it does for sure.  </li>
            <li>The diamond tips, tubing, filters, and the overall machine itself is awesome.  </li>
            <li>you done something different?&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li>give it a 4 b/c I wish it had come with better instructions on how to use it and products to use with it  </li>
            <li>The suction is very good, so good in fact that for me there was a slight learning curve to not give myself bruising around my lips.</li>
            <li>The result was a good one after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time &amp; in great condition we would totally recommend the seller &amp; product as we are thrilled we did</li>
            <li>It seems plumper and many of the fine lines have disappeared.</li>
            <li>I really LOVE this machine,it does a fantastic job..</li>
            <li>--Suction is great and PROFESSIONAL quality</li>
            <li>It came in a compact box that is easy to carry if you plan to use it somewhere else besides your home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use:</li>
            <li>I love my Microdermabrasion machine, is easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>travel a lot and all of my devices work fine everywhere (hairdryer, curler, laptop)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had these as spa treatments you&#x27;ll love this machine, it&#x27;s easy to use and powerful..</li>
            <li>There are many machines out there priced about the same as New Spa but for home use, this machine is the best.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to get the hang of it, but once you do, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>The face feels smooth and toned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and compact so it can fit almost anywhere.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this machine</li>
            <li>I am not sorry!!  </li>
            <li>It is very powerful as someone else stated it is intended for salon use.</li>
            <li>To get a better idea how to use it on your skin, I highly suggest utilizing YouTube for the plethora of videos out there for this :).  </li>
            <li>Super easy to take apart and put to feather for transportation and cleaning.</li>
            <li>Amazon reviews are pretty darn good tools to use when spending money--and ALL of them seem to have a pretty good satisfaction, but I decided against them for the following reason:      </li>
            <li>Since using it, I have seen wonderful results and actually look forward to when I am able to do my next microderm.</li>
            <li>Get online and look at the reply to that review/comment--because when I first read that I was worried until I learned more.      </li>
            <li>--It&#x27;s pretty :).</li>
            <li>I was a licensed salon professional, but have moved on to a career I love more, so I can assure you it is not user error.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have found a machine for a price that&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li>My hands, neck and face felt nice and soft after dermabrasion.  </li>
            <li>GREAT seller would use them again and recommend to other family members and friends.  </li>
            <li>Microdermabrasion is extremely helpful with my teenagers&#x27; acne, and this was a great investment for us.</li>
            <li>The gauge broke the first time I used it, as I believe another reviewer mentioned, although the machine itself still worked fine.</li>
            <li>Really it has a strong power of suction and</li>
            <li>It paid for itself on the first day!</li>
            <li>In addition, it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
            <li>I spoke to the seller, she was extremely nice, and advised her of above</li>
            <li>However, once I got the machine, I realized I guess it was worth it...</li>
            <li>I just turned 40, and while that doesn&#x27;t scare me, I do realize exfoliation is a key element to keeping skin nice.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s had very positive results to her skin.  </li>
            <li>so you can figure out what the right settings are for your skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a HIGH QUALITY machine but its about the size of a toaster over and its carriable and storable and light weight.</li>
            <li>The product so far is really good &amp; I am hoping that there would be no problem in the following months or years to come.</li>
            <li>Complete with easy to follow directions and recommendations for care.</li>
            <li>The only &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; review I found was that this machine was too powerful for home use which made me want to buy it even more.</li>
            <li>It is worth every dime i do have lines and large pores.  </li>
            <li>I had no issues with this machine from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>The first machine didn&#x27;t work and a replacement was sent out immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased it about a month ago and can truly say that this machine really works!</li>
            <li>;)    </li>
            <li>Everything about the New Spa works as advertised and is very user friendly.</li>
            <li>Actually I recommend and start to use in low level power with a good technique to avoid scrape the skin.</li>
            <li>Like someone else here said, starting off on a low level is a good idea.</li>
            <li>, I read every review and article I could find on this machine, I sent many emails to the company with questions and I waited SO long to get this, and I regret buying this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The suction ability of any unit is a HUGE consideration!!!--let&#x27;s face it, these units are merely glorified vacuum pumps--but they serve a darn good purpose :).</li>
            <li>Immediately after using this, my face had a healthy glow which I haven&#x27;t had for a while and all the dry skin on my face was gone...</li>
            <li>The machine is not labeled with the electrical requirements, but the warranty will not replace devices that break for certain electrical problems and fluctuations (note the wand tap comment</li>
            <li>everything works fine, but I still bought a step-down device to regulate electrical current that comes out of my plugs into a stable, US-required output that I bought JUST for this device...</li>
            <li>but I hope if something is wrong, the wararanty would work very good.</li>
            <li>The suitcase design is very convenient, everything fits inside.    </li>
            <li>It Works very well.</li>
            <li>The diamond cut dermabrasion tools are gentle and don&#x27;t scratch the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them both, and this is by far the better machine, for the same amount of money!</li>
            <li>I have only used the product once to far, but was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>My sister has seen my machine and agrees it is definitely sturdier and has more of professional quality compared to the Nu Brilliance.  </li>
            <li>What does that mean for the \\&quot;average consumer\\&quot;?---you CANNOT put it together and then go using it on your face without trying it out first AND getting an idea what best works for you.</li>
            <li>I can do is recommend you to buy other devices that are more electrically stable.</li>
            <li>clean the diamond tips (boil to disinfect for 15 minutes), pop in the cotton filter, and turn it on (after simple attaching of the tubing to the suction port).</li>
            <li>what settings are good or not good...</li>
            <li>Also, like one of the questions answered in a different thread, this IS a full kit including a hose, filters, O-rings, 3 wands (</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve tortured my husband into letting me use it on him, and his skin is WAY MORE sensitve than mine so even with the suction turned down</li>
            <li>and also to New Spa!</li>
            <li>was that I got a small &amp;#34;hickey&amp;#34; on my cheek which was more funny than anything.</li>
            <li>I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t be that good, since I&#x27;m use to using a larger professional Microdermabrasion Machine, but this one seems to work as good as the professional one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will buy from New Spa again!</li>
            <li>That does NOT mean it&#x27;s that hard to put together, but spending this amount of money I wanted to make sure I was doing things right.</li>
            <li>I will definitely save money because the professional microdermabrasion costs from $80 to $160,but it feels absolutely the same, even better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommending it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this machine.</li>
            <li>Its really nice how it comes in a sturdy hard case with clip locks too.</li>
            <li>Its so easy, its intutive, you really cannot mess up here, trust me</li>
            <li>a third time.(it is powerful)</li>
            <li>more waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do need to start at low settings and don&#x27;t do too much when you first start</li>
            <li>First thing is NewSpa has more than one boxed home microdermabrasion machine that it sells--there is a *HOME* machine and a *SPA* machine that are clearly defined online and in the small manual that comes with the machine.</li>
            <li>--there is a 1 star review saying this unit is a fire hazard--the person who bought the unit plugged it in to an outlet not commonly found in homes in the US and the unit overloaded.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many professional microderm abrasion sessions, and the vacuum strength and the tips that come with this machine feel about the same.</li>
            <li>You actually have to beware and not use it at its highest on the facial area as its so strong.</li>
            <li>The wands include coarse and fine abrasion pieces that may be used in different parts of the face.</li>
            <li>but when you call the new spa customer service they  will send you an email explaining everything &amp; you can ask them all kinds of questions .&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li>lost $289 and all they said is that I need to buy a new device</li>
            <li>Although the question remains as to whether New Spa has customer service, they do list an email for contact, but no phone number can be found, I emailed them in December</li>
            <li>I have another New Spa machine to</li>
            <li>I not only received my credit VERY FAST</li>
            <li>This is a high quality professional product.</li>
            <li>I paid nearly 500$ CAD including the duties and the shipping is ridiculously high for canadian customers( 80$US ??)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality, professional grade microdermabrasion machine that&#x27;ll give you results...</li>
            <li>The suction is very powerful and I&#x27;ve only used it on a low setting.</li>
            <li>I did start off on a lower setting and actually tested the suction on my hand first.</li>
            <li>As far as a Home Kit, this is the one I chose!</li>
            <li>It works exactly the same as what we have done at the dermatologist office.</li>
            <li>I shopped around FOREVER, reviewing &amp; comparing EVERY machine out there, and found this machine to be the only one consistently recommended among all the sites.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think the HOME (aka silver) machine is prettier ;), but that isn&#x27;t either here or there.</li>
            <li>Mine would tap and the light would flicker a little.</li>
            <li>The info that came with the machine offers no resource for purchase</li>
            <li>I received microdermabrasion machine and discovered it is not for home use unless you are a professional and know how to use it.  </li>
            <li>It is so soft afterward.  </li>
            <li>This machine costs about as much as 2 professional treatments, requires no refills of any sort (no ongoing maintenance costs) and is professional quality.</li>
            <li>It is nowhere near the exfoliation I get from microdermabrasion at my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>You have to &#x27;play&#x27; with it, at different settings of \\&quot;Intensity\\&quot; (which is the knob that decides how much suction is being used).      </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I am a 34 year old beauty and skincare addict.</li>
            <li>I have used it faithfully and given it a fair chance, and was not remotely impressed.</li>
            <li>It is not real hard to use.  </li>
            <li>* which is pretty sensitive skin, I took swipes at different \\&quot;Intensity\\&quot; levels, also marking down what &#x27;position&#x27; the tick on the knob was in (10 o&#x27;clock, 12 noon, 2 o&#x27;clock, 3 o&#x27;clock--for lack of a better description) and kept a little &#x27;log&#x27; as to what level of Hg the machine went to at those settings.</li>
            <li>still every time I used it I would have deep scratches that I wasn&#x27;t even aware of till the next day.  </li>
            <li>(I DO smile a lot :) and while they are invisible to the naked eye, I own one of those evil magnification mirrors I use for tweezing my eyebrows, that being said, I can see the teeny blackheads that cleansers, toners, cream at-home</li>
            <li>(aka black) machine&#x27;s main complaints are that the suction is &#x27;too much&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do all the things it says it can do, but your skin will feel very soft and you definitely see your skin particles in the filters.</li>
            <li>Be very careful because its really powerful and if not done properly you can have some skin peeling and severe irritation.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the customer&#x27;s service doesn&#x27;t even bother to answer back to their emails which is totally unprofessionnal considering the high cost of this machine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use it twice so far and tried different tips and barely put pressure (succion level is at light-medium intensity) .</li>
            <li>My entire family has been getting professional microdermabrasion with an esthetician for months.</li>
            <li>I chose this one for the level of suction (professional quality at 25 Hg), and having 9 tips to choose from instead of just 2 for multiple sizes of areas.</li>
            <li>I used to get microdermabrasion treatments done in NYC at Bliss Spa and in Miami in my dermatologist&#x27;s office and this machine definitely compares to those professional treatments.  </li>
            <li>Also, I had received a gift cert for my bday from a friend to go to a local spa; I had made an appointment for ONE microdermabrasion---and that alone was $115!---and looking at these home machines, with all due respect to the esthetician industry, it seems like a waste of money to not buy a machine for the cost of 1-3 appts and be able to use it *</li>
            <li>I have waited too long to return it, I&#x27;m sure, but my dad has had serious health issues and time got away from me.</li>
            <li>I have used this on myself and my boyfriend for over a YEAR and no a single problem.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need to be a professional to use it so long as you take your time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After the suction stopped working after 5 minutes of use, I kept this machine on for a while (as someone recommended) and the only thing that happened is that it started to make a crackling noise and it burned and filled my entire apartment with thick smoke that wouldn&#x27;t stop despite being unplugged</li>
            <li>This thing paid for itself in the first few months.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I highly recommend this machine.</li>
            <li>It comes with several tips, all with different &amp;#34;strengths&amp;#34;, so when you first get it I&#x27;d recommend using the lowest strength tip with the suction set a little lower than 50%.</li>

            <li> The machine feels and appears fairly durable.</li>
            <li> if you like micro-derma though, this is probably as good as it gets for the diamond tip units.</li>

            <li> I still have good suction</li>
            <li> It gets 2 stars because of good customer service.  </li>
            <li> if you Purchase this microdermabrasion machine you will be raving like the rest of us on how awesome it is and how fantastic your skin looks and feels from using it.  </li>

            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and customer service was great when i called with a question.</li>
            <li> The suction is amazing.</li>
            <li> An amazing product.</li>
            <li> The quality of the machine is great, and the huge saving of time and money can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> My face feels and looks amazing after I do a treatment.  </li>
            <li> This machine is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> my skin looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> This does not glide as nicely across the skin.</li>
            <li> the diamonds tips are nice to work.</li>
            <li> Nice choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it compares nicely to the doctor&#x27;s office version considering the price.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to do my own face, and use on the family as well.</li>
            <li> Nice choice of tips and the hand piece is very easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> The machine is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The instruction booklet is geared towards using this product in a salon environment, but is very easy to understand.    </li>
            <li> When it comes to the power and/or suction of the machine, it is very strong but you can set the suction between min-max.</li>
            <li> This is still an excellent buy and delivers a professional quality microderm.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that i chose Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine NEW SPA.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome performance and easy to use.</li>
            <li> this is a very good, professional unit.</li>
            <li> I received this product and it is so awesome in my personal opionon.  </li>
            <li> I just love it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is looking better</li>
            <li> and I preferred this model to the cheaper one because it gives you more suctioning power.</li>
            <li> However, if done properly this machine is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> but my face feels and looks better after doing the microdermabrasion treatment.</li>
            <li> really works great if you have any age spots  to get rid of</li>
            <li> /&gt;Notice the electrical plug connects ON TOP of the machine, and when you move the wand it tends to tap on it.</li>
            <li> (they wanted me to give them MORE</li>
            <li> The suction is great and the heads are very durable.</li>
            <li> The silver *HOME* kit seems to come with a couple more items in it and</li>
            <li> Take your time with this, do not rush, play around with the settings to see what works best...and in the end, I think you&#x27;ll love this unit too.      </li>
            <li> AND IN ADDITION--if you&#x27;re reading this on your cell phone (like I do :)</li>
            <li> and it does for sure.  </li>
            <li> The diamond tips, tubing, filters, and the overall machine itself is awesome.  </li>
            <li> you done something different?&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li> give it a 4 b/c I wish it had come with better instructions on how to use it and products to use with it  </li>
            <li> The suction is very good, so good in fact that for me there was a slight learning curve to not give myself bruising around my lips.</li>
            <li> The result was a good one after the first treatment.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time &amp; in great condition we would totally recommend the seller &amp; product as we are thrilled we did</li>
            <li> It seems plumper and many of the fine lines have disappeared.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this machine,it does a fantastic job..</li>
            <li> --Suction is great and PROFESSIONAL quality</li>
            <li> It came in a compact box that is easy to carry if you plan to use it somewhere else besides your home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use:</li>
            <li> I love my Microdermabrasion machine, is easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> travel a lot and all of my devices work fine everywhere (hairdryer, curler, laptop)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had these as spa treatments you&#x27;ll love this machine, it&#x27;s easy to use and powerful..</li>
            <li> There are many machines out there priced about the same as New Spa but for home use, this machine is the best.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get the hang of it, but once you do, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> The face feels smooth and toned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and compact so it can fit almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this machine</li>
            <li> I am not sorry!!  </li>
            <li> It is very powerful as someone else stated it is intended for salon use.</li>
            <li> To get a better idea how to use it on your skin, I highly suggest utilizing YouTube for the plethora of videos out there for this :).  </li>
            <li> Super easy to take apart and put to feather for transportation and cleaning.</li>
            <li> Amazon reviews are pretty darn good tools to use when spending money--and ALL of them seem to have a pretty good satisfaction, but I decided against them for the following reason:      </li>
            <li> Since using it, I have seen wonderful results and actually look forward to when I am able to do my next microderm.</li>
            <li> Get online and look at the reply to that review/comment--because when I first read that I was worried until I learned more.      </li>
            <li> --It&#x27;s pretty :).</li>
            <li> I was a licensed salon professional, but have moved on to a career I love more, so I can assure you it is not user error.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found a machine for a price that&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li> My hands, neck and face felt nice and soft after dermabrasion.  </li>
            <li> GREAT seller would use them again and recommend to other family members and friends.  </li>
            <li> Microdermabrasion is extremely helpful with my teenagers&#x27; acne, and this was a great investment for us.</li>
            <li> The gauge broke the first time I used it, as I believe another reviewer mentioned, although the machine itself still worked fine.</li>
            <li> Really it has a strong power of suction and</li>
            <li> It paid for itself on the first day!</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
            <li> I spoke to the seller, she was extremely nice, and advised her of above</li>
            <li> However, once I got the machine, I realized I guess it was worth it...</li>
            <li> I just turned 40, and while that doesn&#x27;t scare me, I do realize exfoliation is a key element to keeping skin nice.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s had very positive results to her skin.  </li>
            <li> so you can figure out what the right settings are for your skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a HIGH QUALITY machine but its about the size of a toaster over and its carriable and storable and light weight.</li>
            <li> The product so far is really good &amp; I am hoping that there would be no problem in the following months or years to come.</li>
            <li> Complete with easy to follow directions and recommendations for care.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; review I found was that this machine was too powerful for home use which made me want to buy it even more.</li>
            <li> It is worth every dime i do have lines and large pores.  </li>
            <li> I had no issues with this machine from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first treatment.</li>
            <li> The first machine didn&#x27;t work and a replacement was sent out immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased it about a month ago and can truly say that this machine really works!</li>
            <li> ;)    </li>
            <li> Everything about the New Spa works as advertised and is very user friendly.</li>
            <li> Actually I recommend and start to use in low level power with a good technique to avoid scrape the skin.</li>
            <li> Like someone else here said, starting off on a low level is a good idea.</li>
            <li> , I read every review and article I could find on this machine, I sent many emails to the company with questions and I waited SO long to get this, and I regret buying this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The suction ability of any unit is a HUGE consideration!!!--let&#x27;s face it, these units are merely glorified vacuum pumps--but they serve a darn good purpose :).</li>
            <li> Immediately after using this, my face had a healthy glow which I haven&#x27;t had for a while and all the dry skin on my face was gone...</li>
            <li> The machine is not labeled with the electrical requirements, but the warranty will not replace devices that break for certain electrical problems and fluctuations (note the wand tap comment</li>
            <li> everything works fine, but I still bought a step-down device to regulate electrical current that comes out of my plugs into a stable, US-required output that I bought JUST for this device...</li>
            <li> but I hope if something is wrong, the wararanty would work very good.</li>
            <li> The suitcase design is very convenient, everything fits inside.    </li>
            <li> It Works very well.</li>
            <li> The diamond cut dermabrasion tools are gentle and don&#x27;t scratch the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them both, and this is by far the better machine, for the same amount of money!</li>
            <li> I have only used the product once to far, but was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My sister has seen my machine and agrees it is definitely sturdier and has more of professional quality compared to the Nu Brilliance.  </li>
            <li> What does that mean for the \\&quot;average consumer\\&quot;?---you CANNOT put it together and then go using it on your face without trying it out first AND getting an idea what best works for you.</li>
            <li> I can do is recommend you to buy other devices that are more electrically stable.</li>
            <li> clean the diamond tips (boil to disinfect for 15 minutes), pop in the cotton filter, and turn it on (after simple attaching of the tubing to the suction port).</li>
            <li> what settings are good or not good...</li>
            <li> Also, like one of the questions answered in a different thread, this IS a full kit including a hose, filters, O-rings, 3 wands (</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve tortured my husband into letting me use it on him, and his skin is WAY MORE sensitve than mine so even with the suction turned down</li>
            <li> and also to New Spa!</li>
            <li> was that I got a small &amp;#34;hickey&amp;#34; on my cheek which was more funny than anything.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t be that good, since I&#x27;m use to using a larger professional Microdermabrasion Machine, but this one seems to work as good as the professional one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will buy from New Spa again!</li>
            <li> That does NOT mean it&#x27;s that hard to put together, but spending this amount of money I wanted to make sure I was doing things right.</li>
            <li> I will definitely save money because the professional microdermabrasion costs from $80 to $160,but it feels absolutely the same, even better.</li>
            <li> Highly recommending it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this machine.</li>
            <li> Its really nice how it comes in a sturdy hard case with clip locks too.</li>
            <li> Its so easy, its intutive, you really cannot mess up here, trust me</li>
            <li> a third time.(it is powerful)</li>
            <li> more waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do need to start at low settings and don&#x27;t do too much when you first start</li>
            <li> First thing is NewSpa has more than one boxed home microdermabrasion machine that it sells--there is a *HOME* machine and a *SPA* machine that are clearly defined online and in the small manual that comes with the machine.</li>
            <li> --there is a 1 star review saying this unit is a fire hazard--the person who bought the unit plugged it in to an outlet not commonly found in homes in the US and the unit overloaded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many professional microderm abrasion sessions, and the vacuum strength and the tips that come with this machine feel about the same.</li>
            <li> You actually have to beware and not use it at its highest on the facial area as its so strong.</li>
            <li> The wands include coarse and fine abrasion pieces that may be used in different parts of the face.</li>
            <li> but when you call the new spa customer service they  will send you an email explaining everything &amp; you can ask them all kinds of questions .&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li> lost $289 and all they said is that I need to buy a new device</li>
            <li> Although the question remains as to whether New Spa has customer service, they do list an email for contact, but no phone number can be found, I emailed them in December</li>
            <li> I have another New Spa machine to</li>
            <li> I not only received my credit VERY FAST</li>
            <li> This is a high quality professional product.</li>
            <li> I paid nearly 500$ CAD including the duties and the shipping is ridiculously high for canadian customers( 80$US ??)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality, professional grade microdermabrasion machine that&#x27;ll give you results...</li>
            <li> The suction is very powerful and I&#x27;ve only used it on a low setting.</li>
            <li> I did start off on a lower setting and actually tested the suction on my hand first.</li>
            <li> As far as a Home Kit, this is the one I chose!</li>
            <li> It works exactly the same as what we have done at the dermatologist office.</li>
            <li> I shopped around FOREVER, reviewing &amp; comparing EVERY machine out there, and found this machine to be the only one consistently recommended among all the sites.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think the HOME (aka silver) machine is prettier ;), but that isn&#x27;t either here or there.</li>
            <li> Mine would tap and the light would flicker a little.</li>
            <li> The info that came with the machine offers no resource for purchase</li>
            <li> I received microdermabrasion machine and discovered it is not for home use unless you are a professional and know how to use it.  </li>
            <li> It is so soft afterward.  </li>
            <li> This machine costs about as much as 2 professional treatments, requires no refills of any sort (no ongoing maintenance costs) and is professional quality.</li>
            <li> It is nowhere near the exfoliation I get from microdermabrasion at my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> You have to &#x27;play&#x27; with it, at different settings of \\&quot;Intensity\\&quot; (which is the knob that decides how much suction is being used).      </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am a 34 year old beauty and skincare addict.</li>
            <li> I have used it faithfully and given it a fair chance, and was not remotely impressed.</li>
            <li> It is not real hard to use.  </li>
            <li> * which is pretty sensitive skin, I took swipes at different \\&quot;Intensity\\&quot; levels, also marking down what &#x27;position&#x27; the tick on the knob was in (10 o&#x27;clock, 12 noon, 2 o&#x27;clock, 3 o&#x27;clock--for lack of a better description) and kept a little &#x27;log&#x27; as to what level of Hg the machine went to at those settings.</li>
            <li> still every time I used it I would have deep scratches that I wasn&#x27;t even aware of till the next day.  </li>
            <li> (I DO smile a lot :) and while they are invisible to the naked eye, I own one of those evil magnification mirrors I use for tweezing my eyebrows, that being said, I can see the teeny blackheads that cleansers, toners, cream at-home</li>
            <li> (aka black) machine&#x27;s main complaints are that the suction is &#x27;too much&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do all the things it says it can do, but your skin will feel very soft and you definitely see your skin particles in the filters.</li>
            <li> Be very careful because its really powerful and if not done properly you can have some skin peeling and severe irritation.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the customer&#x27;s service doesn&#x27;t even bother to answer back to their emails which is totally unprofessionnal considering the high cost of this machine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use it twice so far and tried different tips and barely put pressure (succion level is at light-medium intensity) .</li>
            <li> My entire family has been getting professional microdermabrasion with an esthetician for months.</li>
            <li> I chose this one for the level of suction (professional quality at 25 Hg), and having 9 tips to choose from instead of just 2 for multiple sizes of areas.</li>
            <li> I used to get microdermabrasion treatments done in NYC at Bliss Spa and in Miami in my dermatologist&#x27;s office and this machine definitely compares to those professional treatments.  </li>
            <li> Also, I had received a gift cert for my bday from a friend to go to a local spa; I had made an appointment for ONE microdermabrasion---and that alone was $115!---and looking at these home machines, with all due respect to the esthetician industry, it seems like a waste of money to not buy a machine for the cost of 1-3 appts and be able to use it *</li>
            <li> I have waited too long to return it, I&#x27;m sure, but my dad has had serious health issues and time got away from me.</li>
            <li> I have used this on myself and my boyfriend for over a YEAR and no a single problem.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need to be a professional to use it so long as you take your time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the suction stopped working after 5 minutes of use, I kept this machine on for a while (as someone recommended) and the only thing that happened is that it started to make a crackling noise and it burned and filled my entire apartment with thick smoke that wouldn&#x27;t stop despite being unplugged</li>
            <li> This thing paid for itself in the first few months.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I highly recommend this machine.</li>
            <li> It comes with several tips, all with different &amp;#34;strengths&amp;#34;, so when you first get it I&#x27;d recommend using the lowest strength tip with the suction set a little lower than 50%.</li>
            <li> the vacuum hose in (my) fish tank\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have received at least 10 professional microderm treatments from my doctor&#x27;s office, but the price is just too high to continue.</li>
            <li> I sugest finding it on u-tube to watch or at least go to a spa so you can learn first hand on how to operate and handle on doing it to self correctly.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is delicate I would say stay away, but for those who give it a try, just be aware.</li>
            <li> he gets long red marks that take two days to fade.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about doing my own microderms at home.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and ordered this unit over the other unit because of the extra wands and extra suction power it has.  </li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected (June 5).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like having a microdermabrasion from a Facial Care Center or SPA.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long, when I decided to use it towards this purchase.</li>
            <li> This has happened on numerous occasions, so at this point I&#x27;m not willing to try again.  </li>
            <li> I felt a little face soreness next morning</li>
            <li> so at this point, I&#x27;m not really concerned.</li>
            <li> Please, be careful.  </li>
            <li> I read a few reviews that said the filters were a pain to replace but don&#x27;t let that be a factor in your decision because it&#x27;s so simple...</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I had it set a little high with a higher strength tip and the worst thing that happened</li>
            <li> Other than that... no complaints.    </li>
            <li> i was checking several machines because, I&#x27;m esthetician professional and was afraid select a personal home device; but I&#x27;m beginning to try on my family and me; to check everything before I take to my job.</li>
            <li> In one of the other product reviews, I saw one comment that equated that machine&#x27;s suction \\&quot;to</li>
            <li> like other home machines goes up to 15Hg, but the black *SPA* unit goes up to 25Hg.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I am struggling a bit to find replacement filters.</li>
            <li> And really, in my opinion, for home use that&#x27;s about as complicated as it needs to get.    </li>
            <li> for such a slow delivery service.</li>
            <li> OK!!!---here are the units besides this NewSpa SALON (black) one I bought that I researched:  </li>
            <li> I would give this a 5 star but the instructions leave a little to be desired.</li>
            <li> I received the machine a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on NuBrilliance.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my nubrilliance lost suction after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it weekly for about 6 months without any problems, although during my last session, the pressure gage seems to have broken.</li>
            <li> &quot; kits just don&#x27;t budge, or if they do anything--the chemicals are so harsh, I wind up with skin that stings (and hurts).</li>
            <li> The filters are just a slightly difficult to replace, I use something with a small flat end to lift the filter and then grab it and carefully slide it out.</li>
            <li> I even find myself using a daytime moisturizer,sunscreen and very little makeup if any.</li>
            <li> This past summer was really hard on my skin, I didn&#x27;t protect it like I usually did, so I got alot of discoloration and a few age spots...</li>
            <li> But if not sure about using it</li>
            <li> but I noticed it leaves small scratches all over my face the day after</li>
            <li> Actually, my skin is worse now and looks like a cat stratched my face!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I wasted $150/per treatment on microderm all those years!</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to take anything small pieces apart to replace the filter - you just unscrew the diamond tip from the wand and poke the filter out with a toothpick or something.</li>
            <li> It comes with tons of filters, tons of tips, and its hard to break it.</li>
            <li> I do not own a salon I am just a consumer looking to save money.</li>
            <li> no more caking my face in lotion!</li>
            <li> With all due respect to those who (unfortunately) had problems with the machine, I say HOGWASH.      </li>
            <li> Shallow,</li>
            <li> /&gt;These machines have a WEAK electrical system and it causes the suction to stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> silicon hose was broken into two parts</li>
            <li> but sheesh---some of the other ones, like an ugly hulking silver box that to me looks like a mini electrical transformer just didn&#x27;t appeal to me.    </li>
            <li> you will know if youre doing it wrong bc</li>
            <li> I have given it weeks to get results, and am not impressed.</li>
            <li> She bought it through the infomercial and was very expensive.  </li>
            <li> , I mean TERRIBLE instructions.</li>
            <li> --Terrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received this product and it is so awesome in my personal opionon.  I just love it.  It is not real hard to use.  But if not sure about using it I sugest finding it on u-tube to watch or at least go to a spa so you can learn first hand on how to operate and handle on doing it to self correctly.  I would order from company again.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this machine,it does a fantastic job..There is a noticeable difference in my skin..This past summer was really hard on my skin, I didn&#x27;t protect it like I usually did, so I got alot of discoloration and a few age spots...Between this machine and Avons skin brightener after about 10 treatments my blotchiness is noticeably reduced. I even find myself using a daytime moisturizer,sunscreen and very little makeup if any.Before I wouldn&#x27;t leave my house without makeup. My skin is looking better everytime I use it and I couldn&#x27;t be happier..However, I&#x27;ve tortured my husband into letting me use it on him, and his skin is WAY MORE sensitve than mine so even with the suction turned down he gets long red marks that take two days to fade. Did it twice,happened twice. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll be a third time.(it is powerful) If you&#x27;ve had these as spa treatments you&#x27;ll love this machine, it&#x27;s easy to use and powerful..</li>
            <li> This is good for the price. I&#x27;m used to using a DiamonTome. This does not glide as nicely across the skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about doing my own microderms at home. I had no issues with this machine from the first time I used it. I did start off on a lower setting and actually tested the suction on my hand first. Since using it, I have seen wonderful results and actually look forward to when I am able to do my next microderm. I have saved money and time. My only complaint is that I am struggling a bit to find replacement filters. The info that came with the machine offers no resource for purchase so my search continues. Other than that, I highly recommend this machine.</li>
            <li> I received microdermabrasion machine and discovered it is not for home use unless you are a professional and know how to use it.  I spoke to the seller, she was extremely nice, and advised her of above and she agreed. She told me to return it and they would refund my money.  I not only received my credit VERY FAST they included the shipping as well.  GREAT seller would use them again and recommend to other family members and friends.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Seller is great! It arrived earlier than expected (June 5). The product so far is really good &amp; I am hoping that there would be no problem in the following months or years to come. It&#x27;s just like having a microdermabrasion from a Facial Care Center or SPA. Every time I use it, which is in the evening once a week, I would wake up with a glow in my face the following morning. Thanks Amazon! and also to New Spa! Keep it up!</li>
            <li> Just received this today.  Two problems:  silicon hose was broken into two parts and I don&#x27;t understand the filter that is inserted into the Vacumn Pump Outlet knob.  I checked it as per instructions and don&#x27;t see the filter or where it is to be inserted.  I contacted the seller via Amazon and will update review once I receive replacement part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many professional microderm abrasion sessions, and the vacuum strength and the tips that come with this machine feel about the same. The machine feels and appears fairly durable. And really, in my opinion, for home use that&#x27;s about as complicated as it needs to get.    The suitcase design is very convenient, everything fits inside.    The filters are just a slightly difficult to replace, I use something with a small flat end to lift the filter and then grab it and carefully slide it out. Other than that... no complaints.    I&#x27;m glad to have found a machine for a price that&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice! As far as a Home Kit, this is the one I chose!</li>
            <li> this is a very good, professional unit. i&#x27;d probably give it 5 stars but i&#x27;m not sold on the technology/process of microdermabrasion. if you like micro-derma though, this is probably as good as it gets for the diamond tip units.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once, can&#x27;t wait for second treatment. I noticed a difference after the first treatment. I am looking forward to seeing the results after several. I would give this a 5 star but the instructions leave a little to be desired. I think it needs to have clearer instructions. It is very powerful as someone else stated it is intended for salon use. I do not own a salon I am just a consumer looking to save money. I am VERY pleased with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> I received the machine a few days ago. It came in a compact box that is easy to carry if you plan to use it somewhere else besides your home. The machine is very easy to use. You have to adjust suctioning power according to your skin. The wands include coarse and fine abrasion pieces that may be used in different parts of the face. I used the machine on myself and my daughter using two different wands and adjusting suction as I felt it was necessary. I was very pleased with the results. The face feels smooth and toned. I felt a little face soreness next morning but it felt good. I like the machine and I preferred this model to the cheaper one because it gives you more suctioning power. I will definitely save money because the professional microdermabrasion costs from $80 to $160,but it feels absolutely the same, even better.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that i chose Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine NEW SPA.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome performance and easy to use. Highly recommending it.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality professional product. It Works very well. Complete with easy to follow directions and recommendations for care.</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t use it properly but I noticed it leaves small scratches all over my face the day after and it takes a week to disappear. I&#x27;ve use it twice so far and tried different tips and barely put pressure (succion level is at light-medium intensity) . My skin is so irritated and red for days and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement. Actually, my skin is worse now and looks like a cat stratched my face! I paid nearly 500$ CAD including the duties and the shipping is ridiculously high for canadian customers( 80$US ??) for such a slow delivery service. Not to mention the customer&#x27;s service doesn&#x27;t even bother to answer back to their emails which is totally unprofessionnal considering the high cost of this machine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on NuBrilliance. This is 10 times the machine and puts it to shame. I&#x27;ve tried them both, and this is by far the better machine, for the same amount of money!</li>
            <li> I bought this after my nubrilliance lost suction after a few uses. This machine has excellent suction and many sizes of diamond heads. It&#x27;s easy to use. I&#x27;ve used it weekly for about 6 months without any problems, although during my last session, the pressure gage seems to have broken. I still have good suction and I&#x27;m well aquainted with the machine so at this point, I&#x27;m not really concerned. This is still an excellent buy and delivers a professional quality microderm.There are many machines out there priced about the same as New Spa but for home use, this machine is the best.</li>
            <li> i was checking several machines because, I&#x27;m esthetician professional and was afraid select a personal home device; but I&#x27;m beginning to try on my family and me; to check everything before I take to my job. Really it has a strong power of suction and the diamonds tips are nice to work. Actually I recommend and start to use in low level power with a good technique to avoid scrape the skin. Nice choice.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe is not neccesary but I hope if something is wrong, the wararanty would work very good.</li>
            <li> very nice home unit, and I am a dermatologist</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do all the things it says it can do, but your skin will feel very soft and you definitely see your skin particles in the filters.</li>
            <li> Excellent machine! I love it! Be very careful because its really powerful and if not done properly you can have some skin peeling and severe irritation. However, if done properly this machine is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with this item we tried it and we are planning to use it a lot, It MAY EVEN LEAD TO ORDERING  a 2nd one.</li>
            <li> I love this Machine! Best Buy Ever! My Boyfriend even asked for a try bc of the great results! Great but!</li>
            <li> I purchased this machine last year, yes I realize its a delayed review, but I was reminded because I was looking for something safer.  It gets 2 stars because of good customer service.  The first machine didn&#x27;t work and a replacement was sent out immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why the low rating?  This machine can scratch the heck out of your skin.  This is why it just sits on a shelf in my closet taking up space.  I followed ever direction, changed my technique, looked up advise, and still every time I used it I would have deep scratches that I wasn&#x27;t even aware of till the next day.  This has happened on numerous occasions, so at this point I&#x27;m not willing to try again.  Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Please, be careful.  If your skin is delicate I would say stay away, but for those who give it a try, just be aware.</li>
            <li> I have used this machine a few times and can really tell a difference in my skin.  It is so soft afterward.  The most difficult thing is to not overdo it.  Results come after several times of using it..  It is easy to use and customer service was great when i called with a question.</li>
            <li> Beyond my expectations! The suction is amazing. You actually have to beware and not use it at its highest on the facial area as its so strong. The tips are great quality. All of my clients love their skin after! Super easy to take apart and put to feather for transportation and cleaning. It&#x27;s lightweight and compact so it can fit almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> An amazing product. I have received at least 10 professional microderm treatments from my doctor&#x27;s office, but the price is just too high to continue. This machine costs about as much as 2 professional treatments, requires no refills of any sort (no ongoing maintenance costs) and is professional quality. The instruction booklet is geared towards using this product in a salon environment, but is very easy to understand.    I have only used the product once to far, but was pleased with the results. I highly recommend this product and will buy from New Spa again!</li>
            <li> My entire family has been getting professional microdermabrasion with an esthetician for months. I decided to invest in this machine after doing a lot of research. It works exactly the same as what we have done at the dermatologist office. It was very easy to do my own face, and use on the family as well. Microdermabrasion is extremely helpful with my teenagers&#x27; acne, and this was a great investment for us. It paid for itself on the first day! I chose this one for the level of suction (professional quality at 25 Hg), and having 9 tips to choose from instead of just 2 for multiple sizes of areas. It is so easy to use: clean the diamond tips (boil to disinfect for 15 minutes), pop in the cotton filter, and turn it on (after simple attaching of the tubing to the suction port). Change the suction filter every 3-4 uses, and that is it! The quality of the machine is great, and the huge saving of time and money can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> My sister purchased the Nu Brilliance Microdermabrasion machine and I saw immediate and awesome results on her.  She bought it through the infomercial and was very expensive.  I, of course, had to check it out on Amazon.  While searching for the Nu Brilliance, I came across this unit and the $189.00 one.  These units both have excellent reviews compared to the Nu Brilliance.  I went ahead and ordered this unit over the other unit because of the extra wands and extra suction power it has.  I am not sorry!!  My sister has seen my machine and agrees it is definitely sturdier and has more of professional quality compared to the Nu Brilliance.  Although, she is still happy with her purchase.  My face feels and looks amazing after I do a treatment.  Your makeup will glide on!  I also do at home glycolic acid peels but my face feels and looks better after doing the microdermabrasion treatment.</li>
            <li> does everything it saids it will works great on my grandkids keratosispilaris...really works great if you have any age spots  to get rid of</li>
            <li> We absolutely love the machine!!! It works wonders &amp; came with all kinds of wand tips so you can use here &amp; there.  It works just as the spa use to.  It arrived on time &amp; in great condition we would totally recommend the seller &amp; product as we are thrilled we did &amp; now we can micro when we want on our schedule</li>
            <li> it is  a wonderful machine , worth the money. you won&#x27;t regret buying it.i consider it the best buy of the year.&lt;br /&gt;i did my face for 4 consecutive weeks(once a week) and the result is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt; you won&#x27;t regret buying it . it does not have enough information on how to use it but when you call the new spa customer service they  will send you an email explaining everything &amp; you can ask them all kinds of questions .&lt;br /&gt;good luck</li>
            <li> Very good machine for the price.  Nice choice of tips and the hand piece is very easy to hold.  A bit louder than some machines I have used.  Placing a towel under the machine has helped decrease the noise from vibration.</li>
            <li> This machine is AMAZING. I cannot believe I wasted $150/per treatment on microderm all those years! If you can use a writing pen you can use this. Its so easy, its intutive, you really cannot mess up here, trust me you will know if youre doing it wrong bc it will be scratchy and red. You CAN DO THIS yourself I promise! Its DURABLE I have used this on myself and my boyfriend for over a YEAR and no a single problem. It comes with tons of filters, tons of tips, and its hard to break it. Its really nice how it comes in a sturdy hard case with clip locks too. This is a HIGH QUALITY machine but its about the size of a toaster over and its carriable and storable and light weight.</li>
            <li> I lost $289. I couldn&#x27;t use it even 1 day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before deciding to buy this, I read every review and article I could find on this machine, I sent many emails to the company with questions and I waited SO long to get this, and I regret buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These machines have a WEAK electrical system and it causes the suction to stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice the electrical plug connects ON TOP of the machine, and when you move the wand it tends to tap on it. Mine would tap and the light would flicker a little. It broke on day 1 after 5 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware about the warranty terms. The machine is not labeled with the electrical requirements, but the warranty will not replace devices that break for certain electrical problems and fluctuations (note the wand tap comment above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot and all of my devices work fine everywhere (hairdryer, curler, laptop) everything works fine, but I still bought a step-down device to regulate electrical current that comes out of my plugs into a stable, US-required output that I bought JUST for this device... more waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the suction stopped working after 5 minutes of use, I kept this machine on for a while (as someone recommended) and the only thing that happened is that it started to make a crackling noise and it burned and filled my entire apartment with thick smoke that wouldn&#x27;t stop despite being unplugged so I threw it under the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost $289 and all they said is that I need to buy a new device (they wanted me to give them MORE money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can do is recommend you to buy other devices that are more electrically stable. In my opinion this is a fire hazard.</li>
            <li> The purchase was no hassle entirely, but the machine leaves a lot to be desired. The gauge broke the first time I used it, as I believe another reviewer mentioned, although the machine itself still worked fine. I have given it weeks to get results, and am not impressed. I was a licensed salon professional, but have moved on to a career I love more, so I can assure you it is not user error. I feel I obtained the same results I would have with regular use of a Buff Puff. I have waited too long to return it, I&#x27;m sure, but my dad has had serious health issues and time got away from me. I have used it faithfully and given it a fair chance, and was not remotely impressed. It is nowhere near the exfoliation I get from microdermabrasion at my dermatologist. No comparison whatsoever. The parts feel like quality parts, but the machine just does not do the job.</li>
            <li> I shopped around FOREVER, reviewing &amp; comparing EVERY machine out there, and found this machine to be the only one consistently recommended among all the sites. The only &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; review I found was that this machine was too powerful for home use which made me want to buy it even more. I purchased it about a month ago and can truly say that this machine really works! It takes a little practice to get the hang of it, but once you do, it&#x27;s awesome! I read a few reviews that said the filters were a pain to replace but don&#x27;t let that be a factor in your decision because it&#x27;s so simple...you don&#x27;t have to take anything small pieces apart to replace the filter - you just unscrew the diamond tip from the wand and poke the filter out with a toothpick or something. When it comes to the power and/or suction of the machine, it is very strong but you can set the suction between min-max. It comes with several tips, all with different &amp;#34;strengths&amp;#34;, so when you first get it I&#x27;d recommend using the lowest strength tip with the suction set a little lower than 50%. The first time I used it, I had it set a little high with a higher strength tip and the worst thing that happened was that I got a small &amp;#34;hickey&amp;#34; on my cheek which was more funny than anything. Immediately after using this, my face had a healthy glow which I haven&#x27;t had for a while and all the dry skin on my face was gone...no more caking my face in lotion! If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality, professional grade microdermabrasion machine that&#x27;ll give you results...take it from me and get this machine!!! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> We deliberated on which Microdermabrasion machine to get and this one does everything it promised. The suction is great and the heads are very durable. This is a great buy that I recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife and a training DVD from another manufacturer.  It&#x27;s been running great since we bought it.  My wife loves to use it and she&#x27;s had very positive results to her skin.  This thing paid for itself in the first few months.  It was a great buy and a great gift for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to start at low settings and don&#x27;t do too much when you first start so you can figure out what the right settings are for your skin.

            <li> OK!!!---here are the units besides this NewSpa SALON (black) one I bought that I researched:  --Kendal SF01  --MicrodermMD  --NuBrilliance  --NewSpa HOME kit (silver)          I refuse to bash any of them. Amazon reviews are pretty darn good tools to use when spending money--and ALL of them seem to have a pretty good satisfaction, but I decided against them for the following reason:      ***I BOUGHT THE NEWSPA PORTABLE *SPA* KIT BECAUSE OF THE COMPLAINTS AGAINST IT***.      WTH!?!?--you may be thinking. The suction ability of any unit is a HUGE consideration!!!--let&#x27;s face it, these units are merely glorified vacuum pumps--but they serve a darn good purpose :). If suction, well, sucks--then what&#x27;s the point? In one of the other product reviews, I saw one comment that equated that machine&#x27;s suction \\&quot;to the vacuum hose in (my) fish tank\\&quot;. Ouch. Why am I going to spend hundreds of $$$ for that?!? The NewSpa Portable SALON (aka black) machine&#x27;s main complaints are that the suction is &#x27;too much&#x27;. With all due respect to those who (unfortunately) had problems with the machine, I say HOGWASH.      First thing is NewSpa has more than one boxed home microdermabrasion machine that it sells--there is a *HOME* machine and a *SPA* machine that are clearly defined online and in the small manual that comes with the machine. Personally, I think the HOME (aka silver) machine is prettier ;), but that isn&#x27;t either here or there. The silver *HOME* kit seems to come with a couple more items in it and like other home machines goes up to 15Hg, but the black *SPA* unit goes up to 25Hg. What does that mean for the \\&quot;average consumer\\&quot;?---you CANNOT put it together and then go using it on your face without trying it out first AND getting an idea what best works for you. Period. You have to &#x27;play&#x27; with it, at different settings of \\&quot;Intensity\\&quot; (which is the knob that decides how much suction is being used).      I got my machine, got it working, and then on my *inner forearm* which is pretty sensitive skin, I took swipes at different \\&quot;Intensity\\&quot; levels, also marking down what &#x27;position&#x27; the tick on the knob was in (10 o&#x27;clock, 12 noon, 2 o&#x27;clock, 3 o&#x27;clock--for lack of a better description) and kept a little &#x27;log&#x27; as to what level of Hg the machine went to at those settings. (Doing this took me a whopping 15 minutes!)Every person will be different, but it gave me a starting point to work with. Also, I waited **24 hours* after doing this to see how my skin would react, and what settings are good or not good...and then I went to use it on my face, and have had NO problems. Like someone else here said, starting off on a low level is a good idea. Take your time with this, do not rush, play around with the settings to see what works best...and in the end, I think you&#x27;ll love this unit too.      Also, like one of the questions answered in a different thread, this IS a full kit including a hose, filters, O-rings, 3 wands (though somewhere it says 2, but I received 3) and corresponding diamond heads in different sizes. AND IN ADDITION--if you&#x27;re reading this on your cell phone (like I do :)--there is a 1 star review saying this unit is a fire hazard--the person who bought the unit plugged it in to an outlet not commonly found in homes in the US and the unit overloaded. Get online and look at the reply to that review/comment--because when I first read that I was worried until I learned more.      ****PROS****  --Suction is great and PROFESSIONAL quality but you don&#x27;t need to be a professional to use it so long as you take your time.  --Built-in carrying case! MY GAWD---ALL the accessories AND the unit are all containable in one easy, peasy carrying case!! That makes things SOOOO nice!!!  --It&#x27;s pretty :). Shallow, but sheesh---some of the other ones, like an ugly hulking silver box that to me looks like a mini electrical transformer just didn&#x27;t appeal to me.    ****CONS****  --Terrible, I mean TERRIBLE instructions. What NewSpa does provide is piddly at best. Justto get the hose ends hooked up properly I asked my husband, who is a licensed mechanic, to help me. That does NOT mean it&#x27;s that hard to put together, but spending this amount of money I wanted to make sure I was doing things right. By the way, he was HIGHLY impressed at the unit saying it was \\&quot;well-built\\&quot; and a \\&quot;good investment\\&quot;. To get a better idea how to use it on your skin, I highly suggest utilizing YouTube for the plethora of videos out there for this :).  --Shipping is a LOT. GEEZ, $34 to ship?!? However, once I got the machine, I realized I guess it was worth it...it&#x27;s not a marshmellow (it&#x27;s also not a big ol boulder in weight either) but it&#x27;s got weight.      I have been sitting on an Amazon giftcard for I don&#x27;t know how long, when I decided to use it towards this purchase. I just turned 40, and while that doesn&#x27;t scare me, I do realize exfoliation is a key element to keeping skin nice. I am getting whisper-thin lines on my cheeks (I DO smile a lot :) and while they are invisible to the naked eye, I own one of those evil magnification mirrors I use for tweezing my eyebrows, that being said, I can see the teeny blackheads that cleansers, toners, cream at-home \\&quot;microdermabrasion\\&quot; kits just don&#x27;t budge, or if they do anything--the chemicals are so harsh, I wind up with skin that stings (and hurts). Also, I had received a gift cert for my bday from a friend to go to a local spa; I had made an appointment for ONE microdermabrasion---and that alone was $115!---and looking at these home machines, with all due respect to the esthetician industry, it seems like a waste of money to not buy a machine for the cost of 1-3 appts and be able to use it *when I want* opposed to weekly or monthly appointments I just couldn&#x27;t afford. (and I&#x27;m using that spa gift cert for a spa pedi instead ;)    Overall, I am happy with this machine and I wish everyone in search of their perfect one the very best :)</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt smoother! It seems plumper and many of the fine lines have disappeared. Everything about the New Spa works as advertised and is very user friendly. The suction is very good, so good in fact that for me there was a slight learning curve to not give myself bruising around my lips. Thankfully 2 days and the bruising was gone. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Although the question remains as to whether New Spa has customer service, they do list an email for contact, but no phone number can be found, I emailed them in December but I have not received a reply. With that said I still think this is a great machine.</li>
            <li> I love this machine!  It is worth every dime i do have lines and large pores.  I wanted to get a machine that had all the \\&quot;bells &amp; whistles \\&quot; plus the suction you would get if having this done in a salon and it does for sure.  The diamond tips, tubing, filters, and the overall machine itself is awesome.  It works great and im very happy I bought it.  I have another New Spa machine to and I believe this is a great company.  if you Purchase this microdermabrasion machine you will be raving like the rest of us on how awesome it is and how fantastic your skin looks and feels from using it.  Happy microdermabrasion...</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t be that good, since I&#x27;m use to using a larger professional Microdermabrasion Machine, but this one seems to work as good as the professional one. I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> I love my Microdermabrasion machine, is easy to use and easy to clean.  The diamond cut dermabrasion tools are gentle and don&#x27;t scratch the skin.  I have used it in my face, neck and hands.  My hands, neck and face felt nice and soft after dermabrasion.  I use the low frequency as i do not want my skin to get bruised.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am a 34 year old beauty and skincare addict. I used to get microdermabrasion treatments done in NYC at Bliss Spa and in Miami in my dermatologist&#x27;s office and this machine definitely compares to those professional treatments.  I&#x27;ve done 5 treatments on myself and my skin looks amazing.  The suction is very powerful and I&#x27;ve only used it on a low setting. I highly recommend this machine.</li>
            <li> Been using it for months now. I microderm, then skin peel immediately after. The results have been great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! It works, my face looks younger, sun damage is lighter and feels softer. In addition, it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
            <li> I have only used it once but it compares nicely to the doctor&#x27;s office version considering the price.  The result was a good one after the first treatment.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  And believe me, I was skepitcal.  I have used it on my bf and my bff.  My bff has rec&#x27;d multiple compliments even after only one treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin and my bf has noticed a difference in my skin too.  He asked me &amp;#34;have you done something different?&amp;#34;  :)&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 4 b/c I wish it had come with better instructions on how to use it and products to use with it  But that&#x27;s why we all have YouTube and Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product.  Good luck and hope it works as good for you.</li>
