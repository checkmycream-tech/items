            <li>Although admittedly, you shouldn&#x27;t be able to smell your own perfume after it&#x27;s been on for awhile or you have too much</li>

            <li>You feel so pretty wearing it. :)</li>
            <li>Just make sure you try a sample at the store first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This perfume is light scented,and not heavy to the nose, but yet a nice blend of floral, and earthy scents.</li>
            <li>wait to wear it, im just waiting for a special occation</li>
            <li>This perfume is so feminine, flowery and sweet.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not over powering and the scent lasts really long, great value for the price, will purchase &#x27;pretty hot&#x27; as well :-)</li>
            <li>I cannot remember how much it costs at DILLARD&#x27;S, but I would think a bit more.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too sweet, or musky at all.</li>
            <li>- it is light, feminine and fresh without being too floral.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Perfume is mild and mildly sweet and musky.  </li>
            <li>Smells like a fresh, clean, sweet flower garden.</li>
            <li>Very elegant and romantic.  </li>
            <li>It’s not too sweet, nor too floral either—it reminds me of fresh rain.</li>
            <li>&quot; was her new favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great light floral scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The perfect year round fragrance - soft but not too sweet -</li>
            <li>This smells so, well, pretty!</li>
            <li>I have since ordered the large bottle on line and just ordered another large bottle for my daughter&#x27;s birthday because she fell in love with it too.</li>
            <li>It was a great price but it was missing the sprayer.</li>
            <li>Great everyday scent.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, its very girlie and  very feinine.  </li>
            <li>But this one is not too strong as to do that, yet it is also strong enough to be noticed.</li>
            <li>I found it for the right price and bought it.</li>
            <li>it was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I.prefer fragrances that last most of the day.</li>
            <li>Pretty is just what it is.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell quite like the Pretty</li>
            <li>Love the scent, just wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li>Can you justify paying that higher price?</li>
            <li>This is important to my wife because she has a sensitive nose for smells and this perfume is just that for her.</li>
            <li>I love Elizabeth Arden products, especially her fragrances.  </li>
            <li>very feminine !</li>
            <li>It is light and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for casual and not-so-casual occasions.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and soft but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last.</li>
            <li>I have purchased Pretty from department stores in the past and loved it</li>
            <li>This perfume really does smell pretty.</li>
            <li>, it is one of my most favorites and the smell lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>I tried a small bottle and loved it.</li>
            <li>It is a floral musk and very girly.</li>
            <li>This was one of them and thanks to my husband, was one of my birthday presents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very feminine perfume.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This same product is for $37.00 on Amazon, with free shipping and NO tax.</li>
            <li>This is my all time, hands down favorite fragrance ever.</li>
            <li>This item was bought mainly for my husband.</li>
            <li>it actually makes you feel pretty!</li>
            <li>THIS one is the real thing (then again it is directly from AMAZON).</li>
            <li>Definitely doesn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>I would have bought it for full price a long time ago</li>
            <li>Smells lovely but not that long lasting.</li>
            <li>I previously bought Pretty EDP from Macy&#x27;s and decided to buy new bottles from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;While the bottles arrived in good condition, the EDP seems diluted and does not last as long as the bottle purchased at Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I went on a hunt for a new one.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new perfume but nothing seemed to please me.</li>
            <li>It was exactly the same fragrance, packaging, etc...</li>
            <li>My all time favorite and at an unbelievable savings!</li>
            <li>Its light not strong at all</li>
            <li>I take it on trips as it uses a small space and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>While the scent is still the same nice fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last nearly as long as when previously purchased from a store.</li>
            <li>They were all too heavy, spicy or sweet.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and very sociable projection.</li>
            <li>My usual &#x27;daily&#x27; perfume is no longer available.</li>
            <li>Makes my blood boil and hers to apparently.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really purchase perfume online but after reading the other reviews I decided to give it a chance</li>
            <li>the only thing I did not like was that the seller did not ship with the box, which was kind of weird.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;goes anywhere&#x27; perfume is just right for everyday wear in the spring/summer!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> , it&#x27;s not over powering and the scent lasts really long, great value for the price, will purchase &#x27;pretty hot&#x27; as well :-)</li>
            <li> I cannot remember how much it costs at DILLARD&#x27;S, but I would think a bit more.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too sweet, or musky at all.</li>
            <li> - it is light, feminine and fresh without being too floral.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Perfume is mild and mildly sweet and musky.  </li>

            <li> Very elegant and romantic.  </li>
            <li> It’s not too sweet, nor too floral either—it reminds me of fresh rain.</li>
            <li> &quot; was her new favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great light floral scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The perfect year round fragrance - soft but not too sweet -</li>
            <li> This smells so, well, pretty!</li>
            <li> I have since ordered the large bottle on line and just ordered another large bottle for my daughter&#x27;s birthday because she fell in love with it too.</li>
            <li> It was a great price but it was missing the sprayer.</li>
            <li> Great everyday scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, its very girlie and  very feinine.  </li>
            <li> But this one is not too strong as to do that, yet it is also strong enough to be noticed.</li>
            <li> I found it for the right price and bought it.</li>
            <li> it was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I.prefer fragrances that last most of the day.</li>
            <li> Pretty is just what it is.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell quite like the Pretty</li>
            <li> Love the scent, just wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Can you justify paying that higher price?</li>
            <li> This is important to my wife because she has a sensitive nose for smells and this perfume is just that for her.</li>
            <li> I love Elizabeth Arden products, especially her fragrances.  </li>
            <li> very feminine !</li>
            <li> It is light and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for casual and not-so-casual occasions.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and soft but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Pretty from department stores in the past and loved it</li>
            <li> This perfume really does smell pretty.</li>
            <li> , it is one of my most favorites and the smell lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I tried a small bottle and loved it.</li>
            <li> It is a floral musk and very girly.</li>
            <li> This was one of them and thanks to my husband, was one of my birthday presents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very feminine perfume.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This same product is for $37.00 on Amazon, with free shipping and NO tax.</li>
            <li> This is my all time, hands down favorite fragrance ever.</li>
            <li> This item was bought mainly for my husband.</li>
            <li> it actually makes you feel pretty!</li>
            <li> THIS one is the real thing (then again it is directly from AMAZON).</li>
            <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> I would have bought it for full price a long time ago</li>
            <li> Smells lovely but not that long lasting.</li>
            <li> I previously bought Pretty EDP from Macy&#x27;s and decided to buy new bottles from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;While the bottles arrived in good condition, the EDP seems diluted and does not last as long as the bottle purchased at Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I went on a hunt for a new one.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new perfume but nothing seemed to please me.</li>
            <li> It was exactly the same fragrance, packaging, etc...</li>
            <li> My all time favorite and at an unbelievable savings!</li>
            <li> Its light not strong at all</li>
            <li> I take it on trips as it uses a small space and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li> While the scent is still the same nice fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last nearly as long as when previously purchased from a store.</li>
            <li> They were all too heavy, spicy or sweet.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and very sociable projection.</li>
            <li> My usual &#x27;daily&#x27; perfume is no longer available.</li>
            <li> Makes my blood boil and hers to apparently.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really purchase perfume online but after reading the other reviews I decided to give it a chance</li>
            <li> the only thing I did not like was that the seller did not ship with the box, which was kind of weird.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;goes anywhere&#x27; perfume is just right for everyday wear in the spring/summer!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable and a few sprays goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The large bottle is an unbelievable buy.</li>
            <li> only complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, even with layering the Pretty lotion and then the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay long either.</li>
            <li> Will be 1 of my favorites for a long time.</li>
            <li> Keeps my wife smelling &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; all year long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the only perfumes that I wear, so I know if it&#x27;s genuine or if it&#x27;s a fake, watered down version.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not last all day.</li>
            <li> Smells soft and delicate.</li>
            <li> My Mother bought this for me a few Christmases back</li>
            <li> Been wearing this daily for a few years</li>
            <li> Just as I expected and even a prettier bottle in person......</li>
            <li> It’s light and subtle, but not too delicate that it goes unnoticed.</li>
            <li> I think I read a review somewhere that you need to be careful with some perfumes you buy with AMAZON because some sellers are selling the imitation.  </li>
            <li> I tried a bunch at the local store and narrowed it down to a few fragrances.</li>
            <li> so other people must like the way it smells as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.....</li>
            <li> I have had this perfume several times but unfortunately this one I received is either a knockoff or old product.  </li>
            <li> It is not very sweet.</li>
            <li> I have to hold down a small sprayer from a different bottle to squirt it.</li>
            <li> all year round...</li>
            <li> Always gets noticed, but it not overwhelming  </li>
            <li> This is a floral without being too sickening sweet.  </li>
            <li> it smells of roses immediately, and that fades into a delicate floral.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time because I can still smell it when I put my dirty clothes in the washer.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle; not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed as it did not smell at all like my previous bottles.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell awful but there is nothing &#x27;deep&#x27; about the fragrance, it has no complexity at all.</li>
            <li> Could not go wrong with this perfume.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed for that reason.</li>
            <li> This is the worst parfume that I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great gift for my wife, both of us love the smell...</li>
            <li> This perfume is so feminine, flowery and sweet.I received a lot of compliments from my family and work place. It smell lasts for 8-12 hours. It can be worn daytime or nighttime. I would recommend this perfume .</li>
            <li> This is an amazing scent and I have received so many compliments when I am wearing it. I love to spray my hair with it and being able to smell it when my hair is blowing in my face. I highly recommend this wonderful and light scent.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  My Mother bought this for me a few Christmases back and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  I get compliments all the time.  It&#x27;s very subtle; not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Sophisticated and refreshing, I purchased this as a gift for my sister and she loves the scent, it&#x27;s not over powering and the scent lasts really long, great value for the price, will purchase &#x27;pretty hot&#x27; as well :-)</li>
            <li> honeydew loves it! As described on time</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, feminine and yes downright &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;. It is a floral musk and very girly. Mum and I share this one and both get rave reviews (loads of compliments). It is an affordable alternative to J&#x27;adore and Idylle. Lovely price and stunning scent. Long lasting and very sociable projection. Amazon has the best price anywhere and yes it is authentic! I will always love this perfume and will continue to buy it here.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I&#x27;m allergic to most perfumes... they give me headaches. But this one is not too strong as to do that, yet it is also strong enough to be noticed. I wear it every day!!</li>
            <li> My usual &#x27;daily&#x27; perfume is no longer available. So I went on a hunt for a new one. I tried a bunch at the local store and narrowed it down to a few fragrances. This was one of them and thanks to my husband, was one of my birthday presents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is light and not too sweet. It has some flower scent but not obvious. It smells nice and soft but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last. Although admittedly, you shouldn&#x27;t be able to smell your own perfume after it&#x27;s been on for awhile or you have too much on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any compliments yet on wearing it but I still like it.</li>
            <li> Packaged well on shipment and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitivity to many scents and miss being  able to wear the perfumes I used to....very nice to find this one - soft, beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! Great price!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite! very feminine perfume. Get a lot of compliments...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new perfume but nothing seemed to please me. They were all too heavy, spicy or sweet. I consulted the sales clerk for her opinion and she said \\&quot;Pretty\\&quot; was her new favorite fragrance. I tried a small bottle and loved it. The perfect year round fragrance - soft but not too sweet - and the fragrance lasts. I cannot believe how many compliments I get on it. I have since ordered the large bottle on line and just ordered another large bottle for my daughter&#x27;s birthday because she fell in love with it too. It won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!  Fresh smell!</li>
            <li> This is the worst parfume that I&#x27;ve ever bought. It doesn&#x27;t smell awful but there is nothing &#x27;deep&#x27; about the fragrance, it has no complexity at all. It doesn&#x27;t stay long either. Definitely doesn&#x27;t worth the money. ( btw the lid that you cover your parfume with is made of cheap plastic even.)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.. I get Compliment on the smell all the time love it</li>
            <li> The &#x27;goes anywhere&#x27; perfume is just right for everyday wear in the spring/summer!  Nothing but compliments when worn day or night!</li>
            <li> My husband loves the smell of this!  I like it too. :-)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume in the world! Ever since I tried it at Boston Store, I’ve been buying it over and over again. It’s light and subtle, but not too delicate that it goes unnoticed. It’s not too sweet, nor too floral either—it reminds me of fresh rain.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is aptly named... it&#x27;s a very &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; scent... all year round... but may wear this more in the summer.  Compliments too!</li>
            <li> This perfume really does smell pretty. My only complaint is that it does not last all day.</li>
            <li> Perfume was purchased as a gift for fiance and when it arrived it was exactly as described.  Could not go wrong with this perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!! It&#x27;s one of the only perfumes that I wear, so I know if it&#x27;s genuine or if it&#x27;s a fake, watered down version. This was the real deal and for a GREAT price!! I will definitely order again! Matter of fact, I&#x27;m reordering right now!! Very fast shipping also!!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite scent! It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34;. People know me by this scent....lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love IT!!!!</li>
            <li> This smells so, well, pretty! I get compliments all of the time. Its not an obnoxious scent...its light and very pleasant. You feel so pretty wearing it. :)</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mother for her birthday.  She wears this fragrance.  I paid $26.  I cannot remember how much it costs at DILLARD&#x27;S, but I would think a bit more.  GREAT for the price.  This was shipped and sold from AMAZON, so super fast shipping, and great packaging.  I think I read a review somewhere that you need to be careful with some perfumes you buy with AMAZON because some sellers are selling the imitation.  NOT this one.  THIS one is the real thing (then again it is directly from AMAZON).</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the scent and gets many compliments from women and me alike.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Downfall is it faints off to very light smell...I.prefer fragrances that last most of the day. For this reason I rate Elizabeth Arden Sunflowers &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; of all E.A. Perfumes.</li>
            <li> Its light not strong at all but it smell real good if you like strong perfume don&#x27;t buy this because its not for u</li>
            <li> You know you&#x27;ve bought the right one when you love it and you get compliments on it like I did! Just make sure you try a sample at the store first</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUME &amp; ELIZABETH ARDEN PRODUCTS, ONLINE HERE IS WAY CHEAPER THAN INSTORE LIKE HERBERGERS &amp; MACYS, I GOT LOTION, PERFUME &amp; BODY WASH PLUS ANOTHER PERFUME CHEAPER THAN I WOULD INSTORE. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT &amp; BUYER TO EVERYONE! :) SHIPMENT CAME FASTER.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite and at an unbelievable savings!</li>

            <li> Love it..... Smells great.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas.  It was on  her list and was sold at a discount. All is good.</li>
            <li> This is a light and airy fragrance.  Perfect for the summer - it lasts all day and night.  It&#x27;s perfect for casual and not-so-casual occasions.</li>

            <li> I have wanted this scent for a while. I found it for the right price and bought it. I love the scent. It lasts for a long time because I can still smell it when I put my dirty clothes in the washer.  Happy with this perchase. I would have bought it for full price a long time ago but I&#x27;m a college student, so I waited for a deal.</li>
            <li> Great product and enjoy the smell and husband does as well.</li>
            <li> Smells soft and delicate. Got many complements wearing this.</li>
            <li> I love this scent - use it all the time! I will definitely buy again when this stuff runs out</li>
            <li> Just what the wife wanted</li>
            <li> Reveived a box set which was nicer than expected-but it was a christmas item</li>
            <li> It is a perfect scent for everyday wear; it&#x27;s Beautifully light &amp; refreshing. Pretty is just what it is. Love it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell quite like the Pretty I&#x27;m used to. Still a good price and still smells good.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and packaged well. This item was bought mainly for my husband. I tried some on one day, he loved it - I thought it was just okay. I do tend to get compliments when wearing it so other people must like the way it smells as well.</li>
            <li> Great smell,  not overpowering!</li>
            <li> I have had this perfume several times but unfortunately this one I received is either a knockoff or old product.  I was extremely disappointed as it did not smell at all like my previous bottles.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, and boy was I happy to order it on here rather than head to a department store!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, its very girlie and  very feinine.  Always gets noticed, but it not overwhelming  Will be 1 of my favorites for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, just wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, so fresh and feminine. The large bottle is an unbelievable buy. I was skeptical at first.....so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite \\&quot;go to\\&quot; fragrances for day wear!  This one by Elizabeth Arden has a very pleasant fresh dainty scent which I wear often.  I love the bottle as it reminds me of my favorite signature symbol, a \\&quot;heart\\&quot;.  I take it on trips as it uses a small space and easy to pack.  I&#x27;ll purchase this again and again!</li>
            <li> This is my all time, hands down favorite fragrance ever. It isn&#x27;t too sweet, or musky at all. It&#x27;s a nice, suddle, spring-like scent that is perfect for every day use as well as special occasions. The best part is that this is a high quality product without the high pricing. It&#x27;s very affordable and a few sprays goes a long way. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love it ,love it came in the mail fast.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller recommend it</li>
            <li> I used this parfume before and I loved it. It stays for long time and smells very good. It is not very sweet.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal. Macys sells this product and the price is $65.00 for the 3.3 oz. spray, not including the tax! This same product is for $37.00 on Amazon, with free shipping and NO tax. Can you justify paying that higher price? This perfume is light scented,and not heavy to the nose, but yet a nice blend of floral, and earthy scents. This is important to my wife because she has a sensitive nose for smells and this perfume is just that for her.</li>
            <li> Very nice perfume. I have bought several bottles to give away to my mother and daughter. Great for all ages.</li>
            <li> This is a bargain. 100ml and a great price. Keeps my wife smelling &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; all year long. If you like pretty, Amazon is a great place to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love Elizabeth Arden products, especially her fragrances.  This is a floral without being too sickening sweet.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> just what she ordered</li>
            <li> love the flowery smell!</li>
            <li> I previously bought Pretty EDP from Macy&#x27;s and decided to buy new bottles from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;While the bottles arrived in good condition, the EDP seems diluted and does not last as long as the bottle purchased at Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if these bottles were diluted or counterfeits. Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.....  I get a lot of people that love the way it smells.  Both men and women compliment me when I wear this perfume.  This is my favorite perfume...</li>
            <li> Item as described. The wife loved it!</li>

            <li> Love the smell. Just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Shopped around at stores for this fragrance.  After trying and liking it, I tried finding it cheaper than the $40-$60 retail price.  As always...Amazon comes thru again!  It was exactly the same fragrance, packaging, etc...but without the price. :) Happy customer!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this perfume, it is one of my most favorites and the smell lasts a really long time. This is my 2nd bottle and it does last awhile.</li>

            <li> Long lasting scent. Very elegant and romantic.  I would buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance! It has a stunning aroma! Very lasting scent.It is a great fragrance for all ages! very feminine !My husband loves the smell.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend (and I) both LOVE this perfume - it is light, feminine and fresh without being too floral.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, even with layering the Pretty lotion and then the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I get numerous compliments on it - perfect for work as well as evenings.</li>
            <li> It was a great price but it was missing the sprayer. I have to hold down a small sprayer from a different bottle to squirt it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really purchase perfume online but after reading the other reviews I decided to give it a chance and I am happy I did it smells so pretty and feminine and lasts all day. Will purchase again the only thing I did not like was that the seller did not ship with the box, which was kind of weird.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Pretty from department stores in the past and loved it so I decided to purchase on Amazon. While the scent is still the same nice fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last nearly as long as when previously purchased from a store. I am disappointed for that reason.</li>
            <li> Great everyday scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this after smelling it on my friend one day. It is light and soft. Just wore it yesterday and my boyfriend told me I smelled good. Great addition to my mix :)</li>
            <li> loved it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait to wear it, im just waiting for a special occation&lt;br /&gt;My husband absolutely love the smell</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know.  How could I?  I&#x27;m a guy. It was a gift.  She loves it and now she loves me. Perfume is mild and mildly sweet and musky.  Makes my blood boil and hers to apparently.</li>
