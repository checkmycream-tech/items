            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>We simply love these files.  </li>
            <li>Just okay.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find them in my pharmacy anymore - glad to find them on Amazon</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love these files.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t  be better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I found these nail files.</li>
            <li>Pleased 110%.</li>
            <li>I had bought glass files from someone else, and they were much more sturdy and heavier.  </li>
            <li>I love using mine.</li>
            <li>I love glass filers over metal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to keep one in my purse, one in my nail kit at home and one at my work desk.</li>
            <li>I also think they are more sanitary than emory boards.</li>
            <li>These files work so much better than the cardboard files.</li>
            <li>Once i break these, which is inevidable, I will def buy more.</li>
            <li>The colors are cute and they came well packaged and unbroken.</li>
            <li>However I find that the Czech made files are better.</li>
            <li>I like how these files do not damage my nails and leave nice, smooth edges.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE FILES</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE FILES!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>; as most the emery board or sand paper versions do.</li>
            <li>Love these and would buy them again...</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to hunt for them :)  </li>
            <li>I love these crystal nail filers.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these files to anyone with peeling nails!!!!!</li>
            <li>Very worth the money!</li>
            <li>Price and quality wise, however, I rate them very highly!</li>
            <li>These were probably the cheapest crystal files I could find, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from them, but they are AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I can tell you that I bought one of these kinds of files a long time ago (lost it) and paid $10 for one, so this is a great deal!</li>
            <li>It leaves my nails smooth not frayed like so many others.  </li>
            <li>They shipped from Hong Kong with no problems, fast service and good packing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>Love that they come with a case to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>It does file your nails, but I don&#x27;t think it does any better then my metal emery board that can also clean under your nails.  </li>
            <li>Nice nail files, good qualtiy and will never go back to paper files</li>
            <li>These are strong, and double-sided</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and each comes in it&#x27;s own plastic sheath to protect the file.</li>
            <li>they arrived more quickly than&lt;</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and I love the way the files work on my nails.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re smooth.  </li>
            <li>The Ultimate is great for thickening brittle nails</li>
            <li>They arrived securely wrapped and undamaged.</li>
            <li>and we will be buying this brand from now on instead of those cheap emory boards.</li>
            <li>The etched glass won&#x27;t wear away (unlike some cheap Revlon or dollar-store nail files &amp; emery</li>
            <li>like how they cut, and how smoothly they work.  </li>
            <li>Overall happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>What is important is that they work.</li>
            <li>They are durable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They file so quickly and cleanly, it&#x27;s even better than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>They do a better job than metal ones and are more gentle on the nails.</li>
            <li>love the 5 pack Cheeky Crystal Nail Files I bought, they work great and don&#x27;t wear out like some of the other brands (Ulta)</li>
            <li>I get a smooth finish quickly and easily...</li>
            <li>Many years ago I had a crystal file (which wasn&#x27;t actually as nice as this, as it only provided the fine finish work) that I dropped and broke.  </li>
            <li>First set of crystal nail files which is supposed to be healthy for your nails.  </li>
            <li>They are small but make perfect stocking stuffers for friends.</li>
            <li>These are my first glass files and I love them.</li>
            <li>When I get done using the crystal file, the tips of my nails are perfectly smooth and rarely tear or catch on fine fabrics anymore.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a replacement for my beloved 8-sided nail filing block that had grits in coarse, medium, fine, etc.,</li>
            <li>but they can be expensive, these are great because the work great but are inexpensive for what they are.</li>
            <li>They file nails effortlessly, always smooth, and so quickly.  </li>
            <li>You can get pretty smooth with a light touch at the end.</li>
            <li>work great, just for me, not very durable.</li>
            <li>that said, I will remind everyone that I haven&#x27;t even had them a full hour.</li>
            <li>and I heard they are much more gentle to the nails than metal or emery boards.</li>
            <li>The hype is true.</li>
            <li>I love the way these gently file my nails.</li>
            <li>My nails are very soft and rip very easily.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no complaints about these nail files, I love them to death!!</li>
            <li>The painted on &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; quickly comes off.  </li>
            <li>Both brands file nails quickly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased one for myself earlier in the year and love it so much more than even my Revlon metal file which I have used for decades.  </li>
            <li>The colors are super.  </li>
            <li>I purchased more expensive ones and these are just as good at a MUCH better price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the first time this has EVER happened with fabulous amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I guess since it shipped from Hong Kong in a small paper bubble wrap bag in a ziploc baggie with nothing to keep the bag from bending, it&#x27;s kind of amazing that any of them made it in one piece.</li>
            <li>They are pretty and look more appealing than your standard emery board.</li>
            <li>Also they look prettier than you standard nail file, if you care about that.&lt;br /&gt;These are also an amazing price.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is you get three, so when you break one you have back ups.  </li>
            <li>They may be colorful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried two other similar products by another brand with no luck, this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using crystal nail files for some time now, and find them to be superior to other nail files.  </li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re particularly good for guys in fact because you won&#x27;t &#x27;roughen&#x27; up your girl due to inaccurate nails.</li>
            <li>I purchased these after reading and hearing good things from other nail polish addicts.</li>
            <li>They easily clean up with water and are ready for another session.</li>
            <li>It was very smart of this company to sell their files in sets of three b/c</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite nail files to use because it never dulls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had my eye on glass files for a long time, and I liked the price of this item</li>
            <li>Partnered with the glass files, you can finally grow long, beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>I figured with these, even if they didn&#x27;t file smooth, they&#x27;d be able to take on the sharp edges of my torn nails, and I could move on to the finer grained emery boards from there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work great and do not become dull after a lot of use.</li>
            <li>love mine and would not go back to anything else.</li>
            <li>and I think that they are better than the regular nail files.</li>
            <li>Will recommend to anyone that is interested in this product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more if i were to lose any</li>
            <li>I just filed my nails with these things for the first time and holy moly</li>
            <li>However, they do break if you drop them (which happened to the first one I bought years ago).  </li>
            <li>They are larger than my Revlon and much better quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them in the past but after my last one broke years ago I never replaced it and forgot how awesome they are.</li>
            <li>Sure beats using emery boards that don&#x27;t last at all anymore.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>This set of three crystal files with vinyl covers is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I normally use one of those 4-sided blocks to file my nails, but with my frequent nail-breaking they tend to get torn up real quick.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I like the feeling of filing on emery boards better, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to using them.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>They shipped in the time they said they were going to, and looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I purchased these as a gift for my mom after my dad broke her first one.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.  </li>
            <li>But if you put it in a safe place I believe these could last for years.</li>
            <li>although they seem very durable!</li>
            <li>They are better than the ones I pay $10 for at Walgreens that is ONLY single-sided.</li>
            <li>You have to be very gentle as they are no joke!&lt;br /&gt;After getting the hang of it, I really like them.  </li>
            <li>I love long nails, so this works for me allowing me to still keep my nail shape.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that they are full sized.  </li>
            <li>I certainly prefer the conventional kind.</li>
            <li>And if they don&#x27;t quite do the trick for you, they&#x27;re pretty and cheap enough that you can give them as gifts.</li>
            <li>These took a long time to come, but it was well worth the wait!!</li>
            <li>These are durable and since they&#x27;re glass and a fine texture, they don&#x27;t tear up my nails like a standard emery board or a metal file.</li>
            <li>They file so smoothly and gently and actually leave your nails shiny!</li>
            <li>I promise I&#x27;m a 100% straight guy.  </li>
            <li>I then analyzed the file for any wear and tear but found absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can find files at check out counters but they are NOT the real thing.  </li>
            <li>These files ARE the real thing.  </li>
            <li>but had expected way more.</li>
            <li>These are spreading like wildfire in my family thanks to the speed at which they can file nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with the product.</li>
            <li>Not like the real thing....</li>
            <li>these files are so gentle on the nails , yet gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>, I guess applying too much</li>
            <li>I can file my nails without worrying about it taking too much length off.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>In fact the only one I no longer have is the yellow one because my sister stole it because she liked it so much.</li>
            <li>Reasonable quality file.</li>
            <li>I think I still prefer metal files over these, but these are so cheap, I can buy enough to leave one all over the house.</li>
            <li>fun to do manicures at home and products like this one are professional and work well.</li>
            <li>Much closer and faster,</li>
            <li>Still a deal for two and free shipping, but I had plans for that third one!</li>
            <li>They are a bit thick, so tricky to get into sides/edges - but manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Great value, good quality.</li>
            <li>They file nails down quickly, but they leave the edges smooth and don&#x27;t leave that leftover bit of chewed up nail.</li>
            <li>Other crystal files cost more than these 3 for one file.</li>
            <li>The real surprise was how inexpensive they were for the high quality.</li>
            <li>While they are a grand product, I gave them four stars because they are SO thin, they break too easily.</li>
            <li>Cheeky nail files will continue to use this product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>These work so much better than any other type of nail file I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>It was a decent price for the 3 pack of crystal nail files.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend this set highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love these little files.</li>
            <li>, the nice finish they provide, and the durability (provided you do not drop them on a hard tile floor).  </li>
            <li>They are nice and thick...</li>
            <li>I live them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried metal and cheap coarse emery boards, but they always left my nails on the haggard side which lead to maddening amounts of snagging on fabrics.</li>
            <li>Crystal nail files last so long and file much faster than paper emery boards,  The only drawback is that they break if you drop them, so I&#x27;m pleased that five files are in the package.  </li>
            <li>I can file my nails very smoothly, no excessive grinding required.  </li>
            <li>They are the first nail files I have used that actual file my nails in the shape that I want without hurting or cracking my fingernails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only taking one star off because I&#x27;ve used better crystal nail files before (although much more expensive).</li>
            <li>easily rinse off the nail dust with water and dry off for the next use.</li>
            <li>The glass handles are relatively smooth and just slightly thicker than the etched part (not contoured at all), so I didn&#x27;t find it the easiest nail file to grip.  </li>
            <li>Some little areas are already smooth as glass and the etching part is gone.</li>
            <li>They are a little uncomfortable to touch (like touching stoneware, which always gives me goosebumps) but the difference between glass and anything else is astounding.  </li>
            <li>I used one of them so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them on natural nails as well as acrylic and gel, and they are still as abrasive as they started out.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice when I ordered, but this product took nearly A MONTH to arrive.</li>
            <li>So far no sign of breaking or wearing out.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap files, these are the way to go.</li>
            <li>I think they ship directly from overseas</li>
            <li>multi-sided file is unnecessary because I can do coarse filing or fine filing with these depending on pressure, AND they smooth my nail edges at the same time--</li>
            <li>Glass files make my nails much less likely to shred because they&#x27;re so fine.  </li>
            <li>They are just the right size, not to long or short.  </li>
            <li>(like no other type of file!)</li>
            <li>The Czech version is more of a matte finish, but I found it harder to grip since it&#x27;s slightly</li>
            <li>These were higher quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>It is easy to touch up a corner the minute you notice it is sharp or rough.  </li>
            <li>No rough edges like I got from metal files and emery boards, and no obsessing for a long time to get a straight tip.</li>
            <li>Not all crystal nail files are created equal, however, and these are terrific, and very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>My Czech file arrived quickly from an Amazon warehouse (beware that some sellers of the Czech files may also ship from overseas and it may take a few weeks to get).</li>
            <li>I have very hard nails, I love these files because they can be used again and again.</li>
            <li>B005EHO5WI Genuine Czech, Etched, Crystal Glass, Blue, Small (3.5\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>These are so much better for my thin brittle nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad there are three, just in case I break one, because I am so clumsy!!</li>
            <li>These files worked quick to file down my uneven, broken edges in a way similar to the coarse grain files, but also smoothed them out, so there aren&#x27;t any nail bits hanging off, just waiting to snag my favorite shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are thick, which some may consider a con, but I&#x27;m glad because I feel like they aren&#x27;t going to snap in half if I toss one in a purse.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Love these files.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t  be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I found these nail files.</li>
            <li> Pleased 110%.</li>
            <li> I had bought glass files from someone else, and they were much more sturdy and heavier.  </li>
            <li> I love using mine.</li>
            <li> I love glass filers over metal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to keep one in my purse, one in my nail kit at home and one at my work desk.</li>
            <li> I also think they are more sanitary than emory boards.</li>
            <li> These files work so much better than the cardboard files.</li>
            <li> Once i break these, which is inevidable, I will def buy more.</li>
            <li> The colors are cute and they came well packaged and unbroken.</li>
            <li> However I find that the Czech made files are better.</li>
            <li> I like how these files do not damage my nails and leave nice, smooth edges.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE FILES</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE FILES!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ; as most the emery board or sand paper versions do.</li>
            <li> Love these and would buy them again...</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to hunt for them :)  </li>
            <li> I love these crystal nail filers.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these files to anyone with peeling nails!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very worth the money!</li>
            <li> Price and quality wise, however, I rate them very highly!</li>
            <li> These were probably the cheapest crystal files I could find, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from them, but they are AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I can tell you that I bought one of these kinds of files a long time ago (lost it) and paid $10 for one, so this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> It leaves my nails smooth not frayed like so many others.  </li>
            <li> They shipped from Hong Kong with no problems, fast service and good packing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> Love that they come with a case to keep them clean.</li>
            <li> It does file your nails, but I don&#x27;t think it does any better then my metal emery board that can also clean under your nails.  </li>
            <li> Nice nail files, good qualtiy and will never go back to paper files</li>
            <li> These are strong, and double-sided</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and each comes in it&#x27;s own plastic sheath to protect the file.</li>
            <li> they arrived more quickly than&lt;</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and I love the way the files work on my nails.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re smooth.  </li>
            <li> The Ultimate is great for thickening brittle nails</li>
            <li> They arrived securely wrapped and undamaged.</li>
            <li> and we will be buying this brand from now on instead of those cheap emory boards.</li>
            <li> The etched glass won&#x27;t wear away (unlike some cheap Revlon or dollar-store nail files &amp; emery</li>
            <li> like how they cut, and how smoothly they work.  </li>
            <li> Overall happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> What is important is that they work.</li>
            <li> They are durable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They file so quickly and cleanly, it&#x27;s even better than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> They do a better job than metal ones and are more gentle on the nails.</li>
            <li> love the 5 pack Cheeky Crystal Nail Files I bought, they work great and don&#x27;t wear out like some of the other brands (Ulta)</li>
            <li> I get a smooth finish quickly and easily...</li>
            <li> Many years ago I had a crystal file (which wasn&#x27;t actually as nice as this, as it only provided the fine finish work) that I dropped and broke.  </li>
            <li> First set of crystal nail files which is supposed to be healthy for your nails.  </li>
            <li> They are small but make perfect stocking stuffers for friends.</li>
            <li> These are my first glass files and I love them.</li>
            <li> When I get done using the crystal file, the tips of my nails are perfectly smooth and rarely tear or catch on fine fabrics anymore.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a replacement for my beloved 8-sided nail filing block that had grits in coarse, medium, fine, etc.,</li>
            <li> but they can be expensive, these are great because the work great but are inexpensive for what they are.</li>
            <li> They file nails effortlessly, always smooth, and so quickly.  </li>
            <li> You can get pretty smooth with a light touch at the end.</li>
            <li> work great, just for me, not very durable.</li>
            <li> that said, I will remind everyone that I haven&#x27;t even had them a full hour.</li>
            <li> and I heard they are much more gentle to the nails than metal or emery boards.</li>
            <li> The hype is true.</li>
            <li> I love the way these gently file my nails.</li>
            <li> My nails are very soft and rip very easily.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints about these nail files, I love them to death!!</li>
            <li> The painted on &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; quickly comes off.  </li>
            <li> Both brands file nails quickly.  </li>
            <li> I purchased one for myself earlier in the year and love it so much more than even my Revlon metal file which I have used for decades.  </li>
            <li> The colors are super.  </li>
            <li> I purchased more expensive ones and these are just as good at a MUCH better price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the first time this has EVER happened with fabulous amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I guess since it shipped from Hong Kong in a small paper bubble wrap bag in a ziploc baggie with nothing to keep the bag from bending, it&#x27;s kind of amazing that any of them made it in one piece.</li>
            <li> They are pretty and look more appealing than your standard emery board.</li>
            <li> Also they look prettier than you standard nail file, if you care about that.&lt;br /&gt;These are also an amazing price.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is you get three, so when you break one you have back ups.  </li>
            <li> They may be colorful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other similar products by another brand with no luck, this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using crystal nail files for some time now, and find them to be superior to other nail files.  </li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re particularly good for guys in fact because you won&#x27;t &#x27;roughen&#x27; up your girl due to inaccurate nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after reading and hearing good things from other nail polish addicts.</li>
            <li> They easily clean up with water and are ready for another session.</li>
            <li> It was very smart of this company to sell their files in sets of three b/c</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite nail files to use because it never dulls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had my eye on glass files for a long time, and I liked the price of this item</li>
            <li> Partnered with the glass files, you can finally grow long, beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> I figured with these, even if they didn&#x27;t file smooth, they&#x27;d be able to take on the sharp edges of my torn nails, and I could move on to the finer grained emery boards from there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work great and do not become dull after a lot of use.</li>
            <li> love mine and would not go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> and I think that they are better than the regular nail files.</li>
            <li> Will recommend to anyone that is interested in this product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more if i were to lose any</li>
            <li> I just filed my nails with these things for the first time and holy moly</li>
            <li> However, they do break if you drop them (which happened to the first one I bought years ago).  </li>
            <li> They are larger than my Revlon and much better quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them in the past but after my last one broke years ago I never replaced it and forgot how awesome they are.</li>
            <li> Sure beats using emery boards that don&#x27;t last at all anymore.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> This set of three crystal files with vinyl covers is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I normally use one of those 4-sided blocks to file my nails, but with my frequent nail-breaking they tend to get torn up real quick.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I like the feeling of filing on emery boards better, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to using them.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> They shipped in the time they said they were going to, and looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift for my mom after my dad broke her first one.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors.  </li>
            <li> But if you put it in a safe place I believe these could last for years.</li>
            <li> although they seem very durable!</li>
            <li> They are better than the ones I pay $10 for at Walgreens that is ONLY single-sided.</li>
            <li> You have to be very gentle as they are no joke!&lt;br /&gt;After getting the hang of it, I really like them.  </li>
            <li> I love long nails, so this works for me allowing me to still keep my nail shape.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that they are full sized.  </li>
            <li> I certainly prefer the conventional kind.</li>
            <li> And if they don&#x27;t quite do the trick for you, they&#x27;re pretty and cheap enough that you can give them as gifts.</li>
            <li> These took a long time to come, but it was well worth the wait!!</li>
            <li> These are durable and since they&#x27;re glass and a fine texture, they don&#x27;t tear up my nails like a standard emery board or a metal file.</li>
            <li> They file so smoothly and gently and actually leave your nails shiny!</li>
            <li> I promise I&#x27;m a 100% straight guy.  </li>
            <li> I then analyzed the file for any wear and tear but found absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can find files at check out counters but they are NOT the real thing.  </li>
            <li> These files ARE the real thing.  </li>
            <li> but had expected way more.</li>
            <li> These are spreading like wildfire in my family thanks to the speed at which they can file nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with the product.</li>
            <li> Not like the real thing....</li>
            <li> these files are so gentle on the nails , yet gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> , I guess applying too much</li>
            <li> I can file my nails without worrying about it taking too much length off.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> In fact the only one I no longer have is the yellow one because my sister stole it because she liked it so much.</li>
            <li> Reasonable quality file.</li>
            <li> I think I still prefer metal files over these, but these are so cheap, I can buy enough to leave one all over the house.</li>
            <li> fun to do manicures at home and products like this one are professional and work well.</li>
            <li> Much closer and faster,</li>
            <li> Still a deal for two and free shipping, but I had plans for that third one!</li>
            <li> They are a bit thick, so tricky to get into sides/edges - but manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Great value, good quality.</li>
            <li> They file nails down quickly, but they leave the edges smooth and don&#x27;t leave that leftover bit of chewed up nail.</li>
            <li> Other crystal files cost more than these 3 for one file.</li>
            <li> The real surprise was how inexpensive they were for the high quality.</li>
            <li> While they are a grand product, I gave them four stars because they are SO thin, they break too easily.</li>
            <li> Cheeky nail files will continue to use this product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> These work so much better than any other type of nail file I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> It was a decent price for the 3 pack of crystal nail files.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend this set highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these little files.</li>
            <li> , the nice finish they provide, and the durability (provided you do not drop them on a hard tile floor).  </li>
            <li> They are nice and thick...</li>
            <li> I live them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried metal and cheap coarse emery boards, but they always left my nails on the haggard side which lead to maddening amounts of snagging on fabrics.</li>
            <li> Crystal nail files last so long and file much faster than paper emery boards,  The only drawback is that they break if you drop them, so I&#x27;m pleased that five files are in the package.  </li>
            <li> I can file my nails very smoothly, no excessive grinding required.  </li>
            <li> They are the first nail files I have used that actual file my nails in the shape that I want without hurting or cracking my fingernails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only taking one star off because I&#x27;ve used better crystal nail files before (although much more expensive).</li>
            <li> easily rinse off the nail dust with water and dry off for the next use.</li>
            <li> The glass handles are relatively smooth and just slightly thicker than the etched part (not contoured at all), so I didn&#x27;t find it the easiest nail file to grip.  </li>
            <li> Some little areas are already smooth as glass and the etching part is gone.</li>
            <li> They are a little uncomfortable to touch (like touching stoneware, which always gives me goosebumps) but the difference between glass and anything else is astounding.  </li>
            <li> I used one of them so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them on natural nails as well as acrylic and gel, and they are still as abrasive as they started out.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice when I ordered, but this product took nearly A MONTH to arrive.</li>
            <li> So far no sign of breaking or wearing out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap files, these are the way to go.</li>
            <li> I think they ship directly from overseas</li>
            <li> multi-sided file is unnecessary because I can do coarse filing or fine filing with these depending on pressure, AND they smooth my nail edges at the same time--</li>
            <li> Glass files make my nails much less likely to shred because they&#x27;re so fine.  </li>
            <li> They are just the right size, not to long or short.  </li>
            <li> (like no other type of file!)</li>
            <li> The Czech version is more of a matte finish, but I found it harder to grip since it&#x27;s slightly</li>
            <li> These were higher quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> It is easy to touch up a corner the minute you notice it is sharp or rough.  </li>
            <li> No rough edges like I got from metal files and emery boards, and no obsessing for a long time to get a straight tip.</li>
            <li> Not all crystal nail files are created equal, however, and these are terrific, and very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> My Czech file arrived quickly from an Amazon warehouse (beware that some sellers of the Czech files may also ship from overseas and it may take a few weeks to get).</li>
            <li> I have very hard nails, I love these files because they can be used again and again.</li>
            <li> B005EHO5WI Genuine Czech, Etched, Crystal Glass, Blue, Small (3.5\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> These are so much better for my thin brittle nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad there are three, just in case I break one, because I am so clumsy!!</li>
            <li> These files worked quick to file down my uneven, broken edges in a way similar to the coarse grain files, but also smoothed them out, so there aren&#x27;t any nail bits hanging off, just waiting to snag my favorite shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are thick, which some may consider a con, but I&#x27;m glad because I feel like they aren&#x27;t going to snap in half if I toss one in a purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used one of these so far, as the other two will be gifts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a crystal nail file; I was surprised at how sharp they are.  </li>
            <li> Somehow, they never seem to last long enough</li>
            <li> Another reason to buy is that these files leave nails smoother than a normal file, they feel less harsh on the nail, and they work faster than a normal nail file.</li>
            <li> I have feeling these will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Previously I had bought similar product from a major H&amp;B chain at several times the cost of this.</li>
            <li> The only slight problem I have with them is that they are kind of thick, which can make it hard to get the sides of my nails.</li>
            <li> Last a lifetime as long as you don&#x27;t loose them.  </li>
            <li> another long wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping took an incredibly long time, and that&#x27;s the only thing that makes me hesitant to order another set, but that was mostly due to my impatience and anticipation to try the product.</li>
            <li> I keep my nails long and am probably mildly obsessed with keeping them clean and well groomed, so keeping files on me are a must.</li>
            <li> They are sharp at the end and are made of glass, so they should definitely be stored with care and kept away from kids.</li>
            <li> These files, although not terribly gritty, file the edges of nails to a glassy smoothness not achievable with other types of files.</li>
            <li> Just took a VERY long time to get them.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not about to try and scratch them with something harder to see their durability, but I&#x27;d highly recommend at least &#x27;crystal&#x27; files to everyone.  </li>
            <li> I wish one of the sides was less coarse to use for finishing, but they remove a lot of nail in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Cheeky files came from overseas and were just taped together and shipped in a bubble envelope with a little extra bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li> and they all come in little individual plastic sleeves.</li>
            <li> They came just in time for me though, as I&#x27;d just earlier in the day broken another nail, and my poor little block had already lost most of it&#x27;s coarseness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure they&#x27;re &#x27;crystal&#x27; given their origin and price, but at least regular sand blasted glass.  </li>
            <li> I tried to be particularly rough on the file too.  </li>
            <li> Also used it to file off some rough edges and hang nails around my nail.  </li>
            <li> Grit is rough and wears off.  Would not reorder.</li>
            <li> I had bought some where the rough parts wears off.</li>
            <li> Also, they got here weeks sooner than the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ll last very long.  </li>
            <li> No comparison to any other nail file on the market.</li>
            <li> I would recomend them to other people.</li>
            <li> (i.e. Rougher at one end than the other)</li>
            <li> I got these because I was tired of grinding through an entire regular file every time I cut my nails</li>
            <li> Even though they appear cheaper than conventional ones they are breakable.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t appreciate how the typical ones flexed all over the place</li>
            <li> files arrived in half the time amazon estimated (about a month).</li>
            <li> I carry one with me wherever I go, and the others I keep hidden away</li>
            <li> The Cheeky is about 50% thicker (about 3/32\\&quot;), heavier, and may be a tad less fragile.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Each file has a protective sleeve, unlike the set I purchased previously.</li>
            <li> and it broke in half.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the crystal nail files for a long time, but finally decided to try them.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t leave all those little shreds on the end of my nails.</li>
            <li> It did take a little while to arrive here, but they warned me when I purchased them this would be the case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still thin enough to get between the nail and sides of your finger though.  </li>
            <li> but that is not important.</li>
            <li> I just wish they were a little thinner, but they still work and get the job done!</li>
            <li> Very sorry I spent the several dollars it cost.</li>
            <li> I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> so it took a bit longer than usual</li>
            <li> (I have really hard nails).  </li>
            <li> This should not have been so hard.</li>
            <li> had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In common to both:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> no catching or spurs.</li>
            <li> The files are about 3mm thick and don&#x27;t flex at all.  </li>
            <li> These leave a dried powder of your nail behind.</li>
            <li> I have thick fingernails and these work wonders.</li>
            <li> The files are so thick you might as well use a branch from a tree.</li>
            <li> I was pretty shocked when I got my order email and the estimated delivery date was a month out!</li>
            <li> I clip my nails, and file the rough bits because I hate they way they feel on cloths, sheets, other fabrics and fleshy places.  </li>
            <li> I have had these files for months now and not one of them has broken, and I file my nails at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Sharp without cutting the skin.</li>
            <li> I have weak brittle nails</li>
            <li> Dropped on floor, broke in half (dangerous).  </li>
            <li> I have thin crappy peeling nails</li>
            <li> and I was never happy with the results of using them anyway.  </li>
            <li> Because I can&#x27;t stand to see them use an emory board or worse</li>
            <li> The texture and shape were all wrong</li>
            <li> Mainly I am shocked by the poor customer service.</li>
            <li> Too bad it was the prettiest one that broke.</li>
            <li> I accidentally broke it and was so frustrated</li>
            <li> used to hate filing my nails because I hated the nails-on-chalkboard feeling.</li>
            <li> and it was awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> glad i have these files!</li>
            <li> Best nail files ever.  Last a lifetime as long as you don&#x27;t loose them.  Great gift idea to put in as an added gift bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I love mine and would not go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and got them WAY before delivery date.  First great surprise. Then I shared them with work friends, so I bought another set.  This time I bought a set of 3 because I want to keep them on hand.  They are double sided and wonderful.  I had a glass nail file years ago and just dropped it and broke it at work before I ordered these.  Couldn&#x27;t find them in stores close to me.</li>
            <li> I found this item on Amazon. This nail fine is the best file I have ever used.  It leaves my nails smooth not frayed like so many others.  I purchased several to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> The nail files were a very good product.  they arrived more quickly than&lt;br /&gt;anticipated.  also a very good price and I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> Glass files are the best. They never wear out and you can wash them if you share with someone  else</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and good quality</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. I just wish they were a little thinner, but they still work and get the job done! Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Great nail file!  Sharp without cutting the skin.</li>
            <li> Took a month to ship, but it&#x27;s coming from China to Florida so that&#x27;s not too surprising. Just opened them 30 minutes ago and I&#x27;m already in love. They file so quickly and cleanly, it&#x27;s even better than what I was expecting. No rough edges like I got from metal files and emery boards, and no obsessing for a long time to get a straight tip. They also came wrapped in bubble wrap inside a padded envelope, and they were all in perfect condition. They are thick, which some may consider a con, but I&#x27;m glad because I feel like they aren&#x27;t going to snap in half if I toss one in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I will remind everyone that I haven&#x27;t even had them a full hour. I don&#x27;t imagine any problems will arise, but if something does come up I&#x27;ll definitely come back and update this review.</li>
            <li> These are the good ones that everyone loved as Christmas stocking stuffers!  I will get more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using crystal nail files for some time now, and find them to be superior to other nail files.  Not all crystal nail files are created equal, however, and these are terrific, and very inexpensive.  It&#x27;s great to have extras because they can break if you drop them.</li>
            <li> The files work well and look really cute. I keep one of the files in my purse for convenience. The files haven&#x27;t slid out of their case and scratched anything in my purse &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Love the files. Just took a VERY long time to get them. I did use points from my credit card to pay, so this may have had something to do with the shipping time. I can tell you that I bought one of these kinds of files a long time ago (lost it) and paid $10 for one, so this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> the price for these awesome nail files is too good to be true - took a while to ship and I didn&#x27;t see they were coming from China - I may purchase more for Christmas gifts even though I didn&#x27;t not want to ship from over seas</li>
            <li> Great colors, I love them. I used one of them so far and it seems quite good. I got to know the glass nail files just recently and I think that they are better than the regular nail files. Will recommend to anyone that is interested in this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite nail files to use because it never dulls. I have one in my car, one in the living room and one in my bedroom. I will definitely purchase more if i were to lose any</li>
            <li> These are great for the price. They are thicker than most files I&#x27;ve used but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me at all. Love that they come with a case to keep them clean. Very worth the money!</li>
            <li> I promise I&#x27;m a 100% straight guy.  I clip my nails, and file the rough bits because I hate they way they feel on cloths, sheets, other fabrics and fleshy places.  I got these because I was tired of grinding through an entire regular file every time I cut my nails (I have really hard nails).  I also don&#x27;t appreciate how the typical ones flexed all over the place either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched Amazon for the cheapest highest rated files.  My gosh these are good.  I&#x27;m not so sure they&#x27;re &#x27;crystal&#x27; given their origin and price, but at least regular sand blasted glass.  The files are about 3mm thick and don&#x27;t flex at all.  Seem like they&#x27;ll hold up to some pressure, but I didn&#x27;t try to break them.  I just filed my nails with these things for the first time and holy moly they&#x27;re smooth.  I tried to be particularly rough on the file too.  I then analyzed the file for any wear and tear but found absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity as it&#x27;s only been one day and I&#x27;m not about to try and scratch them with something harder to see their durability, but I&#x27;d highly recommend at least &#x27;crystal&#x27; files to everyone.  I think they&#x27;re particularly good for guys in fact because you won&#x27;t &#x27;roughen&#x27; up your girl due to inaccurate nails.</li>
            <li> Love the crystal nail files...they never dull and work great!  However, they do break if you drop them (which happened to the first one I bought years ago).  This set is perfect in case one breaks and the price was right!</li>
            <li> You can find files at check out counters but they are NOT the real thing.  The painted on &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; quickly comes off.  These files ARE the real thing.  Truly ground glass surface.  Best nail files.</li>
            <li> It takes about five weeks to receive the items, but they do tell you that upfront.  I bought Revlon glass files at $8 for one.  Cheeky is around $6 for three of them.  I was surprised that they are full sized.  They are larger than my Revlon and much better quality.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy these again. Glass files give smoother filing.  I discovered that my nails were being chewed up with emery boards and metal files.  You won&#x27;t have that problem with these.  I would also recommend LA Colors nail hardeners.  They have a nail hardener and an Ultimate Nail Hardener.  The Ultimate is great for thickening brittle nails like I have.  The only hardener I ever found that works.  It&#x27;s like an acrylic coating.  Partnered with the glass files, you can finally grow long, beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> I read rave reviews about this and decided to give it a try. I find them okay but had expected way more. I certainly prefer the conventional kind. These leave a dried powder of your nail behind. Even though they appear cheaper than conventional ones they are breakable. I won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
            <li> I waited almost a  month for these and they never arrived.  However, once I contacted the seller, after some discussion, she resent the item...another long wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I did receive the item and I appreciate the sellers integrity, but it was a lot of work for $5!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The files are good quality, and I can recommend them at this price, with an honest seller.</li>
            <li> These work great! I have thick fingernails and these work wonders. No comparison to any other nail file on the market.</li>
            <li> This product stands up to its name.Delivery was quick and I love the way the files work on my nails.I highly recommend these files to anyone with peeling nails!!!!!</li>
            <li> love these. Never been one for filing my nails before, but these do the job perfectly. one for each car and one for my purse yay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a crystal nail file everywhere! I&#x27;ve used them in the past but after my last one broke years ago I never replaced it and forgot how awesome they are. I bought a crystal file from a local beauty shop because it was the only physical store nearby carrying them and it was awful! The texture and shape were all wrong so I decided to give up looking in stores and buy one online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These files are perfect and effective. I have thin crappy peeling nails and I read that crystal files are supposed to keep them from peeling because they seal the end of your nail as you file. Love love love! And a great price for 3 files!</li>
            <li> It was very smart of this company to sell their files in sets of three b/c it is too tempting to give one away... which leads to more and more people buying them, lol.  These are spreading like wildfire in my family thanks to the speed at which they can file nails, the nice finish they provide, and the durability (provided you do not drop them on a hard tile floor).  Many years ago I had a crystal file (which wasn&#x27;t actually as nice as this, as it only provided the fine finish work) that I dropped and broke.  I&#x27;ve had my eyes out for a replacement ever since and am very happy with these.</li>
            <li> Can carry them on an airplane.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I have given them to friends &amp; would recommend them to everyone.  Sure beats using emery boards that don&#x27;t last at all anymore.</li>
            <li> These are a nice set.  They are just the right size, not to long or short.  The colors are pretty and each comes in it&#x27;s own plastic sheath to protect the file. I&#x27;m very please with the product.</li>
            <li> It was a decent price for the 3 pack of crystal nail files. They work but I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ll last very long.  Some little areas are already smooth as glass and the etching part is gone.</li>
            <li> glass? breaks. Dropped on floor, broke in half (dangerous).  I use sandpaper instead.</li>
            <li> These are great files! It was nice to have 3 of them. I put 1 in my purse, 1 in my nail polish container at home and 1 in the bathroom. They work great and do not become dull after a lot of use.</li>
            <li> I love these nail files. They are pretty and look more appealing than your standard emery board. They also work quite well, filing nails in seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wasting money on nail files for years.  Somehow, they never seem to last long enough and I was never happy with the results of using them anyway.  These nail files are amazing.  I can file my nails very smoothly, no excessive grinding required.  No chipping afterwards, either.  I wish I bought these years ago.</li>
            <li> These nail files are wonderful.  While they are a grand product, I gave them four stars because they are SO thin, they break too easily.</li>
            <li> They look just like the picture and do a good job. I wish one of the sides was less coarse to use for finishing, but they remove a lot of nail in a hurry. You can get pretty smooth with a light touch at the end.</li>
            <li> I have never used nail files that worked so well. My nails were filed to perfection within minutes. Would definitely recommend this product.  The files themselves are a nice weight and not flimsy at all. Also used it to file off some rough edges and hang nails around my nail.  Worked great.</li>
            <li> I use these files all the time.  I live them.  I have weak brittle nails</li>
            <li> Good grit consistency for finger and toe nails.  easily rinse off the nail dust with water and dry off for the next use.</li>
            <li> These are great!  I&#x27;ve used them on natural nails as well as acrylic and gel, and they are still as abrasive as they started out.  They are nice and thick...no concern to me of them snapping during use like some of the really thin ones available.  It&#x27;s still thin enough to get between the nail and sides of your finger though.  I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> This set of three crystal files with vinyl covers is exactly as pictured. They arrived securely wrapped and undamaged. I have never used this type of file before and I heard they are much more gentle to the nails than metal or emery boards. It&#x27;s true! My nails are already growing longer from using these. The only downside to this product? I did not notice when I ordered, but this product took nearly A MONTH to arrive. I guess it ships from China. I was pretty shocked when I got my order email and the estimated delivery date was a month out! So, if you are looking for this product in a hurry, this is NOT the place to go. Price and quality wise, however, I rate them very highly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a crystal nail file; I was surprised at how sharp they are.  I&#x27;m used to metal and ceramic which are horrid in comparison; having to &amp;#34;saw&amp;#34; at the nail - no need with these.  You have to be very gentle as they are no joke!&lt;br /&gt;After getting the hang of it, I really like them.  They are a bit thick, so tricky to get into sides/edges - but manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Great value, good quality.</li>
            <li> These are WONDERFUL!!  I love them and so does my daughter.  I&#x27;ll be ordering them again for gifts!</li>
            <li> the files never arrived.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know what happened.&lt;br /&gt;they were ordered quite some time ago.&lt;br /&gt;this is the first time this has EVER happened with fabulous amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally disdappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I know you will look into it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for always being there for your customers.&lt;br /&gt;barbara smith</li>
            <li> We recieved the nail files today.  They are great. I would recomend them to other people.They do a better job than the metal ones.</li>
            <li> I love crystal nail files but they can be expensive, these are great because the work great but are inexpensive for what they are. Be forewarned tho they are crystal nail files which means they are glass, so they can break easy but file your nails to perfection!</li>
            <li> I normally use one of those 4-sided blocks to file my nails, but with my frequent nail-breaking they tend to get torn up real quick. I&#x27;ve also tried metal and cheap coarse emery boards, but they always left my nails on the haggard side which lead to maddening amounts of snagging on fabrics. I figured with these, even if they didn&#x27;t file smooth, they&#x27;d be able to take on the sharp edges of my torn nails, and I could move on to the finer grained emery boards from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The files arrived in half the time amazon estimated (about a month). As noted in the description/other reviews, they come in somewhat flimsy feeling plastic sheaths. They came just in time for me though, as I&#x27;d just earlier in the day broken another nail, and my poor little block had already lost most of it&#x27;s coarseness. These were probably the cheapest crystal files I could find, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from them, but they are AMAZING! I have to say, I like the feeling of filing on emery boards better, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to using them. These files worked quick to file down my uneven, broken edges in a way similar to the coarse grain files, but also smoothed them out, so there aren&#x27;t any nail bits hanging off, just waiting to snag my favorite shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence with these, do yourself a favor and just go for it! And if they don&#x27;t quite do the trick for you, they&#x27;re pretty and cheap enough that you can give them as gifts.</li>
            <li> I ordered Cheeky nail files about a month ago. They are the first nail files I have used that actual file my nails in the shape that I want without hurting or cracking my fingernails. I really love this product. Cheeky nail files will continue to use this product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> These took a bit of time to arrive from China, but were in perfect shape.  They work very nicely, and the price is great.  Since they are breakable, however, I would not recommend if used around children.  Otherwise, I recommend 100%!</li>
            <li> These are the best nail files.  You can sterilize them and they don&#x27;t chip your nails when you file.</li>
            <li> We simply love these files.  I gave one to my mom and my dad even likes it so we ordered a five pack and we will be buying this brand from now on instead of those cheap emory boards.</li>
            <li> The product itself is super awesome, price was a steal comparatively.  I will never buy regular files again, I am a glass file convert.  The company purchased from took about 4! months to get them to me!</li>
            <li> Great set. I keep one at home, in my purse and at work. One of them did break, but that was on me. I love glass nail files!</li>
            <li> This was the file I was looking for. A glass file smooths out beautifully. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Not like the real thing....do not work well.</li>
            <li> Just okay.  Grit is rough and wears off.  Would not reorder.</li>
            <li> Crystal nail files last so long and file much faster than paper emery boards,  The only drawback is that they break if you drop them, so I&#x27;m pleased that five files are in the package.  I can&#x27;t find them in my pharmacy anymore - glad to find them on Amazon</li>
            <li> These files are amazing, strong, and beautiful. I carry one with me wherever I go, and the others I keep hidden away so others don&#x27;t get any ideas about usin&#x27; &#x27;em. ;) They work well and are lightweight, not heavy like I would have expected them to be. They shipped in the time they said they were going to, and looks exactly as pictured. Great item!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Ordering more. Crystal nail files are the way to go. They have their individual carrying case so they will not be damaged. Awesomeness!</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift for my mom after my dad broke her first one. She loves them! I think she may even let my dad have one of is own :)</li>
            <li> Love these files.  Couldn&#x27;t  be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I found these nail files. They are inexpensive and they work beautifully. They don&#x27;t leave all those little shreds on the end of my nails. They are sharp at the end and are made of glass, so they should definitely be stored with care and kept away from kids.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after reading and hearing good things from other nail polish addicts. The hype is true. These files, although not terribly gritty, file the edges of nails to a glassy smoothness not achievable with other types of files. I keep one in a pencil holder on my desk, along with all of my pens, and its held up well to being jostled around constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took an incredibly long time, and that&#x27;s the only thing that makes me hesitant to order another set, but that was mostly due to my impatience and anticipation to try the product.</li>
            <li> This set of Cheeky crystal nail files, and the very similar Czech crystal file [[ASIN:B005EHO5WI Genuine Czech, Etched, Crystal Glass, Blue, Small (3.5\\&quot;) Manicure Nail File-Perfect fot Purse or Travel]], are the best nail files I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In common to both:&lt;br /&gt;*  The etched glass won&#x27;t wear away (unlike some cheap Revlon or dollar-store nail files &amp; emery boards).&lt;br /&gt;*  Both brands file nails quickly.  Front &amp; back are etched the same, but the grain is a bit rougher towards the handle &amp; smoother towards the tip.  The Cheeky files have a similar grain variation but are a bit rougher overall than the Czech file.&lt;br /&gt;*  Crystal nail files are a bit thicker than metal nail files.  This Czech file is about 1/16\\&quot;.  The Cheeky is about 50% thicker (about 3/32\\&quot;), heavier, and may be a tad less fragile.&lt;br /&gt;*  The glass handles are relatively smooth and just slightly thicker than the etched part (not contoured at all), so I didn&#x27;t find it the easiest nail file to grip.  The Czech version is more of a matte finish, but I found it harder to grip since it&#x27;s slightly thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these Cheeky files, I got a set of 3 for about the same price as one of the Czech files (your price may vary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that it matters, but the Cheeky version has a Cheeky brand logo printed on the handle; there is no logo on the Czech file (just a printed \\&quot;Made in Czech Republic\\&quot; label on the plastic sleeve).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cheeky files came from overseas and were just taped together and shipped in a bubble envelope with a little extra bubble wrap.  My Czech file arrived quickly from an Amazon warehouse (beware that some sellers of the Czech files may also ship from overseas and it may take a few weeks to get).</li>
            <li> I have used crystal nail files before, but lost mine.  My husband saw these and ordered them for me.  I didn&#x27;t know how convenient it would be to have three.  I keep one in the bathroom, one in the TV room, and one in my purse.  Always handy the minute I need it.  I do my nails and my husband Dave&#x27;s.  We both definitely give them 5 stars.  They file nails effortlessly, always smooth, and so quickly.  It is easy to touch up a corner the minute you notice it is sharp or rough.  The real surprise was how inexpensive they were for the high quality.</li>
            <li> My search for an inexpensive but good quality glass nail file has ended!  And now I am treating all my friends to one of these.  Because I can&#x27;t stand to see them use an emory board or worse (gasp) a metal file!</li>
            <li> Just received these in the mail and I love them! I purchased more expensive ones and these are just as good at a MUCH better price! Thank you Amazon! I will never go back to using regular nail files. These are so much better for my thin brittle nails. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase these!</li>
            <li> I purchased one for myself earlier in the year and love it so much more than even my Revlon metal file which I have used for decades.  They make the nail smoother .  I bought 6 of these for stocking stuffers for next Christmas.  Of course, I&#x27;ll have to find them in December!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great crystal nail file. One of the best I&#x27;ve ever had. It was a great buy and i recommend it to anyone that likes crystal nail files.</li>
            <li> These work so much better than any other type of nail file I&#x27;ve used! No torn up, peeling nails anymore. They shipped from Hong Kong with no problems, fast service and good packing. So far no sign of breaking or wearing out. My nails are very soft and rip very easily. When I get done using the crystal file, the tips of my nails are perfectly smooth and rarely tear or catch on fine fabrics anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had my eye on glass files for a long time, and I liked the price of this item so I tried it.  I love it!  Glass files make my nails much less likely to shred because they&#x27;re so fine.  They are a little uncomfortable to touch (like touching stoneware, which always gives me goosebumps) but the difference between glass and anything else is astounding.  It did take a little while to arrive here, but they warned me when I purchased them this would be the case.</li>
            <li> these files are so gentle on the nails , yet gets the job done.I appreciate the different colors letting me know which texture each one is before i pick it up..</li>
            <li> Wife loves them. Now grandaughter loves them also, as for her birthday gift. 2 sets. Pleased 110%. Proud to say I ordered them. Would advise to anyone looking. Thanks.  (AGAIN-3rd set),, great quality, worth the wait,,!! thanks</li>
            <li> Glass files have proven to be very fragile, too fragile for my family.&lt;br /&gt;I like how they cut, and how smoothly they work.  I have had them break while filing, I guess applying too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work great, just for me, not very durable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great set of files. I keep one in every place - in my purse, in my travel bag, in my bedroom... I love the quality, and the colors are great. For sure, I recommend this!</li>
            <li> First set of crystal nail files which is supposed to be healthy for your nails.  I like that I can file my nails without worrying about it taking too much length off.  I love long nails, so this works for me allowing me to still keep my nail shape.  No ridges when I file.  Pretty colors.  I have feeling these will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have only used one of these so far, as the other two will be gifts.  I had bought glass files from someone else, and they were much more sturdy and heavier.  These don&#x27;t feel the same way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.  They are small but make perfect stocking stuffers for friends. The colors are super.  I love using mine.</li>
            <li> Nice nail files, good qualtiy and will never go back to paper files</li>
            <li> I had bought some where the rough parts wears off. These don&#x27;t. I love glass filers over metal. Only I will use. These are cheap but the quality is great! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> The files are so thick you might as well use a branch from a tree. Very sorry I spent the several dollars it cost. I do rate the seller&#x27;s communication A+. Prior to receiving my purchase, I wanted to know where the order was because it had been weeks in transit. They informed me that the shipment was coming from Asia which I did not know it was coming from out of the country.</li>
            <li> I purchased these nail files for my husband and myself.  We both like them.  They are effective in filing our nails without breaking the nails.</li>
            <li> These nail files are amazing. I had been looking for a replacement for my beloved 8-sided nail filing block that had grits in coarse, medium, fine, etc., but once I got these files, I officially stopped looking.&lt;br /&gt;A multi-sided file is unnecessary because I can do coarse filing or fine filing with these depending on pressure, AND they smooth my nail edges at the same time--so no ragged edges! Just perfectly shaped nails every time.</li>
            <li> Good quality files. Each file has a protective sleeve, unlike the set I purchased previously. I recommend this set highly.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice set of nail files.  I bought these as a Christmas present for my daughter in law.  I have been using mine for over a year and they still do an excellent job of keeping my nails smooth and shaped.</li>
            <li> These were higher quality than I expected. I like the gradient effect (i.e. Rougher at one end than the other) and I also think 3 is the perfect number. I&#x27;m able to keep one in my purse, one in my nail kit at home and one at my work desk. Overall happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is you get three, so when you break one you have back ups.  It does file your nails, but I don&#x27;t think it does any better then my metal emery board that can also clean under your nails.  If you want to try a crystal file this is a good test.  It was inexpensive and you have back ups for when you drop one and it breaks.</li>
            <li> I have very hard nails, I love these files because they can be used again and again. I also think they are more sanitary than emory boards.</li>
            <li> Love the files -- they work really great &amp; it&#x27;s nice that they each come with their own slip cover.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These files work so much better than the cardboard files. They&#x27;re cute too! Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap files, these are the way to go.</li>
            <li> I love these little files. They file really nice and they all come in little individual plastic sleeves. Once i break these, which is inevidable, I will def buy more.</li>
            <li> These are my first glass files and I love them. They file nails down quickly, but they leave the edges smooth and don&#x27;t leave that leftover bit of chewed up nail. The colors are cute and they came well packaged and unbroken. The only slight problem I have with them is that they are kind of thick, which can make it hard to get the sides of my nails. But in a way the thickness is nice because they&#x27;re sturdy. Also, they got here weeks sooner than the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> These are very good files, and they do a better job than emery files. However I find that the Czech made files are better.</li>
            <li> I love the way these gently file my nails. I get a smooth finish quickly and easily...no catching or spurs.</li>
            <li> These nail files are great! The only reason I am giving it a four is because they are quite fragile.</li>
            <li> I have had these files for months now and not one of them has broken, and I file my nails at least once a week. This is not to say you want this file to be the one you carry in your purse. But if you put it in a safe place I believe these could last for years. In fact the only one I no longer have is the yellow one because my sister stole it because she liked it so much. Also they look prettier than you standard nail file, if you care about that.&lt;br /&gt;These are also an amazing price. Other crystal files cost more than these 3 for one file. Another reason to buy is that these files leave nails smoother than a normal file, they feel less harsh on the nail, and they work faster than a normal nail file. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Although I may not be an expert on nail files, I know what I like and I like these. They may be colorful but that is not important. What is important is that they work. They easily clean up with water and are ready for another session. I like these nail files and so will you.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the crystal nail files for a long time, but finally decided to try them.  They are the BEST!  They work well, and leave my nails nice and smooth and perfectly shaped. I also like that you can use these in a side-to-side motion, rather than just the single-direction motion of a regular emory board.</li>
            <li> Nail files didn&#x27;t make it in one piece, all 3 were broke upon arrival.  If you buy these, get the 5 pack that ships from the US!  For some reason, the 3 pack comes from overseas...no wonder they didn&#x27;t make it!&lt;br /&gt;I love the 5 pack Cheeky Crystal Nail Files I bought, they work great and don&#x27;t wear out like some of the other brands (Ulta) I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Nice files-a bit thinner than some I&#x27;ve purchased elsewhere.  I like how these files do not damage my nails and leave nice, smooth edges.  Warning-do not drop them!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE FILES&lt;br /&gt;They are the best nail files I have ever had in my life. I like that its a 3 pack as well. i have one in my purse, one with all my nail stuff and another in my car for emergencies!</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. I&#x27;m only taking one star off because I&#x27;ve used better crystal nail files before (although much more expensive). But this is amazing for the price and you&#x27;re getting 3!!! I have one at home one at the office and one in my handbag at all times!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other similar products by another brand with no luck, this one is perfect. I keep one at home, one in the car, and one in my purse.</li>
            <li> These took a long time to come, but it was well worth the wait!! I LOVE THESE FILES!!&lt;br /&gt;I used to hate filing my nails because I hated the nails-on-chalkboard feeling. I don&#x27;t get that with these files! They file so smoothly and gently and actually leave your nails shiny! They are durable and easy to clean. I&#x27;m glad there are three, just in case I break one, because I am so clumsy!! They come with a sheath to protect them, which is good. I have absolutely no complaints about these nail files, I love them to death!!</li>
            <li> Reasonable quality file. Does not &amp;#34;put my teeth on edge&amp;#34; as most the emery board or sand paper versions do. I think I still prefer metal files over these, but these are so cheap, I can buy enough to leave one all over the house.</li>
            <li> fun to do manicures at home and products like this one are professional and work well. Love these and would buy them again...although they seem very durable!</li>
            <li> Previously I had bought similar product from a major H&amp;B chain at several times the cost of this. Cheeky&#x27;s product is identical and comes at a fraction of the cost. I think they ship directly from overseas so it took a bit longer than usual but nevertheless the package arrived and turned out to be a very good deal. These crystal nail files are the best.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a crystal nail file last year and I fell in love with it.  I accidentally broke it and was so frustrated so I searched Amazon and found Cheeky.  I bought the set of 3 and they are wonderful.  In fact, I had to share one with my mom and one with my sisterfriend.  I will definitely have to get another set because I like to have one in several places so I don&#x27;t have to hunt for them :)  Great product.  They do a wonderful job of filing!  (like no other type of file!)</li>
            <li> I have been using glass nail files for years.  All of a sudden, I could not find them in the stores.  Don&#x27;t know why.  They do a better job than metal ones and are more gentle on the nails.</li>
            <li> Great file but it broke.  Since it was a smaller size I carried it in my purse and it broke in half.</li>
            <li> Every woman should have one of these. They leave your nail edges very smooth, which is a very good thing.</li>
            <li> I love these crystal nail filers. They are better than the ones I pay $10 for at Walgreens that is ONLY single-sided. These are strong, and double-sided</li>
            <li> Need I say more? I guess I will to meet the word requirements. I keep my nails long and am probably mildly obsessed with keeping them clean and well groomed, so keeping files on me are a must. These are durable and since they&#x27;re glass and a fine texture, they don&#x27;t tear up my nails like a standard emery board or a metal file.</li>
            <li> These files may be great but I have yet to find out. I ordered them two months ago and they have yet to arrive. Of course I have bought files in the meantime so I no longer need these. I emailed the company to ask what happened and they said the files were held up in Customs. (I could have just gone to Target! Much closer and faster, but oh well...) I was told to wait another 14 days and then contact Customer Service again if they still had not arrived. I responded, asking to just cancel the order and they said I could not - but I could return them at my expense. These are just nail files. This should not have been so hard. Mainly I am shocked by the poor customer service.</li>
            <li> I guess since it shipped from Hong Kong in a small paper bubble wrap bag in a ziploc baggie with nothing to keep the bag from bending, it&#x27;s kind of amazing that any of them made it in one piece. Too bad it was the prettiest one that broke. The colors did not match the description (I got green, blue, and orange) but that didn&#x27;t matter much. Still a deal for two and free shipping, but I had plans for that third one! Bummer.</li>
