            <li>One squirt lasts all day and it is fresh crisp scent.</li>
            <li>Subtle beautiful feminine smell.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li>My fiance is very particular about her perfume, she likes a sweet soft smell.</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old and was looking for something not overwhelming to wear on a daily basis, and this fits me perfectly.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>

            <li>I really like this fragrance.</li>
            <li>It stays on well and is light enough to wear all year.</li>
            <li>Like it on her as much as she does.</li>
            <li>The only other perfume she wears is Chanel Chance, but she liked this just as much.</li>
            <li>I have mild allergic reactions to the vast majority of perfumes out there, but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all</li>
            <li>THIS IS A FRESH SMELLING FRAGRANCE WITH LASTING SMELL THROUGH THE DAY OR NIGHT.</li>
            <li>and they smell exactly the same, bottles a decent size ....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same one I purchased in Monroe,LA...</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for my 22-year old SIL and she loves it!  </li>
            <li>I love it didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because i&#x27;m not sure of the value... and</li>
            <li>but the top can sometimes be hard to pull off.</li>
            <li>I bought one for each of my sisters as gifts and they were so surprised, so</li>
            <li>This was the only place I could find this particular perfume, seeing as how it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had just a tiny hint of vanilla to help complete and blend it the perfume</li>
            <li>As with many other perfumes, when I transitioned from my other perfume to this one, I did experience a minor skin burn on my neck, however it has gone away.</li>
            <li>and so much less expensive one happy bargain shopper</li>
            <li>I could believe how cheaply I got this either considering its usually over $55 in stores!</li>
            <li>The scent last so long on me which is hard to find, perfumes don&#x27;t stick with me for more than a hour, but this does.</li>
            <li>The product I received is not long lasting as parfums should be.</li>

            <li> This is one my favorite perfumes, the bottle my only complaint is I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my bottle</li>
            <li> the scent was long lasting.</li>
            <li> mmmm, Poppy.&lt;br /&gt;(doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> A squirt goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a little bit of a &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; smelling perfume (as in, for a younger person).  </li>
            <li> Product itself was as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to check out the other scents for her.</li>
            <li> like so may other fragrances do.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe the notes dead on but it&#x27;s not all floral notes.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this scent as I do not like overly powdery scents or heavy scents.</li>
            <li> Not cheap to purchase this.  </li>
            <li> So I was a little sketchy about buying something I&#x27;m not able to see.</li>

I paid extra for expidited shipping so it would arrive on time and was very happy that it did! It was packed well and arrived in perfect shape. She was very excited and happy with this surpise. It was a wonderful transaction. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this scent.</li>
            <li> I have 2 sisters and we all just LOVE this fragrance.  I bought one for each of my sisters as gifts and they were so surprised, so please I hope you continue to carry this.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this fragrance.  I have mild allergic reactions to the vast majority of perfumes out there, but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all AND it&#x27;s a lovely scent : )</li>
            <li> I got this because my aunt was wearing it and it smelled amazing very pleasant and flowery but not over the top where you will get natious or migraines which the both of us tend to get easily well migraines , anyway she told me it was this one so eager I looked it up found it on amazon and it had great reviews well I am now one of those great reviewers ! This perfume smells amazing not per powering at all lasts a good while :) I got plenty of compliments on it and the price is great as well, the quality is perfect came safely bubble wrapped and inside its proper coach box and it is no where near a fake 100% real my aunt got hers at Macys and I got mine here and they smell exactly the same, bottles a decent size ....botttom line of you like floral sweet fragrances then this one is for you :)</li>
            <li> A squirt goes a long way. To over powering for me, wont purchase again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23, I bought it for my mom for Christmas...but I almost kept it for myself. I usually wear Can Can by Paris, so this is sort of a similar flavor. It&#x27;s just a sweet, pretty smell. Fairly priced too.</li>
            <li> My fiance is very particular about her perfume, she likes a sweet soft smell. The only other perfume she wears is Chanel Chance, but she liked this just as much.</li>
            <li> I bought this as one of the many Christmas presents from a recommendation and the wifey LOVES it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to check out the other scents for her.</li>
            <li> I got this for a birthday gift and I was supposed to get it either on February 24-sometime in March and I got right in time on February 25th for my BIRTHDAY :))) LOVE IT!! It&#x27;s bigger than the one that I bought from a retail store and it was 50 dollars.</li>
            <li> great, I love the way that I smell every time I smell me...  really scratch the screen and smell me .</li>
            <li> Love the perfume and the way it smells. Received in very short time. Only problem was the price. I found out after the purchase it was on sale in a lot of stores because either they are discontinuing it or redesigning the packaging.</li>
            <li> This was the only place I could find this particular perfume, seeing as how it was discontinued. I got it for my fiancé and she absolutely loved it. Came in the box and everything is legit including the smell. Most defiantly would buy from them again :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and had wanted to.purchase it from.local department store but didn&#x27;t want to pay 80.00 I&#x27;m.soo glad to have found it here and so much less expensive one happy bargain shopper</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A BIRTHDAY GIFT; SHE LOVED IT. THIS IS A FRESH SMELLING FRAGRANCE WITH LASTING SMELL THROUGH THE DAY OR NIGHT.</li>
            <li> Buying perfume online can often be a gamble, but I am very happy about this purchase. I am 21 years old and was looking for something not overwhelming to wear on a daily basis, and this fits me perfectly. It&#x27;s light, girly and playful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipper and a great product. This is by far one of my very favorite every season scents. The scent last so long on me which is hard to find, perfumes don&#x27;t stick with me for more than a hour, but this does.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of the Coach poppy flower. Liked this perfume because it is lightly scented. Wears nicely-not over powering.</li>
            <li> You know you&#x27;ve bought the right one when you love it and you get compliments on it like I did! Just make sure you try a sample at the store first!</li>
            <li> Very frustrated ! I have prime and did not get this product for ten days .... Product itself was as expected.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance for a great price. I like the scent because it does not bring on a migraine like so may other fragrances do.  One squirt lasts all day and it is fresh crisp scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product in local stores and being a parfum the scent was long lasting. The product I received is not long lasting as parfums should be. I don&#x27;t know why the difference from local products but I would not purchase on line again. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> the product just doesn&#x27;t last on your body or clothes. in 1 hour tops, its mostly gone. cute bottle, but would expect more from coach. especially considering its a perfume, not eau de toilette.</li>
            <li> Perfume smells great. But I have a leaking bottle and it cannot be returned because it is considered flammable. I would think twice before buying perfume online.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> So I was a little sketchy about buying something I&#x27;m not able to see. But my fianc&amp;eacute; does all the time so I did my homework and read the reviews and it seemed like a good buy so I took a chance and I must say that she is thourghly pleased with it. It came in the box and smells just the way it used to in the store. If not sure if your wanting to buy its def. a good deal.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing. Im 20 years old and love it. My mom and sister both like it too and we all have different tastes!</li>
            <li> Love the sweet smell!</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend loved it</li>
            <li> This perfume is the perfect smell for summer. Floral and sweet, but not too strong. Would def recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my perfume! It&#x27;s the exact same one I purchased in Monroe,LA... Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This is all my sister wanted for Christmas and I got it for her. She loves, loves, loves it! Subtle beautiful feminine smell.</li>
            <li> Good price, shipping was quick. Receiver of the gift loved it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and the receiver was thrilled so how could it not be a 5-star?!  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved it and looking forward to ordering again in the very near future.  Thank you for excellent service !</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong scent and this seller doesn&#x27;t do exchanges or returns. This one is TOO FLORAL</li>
            <li> I had tried this out in Macy&#x27;s back in November and I fell in love. I waited till I found a decent price on amazon because a lot of stores wanted outrageous prices for it. I can&#x27;t describe the notes dead on but it&#x27;s not all floral notes. It&#x27;s not weak nor is it strong. This is one my favorite perfumes, the bottle my only complaint is I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my bottle but the top can sometimes be hard to pull off. If you ever want to get an idea about notes and reviews about perfumes try out websites specially for perfumes where people review them. Any of you wondering where I got mine from, I ordered mine from FragranceNet. It was a legit that I got sent AND the bottle came in a box wrapped and I got two free samples with my order and a free handheld mirror. I&#x27;m very happy with with my purchase and I hope you try it out for yourselves!</li>
            <li> As Homer Simpson would say... mmmm, Poppy.&lt;br /&gt;(doesn&#x27;t last very long. wears off after four-ish hours. But a lovely, light and fresh scent.)</li>
            <li> I love this! It is very flowery and girly which is nice when you want to add a touch of flirtatiousness to a lock. I just wish it had just a tiny hint of vanilla to help complete and blend it the perfume, i think it would have been better if they had done that ,but oh well. It can be very strong so don&#x27;t use to much btw! I really love this though, its great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my 22-year old SIL and she loves it!  It&#x27;s definitely a little bit of a &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; smelling perfume (as in, for a younger person).  It&#x27;s nice and light, but she says the scent stays with her all day.</li>
            <li> Price was very good for the size.  I am a fan of this scent as I do not like overly powdery scents or heavy scents.</li>
            <li> Love LOVE this perfume! very feminine and light - perfect for spring and summer and a floral that is young and fresh. (not old lady flowers :o)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 23 year out daughter for Christmas in 2011 and she loved this fragrance and swears by it to all her friends.</li>
            <li> I like how quick u get ur orders and that they will email u to see if u have got ur order.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance. It stays on well and is light enough to wear all year. I could believe how cheaply I got this either considering its usually over $55 in stores!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what my wife wanted. The fragrance is very nice. Like it on her as much as she does.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a nice, summer scent. I absolutely fell in love with Coach Poppy Flower.</li>
            <li> I love it didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because i&#x27;m not sure of the value... and packaging was not great just came in the bottle wrapped in bubble wrap no box. as shown in the pic.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells absolutely wonderful. I get compliments all the time. As with many other perfumes, when I transitioned from my other perfume to this one, I did experience a minor skin burn on my neck, however it has gone away. I love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, new for me.  I had used the same cologne for years and needed a change.  I ordered one bottle online and it broke in my hands, the merchant was awesome and gave me a full refund.  Not cheap to purchase this.  I got this offer thru amazon and grabbed it.  Love it :)  Price was good.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas and hopefully it will be everything she wished for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife on Christmas.  It has a lovely smell, however its nicely balanced as it is not too strong and over powers you.  A sweet scent, like light jasmine.  We tried it out at the mall, and it was ten dollars cheaper on Amazon.  All in all, if the smell is to your taste and you don&#x27;t mind waiting a couple of days to get it this is the best way to go as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Came just today. Packaging was very nice, like new and OMG smells so good! I will DEFINITELY be purchasing this again before the bottle runs out! No complaints here! &amp;lt;3</li>
