            <li>I tried a couple of others before trying the Batiste Brunette, but wasn&#x27;t really impressed...</li>
            <li>All of those products are great!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great service!</li>
            <li>I love this product!!!</li>

            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>This product works great and you don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it.  </li>
            <li>It smells great...</li>

            <li>Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>My daughter borrowed it and loved it too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that it isn&#x27;t good for the hair to shampoo every day, so when I have to skip shampoos I use this product</li>
            <li>Then I brush and it looks and smells good.</li>
            <li>Geared towards being gender neutral, so it would be good for guys,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good thing!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions (imperative!), and use it sparingly at each section I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I even went out to the pool in the hot Florida sun and it held up perfectly!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The price is great and the product works wonderfully on my fine, prone to greasiness hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, is cheap</li>
            <li>I never had an issue with the Batiste bottle clogging, the smell is nice and it does its job.</li>
            <li>It smells so nice and blends in well.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice too and for $6 it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>I really liked it, but when I ran out I couldn&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE.  </li>
            <li>Works great, smells good, inexpensive and it really saves you.  </li>
            <li>kind of like a sexy perfume.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>, although the scent is not unpleasant, it isn&#x27;t really pleasant either.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice, too... not too strong.</li>
            <li>It did not make my hair look any better.</li>
            <li>Love that it matches my hair color</li>
            <li>None works better than Batiste.</li>
            <li>I figured this would be better because of the brunette tone.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This is officially my favorite beauty product of all time.</li>
            <li>I  thaught it would but need to give it more time.</li>
            <li>and I was impressed with them for getting back to me and working with me.</li>
            <li>but I like the smell of this better.</li>
            <li>It does exactly that, it sprays BROWN powder EVERYWHERE!!!</li>
            <li>Batiste&#x27;s Dry Shampoo for Brunette hair was perfect for me; encouraged by many excellent reviews, I decided to buy it, looking for it to provide one key factor-</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good too.  </li>
            <li>This is the best, inexpensive dry shampoo spray I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a brunette color dry shampoo and this one is perfect!  </li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Not the best solution for dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get the right shade :) This company got a hold of me from my last review (seeing that I wasn&#x27;t happy with this shade) and said they would give me a refund.</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re looking for a product for getting rid of grease, that is easy and quick to use, and is great for traveling, I would definitely recommend this spray can of perfection. :)</li>
            <li>The scent is fabulous and I like</li>
            <li>It claims but for really light brown.</li>
            <li>Why do you think it is so cheap?</li>
            <li>I had originally used PSSSSST for Brunettes after finding it in Ulta.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews and finding a dry shampoo for brunettes</li>
            <li>But still love the product in general :)  </li>
            <li>I got this because I was having surgery and knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wash my hair very often during my recovery.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you are a brunette just stick to white sprays and rub it in good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a good and cheap dry shampoo for brunettes!</li>
            <li>, the color is correct for dark hair, and it works great for those days I have to bolt, with no time to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for dark hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this stuff !</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair dry the next day and feels great!</li>
            <li>Natural hair was better, but I&#x27;m still having success with it.</li>
            <li>It does rub off on your towel when you&#x27;re rubbing it in, but it comes right out in the wash.</li>
            <li>It drys almost instantly, and left me with great results.</li>
            <li>I love how this spray makes my hair feel clean and light again after it&#x27;s gone limp for a while.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work as it should, it really smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Love the low cost too!</li>
            <li>Not as great as T3 when covering roots between colorings, but as long as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair gray or white, i&#x27;m all for it.</li>
            <li>I love the actual effect</li>
            <li>I will pay more and go back to Bumble &amp; Bumble.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I finally found this one.</li>
            <li>If I am going to spend extra moolah on a specialized product, I want it to be better than baby powder.</li>
            <li>but after I run my fingers through it, it&#x27;s pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>Also , after having this shampoo sitting in a drawer for a few months the strong smell it used to have is not as strong anymore.</li>
            <li>It is OK as a dry shampoo</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hair gets greasy so fast</li>
            <li>It still has a light, white tint once it&#x27;s on my hair</li>
            <li>: I upgraded the rating to 3 stars because after I died my hair to really light brown (almost blonde)</li>
            <li>While it says it&#x27;s for brunettes, it doesn&#x27;t seem much different to me than the original spray.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much but its just not enough product to last me even a month!  </li>
            <li>the the Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Dry Shampoo, but still noticeable.</li>
            <li>I normally had oily hair after 18 hours.  </li>
            <li>I normally shampoo every day.  </li>
            <li>It does leave a little residue but this is one of the best dry shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried for dark hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands of dry shampoo and this is head and shoulders above the rest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried four or five expensive dry shampoos and this is the best of them all!</li>
            <li>This product is better than non-colored dry shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t leave a white spray that you have to rub away in your hair.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every other day and this works just fabulously at getting rid of any oily shine in my hair and adding volume as well.  </li>
            <li>so it blended it fine with my dark hair.</li>
            <li>I have very oily/greasy hair and have had to shampoo daily my whole life.</li>
            <li>It just made it smell funny and feel very coarse.</li>
            <li>This erases it completely!</li>
            <li>It really excels itself when you need instant revitalisation.</li>
            <li>and this stuff completely solves the problem.</li>
            <li>After using this product I went 3 whole days using it only once each morning.  </li>
            <li>the white powdery residue doesn&#x27;t show as much.</li>
            <li>so I thought wow, spray brown</li>
            <li>I have used Bumble &amp; Bumble frequently and thought I would save some money and try Batiste.  </li>
            <li>Now I will try what I should have in the first place: Pssst brunette dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I also found with other products that as the day progressed the fresh feel started to fade and my hair would start to get oily again.</li>
            <li>If only I would have had this in high school....</li>
            <li>The aerosol really gets the dry shampoo into the roots.  </li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time on hair that was 2 days dirty and looking pretty gross, thinking that SURELY it wouldn&#x27;t make my hair presentable enough for the work day.  </li>
            <li>This smells nice and works well--it doesn&#x27;t dull my hair as much as some other dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I was in love the T3 dry shampoo, but due to it no longer being produced and the rising cost of what&#x27;s left on the market for T3, i decided to try other brands.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, I decided then to dye my hair a little darker brown, and I just have to work with it a little more to get it to blend.</li>
            <li>On the rare occasion that a little white is left over, I just use a bit of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as directed</li>
            <li>Most don&#x27;t work on dark hair because you end up with your hair appearing dull and gray.</li>
            <li>I just spray it in, mess it up a little, and lightly comb.</li>

            <li> so I thought wow, spray brown</li>
            <li> I have used Bumble &amp; Bumble frequently and thought I would save some money and try Batiste.  </li>
            <li> Now I will try what I should have in the first place: Pssst brunette dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I also found with other products that as the day progressed the fresh feel started to fade and my hair would start to get oily again.</li>
            <li> If only I would have had this in high school....</li>
            <li> The aerosol really gets the dry shampoo into the roots.  </li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time on hair that was 2 days dirty and looking pretty gross, thinking that SURELY it wouldn&#x27;t make my hair presentable enough for the work day.  </li>
            <li> This smells nice and works well--it doesn&#x27;t dull my hair as much as some other dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I was in love the T3 dry shampoo, but due to it no longer being produced and the rising cost of what&#x27;s left on the market for T3, i decided to try other brands.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, I decided then to dye my hair a little darker brown, and I just have to work with it a little more to get it to blend.</li>
            <li> On the rare occasion that a little white is left over, I just use a bit of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as directed</li>
            <li> Most don&#x27;t work on dark hair because you end up with your hair appearing dull and gray.</li>
            <li> I just spray it in, mess it up a little, and lightly comb.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with Salon Graphix brunette dry shampoo to compare to Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s version and this one barely stacks up.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly but after it dried it left an ugly white/grayish very fine powder on my roots.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost ten different types of dry shampoos and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Wanted to use another product than Pssst dry hair shampoo only because of the white powder residue it leaves.</li>
            <li> My intention was to purchase this product to not only serve as a dry shampoo but also to help cover my gray hairs as my coloring grows out.</li>
            <li> I have thinning dark brown hair that clumps up and leaves little bald spots on the top of my scalp whenever it gets the least bit oily.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look like it left a brown residue, but when I wiped my previously clean face off with toilet paper, it looked like I had tried to apply fake tanner.</li>
            <li> When I found this product I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be any different, but I was WRONG!</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue buying this, I&#x27;ll just buy the deep dark brown shade instead.</li>
            <li> and it still left slight white streaks.</li>
            <li> As a 13 year old girl, I barely have time to wash my hair in the mornings before school, and I can never really be bothered late at night before I eventually go to sleep.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have that white flaky build up like other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I was definitely happier with this product over the other dry shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li> This bottle gave me everything I wanted in a dry shampoo: it remove all signs of oily scalp and de-greased the hair; gave me a freshly-washed look.  </li>
            <li> but now I can go every 3 days when using this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Dry Shampoo for brunettes for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Batiste dry shampoo for some time now.  </li>
            <li> the spray spout on every dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried would clog up ocassionally.  </li>
            <li> Because I have dark hair this tinted formula doesn&#x27;t show up in the form of a white powder on my hair.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money, there is barely any color in it.  </li>
            <li> I guess there is not much to say about a stick of dry shampoo, its fairly dry.</li>
            <li> See my review on the same product in BLACK...</li>
            <li> So i would suggest spraying this just outside of your bathroom so you can escape back into your bathroom to get past the cloud of residual..stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark brown hair because other dry shampoos I have used spray white powder....</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands of dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still a little bit lighter than my hair, but it wasn&#x27;t obvious.  </li>
            <li> Still goes to hair a grayish color just like other non-tinted dry shampoos</li>
            <li> I had hoped to spruce my hair up enough for a ponytail, but it worked so well that I ended up wearing it down!  </li>
            <li> This product is not really for brunettes as  </li>
            <li> It is a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and I had to wet my head to make the streaks go away.</li>
            <li> Other products seem to require you to use a lot of product to get the same result as a little bit of Batiste.</li>
            <li> It looked flat, grayish, coarse and dull.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> So this is the wrong color for my hair--I have to get the deep dark brown--it is definitely the cheapest option out there for brunettes--other dry shampoos will leave your hair streaky white or gray but this blends in with your hair color.</li>
            <li> One other thing...</li>
            <li> Make any other choice and it will be an improvement over this product.</li>
            <li> and I do like the smell, but it does nothing for volume or blending in with a dark hair color.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, and even with the color in this</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and</li>
            <li> I would take off another star for this, except that it makes sense it would do this since it is made specifically for dark hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> My baby powder does this, but costs WAY less.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to get black.  </li>
            <li> What a mess.</li>
            <li> i purchased this because a dry shampoo i had previously used had made my hair appear dull.</li>
            <li> After trying TresEmme&#x27;s awful version of a dry shampoo, I did a little more research and found this product, specifically for brunettes.</li>
            <li> I wasted almost 10 bucks for this junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My other dry shampoo is just too expensive, so I decided to try this brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to love it, but unfortunately it was just a bad smelling spray.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the size of the container just isn&#x27;t enough.  </li>
            <li> I have found it to leave very little residue and adds a lot of volume.</li>
            <li> Although it does dull the shine</li>
            <li> but it can be hard sometimes to keep the product from showing up in your hair.  </li>
            <li> That was the reason I bought it, so I can hardly complain about it.</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> They even know it sucks!</li>
            <li> To make matters worse my hair didn&#x27;t smell or feel any cleaner.</li>
            <li> I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bumble and Bumble (way too expensive) and Psssssst (clogs up often)</li>
            <li> I was sadly mistaken.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> gave it 3 stars instead of one or two because it did soak up the oil and did not make my hair feel too weird -</li>
            <li> I followed instructions and shook it like crazy to no avail.  </li>
            <li> noticeable was how dirty it made my face after applying it.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t as bad</li>
            <li> although there was a noticeable difference in texture, it just wasn&#x27;t a bad</li>
            <li> bad color, spray delivery, smell, appearance on your hair.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> just hate the powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed by this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Worst product out there....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried almost ten different types of dry shampoos and this is one of my favorites. Because I have dark hair this tinted formula doesn&#x27;t show up in the form of a white powder on my hair. It smells great and it absorbs oil and adds volume. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Batiste&#x27;s Dry Shampoo for Brunette hair was perfect for me; encouraged by many excellent reviews, I decided to buy it, looking for it to provide one key factor- eliminating greasy looking hair! As a 13 year old girl, I barely have time to wash my hair in the mornings before school, and I can never really be bothered late at night before I eventually go to sleep. It really excels itself when you need instant revitalisation. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a product for getting rid of grease, that is easy and quick to use, and is great for traveling, I would definitely recommend this spray can of perfection. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to love it, but unfortunately it was just a bad smelling spray. It did not make my hair look any better. It just made it smell funny and feel very coarse. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Amazing Stuff!  This bottle gave me everything I wanted in a dry shampoo: it remove all signs of oily scalp and de-greased the hair; gave me a freshly-washed look.  A little goes a long way.  It lasts all day and even the next!  Love the low cost too!</li>
            <li> Ordered this item after I read the reviews, but didn&#x27;t like it. It didn&#x27;t work for me. The color didn&#x27;t work on my hair as well as I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> This product works great and you don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it.  It soaks up the oil in your hair so you can go an extra day or two without washing!!  Love that it matches my hair color so I don&#x27;t have that white flaky build up like other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> This smells nice and works well--it doesn&#x27;t dull my hair as much as some other dry shampoos.  I&#x27;d give it a five except the spray doesn&#x27;t come out that brown (this may be a plus for some).</li>
            <li> After trying TresEmme&#x27;s awful version of a dry shampoo, I did a little more research and found this product, specifically for brunettes. It smells great... kind of like a sexy perfume. It drys almost instantly, and left me with great results. I would highly recommend! The only thing is, I decided then to dye my hair a little darker brown, and I just have to work with it a little more to get it to blend. Natural hair was better, but I&#x27;m still having success with it. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried the all - Furterer, Blandi, Suave, Tres Semme and paid a lot of money. None works better than Batiste. Other products seem to require you to use a lot of product to get the same result as a little bit of Batiste. I also found with other products that as the day progressed the fresh feel started to fade and my hair would start to get oily again.With Batiste it lasts all day with the same result. I even went out to the pool in the hot Florida sun and it held up perfectly! I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> I was definitely happier with this product over the other dry shampoos I have tried. Most don&#x27;t work on dark hair because you end up with your hair appearing dull and gray. Although it does dull the shine, the color is correct for dark hair, and it works great for those days I have to bolt, with no time to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of dry shampoo and this is head and shoulders above the rest. You can&#x27;t beat the price and it works so well. My hair gets greasy so fast and this stuff completely solves the problem. It&#x27;s also great for adding volume to hairstyles even if you don&#x27;t need to combat grease.</li>
            <li> Works great.  The aerosol really gets the dry shampoo into the roots.  I normally had oily hair after 18 hours.  After using this product I went 3 whole days using it only once each morning.  I probably could have even gone longer.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands of dry shampoo.  This stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  I have found it to leave very little residue and adds a lot of volume. It smells pretty good too.  Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! Keeps my hair dry the next day and feels great! I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> My wife used this product and she was happy with it. I have nothing negative to say about it. I guess there is not much to say about a stick of dry shampoo, its fairly dry.</li>
            <li> This is the best, inexpensive dry shampoo spray I have used. It smells really nice, too... not too strong. While it says it&#x27;s for brunettes, it doesn&#x27;t seem much different to me than the original spray. It still has a light, white tint once it&#x27;s on my hair but after I run my fingers through it, it&#x27;s pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> I was in love the T3 dry shampoo, but due to it no longer being produced and the rising cost of what&#x27;s left on the market for T3, i decided to try other brands. I never had an issue with the Batiste bottle clogging, the smell is nice and it does its job. Not as great as T3 when covering roots between colorings, but as long as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair gray or white, i&#x27;m all for it.</li>
            <li> My other dry shampoo is just too expensive, so I decided to try this brand. Even though it says brunette, it&#x27;s kinda white. The scent is fabulous and I like that it&#x27;s not sticky (if sprayed from the correct distance).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed by this shampoo. After reading all the great reviews and finding a dry shampoo for brunettes I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. I followed the instructions exactly but after it dried it left an ugly white/grayish very fine powder on my roots. Yuck! To make matters worse my hair didn&#x27;t smell or feel any cleaner. While it did remove some of the oil, it didn&#x27;t add any volume and didn&#x27;t smell any fresher than before. It looked flat, grayish, coarse and dull. I wasted almost 10 bucks for this junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I upgraded the rating to 3 stars because after I died my hair to really light brown (almost blonde) the white powdery residue doesn&#x27;t show as much. This product is not really for brunettes as  It claims but for really light brown. Also , after having this shampoo sitting in a drawer for a few months the strong smell it used to have is not as strong anymore.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was having surgery and knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wash my hair very often during my recovery. I&#x27;ve been using it even after regaining all shower privileges, because it works wonders on my hair. I have thinning dark brown hair that clumps up and leaves little bald spots on the top of my scalp whenever it gets the least bit oily. I used to have to wash my hair every day to prevent this from happening but now I can go every 3 days when using this dry shampoo. I just spray it in, mess it up a little, and lightly comb. The oily clumps are gone. Because it is colored it even helps mask my thinning spots and makes my hair look thicker. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Bumble and Bumble (way too expensive) and Psssssst (clogs up often) Dry Shampoo for brunettes for years.  This one has almost no color and no powdery substance at all to absorb any scalp oils.  It is a total waste of money.  The only thing that comes out turns silvery white on a newspaper after it dries, with maybe a hint of color.  I followed instructions and shook it like crazy to no avail.  It did not soak up any scalp oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a brunette color dry shampoo and this one is perfect!  It smells so nice and blends in well.  It does rub off on your towel when you&#x27;re rubbing it in, but it comes right out in the wash.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this.  The price is great and the product works wonderfully on my fine, prone to greasiness hair.  I plan to make this a staple in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> See my review on the same product in BLACK... this is a waste of money. Bumble &amp; Bumble or Tresemme is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried four or five expensive dry shampoos and this is the best of them all! Smells great, doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky and the brown tint is a great idea! That way it doesn&#x27;t look like i have white  powder all over my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> Wanted to use another product than Pssst dry hair shampoo only because of the white powder residue it leaves. I love the actual effect just hate the powder. I figured this would be better because of the brunette tone. I was sadly mistaken. This stuff actually makes my hair greasier. Not kidding. It sucks. Why do you think it is so cheap? They even know it sucks! Now I will try what I should have in the first place: Pssst brunette dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does not leave a white powder look to your roots or scalp. It lasted longer than a competitive brand I tried. My daughter borrowed it and loved it too. You may want to buy one for each brunette female in the house.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with Salon Graphix brunette dry shampoo to compare to Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s version and this one barely stacks up.  To say it&#x27;s colored is a stretch.  It is OK as a dry shampoo and I do like the smell, but it does nothing for volume or blending in with a dark hair color.  I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much but its just not enough product to last me even a month!  I wash my hair every other day and this works just fabulously at getting rid of any oily shine in my hair and adding volume as well.  The only bad thing is the size of the container just isn&#x27;t enough.  But still love the product in general :)  oh, and don&#x27;t inhale this stuff at all, because you&#x27;ll end up coughing up brown dye, all day. So i would suggest spraying this just outside of your bathroom so you can escape back into your bathroom to get past the cloud of residual..stuff. in the air.</li>
            <li> I love how this spray makes my hair feel clean and light again after it&#x27;s gone limp for a while. The smell is nice too and for $6 it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark brown hair because other dry shampoos I have used spray white powder....so I thought wow, spray brown...fantastic! I was so wrong. It does exactly that, it sprays BROWN powder EVERYWHERE!!! On my hands, clothes, ugh. What a mess. Don&#x27;t buy this if you are a brunette just stick to white sprays and rub it in good.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time on hair that was 2 days dirty and looking pretty gross, thinking that SURELY it wouldn&#x27;t make my hair presentable enough for the work day.  I had hoped to spruce my hair up enough for a ponytail, but it worked so well that I ended up wearing it down!  Very pleased with the results.  I have dark brown hair, and even with the color in this it&#x27;s still a little bit lighter than my hair, but it wasn&#x27;t obvious.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this stuff !</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money, there is barely any color in it.  I bought it to cover gray roots.  I have used Bumble &amp; Bumble frequently and thought I would save some money and try Batiste.  It&#x27;s true, you get what you pay for.  I will pay more and go back to Bumble &amp; Bumble.  Their product give excellent coverage to gray roots.</li>
            <li> This product is better than non-colored dry shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t leave a white spray that you have to rub away in your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Batiste dry shampoo for some time now.  I love it but it can be hard sometimes to keep the product from showing up in your hair.  Since I am a brunette the colored product is the perfect solution!  All the benefits of the shampoo and no worries about it showing.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells good, inexpensive and it really saves you.  I have dark hair and this spray works well in my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue after I spray.  I even reccomended this spray to my hair dresser!</li>
            <li> I had originally used PSSSSST for Brunettes after finding it in Ulta.  I really liked it, but when I ran out I couldn&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE.  I tried a couple of others before trying the Batiste Brunette, but wasn&#x27;t really impressed...they would do in a rush as opposed to not having anything else to use. When I found this product I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be any different, but I was WRONG! Not only does it work as it should, it really smells nice.  If you follow the instructions (imperative!), and use it sparingly at each section I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be happy with it.  I have oily hair, and when necessary (ocasionally) I can go up to three days without shampooing.  I normally shampoo every day.  I&#x27;ve read that it isn&#x27;t good for the hair to shampoo every day, so when I have to skip shampoos I use this product and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good thing!  OH!  One other thing...the spray spout on every dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried would clog up ocassionally.  This one is no different.  When you&#x27;re finished using it wash the spout before storing the can...</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good and cheap dry shampoo for brunettes! I am so glad that I finally found this one. It is no surprise that it is of the Batiste line. All of those products are great!</li>
            <li> This is officially my favorite beauty product of all time. I have very oily/greasy hair and have had to shampoo daily my whole life. This erases it completely! Now I don&#x27;t have to shampoo but a couple times a week. I just spray my roots and comb through with my fingers and voila! The grease/oil is gone! It smells great too. If only I would have had this in high school.... I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like I  thaught it would but need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> I sweat in my sleep and my hair gets oily at times. My answer to this has been to put a bit of baby powder in my hair and then go to sleep. The baby powder does leave white residue, but it evens out while I sleep. Then I brush and it looks and smells good. On the rare occasion that a little white is left over, I just use a bit of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as directed and it still left slight white streaks. They weren&#x27;t as bad the the Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Dry Shampoo, but still noticeable. My baby powder does this, but costs WAY less. If I am going to spend extra moolah on a specialized product, I want it to be better than baby powder. The spray DID NOT even out as I slept and I had to wet my head to make the streaks go away. Brushing helped only slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, although the scent is not unpleasant, it isn&#x27;t really pleasant either. Geared towards being gender neutral, so it would be good for guys, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars instead of one or two because it did soak up the oil and did not make my hair feel too weird - although there was a noticeable difference in texture, it just wasn&#x27;t a bad difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also noticeable was how dirty it made my face after applying it. It didn&#x27;t look like it left a brown residue, but when I wiped my previously clean face off with toilet paper, it looked like I had tried to apply fake tanner. I would take off another star for this, except that it makes sense it would do this since it is made specifically for dark hair. That was the reason I bought it, so I can hardly complain about it. I will just wash my face after each application.</li>
            <li> So this is the wrong color for my hair--I have to get the deep dark brown--it is definitely the cheapest option out there for brunettes--other dry shampoos will leave your hair streaky white or gray but this blends in with your hair color. Just make sure you get the right shade :) This company got a hold of me from my last review (seeing that I wasn&#x27;t happy with this shade) and said they would give me a refund. That&#x27;s great service! I will definitely continue buying this, I&#x27;ll just buy the deep dark brown shade instead. It smells great, is cheap and I was impressed with them for getting back to me and working with me.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used. I will buy it again. Its got some color to it so it blended it fine with my dark hair.</li>
            <li> i purchased this because a dry shampoo i had previously used had made my hair appear dull. but i didn&#x27;t notice any dullness with this product at all! it definitely worked to expectations</li>
            <li> Not worth the price. Still goes to hair a grayish color just like other non-tinted dry shampoos</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product. My intention was to purchase this product to not only serve as a dry shampoo but also to help cover my gray hairs as my coloring grows out. When I use the product on my hair, though, it makes the color of my hair look &#x27;ashy&#x27;.  Perhaps I should have gone with a darker color but I didn&#x27;t want to get black.  Not the best solution for dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for dark hair. It does leave a little residue but this is one of the best dry shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried for dark hair. I&#x27;ve tried Tresseme but I like the smell of this better.</li>
            <li> Worst product out there.... bad color, spray delivery, smell, appearance on your hair. Make any other choice and it will be an improvement over this product.</li>
