            <li> These Briks didn&#x27;t have the copper strip. I have the old model dryer, but I plan on purchasing the new dryer that they work in.  Do you sell them?</li>
            <li> A must have for hearing aid users.they do an excellent job of removing moisture from your hearing aids.that is the biggest cause of hearing aids failing.</li>
            <li> We order these regularly.  They work really well to keep hearing aids dry.</li>
            <li> The dry briks makes my Cochlear Implants come out smelling nice &amp; fresh. When I use Dry Briks I know my implants will be just fine :)</li>
            <li> I use the &amp;#34;dry brik&amp;#34; to keep my hearing aids dry and moisture free.  I haven&#x27;t found anything that does it as well as these.</li>
            <li> Better than the jars of rechargeable pellets that these replaced.  At the cost of HA, I want to do everything to keep them working.  Since moisture and electronics do not go together, these bricks are the best solution.</li>
            <li> Good item, especially if you have to keep for hearing aids.</li>
            <li> I have the cochlear implant, this is so helpful keeping the processor clean and dry!! The shipping was super fast, I will purchase from this seller again!!!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hearing aids dry overnight</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Have used these for many years. Very pleased with the product and the service .</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to do</li>
            <li> I need this product to dry out my microphone for my hearing implant and the batteries for my regular hearing aid.  This works very well and extends the life of the hearing equipment.</li>
            <li> Recommended by DryStore for their hearing aid dryer.  Seems to work.</li>
            <li> I was alittle unsure about ordering the heater that these use these dry briks but its wonderful.  Wearing hearing aids leads to increased ear wax and these little briks help with drying the hearing aids substantially.  I will definitely reorder again.</li>
            <li> exactly as described and shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> I use this desiccant (drying agent) in my evening hearing air dryer which blows air through my rather delicate hearing air to remove moisture. One brick last 2 months, and while they are not exciting, they are medically necessary for me and do just what they are supposed to do by keeping the computer in my hearing aid moisture free and operating properly.</li>
            <li> This product does everything they claim. It drys and evaporates any water and ear wax in or on my hearing aids</li>
            <li> these briks certainly do a good job, when used with the Zephyr  drying machine for hearing aids, as recommended by my audiologist.  Think the trick  is to make sure you note on the brik itself where indicated when they need to be replaced, and make sure you do.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great quality&lt;br /&gt; merchant was a pleasure to deal with&lt;br /&gt;Buy these all the time</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because the audiologist I went to advised me to use it and it does make a difference --  therefore I continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good price</li>
            <li> For what I have paid for my hearing aids this is one product you can not do without as it will extend the life of your hearing aids and batteries.  Excellent place for when the hearing aids are not in your ear so you will always know where they are and it does exactly what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> They had indicator on them indication how much drying power they had left.  Lossing that looses a star.&lt;br /&gt;Still they do what they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> Loved that I was able to get this replacement so readily.</li>
            <li> Never go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for drying my ear aids out.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Does the job every time.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> GOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR RECEIVED  IN A TIMELY MANNER, WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> I use it to put my one hearing aid and the other cochlear implant both in the case at night.</li>
            <li> Product was all OK.  The mix up caused me to get twice as much as I wanted.  Your dealer was crook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles</li>
            <li> This really helps hearing aids.</li>
            <li> The Dry Brik II are reasonably priced and readily available from Amazon.  Delivery is fast and the whole transaction is easier than looking around locally to find them...if they can be found!  They keep my hearing aids dry and working the way they should.  Really saves money by not having to have the doctor work on removing the moisture. Even helps after I step in the shower with the aids still in!  Yes, I have done this a few times.</li>
            <li> They seem to last and do what they are designed for.  No problem for me and the price was better than thru the hearing centers.</li>
            <li> Fits the machine perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great product, got to us quick and easy.  Would buy from seller again!</li>
            <li> My son has bilateral cochlear implants and we have had to use his dry box since we moved to the east.  Humidity and CIs don&#x27;t mix so we religiously cean them every night using the dry brick and we have had no issues with his hearing or device.</li>
            <li> I bought again. Have had good results.</li>
            <li> They keep my Ronda Hearing Insert dry at Night.</li>
            <li> Given the nature of the product, there no observable way to judge the it.  I use it at the advice of my audiologist.</li>
            <li> Service was excellent and quickly received.  The bricks fit well into the required space and&lt;br /&gt;keep the enclosed ear pieces in the box at the correct humidity. We are quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I had used previously and knew what I was getting.  It met expectations.  Will no doubt order it another time.</li>
            <li> pictured as though they had the copper strip on the back but that was non-existent. doesn&#x27;t work in my dry and store.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Exactly what I needed.  I have bought these before and they work great.  The price is right as well.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by the company that makes my hearing aid and I find that by using this product it keeps my hearing aid in great working order.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My husband wears hearing aides and always had a problem with the wax buildup in his ears. Every night he uses these Dry Briks in his hearing aide machine to dry out and disinfect his hearing aides. They work great and keep his hearing aides clean and dry. I would recommend anyone with hearing aides do this.</li>

            <li> I GET CONFLICTING INFORMATION AS TO USEFULNESS OF PUTTING YOUR HEARING AID IN A DRY ATMOSPHERE DURING NIGHT STORAGE, BUT THESE BRICKS ARE USED IN A NICE FAN DRIVEN DESSICATOR THAT MY AUDIOLOGIST HIGHLY RECOMMENDS AND SINCE AN ADVANCED  HEARING AID THESE DAYS COSTS BETWEEN $2000 AND $5000, IT IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO USE A DESICCATOR TO PROLONG THE LIFE OF THIS ELECTRONIC MARVEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V TENNERY</li>

            <li> Good product and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Does what its meant to do in my Hearing Aid dryer.</li>

            <li> Exactly what I needed and what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Yes the dry bricks where fine but I ordered something else and they sent me another pkg that I didn&#x27;t order and charged me for it!????</li>
            <li> Product was not as effective as I&#x27;d hope. I&#x27;ll still purchase more because it&#x27;s better than nothing. Not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid area and my hearing aids and now my Cochlear Implant processor would degrade in performance faster, resulting in repair downtime and stress from not having my hearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a Dri-Aid and use these Dry Briks and you will never worry about water corroding your sensitive electronics again.  I&#x27;ll give you a good example: recently, I got caught in a rainstorm without an umbrella or hat, and my processor got wet and shut down. The minute I got home, I placed it in my Dri-Aid and waited it out. Within an hour, the processor started up again, but for my peace of mind, I let it go through the full 8-hour cycle and then some. Afterwards, the processor was good as new and the sounds were crisp as Day One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t leave the life of your hearing devices to chance... get a Dri Aid and these Dry Briks.</li>
