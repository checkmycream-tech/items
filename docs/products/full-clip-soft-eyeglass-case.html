            <li> Works fine for my large Bifocals. Since these are cheaply made, I bought 2 of them. The one I had previously had the pocket clip rip out but it lasted for a year before that happened.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Good quality</li>
            <li> It falls out of his shirt pocket. The clip needs to be stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this case before, and it lasted a long time.  This time I ordered the three-pack.  It arrived a day before the first day of the delivery window listed on my order!  So I got a fine product and it arrived very fast.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> fits my needs reasonably well made the price was perfect</li>
            <li> Just what I ahve been looking for.  I boight one a long time ago and my aunt also wanted me to get her one.  I could no longer find one in the stores so Amazon of course had one.  Love it!  Works great instead of having a big heavey hard case to carry around for my glasses.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertized</li>
            <li> These are great quality, really nice and thick. It&#x27;s always handy to have a couple of them lying around!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a like item but was actually better than the eyeglass case that I lost in the yard</li>
            <li> This eyeglass case is very inexpensive and fit the bill that I needed it too. I have quite a few pairs&lt;br /&gt;of glasses around and needed something to put them in while in the car. The plastic cip is usless&lt;br /&gt;if it is going to go on say a sunvisor in a car. It is hard plastic and once it stretches out it looses&lt;br /&gt;its grip and will fall off the visor. I have three of these cases and all of the clips expanded and&lt;br /&gt;then will not hold anymore.  I fixed that buy putting an rubber band around the case and my&lt;br /&gt;visior. If you need these for a coffee table or nightstand they are perfect as I said they are very&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive and are very soft. If you want the clip to hold on a sunvisor it will not.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> As advertised, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> hard to find anywhere but on amazon good item</li>
            <li> Delivered on time as expected. Great case that holds glasses and one or two pens as well.</li>
            <li> loved it I just ordered 2 more  great price</li>
            <li> This item is very good for the money.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations, although slightly larger than a similar version I had been using. This may have contributed to glasses falling out of case, when I accidentally dropped case. May opt for a similarly designed case with cover in future.</li>
