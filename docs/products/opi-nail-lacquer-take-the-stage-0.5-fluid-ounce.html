            <li>nice color...perfect for Fall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice &amp;#34;burnt-pumpkin color!</li>
            <li>Thought it would be a good fall color.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife thought the color looked good after it arrived on time with ease of ordering the color</li>
            <li>So when I was able to find the color through Amazon I was extremely happy.</li>
            <li>I love this color!  </li>
            <li>Love this polish!</li>
            <li>But amazingly, it&#x27;s still an eye catching color.</li>
            <li>The color was amazing after she applied it</li>
            <li>this summer I had to buy my own bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a nice color for fall and that is why I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and company :)</li>
            <li>While I can say the shade might not be for everyone I am loving it right now on my toes and think it will look equally great on my nails.</li>
            <li>you just cant wait to put it on, and it was not a prime product, but the shipping on this was very cheap.</li>
            <li>and it looks nice on my nails--but it will be peeling and chipping off very quickly.</li>
            <li>Opi Take the Stage is a lovely orange/bronze color with hints of sparkle.</li>
            <li>Definitely more of a fall/winter color.</li>
            <li>OPI is my favorite nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I got so many compliments</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I saw this color in the ULTA store and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>with most OPI Lacquers that I&#x27;ve worn, it lasts 2-3 days, with</li>
            <li>It looks better than I thought it would when I saw the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it does not chip, peal, or fade.  </li>
            <li>I love all OPI nail polish</li>
            <li>One of my all time favorite colors.</li>
            <li>Such a sexy and eye-catching color !!!</li>
            <li>Perfect Halloween color, arrived early, polish was brand new and hadnt been sitting around and barely needed to be shaken up, color was a perfect match to what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li>I loved this color so much, I had the clerk at the auto paint store color match it for my motorcycle&#x27;s paint.  </li>
            <li>Easy application, opaque in 3 coats.</li>
            <li>I love this so much it make my nail amazing.</li>
            <li>This color isn&#x27;t quite accurate to the picture.</li>
            <li>This Nail Lacquer is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>The color is rich and sparkly, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It is truly a fantastic color that gives your nails the right amount of pop for this time of year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a lil&#x27; more brown, than orange, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Love the color and that Opi&#x27;s polishes last for more than a week.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to those who love orange for a fall color....</li>
            <li>I love this color and am glad I was able to find it on Amazon as it&#x27;s not available in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a suitable orange for fair skin, which is hard to find.</li>
            <li>You could wear this gorgeous color all year long!</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t have as much red as I would have liked</li>
            <li>This by far my favorite OPI color ever.  </li>
            <li>so if you are not sure GET IT happy with everything</li>
            <li>the wife wanted this polish and she likes this color very much</li>
            <li>still pretty though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a metallic copper, very eye-catching!  </li>
            <li>Love the color and the polish last along time.</li>
            <li>As always, Opi never fails to please.  </li>
            <li>Its a pure copper color and does not look good with pale skin tones.</li>
            <li>Am retired cosmetologist &amp; could not find this at supply house so had to pay full price, but it was definitely worth the extra couple of $$.  </li>
            <li>This color is absolutely hideous.  </li>
            <li>it is so much prettier than the picture.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for Fall color!</li>
            <li>They have the best colors and their polish seems to stay on longer than most and doesn&#x27;t chip very bad.</li>
            <li>Nothing new here!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as vibrant an orange as pictured.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this color if you like sparkle and orange.</li>
            <li>you will be getting a high quality product.</li>
            <li>in the sun it is more of an orange color but indoors with not much light</li>
            <li>A little Seche Vite high gloss quick dry top coat over it</li>
            <li>It also matches the color of my new Fiat Pop (in Rame, or Copper)</li>
            <li>The image looks more orange, while the actual shade was a dark copper.</li>
            <li>This nail color from OPI was a promotional color with only a limited number available.</li>
            <li>It would of been a 5 star except that the orange color tone is less reddish than shown in the picture, making it a less warm color than I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li>It takes a few coats on the big toe to get the actual orange color to be rich and really stand out</li>
            <li>No chips, dried quick.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Opi Take the Stage is a lovely orange/bronze color with hints of sparkle. It&#x27;s a suitable orange for fair skin, which is hard to find. Definitely more of a fall/winter color. Easy application, opaque in 3 coats.</li>

            <li> This color is absolutely hideous.  It looks like I have pennies on all of my fingers.  I was expecting this to be a gold glittery polish but I was wrong.  Its a pure copper color and does not look good with pale skin tones.</li>
            <li> Color is awesome, goes with almost anything in your closet!!  Give it a go!!  You will look so gorgeous! Am retired cosmetologist &amp; could not find this at supply house so had to pay full price, but it was definitely worth the extra couple of $$.

            <li> beautiful shade I have ever seen !Wears on&amp;on.No chips, dried quick.Perfect shade for autumn.hate to take it off to wear a pastel gown.</li>
            <li> OPI is my favorite nail polish.  They have the best colors and their polish seems to stay on longer than most and doesn&#x27;t chip very bad.</li>
            <li> I got a manicure/pedicure done at a local salon and they used this color on my toes. I got so many compliments this summer I had to buy my own bottle. I love it. It takes a few coats on the big toe to get the actual orange color to be rich and really stand out but it brings a little sunshine to cold winter days. I highly suggest this color if you like sparkle and orange.</li>
            <li> the wife wanted this polish and she likes this color very much</li>
            <li> I bought this polish on amazon and i was hoping that the color is what the description said, and it was,the overall color would compare to a rusty orange!. plus i did get the product way faster than expected wich that was a plus because if your a nail polish fanatic like me you just cant wait to put it on, and it was not a prime product, but the shipping on this was very cheap. in the sun it is more of an orange color but indoors with not much light it looks like a fire color wich is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my wife,Christmas 2013. The color was amazing after she applied it and it dried completely. Such a sexy and eye-catching color !!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice color for fall and that is why I bought it.  It has shimmer, which I also like.</li>
            <li> This will be my fall orange nail polish.  Can&#x27;t wait to wear it!!</li>
            <li> I saw this color in the ULTA store and fell in love with it.  I have since purchased it and other shades fo the Burlesque line for 2010.  While I can say the shade might not be for everyone I am loving it right now on my toes and think it will look equally great on my nails.</li>
            <li> The color screams fall allure! It is truly a fantastic color that gives your nails the right amount of pop for this time of year.</li>
            <li> This color is the perfect color for summer...the glitter just adds a nice snap!  Looks wonderful with a nice tan.</li>
            <li> I love this color!  It&#x27;s a metallic copper, very eye-catching!  It also matches the color of my new Fiat Pop (in Rame, or Copper) perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most OPI Lacquers that I&#x27;ve worn, it lasts 2-3 days, with the proper base/top coats- OPI&#x27;s 2-in-1 for me.</li>
            <li> This color isn&#x27;t quite accurate to the picture. It&#x27;s actually a lil&#x27; more brown, than orange, but that&#x27;s ok. I like it anyway. It looks better than I thought it would when I saw the bottle. The color is rich and sparkly, which is what I wanted. Thought it would be a good fall color. Can&#x27;t wait to use it. :D Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this so much it make my nail amazing. My friends want to buy this color because of me.</li>
            <li> Really nice color! opi is great! Nice color for fall!</li>
            <li> This item arrived promptly and met all expectations.</li>
            <li> Love this polish! Beautiful fall color?</li>
            <li> This Nail Lacquer is fabulous.  The picture does not do it justice...it is so much prettier than the picture.  I love the fact that it does not chip, peal, or fade.  Highly recommended to those who love orange for a fall color....you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
            <li> The image looks more orange, while the actual shade was a dark copper. Still close though. And OPI is always a great polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m repeating myself, but you can buy OPI Nail Lacquer with confidence you will be getting a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Nothing new here!  I love all OPI nail polish</li>
            <li> nice color...perfect for Fall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice &amp;#34;burnt-pumpkin color! Highly recommended for Fall color! You can never go wrong with OPI! :)</li>
            <li> I love this color and am glad I was able to find it on Amazon as it&#x27;s not available in the stores anymore.  While it doesn&#x27;t have as much red as I would have liked it is still a gorgeous color!  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the polish last along time. No need for touch ups.</li>
            <li> This is not the fault of the seller it is the product.  I like the picture&#x27;s color and it looks nice on my nails--but it will be peeling and chipping off very quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife thought the color looked good after it arrived on time with ease of ordering the color turned out great get lots of compliments on color so if you are not sure GET IT happy with everything</li>
            <li> As always, Opi never fails to please.  Love the color and that Opi&#x27;s polishes last for more than a week.</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite colors. It&#x27;s a copper/autumn orange foil color. A little Seche Vite high gloss quick dry top coat over it and it almost glows.</li>
            <li> This by far my favorite OPI color ever.  There is no change in the quality of the OPI polish....  always the best manicure/pedicure.  I loved this color so much, I had the clerk at the auto paint store color match it for my motorcycle&#x27;s paint.  Now I get compliments on my bike...  and my pedicure!</li>
