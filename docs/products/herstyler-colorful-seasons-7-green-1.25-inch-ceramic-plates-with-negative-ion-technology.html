            <li>and that is not an easy task!</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have found and price is amazing.</li>
            <li>It had a great run considering I&#x27;m an avid every day straightener user.</li>
            <li>but I really dont care as it works great.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener.</li>
            <li>I love the price more.</li>
            <li>I like the turbo better</li>

            <li>love them everyone women should have, not a kncokoff , dont let tellers in mall try to prove you otherwise</li>

            <li>It worked great and very affordable.</li>
            <li>so I am so glad I found this deal on here</li>
            <li>and she didn&#x27;t get a sale from me! :)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem cheap at all!</li>
            <li>glad I did not pay $200 dollars</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product and the pricing.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it if you want the original kind of quality.</li>
            <li>They even have the r tilting plates to help create the perfect curl without your hair looking really flat</li>
            <li>(They almost got me) also great on natural hair, like mines ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>so I bought her one for herself &amp; she loves them.no matter what color its an overall great flatiron.</li>
            <li>What a great flat iron i have seen this for $200.00 I dont know if this is a knock off or not</li>
            <li>Great flat iron!</li>
            <li>Great product, quick shipment, and totally content!</li>
            <li>I have been using this brand for the past 5 years and it works great!</li>
            <li>this iron makes my  hair perfectly straight and very smooth.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the original product or close to as good, for any hopefuls out there.</li>
            <li>It heat up quickly has the tempature adjustment and its sleek and stylish with a pretty cool color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this on Amazon, because I&#x27;m fairly certain malls don&#x27;t have kiosks for these anymore.</li>
            <li>I truthfully believe it&#x27;s the real deal here...</li>
            <li>Would rather pay more for the real thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few months, and it&#x27;s still going strong- love it! :-)</li>
            <li>Great product at a fraction of the cost I bought my other one at and this one works just as well</li>
            <li>Just remember, it gets very hot, so get a glove to help protect you.</li>
            <li>the package is the same if they are knockoffs i surely cant tell!</li>
            <li>I have ordered around 8 over a period of five years for friends and family members after ordering my first one!</li>
            <li>The price is just right too.</li>
            <li>Been through many straighteners and this is by far my ultimate favorite.</li>
            <li>Woke up next day with straight hair that was very easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>came quick,cool color,gets hot...</li>
            <li>I paid 20.00 for something I would have paid potentially 100 dollars more if bought at a retail store.</li>
            <li>Best flat iron hands down!!</li>
            <li>My daughter took my favorite flat iron</li>
            <li>It was ok it still left my hair a lil wavy. ..  not fully straight. ..</li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron!!!</li>
            <li>It really gets hot but the control temperature is helpful.</li>
            <li>The plate size aside, it appears to be a real herstyler.</li>
            <li>I was really expecting this to work as well as the ones they sell in the mall</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this.</li>
            <li>hahaa lol...got my hair straight</li>
            <li>It does the job, the plate is smaller than advertised, and it&#x27;s cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair straight or curled.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Everyone I talked to said I was looking at 3+ hours to get it straight.</li>
            <li>I plan to get this for myself as well, for when I need a very polished look.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this particular hair straightener because of how fast it heats up</li>
            <li>Even in the high summer humidity we get here it always works.</li>
            <li>It left it super straight, soft, &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>Then when I used the straightener, grabbing the end of the iron was so hot I could barely touch it to hold my hair in.</li>
            <li>so I needed a new one .This</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair, I keep it on a relatively low setting for my fine hair,  take my time, and i never have been upset using this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Take note, I did not buy my first herstyler flat iron here.</li>
            <li>Hot fast, and just one pass already made my hair a billion times straighter than my other.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s even straight the next day!</li>
            <li>I got stopped to buy this product that I paid $120 thinking I was getting a 60% off deal since the box is marked $300.</li>
            <li>(my hair is really curly and is fizzy anyway without a little help;)</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is very long and straight.</li>
            <li>Right away I noticed that I had a lot less breakage (</li>
            <li>After putting my hair through the iron, it kept slipping through leaving the bottom straight and unwaved.</li>
            <li>I paid full price (because I was naive and young) at the mall.</li>
            <li>Because it is so hot you can move fast making time spent on you hair in half.</li>
            <li>Sister bought exact one in pink at the Mall and spent $100 for hers.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is exactly like the one at the kiosk at the mall, but for much much less money!</li>

            <li> This flat iron is exactly like the one at the kiosk at the mall, but for much much less money!</li>
            <li> but after I moved to another state and left my nice straighten there, I had to live with a piece of crap one given to me by friends for years before I finally just took a chance on this since I couldn&#x27;t afford anything different.</li>
            <li> It took right under an hour with the Herstyler, and found out her hair was actually past her waist!</li>
            <li> Long lasting for price, have had this for about a year too!</li>
            <li> barely any)than when I used the other one.</li>
            <li> It has been about a month since my last purchase, and it is everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I did a side by side comparison and everything down to the dials were the same!</li>
            <li> Actually got the lady to come down to $89</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s five and a half years later</li>
            <li> I previously had a Cortex tourmaline ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> Will never use any other straightener.</li>
            <li> but she was really rude with me when I told her I didn&#x27;t have the money to buy it that day I would have to wait until payday the next week</li>
            <li> Me and my sister have thick Afro American hair and this does the job for the both of us.</li>
            <li> I used it on pixie cut hair, and hair down to the waist.</li>
            <li> but i can use less of it than i have before.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my niece, who has lots of very long, thick, tight curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not a genuine herstyler.  </li>
            <li> Flat Iron sounds like the spring it broken.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only $22, so if it&#x27;s fake</li>
            <li> and it doen&#x27;t turn off at random like my last one.</li>
            <li> I am curious to see if they honor the warranty if anything goes wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because of the dramatic price difference, but decided what the hell</li>
            <li> but too thin to hold unless I gripped the end burning by fingers.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence, just go ahead and order it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>

            <li> I love this straightener. I love the price more. Alot cheeper then the mall.</li>
            <li> I like the turbo better</li>
            <li> Amazing quality at an unbeatable price! Mine is still working perfectly 2 years later!</li>
            <li> Item works great and for a great price.</li>
            <li> Came in a good amount of time and works WONDERFULLY! Long lasting for price, have had this for about a year too!</li>
            <li> love them everyone women should have, not a kncokoff , dont let tellers in mall try to prove you otherwise</li>
            <li> Will never use any other straightener. I love it and will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. It really gets hot but the control temperature is helpful. I just have to learn how to use it and make curls at the end of my hair.</li>
            <li> My niece loved mine so I bought her one for herself &amp; she loves them.no matter what color its an overall great flatiron.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. It heat up quickly has the tempature adjustment and its sleek and stylish with a pretty cool color. I love this product</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my friend who had a herstyler that she purchased from the mall... It lasted her a year until one of the plates fell off. I was a little skeptical because of the dramatic price difference, but decided what the hell it&#x27;s only $22, so if it&#x27;s fake whatever. I don&#x27;t believe that the plates are 1.5 inches, they look like they are only 1 inch plates to me. The plate size aside, it appears to be a real herstyler. Looks good and works well! I truthfully believe it&#x27;s the real deal here... If you are on the fence, just go ahead and order it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was really expecting this to work as well as the ones they sell in the mall and it does not. Just happy that it was cheap.</li>
            <li> this iron makes my  hair perfectly straight and very smooth. love it.&lt;br /&gt;wish it had a timer to turn off as I forget to turn my iron off often.</li>
            <li> Awesome straighner for the price!!!</li>
            <li> fast shipping, awesome price! great product</li>
            <li> This flat iron is exactly like the one at the kiosk at the mall, but for much much less money! I am curious to see if they honor the warranty if anything goes wrong with it.</li>
            <li> It was ok it still left my hair a lil wavy. ..  not fully straight. ..</li>
            <li> As someone who went to beauty school, I kinda became a name brand hog but after I moved to another state and left my nice straighten there, I had to live with a piece of crap one given to me by friends for years before I finally just took a chance on this since I couldn&#x27;t afford anything different. And I love it! Hot fast, and just one pass already made my hair a billion times straighter than my other. I absolutely recommend this. The price is just right too.</li>
            <li> The best hot iron ever. Because it is so hot you can move fast making time spent on you hair in half. I have tried others, but found this is the best and the internet has the best prices.</li>
            <li> It worked great and very affordable.</li>
            <li> Been through many straighteners and this is by far my ultimate favorite. Great price. Sister bought exact one in pink at the Mall and spent $100 for hers.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the original product or close to as good, for any hopefuls out there. I would not recommend it if you want the original kind of quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after using the ones from my friend had from the mall and they are wonderful! the package is the same if they are knockoffs i surely cant tell! I did a side by side comparison and everything down to the dials were the same! they only thing different between hers and mine was the price! hahaa lol...got my hair straight and that is not an easy task!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron!!! It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that actually straightens my hair and it&#x27;s even straight the next day! Wow! Just like the one they try and sell you for $200 in the mall! Actually got the lady to come down to $89 but she was really rude with me when I told her I didn&#x27;t have the money to buy it that day I would have to wait until payday the next week so I am so glad I found this deal on here and she didn&#x27;t get a sale from me! :)</li>
            <li> It does the job, the plate is smaller than advertised, and it&#x27;s cheap looking.</li>
            <li> This item arrived in great packaging, was as described, ahead of schedule and works great!! It&#x27;s been a few months, and it&#x27;s still going strong- love it! :-)</li>
            <li> i had this straighter fir a couple of months and its the best one I&#x27;ve had so far but it already has a crack but this may have happened  from a drop.&lt;br /&gt;i still use it and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron! Doesn&#x27;t seem cheap at all!</li>
            <li> Flat Iron sounds like the spring it broken. Highly disappointed. Wish I would have bought at a salon instead. Should have returned.</li>
            <li> I got stopped to buy this product that I paid $120 thinking I was getting a 60% off deal since the box is marked $300. My daughter&#x27;s hair is very long and straight. I wear my hair straight or curled. The seller put waves in my daughter&#x27;s hair that were gorgeous.  The waves were there after being in the wind and the following morning! Unheard of. Then when I used the straightener, grabbing the end of the iron was so hot I could barely touch it to hold my hair in. Tried just holding the handle with both hands and it pinched my hand three times when releasing the iron. After putting my hair through the iron, it kept slipping through leaving the bottom straight and unwaved. I kept trying to get the ends but too thin to hold unless I gripped the end burning by fingers. Would not recommend at all. I am returning it today</li>
            <li> I really like this particular hair straightener because of how fast it heats up and it doen&#x27;t turn off at random like my last one. I still have to use some kind of heat protection conditioner or friz protector, (my hair is really curly and is fizzy anyway without a little help;) but i can use less of it than i have before. There isn&#x27;t anything i don&#x27;t like about it. Great product, quick shipment, and totally content! thank you!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them! They even have the r tilting plates to help create the perfect curl without your hair looking really flat</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Was a gift for my niece, who has lots of very long, thick, tight curly hair. Everyone I talked to said I was looking at 3+ hours to get it straight. It took right under an hour with the Herstyler, and found out her hair was actually past her waist! It left it super straight, soft, &amp; shiny. No need to use any extra products on her hair to keep it that way. Woke up next day with straight hair that was very easy to manage.  I plan to get this for myself as well, for when I need a very polished look. Great value! Just remember, it gets very hot, so get a glove to help protect you.</li>
            <li> Not a genuine herstyler.  Hair catches and pulls my hair.  Does not have a auto shut off if left on.  Would rather pay more for the real thing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!! The same product the mall vendors were trying to sale to me for.... $250! (They almost got me) also great on natural hair, like mines ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> I got stopped by a kiosk in a mall but didn&#x27;t have the money to buy it at the time... But loved the product (not the price) they dropped it to about $200 for two... So glad I went home and checked on here! Great price for Great tool, great for straightening and for curling!</li>
            <li> This is my second Herstyler, I got this to replace one that was dropped which broke the ceramic plates. This is the best flat iron I have found and price is amazing. I have curly hair that can get frizzy, but this straightener works like a charm, leaves my hair silky and shiny, and it lasts for 2 days. Even in the high summer humidity we get here it always works.</li>
            <li> It has been about a month since my last purchase, and it is everything I expected. I have been using this brand for the past 5 years and it works great!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron hands down!!</li>
            <li> Take note, I did not buy my first herstyler flat iron here. I paid full price (because I was naive and young) at the mall. It&#x27;s five and a half years later and I&#x27;m just now having to replace it. It had a great run considering I&#x27;m an avid every day straightener user. It hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair, I keep it on a relatively low setting for my fine hair,  take my time, and i never have been upset using this flat iron. I&#x27;m glad I found this on Amazon, because I&#x27;m fairly certain malls don&#x27;t have kiosks for these anymore. I used it on pixie cut hair, and hair down to the waist. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> glad I bought it,not for the price in the mall! came quick,cool color,gets hot...can curl hair as well..no snagging of hair...glad I did not pay $200 dollars</li>
            <li> Great product at a fraction of the cost I bought my other one at and this one works just as well</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and the pricing. I paid 20.00 for something I would have paid potentially 100 dollars more if bought at a retail store. Works awesome. I previously had a Cortex tourmaline ceramic flat iron. It got up to 450 degrees. Right away I noticed that I had a lot less breakage (barely any)than when I used the other one. The hair glides through the plates. Heats up fast. Me and my sister have thick Afro American hair and this does the job for the both of us. I just have to get my sister to get her own!</li>
            <li> Very Pleased with this item. I have ordered around 8 over a period of five years for friends and family members after ordering my first one!</li>
            <li> Very nice flat iron at a great price! Very impressed!!</li>
