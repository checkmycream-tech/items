    <ol>
            <li>Pantene does its best to make you beautiful!</li>
            <li>it is good to use and very nice !!!!!  </li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Always makes my hair feel great</li>
            <li>I love it !!</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>the scent on this is pleasant and not too girly.</li>
            <li>This is a good shampoo for a good price.  </li>
            <li>i use this along with the accompanying conditioner and my hair dresser tells me to keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>good to use, i love it and recommend~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ !</li>
            <li>The pump is handy.  </li>
            <li>I buy this for our entire family of 5, it works great for everyone in the family and it smells great for guys and gals!</li>
            <li>i do have thicker hair too and it works nicely.</li>
            <li>A win-win :)</li>
            <li>This is one item that I think you can do better in the stores or at the clubs warehouses.  </li>
            <li>If they bundled a bulk buy here and reduced cost, it may be better.  </li>
            <li>Treseme does so much more for me now.</li>
            <li>Also, this product leaves my hair nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>SLS is the agent in many shampoos that causes that foaming lather we covet from hair commercials.</li>
            <li>Products containing SLS have a cleaning power that is overwhelming, stripping the hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks pantene for a great product</li>
            <li>The bonus: Since stopping my use of SLS my hair is way more manageable without the need of gels, de-frizzers, pomades etc.</li>
            <li>Amazon needs to give more than 30 days to return something like this, it takes awhile to see the results on a product like this.</li>
            <li>Works like most shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Like the squirty top, it is extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is our favorite shampoo, leaves my girls hair smooth and easy to comb, love it and the way it smells too.</li>
            <li>Good smell and very well lathering.</li>
            <li>love the pantene products for my kind of wild curly hair.</li>
            <li>Regardless I was in Costco and noticed that there was a Kirkland shampoo 100% vegan formula, sulfate free,</li>
            <li>I am now buying Aubrey shampoo free of SLS, parabens and chemical fragrances.</li>
            <li>This shampoo helps to smooth my hair and prepare it for the pantene conditioner.</li>
            <li>When used in tandem with the Pantene Pro-V Smooth Conditioner and Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum with Argan Oil, my hair looks, feels and acts like it&#x27;s been pampered at a high-class salon.</li>
            <li>Unlike mineral makeup, there&#x27;s nothing good or natural about Mineral Oil.</li>
            <li>Unlike mineral makeup, there&#x27;s nothing good or natural about Mineral Oil.</li>
            <li>like the smell and rich foams.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems worth it!</li>
            <li>so it will last me a good while.</li>
            <li>The kids don&#x27;t use it up as fast either since the portions are more controlled.  </li>
            <li>My hair strands are fine, but I have a lot of them and they get very tangled.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo with the conditioner and I love the smell of my hair and how soft it is.</li>
            <li>Still worth it for us to buy in the stores for now tho...</li>
            <li>I have tried all the expensive Shampoo and Conditioner products(Aveda) and by far I love Pantene products the best!  </li>
            <li>I do feel this is a little overpriced here on Amazon, but overall, this is a great shampoo!</li>
            <li>Does not take out the curl but tames it down and leaves hair strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>When I received the package, I noticed that it did not look anything like the real thing!</li>
            <li>Not only that, but amazon subscribe and save puts a bit more in my pocket</li>
            <li>and very recommend it !</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to go back to the old kind.</li>
            <li>Paraben free, gluten free, 33.8oz for less than $10</li>
            <li>Shampoo is so much easier to use in the shower with a pump.  </li>
            <li>and after I started using this it has made it less frizzy, and a lot more softer.</li>
            <li>Its vivid effect and reasonable price will make me keep using it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works perfectly - not only does it smell pretty nice, but my hair isn&#x27;t a complete mess.</li>
            <li>Smooth Shampoo not really smoothen my hair.</li>
            <li>It dried my hair out even more, I ended up throwing it out and wasting my money.</li>
            <li>although the smell can be a little bit strong at times I would suggest using both shampoo and conditioner together with this as it makes you here very flaky.</li>
            <li>but right next to it</li>
            <li>Cleans well like most pantene shampoos but this smooth version leaves a film on the hair which makes it hard to brush and blow dry.</li>
            <li>What you may not know is that exposing your hair to this chemical actually destroys it in the long run, stripping it of essential oils it needs to stay healthy, breaking down protein and halting healthy hair growth.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would still continue to order this product because it works, my hair is usually very frizzy</li>
            <li>Only thing that bugs me is that they would sell it as the real thing</li>
            <li>Thickening agent which can strip hair and skin of their natural moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thickening agent which can strip hair and skin of their natural moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can buy even cheaper shampoo, but your hair just won&#x27;t be as soft.</li>
            <li>Well they were selling this Pantene Pro-V shampoo in bigger quantity for less money than Kirkland Moisture Shampoo with double whammy, sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate and more chemicals.</li>
            <li>In the REAL product at the store, it only has it in English.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mineral Oil: Same as baby oil, make hair look shiny and feel soft.</li>

            <li> Wow, a liter of shampoo for less than $10?  </li>
            <li> I have been a long time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Diethanolamine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEA): Can cause scalp irritation and even bad allergic reactions and they also destroy all the good stuff in your hair (such as keratin) making your hair dry, brittle and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sodium chloride: Also known as table salt, is used as a thickener in shampoos and conditioners containing sodium lauryl sulfate and may also be the cause of dry and itchy scalp in addition to hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Alcohol: Can dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parabens like Methylparaben and Propylparaben:</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and Pantene</li>
            <li> For a few extra dollars, you get a little softer / glossier hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has tight curls that can get tangled or matted.  </li>
            <li> Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) is a surfactant, emulsifier, and a harsh detergent added to literally thousands of cleaners and cosmetic products/ toiletries (shampoos, hair dyes, makeup, toothpaste, mouth wash, hand soaps, and laundry detergents).</li>
            <li> I like to use this at least once or twice a week</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that SHAMPOO could be unhealthy?</li>
            <li> I think this is a fake!</li>
            <li> Turns out there are all sorts of things we have to be wary of!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a petrochemical derived from crude oil.e of a hair product, parabens are chemicals that are known for their toxic nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I bought this shampoo with the conditioner and I love the smell of my hair and how soft it is. I bought the big bottle so it will last me a good while.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fake! When I received the package, I noticed that it did not look anything like the real thing! It has the name in English, French, and I believe in Spanish. In the REAL product at the store, it only has it in English. It also has a different smell. Overall, I would still continue to order this product because it works, my hair is usually very frizzy and after I started using this it has made it less frizzy, and a lot more softer. Only thing that bugs me is that they would sell it as the real thing but in reality it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I only buy this shampoo because both my husband and I like it. Not only that, but amazon subscribe and save puts a bit more in my pocket and I get to receive it at my front door. A win-win :)</li>
            <li> This is one item that I think you can do better in the stores or at the clubs warehouses.  Buyer beware on this one.  If they bundled a bulk buy here and reduced cost, it may be better.  Still worth it for us to buy in the stores for now tho...even with the Subscribe and save discount.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Pantene user and it just doesn&#x27;t give my hair the same shine anymore. This is nothing against the seller, this is against Patene themselves. Their quality just isn&#x27;t the same anymore. Treseme does so much more for me now.</li>
            <li> it is good to use and very nice !!!!!  I love it !! and very recommend it !try it to you</li>
            <li> I like Pantene Pro-V Shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell and rich foams.&lt;br /&gt;But Smooth Shampoo not really smoothen my hair.</li>
            <li> Wow, a liter of shampoo for less than $10?  Amazing!  Also, this product leaves my hair nice and smooth.  I definitely recommend this product.  The pump is a plus!</li>
            <li> Aveda is my choice. Regardless I was in Costco and noticed that there was a Kirkland shampoo 100% vegan formula, sulfate free, Paraben free, gluten free, 33.8oz for less than $10 but right next to it they were still selling Nexxus with $5 off coupon an awful shampoo with sodium laureth sulfate which is used in paints... these days everyone stays away from SLS but not Nexxus. Well they were selling this Pantene Pro-V shampoo in bigger quantity for less money than Kirkland Moisture Shampoo with double whammy, sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate and more chemicals. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Laurel Sulfate: SLS is the agent in many shampoos that causes that foaming lather we covet from hair commercials. What you may not know is that exposing your hair to this chemical actually destroys it in the long run, stripping it of essential oils it needs to stay healthy, breaking down protein and halting healthy hair growth. Great. Products containing SLS have a cleaning power that is overwhelming, stripping the hair. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) is a surfactant, emulsifier, and a harsh detergent added to literally thousands of cleaners and cosmetic products/ toiletries (shampoos, hair dyes, makeup, toothpaste, mouth wash, hand soaps, and laundry detergents). It&#x27;s actually derived from coconuts, but during the manufacturing process it undergoes \\&quot;ethoxylation\\&quot; that results in an unwanted  byproduct - 1,4 dioxane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium chloride: Also known as table salt, is used as a thickener in shampoos and conditioners containing sodium lauryl sulfate and may also be the cause of dry and itchy scalp in addition to hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diethanolamine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEA): Can cause scalp irritation and even bad allergic reactions and they also destroy all the good stuff in your hair (such as keratin) making your hair dry, brittle and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol: Can dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parabens like Methylparaben and Propylparaben: Used to prolong shelf life of a hair product, parabens are chemicals that are known for their toxic nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polyethelyne glycol or PEG/Polyethelyne, or Polyoxyethelyne: Thickening agent which can strip hair and skin of their natural moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Oil: Same as baby oil, make hair look shiny and feel soft.

            <li> when I was in my country, i was used to using pantene shampoo and conditioner. So after i came to boston, i still prefer to use the same product. Its vivid effect and reasonable price will make me keep using it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is so much easier to use in the shower with a pump.  The kids don&#x27;t use it up as fast either since the portions are more controlled.  This is our favorite shampoo, leaves my girls hair smooth and easy to comb, love it and the way it smells too.</li>
            <li> Cleans well like most pantene shampoos but this smooth version leaves a film on the hair which makes it hard to brush and blow dry.</li>
            <li> I like to have a pump dispenser in the shower for ease of use.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of this - one short pump will lather up a lot and I find I don&#x27;t need a &amp;#34;repeat&amp;#34; application.  I have very dry hair and Pantene gives it a sheen.</li>
            <li> My daughter has tight curls that can get tangled or matted.  She swears by this shampoo saying that nothing else leaves her hair as manageable.</li>
            <li> Always makes my hair feel great I will always choose this brand in the future. Thanks pantene for a great product</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo for a good price.  The pump is handy.  Amazon can&#x27;t be beat.  Pantene does its best to make you beautiful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently a college student [guy], and as such, I have to be rather budget oriented. This shampoo works perfectly - not only does it smell pretty nice, but my hair isn&#x27;t a complete mess. You can buy even cheaper shampoo, but your hair just won&#x27;t be as soft. For a few extra dollars, you get a little softer / glossier hair. Seems worth it!</li>
            <li> love the pantene products for my kind of wild curly hair. Does not take out the curl but tames it down and leaves hair strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that SHAMPOO could be unhealthy? Turns out there are all sorts of things we have to be wary of! I am now buying Aubrey shampoo free of SLS, parabens and chemical fragrances. The bonus: Since stopping my use of SLS my hair is way more manageable without the need of gels, de-frizzers, pomades etc. I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> My hair strands are fine, but I have a lot of them and they get very tangled.  This shampoo helps to smooth my hair and prepare it for the pantene conditioner.</li>
            <li> Amazon needs to give more than 30 days to return something like this, it takes awhile to see the results on a product like this. It dried my hair out even more, I ended up throwing it out and wasting my money. Boo hiss.</li>
            <li> good to use, i love it and recommend~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ !</li>
            <li> Works like most shampoo.  Like the size so I dont&#x27; have to reorder.</li>
            <li> When used in tandem with the Pantene Pro-V Smooth Conditioner and Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum with Argan Oil, my hair looks, feels and acts like it&#x27;s been pampered at a high-class salon.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the expensive Shampoo and Conditioner products(Aveda) and by far I love Pantene products the best!  I do feel this is a little overpriced here on Amazon, but overall, this is a great shampoo!</li>
            <li> Good smell and very well lathering. I like to use this at least once or twice a week although the smell can be a little bit strong at times I would suggest using both shampoo and conditioner together with this as it makes you here very flaky.</li>
            <li> I buy this for our entire family of 5, it works great for everyone in the family and it smells great for guys and gals!</li>
            <li> ive used this shampoo for about a year. i use this along with the accompanying conditioner and my hair dresser tells me to keep up the good work. i do have thicker hair too and it works nicely. the scent on this is pleasant and not too girly. also if you ever have lady friends over, they wont have to cringe at 2 in 1 shampoo bottles. but again i recommend to get the accompanying conditioner.</li>
            <li> Like the squirty top, it is extremely easy to use.  I don&#x27;t want to go back to the old kind.</li>
