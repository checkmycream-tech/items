            <li>I love Ardell wispies.</li>
            <li>either I&#x27;m better with two coats of mascara</li>
            <li>I reach for them more often then</li>
            <li>ON HAND WHEN I RUN OUT OF MY FAVORITE LASHES.</li>
            <li>IM IN LOVE WITH THESE</li>
            <li>These lashes are better quality than some I&#x27;ve purchased from overseas.</li>
            <li>I see many reviews about the trimming and length</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>They are okay.</li>
            <li>Im about to order 4 more</li>
            <li>Nice they came when excepted and where very useful on my clients</li>
            <li>As far as the lashes themselves, beautiful. :)</li>
            <li>Great quality, very natural looking!</li>
            <li>These are very good quality for the price, and they arrived super fast.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good for just a dollar</li>
            <li>Beautiful natural looking eyelashes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try them out!</li>
            <li>the lashes are a lot wider than most, but are easily trimmed.</li>
            <li>To give them a better shape I just wrapped the rim of the eyelash around the tip of my finger to give it more of a curve which helped fit to the curve of my eye when I applied them.</li>
            <li>Love them light an airy</li>
            <li>So they aren&#x27;t completely fuss-free but for the value they are a great for go-to fab lash for your beauty kit on a budget</li>
            <li>and these are the most comfortable.</li>
            <li>They are a really good price because phone pair of lashes are about how much these are.</li>
            <li>Very light and comfy, lots of fun to put on!  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of whisppies...if I spelled it right!!</li>
            <li>Thx goods cool!</li>
            <li>Other than that, they are great!</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t bend as easily.</li>
            <li>they are all in place but easy to remove from the packaging.</li>
            <li>such beautiful lashes for the price.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist and I am very particular on the products I use, and again, I LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li>Light and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Given the mixed reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure how these lashes would turn out to be, BUT they are amazing!</li>
            <li>I love these thanks a million!!</li>
            <li>I love it as much!!</li>
            <li>And about once a week, I take them off to clean and since they retain their shape so beautifully, I just place them back on.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a huge steal.&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#34;ll</li>
            <li>Crazy price, excellent, feel great, wear again and again.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are SO cheap (</li>
            <li>they are such a great value.</li>
            <li>Fabulous lashes for under $2.</li>
            <li>And they don&#x27;t even fit</li>
            <li>I could not use them because they looked too cheap</li>
            <li>They look fabulous on camera</li>
            <li>But i could do without the extra plastic hanging off the ends and the bonus fly..</li>
            <li>They just need to be trimmed to fit the eye and then applied with eyelash glue (bought separately).</li>
            <li>Nice lashes and fairly fast shipping</li>
            <li>Put them on with a light mascara like lengthening to taper tips then add a coat of a thickening mascara</li>
            <li>Truthfully, these are worth the wait.</li>
            <li>so cheap bought two types to try but started breaking out around my eyes every time i wore them.</li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>Look cheap and crappy</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be such good quality for cheap price!</li>
            <li>The price was great, but keep in mind that these lashes are packaged flat, which means they&#x27;re not the easiest to apply.</li>
            <li>advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it</li>
            <li>I was so excited when i got them</li>
            <li>so I was so excited.</li>
            <li>They are long and it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>I prefer thicker bands but they&#x27;re pretty cute.</li>
            <li>i wished they shipped faster but worth the wait!</li>
            <li>be ordering these hopefully next a bulk batch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast shipping and very good packaging it didn&#x27;t come damaged at all.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I like them because the change to my eye is subtle...easy to remove, clean, and re use...</li>
            <li>The hair bristles are soft which I love!</li>
            <li>They are beautiful for the price but the shipping is pretty long</li>
            <li>And that was the only good thing about them.</li>
            <li>I love the look the lashes can achieve, but one of the things I don&#x27;t really like about them is the inconsistency in the product.</li>
            <li>Ok to wear a pair of leashes maybe twice, if you don&#x27;t get a whole bunch of makeup on it.</li>
            <li>they look full and</li>
            <li>Goods cool shipped to me within the time they said they would.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re not bad though.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and look more natural than some others that I tried.</li>
            <li>the more you wear them the more natural they become at first</li>
            <li>Ehhhhh, not my favorite lol the band to the lashes are super hard to work with, but for the price you can&#x27;t complain I wouldn&#x27;t use these if I were to go out because they lift by the end of the day</li>
            <li>These eyelashes were surprisingly quick to be delivered and weren&#x27;t smashed at all.</li>
            <li>Cute lashes, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re easy to apply but my lashes are curly making it harder for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;ve got a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>my ardell lashes, can definitely say these are better then ardell:)</li>
            <li>Quick shipping</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>No other retailer that I have experience have anything on these eye catching beauties.  </li>
            <li>These are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I trim them a tiny bit for more everyday wear and they look perfect!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these lashes because they not only can be used for either eye; depending on which end you trim, but the stem is so light and comfortable</li>
            <li>I love the look, they&#x27;re light weight and more natural looking and the clear strip is a plus,  </li>
            <li>they are very stiff and you would need a very good glue and a lot of practice</li>
            <li>Lashes look exactly like this picture!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to the ardell demi lashes but a lot cheaper and you get more!</li>
            <li>The synthetic are cheap and pretty much look cheap too.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this brand in the past and totally loved them!</li>
            <li>Pretty!</li>
            <li>they are a great length i wish they were a little longer for my taste</li>
            <li>Very flexible and light weight.</li>
            <li>but definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely  worth it for the price..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>and i would buy this product again and it looks natural and its completely comfortable to wear!</li>
            <li>But I was looking for something very specific (the kind of lashes in the picture).</li>
            <li>üëçtakes a longtime for shipment but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>but they are so worth it  .</li>
            <li>They are so soft and feather light!</li>
            <li>A lot more natural than the picture.</li>
            <li>Love these and are not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>We will be at said convention for three days, so the multiple pairs is nice.</li>
            <li>They look real if you put them on right, though so they aren&#x27;t really cheap looking.</li>
            <li>BUT they are the perfect shape to cut in half and do half the eye (mid-outer) which is much easier to apply and so much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>i glue these on top of each other for a better effect.</li>
            <li>right they come off</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>However, do not expect that you will be able to wear as a full lash as the strip doesnt have enough bend to it</li>
            <li>But they are pretty, soft, and I think once I am able to correctly affix them I&#x27;ll give a 5 üòÑ</li>
            <li>very natural looking and are easy to apply</li>
            <li>These lashes are a fantastic value and perfect for a very dramatic look.</li>
            <li>They are super long so I had to cut them a bit to fit the shape and length of my eye, if you have prime and can get free shipping</li>
            <li>The lashes look pretty when they&#x27;re cut right.</li>
            <li>There are far better ones on Amazon that are much easier to work with.</li>
            <li>The band is clear, they are easy to apply, and they are reusable</li>
            <li>Synthetic but the shape is good, they are long enough to cut to desired length.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast overall good buy</li>
            <li>Got here sooooo fast!</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>These are actually really well made and worth spending the three bucks on them.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I was iffy at first because of the price</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re willing to take the gamble go ahead.</li>
            <li>I love these definitely order again</li>
            <li>I was reluctant at first to order since things never look like the image..</li>
            <li>The lashes look just like the image- totally natural and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyes really pretty.</li>
            <li>Exactly as they said.</li>
            <li>There more better lashes better price theses are too expensive and there are similar lashes just like these for 1.99 and better</li>
            <li>I really like this lashes!</li>
            <li>this is my second box of these lashes and i am so in love.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered these I got what was pictured &amp; what the description said.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the human hair look &amp; feel that these synthetic lashes give!!!!</li>
            <li>They are light wait and very blendable with your natural lashes.</li>
            <li>I noticed that some of the lashes seems to have more of a flare (shorter lashes on the inner part and longer lashes on the outer part) and others are straight.</li>
            <li>Not good quality great for temporary fix.</li>
            <li>Not all the lashes are the same , some are other lengths but for the price you do get alot of great lashes</li>
            <li>&amp; now I just purchased a couple more boxes it takes a long time to get to me</li>
            <li>Love these lashes, just take too long to get to the USA</li>
            <li>The lashes are actually super soft.</li>
            <li>these are definatley my fav lashes they are super natural and have a mink lash feel to them.</li>
            <li>They were very stiff and plasticky good to wear imperfections but not together they don&#x27;t bend.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the band but other than that they are amazing!</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY recommend these to everyone, plus they are super affordable!</li>
            <li>It looks like human hair and more realistic than the other many lashes i&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li>Very close to the Ardelle wispy lashes.</li>
            <li>blends really well.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this to my friends and family look real.</li>
            <li>they feel so real</li>
            <li>BUT TOO STRAIGHT.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>These are plastic- straight up plastic.</li>
            <li>So much easier to put on.  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re into very think and overbearing lashes for a night out then go ahead</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to wash my face, allowing them to get wet</li>
            <li>They are very think</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really give any length</li>
            <li>They are straight</li>
            <li>Flimsy band, these are definitely after hours appropriate as far as length goes.</li>
            <li>the band is not thick at all !</li>
            <li>Other than that I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>These lashes look nice and are durable in the way they feel, but I think that they look much less natural in person than in the picture.</li>
            <li>Lashes were delivered before estimated delivery daily, that was cool.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed these lashes as well as any at the local beauty supply store only these were priced much lower.</li>
            <li>The price was nice, but I am not sure I am even going to use these.</li>
            <li>But also look natural and pretty.</li>
            <li>They wont give you the volume and full look if you think they are just the same as the photo.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and feel very realistic.</li>
            <li>But overall, I do love the lashes especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I love the way these look on my eyes only thing is I can only wear once.</li>
            <li>I actually just ordered 6 more boxes which should keep me stocked up for the next decade.  </li>
            <li>The only negative is that they took about 3 weeks to be delivered, but extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I would rather spend a little extra to have something more natural looking, but like I mentioned already, these are fine and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>They look very natural!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend</li>
            <li>the only thing is the packaging wasn&#x27;t the best the little white box kinda got smashed so 2 lashes where flat</li>
            <li>Look super natural or you can add mascara for a more dramatic look and are even good for more than one time use I&#x27;m obsessed !</li>
            <li>Hair glue works great for fake eye lashes</li>
            <li>The lashes them selves are long and full.</li>
            <li>would purchase again :) probably will in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again, I normally can reuse my lashes and these were disposed of after one day.</li>
            <li>so it is quite difficult to wear them for a long period of time without having to worry about it moving, even with the best of glues.</li>
            <li>Overall these are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the near future, although they will probably last me a long time since they&#x27;re very durable and reusable!</li>
            <li>The only downfall about these lashes is that they weren&#x27;t stuck to the package, they arrived just hanging in the box and didn&#x27;t really have any form, just a straight strip of lashes..</li>
            <li>the lashes were ruined not even one was in good shape, looked like someone sleeped with these on the put them in the box.. not even one good set in the order TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I like the blend on these lashes they look very natural</li>
            <li>we&#x27;re very natural looking on me to the point that friends would ask &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li>They look so natural!</li>
            <li>and they are natural!</li>
            <li>I turned around and bought another box right away to ensure they would arrive long before these would be used up.</li>
            <li>When I opened the shipping package, the box was slightly crushed, but luckily non of the lashes were damaged.</li>
            <li>And soft, very natural looking...</li>
            <li>I only give a 3 since I&#x27;m New to applying lashes and haven&#x27;t really gotten the hang of it yet.</li>
            <li>Just  a little hard to glue them on but great lashes just like the picture , will purchase it again</li>
            <li>You do have to trim the threading at the end and bend them a little bit to fit you eye.  </li>
            <li>The plastic strip is a bit hard so can be challenging getting them to bend to the shape of your eyes.</li>
            <li>It looks like clear string</li>
            <li>The only thing I didnt like is that they are not really shaped well and the packaging is cheap.</li>
            <li>Just writing this so that it is clear.</li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>They look so natural when I have them on</li>
            <li>it blends with my natural lashes ans</li>
            <li>They were not as natural looking as I thought they would.</li>
            <li>These eyelashes look natural üòÅ</li>
            <li>so soft</li>
            <li>I always get a lot of complements with these lashes because they look so natural.</li>
            <li>so I wore an old pair (not from this company, a Walmart or Beauty Supply).  </li>
            <li>so the nearly 2mths I waited is alright with me.</li>
            <li>Look natural.  </li>
            <li>They dont stay on long because they are so straight!</li>
            <li>These lashes are the same legnth from left to right.</li>
            <li>The lashes are incredibly stiff at first and they are packages bine straight.</li>
            <li>Many times, the left and right lashes are uneven, giving an uneven look to the eye.</li>
            <li>The ones that I received are not thick enough</li>
            <li>I live in California placed the order on June 16th, then it finally arrived today at June 30th.</li>
            <li>Ordering two boxes next time, I wear them daily and get compliments all the time, and no one knows they aren&#x27;t my real lashes.</li>
            <li>and I love that the band is thin and clear.</li>
            <li>Super uneven.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>Constantly have to add more glue throughout the day that&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I love these i use them everyday!!!</li>
            <li>You WILL have to trim off the sides where the clear band is but for ten pairs of well made lashes</li>
            <li>And when I opened the package the lashes were so soft tlits similar to ardells wispie lashes.</li>
            <li>Would re purchase again similar to ardell Demi whispies if u like a natural look buy these</li>
            <li>These are some of my favorite false  Eyelashes.</li>
            <li>When you put them on, they are just like kind of spare long false eyelashes</li>
            <li>less than 3$.  Theyre full and long.  </li>
            <li>The only real issue I had was the length of shipping time and the bands are a bit stiff so trimming, adding more glue, and holding down the inner third of the lash until they set is sometimes necessary.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with them , they look natural but from the pictures they look longer and thicker then in person , so I plan to wear them when I&#x27;m going for a less dramatic look</li>
            <li>There are several pairs and they are not of bad quality great for an evening out or costumes.</li>
            <li>cheaper.these look exactly the same for not even half the cost</li>
            <li>They look natural yet long and noticeable.</li>
            <li>they give you a natural look without being too long.</li>
            <li>Long lasting wear and looks natural!</li>
            <li>The shipping takes a little long but definitely worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>These are the better quality plastic eyelashes, which I don&#x27;t usually like for everyday style/use.</li>
            <li>Not very long not long at all very short!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love Ardell wispies.</li>
            <li> either I&#x27;m better with two coats of mascara</li>
            <li> I reach for them more often then</li>
            <li> ON HAND WHEN I RUN OUT OF MY FAVORITE LASHES.</li>
            <li> IM IN LOVE WITH THESE</li>
            <li> These lashes are better quality than some I&#x27;ve purchased from overseas.</li>
            <li> I see many reviews about the trimming and length</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> They are okay.</li>
            <li> Im about to order 4 more</li>
            <li> Nice they came when excepted and where very useful on my clients</li>
            <li> As far as the lashes themselves, beautiful. :)</li>
            <li> Great quality, very natural looking!</li>
            <li> These are very good quality for the price, and they arrived super fast.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good for just a dollar</li>
            <li> Beautiful natural looking eyelashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try them out!</li>
            <li> the lashes are a lot wider than most, but are easily trimmed.</li>
            <li> To give them a better shape I just wrapped the rim of the eyelash around the tip of my finger to give it more of a curve which helped fit to the curve of my eye when I applied them.</li>
            <li> Love them light an airy</li>
            <li> So they aren&#x27;t completely fuss-free but for the value they are a great for go-to fab lash for your beauty kit on a budget</li>
            <li> and these are the most comfortable.</li>
            <li> They are a really good price because phone pair of lashes are about how much these are.</li>
            <li> Very light and comfy, lots of fun to put on!  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of whisppies...if I spelled it right!!</li>
            <li> Thx goods cool!</li>
            <li> Other than that, they are great!</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t bend as easily.</li>
            <li> they are all in place but easy to remove from the packaging.</li>
            <li> such beautiful lashes for the price.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and I am very particular on the products I use, and again, I LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li> Light and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Given the mixed reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure how these lashes would turn out to be, BUT they are amazing!</li>
            <li> I love these thanks a million!!</li>
            <li> I love it as much!!</li>
            <li> And about once a week, I take them off to clean and since they retain their shape so beautifully, I just place them back on.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a huge steal.&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#34;ll</li>
            <li> Crazy price, excellent, feel great, wear again and again.  </li>
            <li> These lashes are SO cheap (</li>
            <li> they are such a great value.</li>
            <li> Fabulous lashes for under $2.</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t even fit</li>
            <li> I could not use them because they looked too cheap</li>
            <li> They look fabulous on camera</li>
            <li> But i could do without the extra plastic hanging off the ends and the bonus fly..</li>
            <li> They just need to be trimmed to fit the eye and then applied with eyelash glue (bought separately).</li>
            <li> Nice lashes and fairly fast shipping</li>
            <li> Put them on with a light mascara like lengthening to taper tips then add a coat of a thickening mascara</li>
            <li> Truthfully, these are worth the wait.</li>
            <li> so cheap bought two types to try but started breaking out around my eyes every time i wore them.</li>
            <li> Comfortable.</li>
            <li> Look cheap and crappy</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be such good quality for cheap price!</li>
            <li> The price was great, but keep in mind that these lashes are packaged flat, which means they&#x27;re not the easiest to apply.</li>
            <li> advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i got them</li>
            <li> so I was so excited.</li>
            <li> They are long and it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> I prefer thicker bands but they&#x27;re pretty cute.</li>
            <li> i wished they shipped faster but worth the wait!</li>
            <li> be ordering these hopefully next a bulk batch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast shipping and very good packaging it didn&#x27;t come damaged at all.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I like them because the change to my eye is subtle...easy to remove, clean, and re use...</li>
            <li> The hair bristles are soft which I love!</li>
            <li> They are beautiful for the price but the shipping is pretty long</li>
            <li> And that was the only good thing about them.</li>
            <li> I love the look the lashes can achieve, but one of the things I don&#x27;t really like about them is the inconsistency in the product.</li>
            <li> Ok to wear a pair of leashes maybe twice, if you don&#x27;t get a whole bunch of makeup on it.</li>
            <li> they look full and</li>
            <li> Goods cool shipped to me within the time they said they would.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re not bad though.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and look more natural than some others that I tried.</li>
            <li> the more you wear them the more natural they become at first</li>
            <li> Ehhhhh, not my favorite lol the band to the lashes are super hard to work with, but for the price you can&#x27;t complain I wouldn&#x27;t use these if I were to go out because they lift by the end of the day</li>
            <li> These eyelashes were surprisingly quick to be delivered and weren&#x27;t smashed at all.</li>
            <li> Cute lashes, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re easy to apply but my lashes are curly making it harder for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;ve got a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> my ardell lashes, can definitely say these are better then ardell:)</li>
            <li> Quick shipping</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> No other retailer that I have experience have anything on these eye catching beauties.  </li>
            <li> These are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I trim them a tiny bit for more everyday wear and they look perfect!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lashes because they not only can be used for either eye; depending on which end you trim, but the stem is so light and comfortable</li>
            <li> I love the look, they&#x27;re light weight and more natural looking and the clear strip is a plus,  </li>
            <li> they are very stiff and you would need a very good glue and a lot of practice</li>
            <li> Lashes look exactly like this picture!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to the ardell demi lashes but a lot cheaper and you get more!</li>
            <li> The synthetic are cheap and pretty much look cheap too.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this brand in the past and totally loved them!</li>
            <li> Pretty!</li>
            <li> they are a great length i wish they were a little longer for my taste</li>
            <li> Very flexible and light weight.</li>
            <li> but definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely  worth it for the price..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> and i would buy this product again and it looks natural and its completely comfortable to wear!</li>
            <li> But I was looking for something very specific (the kind of lashes in the picture).</li>
            <li> üëçtakes a longtime for shipment but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> but they are so worth it  .</li>
            <li> They are so soft and feather light!</li>
            <li> A lot more natural than the picture.</li>
            <li> Love these and are not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> We will be at said convention for three days, so the multiple pairs is nice.</li>
            <li> They look real if you put them on right, though so they aren&#x27;t really cheap looking.</li>
            <li> BUT they are the perfect shape to cut in half and do half the eye (mid-outer) which is much easier to apply and so much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> i glue these on top of each other for a better effect.</li>
            <li> right they come off</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> However, do not expect that you will be able to wear as a full lash as the strip doesnt have enough bend to it</li>
            <li> But they are pretty, soft, and I think once I am able to correctly affix them I&#x27;ll give a 5 üòÑ</li>
            <li> very natural looking and are easy to apply</li>
            <li> These lashes are a fantastic value and perfect for a very dramatic look.</li>
            <li> They are super long so I had to cut them a bit to fit the shape and length of my eye, if you have prime and can get free shipping</li>
            <li> The lashes look pretty when they&#x27;re cut right.</li>
            <li> There are far better ones on Amazon that are much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> The band is clear, they are easy to apply, and they are reusable</li>
            <li> Synthetic but the shape is good, they are long enough to cut to desired length.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast overall good buy</li>
            <li> Got here sooooo fast!</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These are actually really well made and worth spending the three bucks on them.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I was iffy at first because of the price</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re willing to take the gamble go ahead.</li>
            <li> I love these definitely order again</li>
            <li> I was reluctant at first to order since things never look like the image..</li>
            <li> The lashes look just like the image- totally natural and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes really pretty.</li>
            <li> Exactly as they said.</li>
            <li> There more better lashes better price theses are too expensive and there are similar lashes just like these for 1.99 and better</li>
            <li> I really like this lashes!</li>
            <li> this is my second box of these lashes and i am so in love.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered these I got what was pictured &amp; what the description said.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the human hair look &amp; feel that these synthetic lashes give!!!!</li>
            <li> They are light wait and very blendable with your natural lashes.</li>
            <li> I noticed that some of the lashes seems to have more of a flare (shorter lashes on the inner part and longer lashes on the outer part) and others are straight.</li>
            <li> Not good quality great for temporary fix.</li>
            <li> Not all the lashes are the same , some are other lengths but for the price you do get alot of great lashes</li>
            <li> &amp; now I just purchased a couple more boxes it takes a long time to get to me</li>
            <li> Love these lashes, just take too long to get to the USA</li>
            <li> The lashes are actually super soft.</li>
            <li> these are definatley my fav lashes they are super natural and have a mink lash feel to them.</li>
            <li> They were very stiff and plasticky good to wear imperfections but not together they don&#x27;t bend.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the band but other than that they are amazing!</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY recommend these to everyone, plus they are super affordable!</li>
            <li> It looks like human hair and more realistic than the other many lashes i&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li> Very close to the Ardelle wispy lashes.</li>
            <li> blends really well.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this to my friends and family look real.</li>
            <li> they feel so real</li>
            <li> BUT TOO STRAIGHT.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> These are plastic- straight up plastic.</li>
            <li> So much easier to put on.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re into very think and overbearing lashes for a night out then go ahead</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to wash my face, allowing them to get wet</li>
            <li> They are very think</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really give any length</li>
            <li> They are straight</li>
            <li> Flimsy band, these are definitely after hours appropriate as far as length goes.</li>
            <li> the band is not thick at all !</li>
            <li> Other than that I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> These lashes look nice and are durable in the way they feel, but I think that they look much less natural in person than in the picture.</li>
            <li> Lashes were delivered before estimated delivery daily, that was cool.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed these lashes as well as any at the local beauty supply store only these were priced much lower.</li>
            <li> The price was nice, but I am not sure I am even going to use these.</li>
            <li> But also look natural and pretty.</li>
            <li> They wont give you the volume and full look if you think they are just the same as the photo.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and feel very realistic.</li>
            <li> But overall, I do love the lashes especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the way these look on my eyes only thing is I can only wear once.</li>
            <li> I actually just ordered 6 more boxes which should keep me stocked up for the next decade.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that they took about 3 weeks to be delivered, but extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I would rather spend a little extra to have something more natural looking, but like I mentioned already, these are fine and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> They look very natural!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> the only thing is the packaging wasn&#x27;t the best the little white box kinda got smashed so 2 lashes where flat</li>
            <li> Look super natural or you can add mascara for a more dramatic look and are even good for more than one time use I&#x27;m obsessed !</li>
            <li> Hair glue works great for fake eye lashes</li>
            <li> The lashes them selves are long and full.</li>
            <li> would purchase again :) probably will in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again, I normally can reuse my lashes and these were disposed of after one day.</li>
            <li> so it is quite difficult to wear them for a long period of time without having to worry about it moving, even with the best of glues.</li>
            <li> Overall these are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the near future, although they will probably last me a long time since they&#x27;re very durable and reusable!</li>
            <li> The only downfall about these lashes is that they weren&#x27;t stuck to the package, they arrived just hanging in the box and didn&#x27;t really have any form, just a straight strip of lashes..</li>
            <li> the lashes were ruined not even one was in good shape, looked like someone sleeped with these on the put them in the box.. not even one good set in the order TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the blend on these lashes they look very natural</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re very natural looking on me to the point that friends would ask &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li> They look so natural!</li>
            <li> and they are natural!</li>
            <li> I turned around and bought another box right away to ensure they would arrive long before these would be used up.</li>
            <li> When I opened the shipping package, the box was slightly crushed, but luckily non of the lashes were damaged.</li>
            <li> And soft, very natural looking...</li>
            <li> I only give a 3 since I&#x27;m New to applying lashes and haven&#x27;t really gotten the hang of it yet.</li>
            <li> Just  a little hard to glue them on but great lashes just like the picture , will purchase it again</li>
            <li> You do have to trim the threading at the end and bend them a little bit to fit you eye.  </li>
            <li> The plastic strip is a bit hard so can be challenging getting them to bend to the shape of your eyes.</li>
            <li> It looks like clear string</li>
            <li> The only thing I didnt like is that they are not really shaped well and the packaging is cheap.</li>
            <li> Just writing this so that it is clear.</li>
            <li> Arrived early.</li>
            <li> They look so natural when I have them on</li>
            <li> it blends with my natural lashes ans</li>
            <li> They were not as natural looking as I thought they would.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes look natural üòÅ</li>
            <li> so soft</li>
            <li> I always get a lot of complements with these lashes because they look so natural.</li>
            <li> so I wore an old pair (not from this company, a Walmart or Beauty Supply).  </li>
            <li> so the nearly 2mths I waited is alright with me.</li>
            <li> Look natural.  </li>
            <li> They dont stay on long because they are so straight!</li>
            <li> These lashes are the same legnth from left to right.</li>
            <li> The lashes are incredibly stiff at first and they are packages bine straight.</li>
            <li> Many times, the left and right lashes are uneven, giving an uneven look to the eye.</li>
            <li> The ones that I received are not thick enough</li>
            <li> I live in California placed the order on June 16th, then it finally arrived today at June 30th.</li>
            <li> Ordering two boxes next time, I wear them daily and get compliments all the time, and no one knows they aren&#x27;t my real lashes.</li>
            <li> and I love that the band is thin and clear.</li>
            <li> Super uneven.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Constantly have to add more glue throughout the day that&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I love these i use them everyday!!!</li>
            <li> You WILL have to trim off the sides where the clear band is but for ten pairs of well made lashes</li>
            <li> And when I opened the package the lashes were so soft tlits similar to ardells wispie lashes.</li>
            <li> Would re purchase again similar to ardell Demi whispies if u like a natural look buy these</li>
            <li> These are some of my favorite false  Eyelashes.</li>
            <li> When you put them on, they are just like kind of spare long false eyelashes</li>
            <li> less than 3$.  Theyre full and long.  </li>
            <li> The only real issue I had was the length of shipping time and the bands are a bit stiff so trimming, adding more glue, and holding down the inner third of the lash until they set is sometimes necessary.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with them , they look natural but from the pictures they look longer and thicker then in person , so I plan to wear them when I&#x27;m going for a less dramatic look</li>
            <li> There are several pairs and they are not of bad quality great for an evening out or costumes.</li>
            <li> cheaper.these look exactly the same for not even half the cost</li>
            <li> They look natural yet long and noticeable.</li>
            <li> they give you a natural look without being too long.</li>
            <li> Long lasting wear and looks natural!</li>
            <li> The shipping takes a little long but definitely worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> These are the better quality plastic eyelashes, which I don&#x27;t usually like for everyday style/use.</li>
            <li> Not very long not long at all very short!!</li>
            <li> so it takes a while for them to curve to a natural eyelash shape, but very thick, came in exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> Now for shipping they actually came 2 weeks earlier then expected</li>
            <li> You know how other lashes come with one side shorter than the other, because that&#x27;s how natural lashes grow?</li>
            <li> These were a bit too long</li>
            <li> The are long like clown eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes come attached to string that is way to long.</li>
            <li> To long and un-natural looking</li>
            <li> I just received my lashes not too long ago.</li>
            <li> they are too long for me.</li>
            <li> Wish the band was slightly larger because I find them harder to hang on through out the day</li>
            <li> The actual individual lash hairs are thick and shiny but soft.</li>
            <li> The front of these lashes are too thick and they look very unnatural, and there is no bend to these lashes, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The corners are short and awkward because instead of having short corners for both eyes the lashes only have short corners for the right eye.  </li>
            <li> Neither side of the lashes has that smaller side than the other.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the band is a little different than I am used to.</li>
            <li> it came in earlier then i expected!</li>
            <li> They even arrived a couple weeks earlier then I expected!</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviews,  i got the same lashes advertised, if not thicker.  </li>
            <li> I wear eyelashes every single day.</li>
            <li> Ive used  single strip eyelashes from the store</li>
            <li> a single pair of these at the beauty supply are around five bucks</li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked was the band little stiff and the way it is packaged the band is straight.</li>
            <li> the box was slightly damaged and the lengths of each lash are not the same.</li>
            <li> Took very long to get here and they are very difficult to mold to eye shape, they come in a straight foward line and whenever are bent return to the original shape,making them very hard to glue, since they keep coming off instantly</li>
            <li> I cut them individually and put th little chunks one by one.</li>
            <li> smell to them.....which can be a problem when your crying and your mate can&#x27;t console you because the ones made by popular companies here in the US smell badly when they become wet.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the lashes are longest in the middle of the eye</li>
            <li> They will last for a few wears.</li>
            <li> Which is not much.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re shorter than expected.  </li>
            <li> the shipping was faster than i expected</li>
            <li> They arrived sooner than I expected them too</li>
            <li> were not the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve to be careful with the edges to glue</li>
            <li> They arrived 1 week sooner that expected, will buy again.</li>
            <li> expected longer ones</li>
            <li> It arrived with no damage and just what I expected.</li>
            <li> They are stiffer or harder than the Ardell Lashes.  </li>
            <li> In the photo you can tell the difference as I am wearing them on one eye and not the other</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected!</li>
            <li> I usually use human hair lashes</li>
            <li> Not to much not to little !!!!</li>
            <li> I was worried that I was going to get the wrong lashes delivered to me after reading other reviews about recieving the wrong kind.</li>
            <li> The cut is very similar, but these are indeed artificial lashes and therefore have a sheen to it that real lashes do not have.</li>
            <li> They are just thick enough to boost up your natural lash without looking ridiculous.</li>
            <li> anyone who loves natural thick lashes, these are the ones to go for!</li>
            <li> but they are too expensive for how much I use ans lose them.  </li>
            <li> Adds so much volume with out looking too fake üíú</li>
            <li> so I just cut them in half and use them as demi lashes.</li>
            <li> so tight sown</li>
            <li> My eyelashes came on time but the package came a little smashed,but it didn&#x27;t mess up the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They just are NOT natural looking on because they&#x27;re stiff and hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> Wish the shipping was a little faster.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for everyday use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Used them for a few parties.  </li>
            <li> but I would not use these for everyday.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for everyday use because they are not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I wear them everyday</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I received them and</li>
            <li> There not real and not nice to wear.</li>
            <li> They are a little stiff but not unmanageable.</li>
            <li> KINDA STIFF, BUT FOR THE MONEY ...</li>
            <li> I was nervous that they would be stiff and plastic</li>
            <li> The band is a bit thin and they&#x27;re quite long, but that&#x27;s what trimming scissors are for.</li>
            <li> Stiff very stiff.</li>
            <li> I was really shocked it came that fast some shipping would take months for me because of some of these sellers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear ardell wispies usually I wanted to try something</li>
            <li> They have that shine on them that makes them look extra fake.</li>
            <li> So this is the teason fpr such a poor rate!</li>
            <li> Not sure whats in them.</li>
            <li> So stiff, so hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> only bad thing is that it took a month to come,but that was expected.</li>
            <li> When I did trim the lashes to fit my lids, the lash base was a little difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kinda hard for other people to tell they&#x27;re false</li>
            <li> A little too dramatic for everyday, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> They are very stiff</li>
            <li> They are very stiff and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I am a hard sell when it comes to lashes that I buy overseas.</li>
            <li> i had spent over 10.00 dollars at sallys in 5 years iwn eyelasher an fake hair for work.</li>
            <li> Did not like the lashes very stiff and just not good .</li>
            <li> they have a little fake look to them</li>
            <li> They are hard to put on too!</li>
            <li> Took a long time to receive and threw them away they looked so bad.</li>
            <li> Everyones always second guessing wether my lashes are real or fake.</li>
            <li> The first wear was terrible.</li>
            <li> Extremely slow!</li>
            <li> and I already have thin lashes</li>
            <li> poorly made</li>
            <li> Other than that they were painful because the material was made of what seemed like plastic...</li>
            <li> My holy grail seriously!</li>
            <li> if I ever do halloween makeup &amp; I decide I need really dramatic</li>
            <li> Too dramatic for my liking</li>
            <li> , faux looking lashes maybe for a creepy doll look or something.</li>
            <li> Quite uncomfortable</li>
            <li> so fake</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with these lashes.</li>
            <li> but they are extremely difficult to apply..</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the price</li>
            <li> cause they&#x27;re also uncomfortable</li>
            <li> No one could tell they were false!</li>
            <li> These are very difficult to put on because they are lined with a very thick price of plastic which needs to be trimmed.</li>
            <li> i like these lashes but the bad is really thin</li>
            <li> Horrible stiffness due to fishline holding lashes together.  </li>
            <li> The lashes I&#x27;ve bought from OTHER sellers have been terrible.</li>
            <li> I know these lashes are artificial, but the picture made me have a glimmer of hope that they wouldn&#x27;t be shiny; but</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t curve to the shape of your eyelids, which makes it very difficult for you to get them on let alone stay on...</li>
            <li> Received wrong lashes, very disappointed</li>
            <li> But when I opened it I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate</li>
            <li> My dtr and I was very very disappointed</li>
            <li> These were the worst looking lashes ever.</li>
            <li> these are awful.</li>
            <li> terrible lashes they don&#x27;t even lay correctly</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it! Reminds me of whisppies...if I spelled it right!! Lol</li>
            <li> Got here sooooo fast! I&#x27;m excited to try them out! There beautiful  and I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be such good quality for cheap price!</li>
            <li> These were a very good price. And that was the only good thing about them. Other than that they were painful because the material was made of what seemed like plastic... So I gave them away to my sister... And well... She ended up throwing them away for the same reason uncomfortable/painful!</li>
            <li> Horrible stiffness due to fishline holding lashes together.  Not applicable and I wear lashes all the time for years</li>
            <li> Love my lashes, fantastic price!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular. Gets the job done:</li>
            <li> I really love these lashes I reorder them again I will always order these from now on!!!! look like my own lashes</li>
            <li> I like the blend on these lashes they look very natural so I&#x27;m glad I got a good amount of them for this price.</li>
            <li> found it!! I&#x27;ve tried every type but this ones the best. Everyones always second guessing wether my lashes are real or fake.</li>
            <li> The hair bristles are soft which I love! The plastic strip is a bit hard so can be challenging getting them to bend to the shape of your eyes. Once on, they look amazing. Very close to the Ardelle wispy lashes.</li>
            <li> A little too dramatic for everyday, in my opinion. They look real if you put them on right, though so they aren&#x27;t really cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Item is as advertised &amp; shipping time!! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I wear ardell wispies usually I wanted to try something cheaper.these look exactly the same for not even half the cost and you get way more. I will be ordering these from now on instead of ardell rip off lashes. They also arrived a month earlier than they were supposed to.</li>
            <li> These Are My Favorite Pair Of Eye Lashes üòòüëè‚úåÔ∏èüëçüëç They&#x27;re Full And Beautiful</li>
            <li> Just got these..took a while..but definitely worth the wait. These are perfect to wear when having a girls night out.  Could wear during the day as well..(they are a bit scandalous for the day) either way love love love them!!! Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> Lashes look exactly like this picture! Speedy delivery</li>
            <li> Look great on me I love it</li>
            <li> I purchased these in lieu of buying the Salon Perfect Demi Wispies that I love (4 pairs for about $10). They are a good length but you will need to trim the ends off (they&#x27;re just for packaging). The lashes them selves are long and full. I believe they are synthetic hair. The actual individual lash hairs are thick and shiny but soft. They are a little stiff but not unmanageable. They will last for a few wears. The only complaint I have is that the lashes are longest in the middle of the eye and I prefer them to me longest at the outer corner. In the photo you can tell the difference as I am wearing them on one eye and not the other</li>
            <li> love these lashes!! My holy grail seriously! Can&#x27;t live without them and best part is I can use them twice!!!</li>
            <li> 10 pairs for $3? Yes, please! These are very pretty. The band is a bit thin and they&#x27;re quite long, but that&#x27;s what trimming scissors are for. I would definitely buy these again, if I didn&#x27;t need them in a hurry bc it does take a while to ship. As far as the lashes themselves, beautiful. :)</li>
            <li> Dont buy it. Waste of money</li>
            <li> love em. blends really well. would purchase again :) probably will in a few weeks. i keep giving some to my friends to try em out and they like em as well :)</li>
            <li> lashes came before delivery date, looks just like photo, and can&#x27;t beat the price! the only thing is the packaging wasn&#x27;t the best the little white box kinda got smashed so 2 lashes where flat</li>
            <li> The lashes are actually super soft. They come in an adorable package, &amp; look great in the box! Once you put them on........ it&#x27;s a different story. They have that shine on them that makes them look extra fake. Neither side of the lashes has that smaller side than the other. You know how other lashes come with one side shorter than the other, because that&#x27;s how natural lashes grow? Yeah. These lashes are the same legnth from left to right. Yikes. I&#x27;d keep them around for if I ever do halloween makeup &amp; I decide I need really dramatic, faux looking lashes maybe for a creepy doll look or something. It doesn&#x27;t seem like these were made for anything else. You get exactly what you pay for. Which is not much. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments while wearing these , there def nice for the price point , I&#x27;ll definately order again !</li>
            <li> Pretty good for just a dollar</li>
            <li> These lashes are SO cheap (price wise) but I didn&#x27;t personally like the look of them. They&#x27;re a bit too short for my liking.</li>
            <li> They are very stiff and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely  worth it for the price.. You get several pairs. I would rather spend a little extra to have something more natural looking, but like I mentioned already, these are fine and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> These are actually really well made and worth spending the three bucks on them. You WILL have to trim off the sides where the clear band is but for ten pairs of well made lashes it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat these lashes! There are several pairs and they are not of bad quality great for an evening out or costumes. They are super long so I had to cut them a bit to fit the shape and length of my eye, if you have prime and can get free shipping these are a must buy</li>
            <li> They are pretty great for the price.The only thing is the band is a little different than I am used to.It looks like clear string and you have to clip the ends but besides that they get the job done well.My eyelashes came on time but the package came a little smashed,but it didn&#x27;t mess up the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I wear eyelashes every single day. I was so excited when i got them I thought I was getting a good deal. What a disappoinment!! They are very stiff I could not get them to bend and stay glued. The material is too shiny so they instantly look fake..with the walmart lashes some people think they are natural.i will stick with those.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchased. Shipped fast. Great quality!!</li>
            <li> Nice they came when excepted and where very useful on my clients</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re shorter than expected.  Came in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> What a difference eye lashes make once you learn how to put them on</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are full and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> These eye lashes are just like demi eye lashes. 90 percent cheaper then Sally. I will be back for more. With he right glue the go on great!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes were surprisingly quick to be delivered and weren&#x27;t smashed at all. Great price! Great product!</li>
            <li> I love the price. I love the look the lashes can achieve, but one of the things I don&#x27;t really like about them is the inconsistency in the product. I noticed that some of the lashes seems to have more of a flare (shorter lashes on the inner part and longer lashes on the outer part) and others are straight. When I did trim the lashes to fit my lids, the lash base was a little difficult to work with. It just didn&#x27;t bend as easily. But overall, I do love the lashes especially for the price.</li>
            <li> My lashes do not look like these in the picture</li>
            <li> The first wear was terrible. The lashes are incredibly stiff at first and they are packages bine straight. But once you bend them over night the wear is amazing I love them they are such a great value. I wear them to work and out on the town</li>
            <li> Great quality, very natural looking! My clients love them. Very impressed, especially for the wonderfully affordable price ;)</li>
            <li> Great find very nice lashes remind me of Ardel Wispies</li>
            <li> Fabulous lashes for under $2. Quite uncomfortable and you have to use a stronger lash glue. Not recommended for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Love this eyelashes! This is my 2nd perches and I just can&#x27;t have inofe of this eyelashes! They look so natural! Def recommended !</li>
            <li> These were the worst looking lashes ever. They looked  so fake I hate I purchased them plus it took over 3wks for them to arrive. My dtr and I was very very disappointed</li>
            <li> Arrived early. I like them.</li>
            <li> it came in earlier then i expected! the packaging is so cute i love it and i would buy this product again and it looks natural and its completely comfortable to wear!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing lashes for years and these are the bomb!!!! Light and easy to put on. They look natural yet long and noticeable. I love these . Definitely ordering again</li>
            <li> These were a bit too long so I just cut them in half and use them as demi lashes.</li>
            <li> the lashes were ruined not even one was in good shape, looked like someone sleeped with these on the put them in the box.. not even one good set in the order TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very light and comfy, lots of fun to put on!  I cut them individually and put th little chunks one by one.</li>
            <li> I love these i use them everyday!!! They are so cute and make your eyes pop üòÅ</li>
            <li> These are my favorite ones to buy. It&#x27;s similar to the ardell demi lashes but a lot cheaper and you get more! Ok to wear a pair of leashes maybe twice, if you don&#x27;t get a whole bunch of makeup on it.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes!! They look so natural when I have them on, sometimes I forget I have them on!! Totally would buy again when I&#x27;m all out!!!</li>
            <li> Received wrong lashes, very disappointed And they don&#x27;t even fit right they come off</li>
            <li> The front of these lashes are too thick and they look very unnatural, and there is no bend to these lashes, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes they are my favorite !!!!! I recommend these :)</li>
            <li> Love these!!!!! I was iffy at first because of the price but I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Synthetic but the shape is good, they are long enough to cut to desired length.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast overall good buy</li>
            <li> Love them light an airy</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
            <li> The quality is not that great, when I wear them they peel up at the ends. Constantly have to add more glue throughout the day that&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Great lashes and the price, who can resist!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and quantity!</li>
            <li> just how i like my lashes they look full and i like that it blends with my natural lashes ans the shipping was faster than i expected</li>
            <li> They arrived sooner than I expected them too so I was so excited. But when I opened it I was so disappointed. They are completed not what is in the pictures. They are a really good price because phone pair of lashes are about how much these are. So, if you&#x27;re willing to take the gamble go ahead. But I was looking for something very specific (the kind of lashes in the picture).</li>
            <li> These are actually really great lashes, there is a bunch..and you can cut them to the size you need. They are light wait and very blendable with your natural lashes. The shipping took 2 weeks but they are coming from a different country. I&#x27;d def buy them again.</li>
            <li> love the way they look! I am definitely going to order them again when i run out!!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with these lashes. They were not as natural looking as I thought they would. I did not like the mounting of them either.</li>
            <li> These are really nice lashes! They are very soft and feel very realistic. Came on time and packaged nicely. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> were not the quality I expected. I could not use them because they looked too cheap</li>
            <li> Just like Ardell Demi Whispies.. I love these definitely order again</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re awesome! with a bit of glue they&#x27;ll stay all day! :D you&#x27;ve to be careful with the edges to glue right but i have no complains &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Okay for the price, you cant beat it. However, do not expect that you will be able to wear as a full lash as the strip doesnt have enough bend to it so it keeps popping up. BUT they are the perfect shape to cut in half and do half the eye (mid-outer) which is much easier to apply and so much more comfortable.  Also it looks great. So your 10pair turn into 20 pair and I get a good 3-5 uses out of mine so great buy if you ask me.</li>
            <li> such beautiful lashes for the price. Will definitely be buying from them again.</li>
            <li> These were great! They sell the same lashes in the beauty supply store for triple the amount but I was so happy I found these alternatives. they are great for ocassional photo shoots</li>
            <li> These are great eyelashes! Ive used  single strip eyelashes from the store and ive also bought wholesale synthetic.  They store bought are nice but they are too expensive for how much I use ans lose them.  The synthetic are cheap and pretty much look cheap too. But these are a good mix between the two. The only thing I didnt like is that they are not really shaped well and the packaging is cheap. To give them a better shape I just wrapped the rim of the eyelash around the tip of my finger to give it more of a curve which helped fit to the curve of my eye when I applied them. Other than that I absolutely love them. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Finally got my eye lashes they look awesome I would definitely get these again because come one 10 for less than 3$.  Theyre full and long.  I love these thanks a million!!</li>
            <li> Perfect love that the strip is clear and that there is more length so you don&#x27;t damage the lashes pulling them off the stickers!</li>
            <li> Flimsy band, these are definitely after hours appropriate as far as length goes. Definitely not the best quality on the market but they served their purpose.</li>
            <li> These can be worn daily. I like them because the change to my eye is subtle...easy to remove, clean, and re use...they arrived before the shipping date.</li>
            <li> Looks similar to Ardell Demi Wispies only bad thing is that it took a month to come,but that was expected.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes look natural üòÅ</li>
            <li> I love the way these look on my eyes only thing is I can only wear once.</li>
            <li> I love these these are perfect to practice with.  yes they do look very natural for perfect looking lashes but they are extremely difficult to apply.. they are very stiff and you would need a very good glue and a lot of practice</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. I honestly don&#x27;t know why anyone gave them a good review though. The are long like clown eyelashes. And they don&#x27;t curve to the shape of your eyelids, which makes it very difficult for you to get them on let alone stay on...DO NOT PURCHASE THESE!</li>
            <li> They are beautiful for the price but the shipping is pretty long</li>
            <li> Lashes were delivered before estimated delivery daily, that was cool. I only give a 3 since I&#x27;m New to applying lashes and haven&#x27;t really gotten the hang of it yet. But they are pretty, soft, and I think once I am able to correctly affix them I&#x27;ll give a 5 üòÑ</li>
            <li> love it I will recommend this to my friends and family look real.üëçtakes a longtime for shipment but it&#x27;s worth it.love it love it........üòÑ</li>
            <li> I have ordered this brand in the past and totally loved them! BUT I&#x27;m dissapointed with this recent order because I did not get the ones I wanted and that are shown of course. So this is the teason fpr such a poor rate! The ones that I received are not thick enough but I&#x27;m going to try them.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed these lashes as well as any at the local beauty supply store only these were priced much lower.</li>
            <li> Pretty! I think I bought them all!</li>
            <li> Love these!! So cheap and amazing !! These are great for stacking too :) will buy again</li>
            <li> They are Beautiful! And soft, very natural looking... They arrived 1 week sooner that expected, will buy again.</li>
            <li> These lashes look nice and are durable in the way they feel, but I think that they look much less natural in person than in the picture. The cut is very similar, but these are indeed artificial lashes and therefore have a sheen to it that real lashes do not have. I know these lashes are artificial, but the picture made me have a glimmer of hope that they wouldn&#x27;t be shiny; but they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not bad though.</li>
            <li> Not all the lashes are the same , some are other lengths but for the price you do get alot of great lashes and I love them !</li>
            <li> These are absolutely amazing they&#x27;re so easy to apply and the line that&#x27;s holding them Is see through so it&#x27;s kinda hard for other people to tell they&#x27;re false</li>
            <li> Used them for a few parties.  Got lots if compliments on them.  Very nice for what you pay for them.  Shipped the next day and arrived in about 3 weeks. You do have to trim the threading at the end and bend them a little bit to fit you eye.  Keeps scissors handy.  But over all I love them.  :-)</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected! Will not repurchase! Nothing like ardel demi wispies. I would rather pay more for ardel!</li>
            <li> This lashes are perfect. They&#x27;re so inexpensive and look great! Sometimes I trim them a tiny bit for more everyday wear and they look perfect!</li>
            <li> I live in California placed the order on June 16th, then it finally arrived today at June 30th. I was really shocked it came that fast some shipping would take months for me because of some of these sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the lashes, I know who to order from now on.&lt;br /&gt;These are very similar to Ardell wispies!&lt;br /&gt;but for the affordable price including 10 pairs it&#x27;s a huge steal.&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#34;ll be ordering these hopefully next a bulk batch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast shipping and very good packaging it didn&#x27;t come damaged at all.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who loves natural thick lashes, these are the ones to go for!</li>
            <li> Just  a little hard to glue them on but great lashes just like the picture , will purchase it again</li>
            <li> These are the only eyelashes I order n use!!!!!! I also use them in my YouTube tutorials ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> Amaizing I loved this eyelashes they feel so real so soft the length is amaizing I will be re purchasing this again and again</li>
            <li> Took very long to get here and they are very difficult to mold to eye shape, they come in a straight foward line and whenever are bent return to the original shape,making them very hard to glue, since they keep coming off instantly</li>
            <li> Cute lashes, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re easy to apply but my lashes are curly making it harder for me. Love the casing they come in. Placed the order june 17th, didn&#x27;T come til the 30th.</li>
            <li> They are short ...&lt;br /&gt;I expected longer ones</li>
            <li> You can only expect what you pay for correct? Well honestly, for the price i think these lashes work quite well.  They blended well, I just don&#x27;t recommended using a eyelash curler on them. It over curled my lashes.  but the preference is up to you.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE.  MADE WELL BUT TOO STRAIGHT. They need to be more curved to stay on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> Beautiful natural looking eyelashes</li>
            <li> I was reluctant at first to order since things never look like the image.. Goods cool shipped to me within the time they said they would. The lashes look just like the image- totally natural and comfortable to wear. You cannot beat this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve got a loyal customer. Thx goods cool!</li>
            <li> These are amazing quality for the price! No one could tell they were false! I will be buying more in the near future, although they will probably last me a long time since they&#x27;re very durable and reusable! Very satisfied with my purchase thank you!</li>
            <li> These lashes are a fantastic value and perfect for a very dramatic look. They look fabulous on camera but I would not use these for everyday. The only real issue I had was the length of shipping time and the bands are a bit stiff so trimming, adding more glue, and holding down the inner third of the lash until they set is sometimes necessary. So they aren&#x27;t completely fuss-free but for the value they are a great for go-to fab lash for your beauty kit on a budget :) hope this helps!</li>
            <li> To thin and too cheap</li>
            <li> Not good quality great for temporary fix. I use them for teen glamour parties. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for everyday use because they are not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I havent got mine yet but i love eye lasher. When i was a dancer i wore them all the time. I cant wait to get mine. I didnt know i could order them off line i use to oay 5 dollars a pair from sallys i had spent over 10.00 dollars at sallys in 5 years iwn eyelasher an fake hair for work. Im so happy i found these.. Hair glue works great for fake eye lashes</li>
            <li> I never received this. I would not recommend it to anyone. I have no idea where they sent it to</li>
            <li> I love this lashes!!! It makes my eyes really pretty. The shipping was fast too. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> They wouldn&#x27;t hold their shape.  they were glued so tight sown I tore some trying to get them out.  I woulnt buy them again.</li>
            <li> The items arrived as the schedules and the  eye lashes were in good condition. I have lots of compliments from my  friends and for sure I&#x27;ll buy them some more.</li>
            <li> Awesome lashes for the price! But i could do without the extra plastic hanging off the ends and the bonus fly..</li>
            <li> Exactly as they said. Worked very nicely</li>
            <li> Just got them today they took three weeks to arrive but I dont mind because they came from china , they are very nice I am very pleased with them , they look natural but from the pictures they look longer and thicker then in person , so I plan to wear them when I&#x27;m going for a less dramatic look</li>
            <li> These are plastic- straight up plastic. Just writing this so that it is clear.</li>
            <li> Very great eyelashes I&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
            <li> There more better lashes better price theses are too expensive and there are similar lashes just like these for 1.99 and better</li>
            <li> These are some of my favorite false  Eyelashes. These are very nice and easy to apply! 10 pair for the price is a great deal!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering lashes from this Company and I LOVE them.  I have yet had an issue with them.  The shipping takes a little long but definitely worth the wait.  I always get a lot of complements with these lashes because they look so natural. Will order again and recommend</li>
            <li> Great eyelashes and great price!</li>
            <li> These took forever to receive. What I received is not what I bought. The lashes come attached to string that is way to long. the box was slightly damaged and the lengths of each lash are not the same. The price was nice, but I am not sure I am even going to use these.</li>
            <li> This lashes look like they are human hair lashes-easy to apply, a string on the end helps with application, of course this is to be removed before applying the lashes.  Crazy price, excellent, feel great, wear again and again.  I waited to get them so I wore an old pair (not from this company, a Walmart or Beauty Supply).  They were the the best for all of these lashes. No other retailer that I have experience have anything on these eye catching beauties.  I reallllly can not get over the price, what I have paid for one  pair, I get 10, 10, 10 pair of lashes for 1/2 the price of one.  The only thing that could have made this deal sweeter would have been eyelash glue coming with packet.  Wear them well, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Loved these. Only con for me was having to trim the ends each time. Lashes we&#x27;re very natural looking on me to the point that friends would ask &amp;#34;are those your lashes?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Did not like the lashes very stiff and just not good . I threw them away.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the price but once I placed them on I fell in love with them . I wear them everyday they make my makeup look 10x better the band is not thick at all ! they&#x27;re plastic but they look like hair I usually use human hair lashes but I cannot spot a difference I&#x27;ve already owned some &amp; now I just purchased a couple more boxes it takes a long time to get to me but they are so worth it  .</li>
            <li> I am a hard sell when it comes to lashes that I buy overseas. The lashes I&#x27;ve bought from OTHER sellers have been terrible. I LOVE THESE!!! They are so soft and feather light! I just received them today and I am about to place another, LARGER, order. I am a makeup artist and I am very particular on the products I use, and again, I LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li> To long and un-natural looking</li>
            <li> I just received my lashes not too long ago. And when I opened the package the lashes were so soft tlits similar to ardells wispie lashes. Great purchase. Im definitely going to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love them this is like the 3 time I buy them! I wear them to every occasion I have! They look very natural!</li>
            <li> Look super natural or you can add mascara for a more dramatic look and are even good for more than one time use I&#x27;m obsessed ! And will definitely be repurchasing</li>
            <li> Loved them! Very flexible and light weight. But also look natural and pretty. Great price</li>
            <li> I really like this lashes! they are perfect!</li>
            <li> It exceeded my expectations. They are of good quality and the price was GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I love these.  So much easier to put on.  I&#x27;ve been using ardell and these are better for me.</li>
            <li> These are very good quality for the price, and they arrived super fast.  I love the look, they&#x27;re light weight and more natural looking and the clear strip is a plus,  Definitely recommend.  The only downfall about these lashes is that they weren&#x27;t stuck to the package, they arrived just hanging in the box and didn&#x27;t really have any form, just a straight strip of lashes..</li>
            <li> very natural looking and are easy to apply</li>
            <li> I love Ardell wispies. This is comparable but not totally the same. I love it as much!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again, I normally can reuse my lashes and these were disposed of after one day.</li>
            <li> The band is plastic so it is quite difficult to wear them for a long period of time without having to worry about it moving, even with the best of glues. Too dramatic for my liking but if you&#x27;re into very think and overbearing lashes for a night out then go ahead these will get the job done! Not for me though.</li>
            <li> Love love love these lashes!!! Would re purchase again similar to ardell Demi whispies if u like a natural look buy these</li>
            <li> these are definatley my fav lashes they are super natural and have a mink lash feel to them. the more you wear them the more natural they become at first they have a little fake look to them but you just have to &amp;#34;break them in&amp;#34;. also doubling the eyelashes up adds a lot more volume and they look beautiful. the best part of all is the price :-)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lashes because they not only can be used for either eye; depending on which end you trim, but the stem is so light and comfortable I sleep in them everynignt. And about once a week, I take them off to clean and since they retain their shape so beautifully, I just place them back on.  I actually just ordered 6 more boxes which should keep me stocked up for the next decade.  Believe me, I have tried almost every pair made out there and these are the most comfortable. No popping up on corners and I&#x27;m able to wash my face, allowing them to get wet and there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;perm&amp;#34; smell to them.....which can be a problem when your crying and your mate can&#x27;t console you because the ones made by popular companies here in the US smell badly when they become wet.</li>
            <li> A lot more natural than the picture. They are very short lashes</li>
            <li> They are very think and I already have thin lashes it doesn&#x27;t really give any length either I&#x27;m better with two coats of mascara cause they&#x27;re also uncomfortable</li>
            <li> this is my second box of these lashes and i am so in love. they give you a natural look without being too long. i recommend!</li>
            <li> i definitely like the way they packed these lashes. they are all in place but easy to remove from the packaging. the lashes are a lot wider than most, but are easily trimmed.</li>
            <li> They were very stiff and plasticky good to wear imperfections but not together they don&#x27;t bend. Stiff very stiff. Not very long not long at all very short!!</li>
            <li> These lashes have become my favorite! I reach for them more often then my ardell lashes, can definitely say these are better then ardell:) They came packaged so well, in bubble wrap. The box and lashes were in perfect condition. They even arrived sooner then the time they stated. DEFINITELY recommend these to everyone, plus they are super affordable! I will continue to buy in the future, hope they never go out of stock..</li>
            <li> they are too long for me. They wont give you the volume and full look if you think they are just the same as the photo. When you put them on, they are just like kind of spare long false eyelashes</li>
            <li> Look just like picture. They are long and it&#x27;s a great buy. ONLY thing is it took forever to receive them.</li>
            <li> Love these and are not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Great Lashes!! Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> Very nice. Adds so much volume with out looking too fake üíú</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase! Thank you!</li>
            <li> These lashes aren&#x27;t the easiest to apply. I prefer thicker bands but they&#x27;re pretty cute. I probably wouldn&#x27;t repurchase tho.</li>
            <li> so cheap and look great!</li>
            <li> The eye lashes are beautiful and amazing but they took forever to get to my home. I had to contact the seller for my eye lashes. Other than that, they are great!</li>
            <li> So stiff, so hard to work with.  There are far better ones on Amazon that are much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! Quick shipping and they are natural! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the band but other than that they are amazing!</li>
            <li> KINDA STIFF, BUT FOR THE MONEY ...I CONSIDERED THEM A GOOD DEAL. AND I HAVE THEM ON HAND WHEN I RUN OUT OF MY FAVORITE LASHES.</li>
            <li> Love them! They just need to be trimmed to fit the eye and then applied with eyelash glue (bought separately). Work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love these! They are just thick enough to boost up your natural lash without looking ridiculous. I cut them in 1/2 and use 1 pair on my eyes as an accent lash application. They look great and the price is AMAZING!! It took a while to receive, but for the price they were worth the wait, and when they arrived after I realized how incredible they were I turned around and bought another box right away to ensure they would arrive long before these would be used up. Ordering two boxes next time, I wear them daily and get compliments all the time, and no one knows they aren&#x27;t my real lashes.</li>
            <li> It looks like human hair and more realistic than the other many lashes i&#x27;ve ordered. IM IN LOVE WITH THESE</li>
            <li> i like these lashes but the bad is really thin so i only wear them one time</li>
            <li> Ehhhhh, not my favorite lol the band to the lashes are super hard to work with, but for the price you can&#x27;t complain I wouldn&#x27;t use these if I were to go out because they lift by the end of the day but I use them when I do a make up look &amp; I&#x27;m not planning on going out. Now for shipping they actually came 2 weeks earlier then expected so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> Not as pictured. The first time I ordered these I got what was pictured &amp; what the description said. This time I received a totally different set. Still useable but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> You need to cut off excess plastic off the strip before you can apply.</li>
            <li> Love the lashes! Wish the shipping was a little faster. Extremely slow! but I can&#x27;t complain the lashes were GREAT!</li>
            <li> Nice lashes and fairly fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really loved these lashes if you have used mac lashes they are between 43&#x27;s and 48&#x27;s. The only thing I disliked was the band little stiff and the way it is packaged the band is straight.</li>
            <li> Given the mixed reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure how these lashes would turn out to be, BUT they are amazing! When I opened the shipping package, the box was slightly crushed, but luckily non of the lashes were damaged. The band is clear, they are easy to apply, and they are reusable (I used the same pair twice!) For the price they are truly unbeatable, I will definitely purchase them again! The only negative is that they took about 3 weeks to be delivered, but extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> clear band makes them blend great! a single pair of these at the beauty supply are around five bucks so what a deal! they are a great length i wish they were a little longer for my taste but these are awesome! try them out</li>
            <li> I think these lashes are amazing &amp; GREAT price as well!!!! They even arrived a couple weeks earlier then I expected! Im so buying again!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the human hair look &amp; feel that these synthetic lashes give!!!! I was nervous that they would be stiff and plastic but they are not.</li>
            <li> The lashes look pretty when they&#x27;re cut right. Many times, the left and right lashes are uneven, giving an uneven look to the eye. If they were cut evenly, I would give them five stars.</li>
            <li> I like my product that arrived 2/25 I understand customs is something else so the nearly 2mths I waited is alright with me. It arrived with no damage and just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Good eyelashes for a good price! They are longer, so you will have to trim the edges, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> These lashes are better quality than some I&#x27;ve purchased from overseas. It beats paying 3-6 a pair. The band is translucent and needs just a bit of trimming. Overall these are definitely worth it. Put them on with a light mascara like lengthening to taper tips then add a coat of a thickening mascara and they look beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love them! The are a good replica of ardel DemiWispies üëåüòò‚ú®üíówill purchase again!</li>
            <li> Truthfully, these are worth the wait. I see many reviews about the trimming and length but it&#x27;s very easy! You should always measure and cut before applying. I love them. I recommend for every look because they defiantly will work for anything.</li>
            <li> so cheap bought two types to try but started breaking out around my eyes every time i wore them. Had to toss them all. Not sure whats in them.</li>
            <li> BEST LASHES IVE EVER BOUGHT.</li>
            <li> these are awful. threw them away.  poorly made</li>
            <li> i glue these on top of each other for a better effect. These are the better quality plastic eyelashes, which I don&#x27;t usually like for everyday style/use.</li>
            <li> amazing lashes I LOVE THEM!!</li>
            <li> They are okay. Get the job done... If your conservative. You can make them work.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and look more natural than some others that I tried.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes, just take too long to get to the USA</li>
            <li> These r perfect! Not to much not to little !!!! Im about to order 4 more</li>
            <li> The price was great, but keep in mind that these lashes are packaged flat, which means they&#x27;re not the easiest to apply. You sort of have to work with them if you use your lashes in one go. I like to cut them up and use them as individual lashes.</li>
            <li> Wish the band was slightly larger because I find them harder to hang on through out the day BUT these are really beautiful lashes and SO CHEAP!!</li>
            <li> Was blown away by the quality! Yessss thank u</li>
            <li> i wished they shipped faster but worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I was worried that I was going to get the wrong lashes delivered to me after reading other reviews about recieving the wrong kind. After a few weeks, I received them and Im so happy I was sent the right ones and I love that the band is thin and clear. Will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Look natural.  Comfortable.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. Love it!</li>
            <li> Good quality, but it wasn&#x27;t flexible. It still works though.</li>
            <li> Long lasting wear and looks natural!</li>
            <li> They dont stay on long because they are so straight! They are hard to put on too!</li>
            <li> These are very difficult to put on because they are lined with a very thick price of plastic which needs to be trimmed. Not a big fan</li>
            <li> There not real and not nice to wear.</li>
            <li> terrible lashes they don&#x27;t even lay correctly</li>
            <li> They are straight so it takes a while for them to curve to a natural eyelash shape, but very thick, came in exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> Super uneven. Some of the pairs come with 2 of the same side (for the right/left eye)</li>
            <li> They are stiffer or harder than the Ardell Lashes.  The corners are short and awkward because instead of having short corners for both eyes the lashes only have short corners for the right eye.  They just are NOT natural looking on because they&#x27;re stiff and hard to apply.  You get what you pay for with these.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> Best lashes ever!!!!! Must buy!</li>
            <li> Took a long time to receive and threw them away they looked so bad. Not like picture.</li>
            <li> Look cheap and crappy</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going to an anime convention in a couple of months and I&#x27;m doing my friends makeup. We will be at said convention for three days, so the multiple pairs is nice. Unlike some of the other reviews,  i got the same lashes advertised, if not thicker.  Still invisible band.</li>
