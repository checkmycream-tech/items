    <ol>
            <li>This is an excellent hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s probably best to stick with hydrating masks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent treatment, not the strongest I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>And it smells great!</li>

            <li>The best hair product ever!</li>
            <li>I used Kerastase products including the hair masks for years and thought they were the best you could get.</li>
            <li>The oil is also superb!  </li>
            <li>One of the best hair mask that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Another great product from Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s wiry and fly away and bushy.</li>
            <li>Awesome love this product it is</li>
            <li>Argan oil may prevent this damage and protect our hair against aggressive factors, maintaining it healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is an excellent rescue for hair</li>
            <li>It help me keep my hair in good shape.  </li>
            <li>I do follow up with a good Moroccan oil conditioner, but I was told I would need to when I purchased the product.  </li>
            <li>so that was good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good too and it will get you hooked....</li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week, leave it in for a good 15 minutes and rinse.</li>
            <li>good experince with seller.</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years</li>
            <li>I purchased this product becaue of the good experience I had with Moroccan Oil (The OIL, not hair mask).</li>
            <li>but I have very healthy hair</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad about this item!</li>
            <li>I also use the curl cream, I love it!</li>
            <li>This product gives me beautiful, silky soft hair every time and my ends are in very good condition.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Smells really nice.</li>
            <li>and I mentioned how nice, shiny and silky her hair looked</li>
            <li>I hope this does not contain anything that&#x27;s hazardous to my health.</li>
            <li>What I have found that works best with this product is to shampoo, put on the mask and leave in for 20-30 minutes, rinse and use normal conditioner.  </li>
            <li>certainly far from the best.</li>
            <li>I take excellent care of my hair, but old age has not been its friend.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled with the larger size and had worked to find the best price.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product, but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I need more hair follcles</li>
            <li>I purchased and I am in love with this product</li>
            <li>My curly hair behaves so much better now.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it made with my favorite product argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did however make my hair feel and appear more &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It eliminates the static in winter too.</li>
            <li>(There are several Moroccan Oils on the market, but I&#x27;ve heard that this one, Moroccanoil - one word - is the best.)</li>
            <li>I was very excited and eager to try this Restorative Hair Mask.  </li>
            <li>This product is good for your hair, leave your hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>Natural and very effective product.</li>
            <li>Almost finished and so far it has worked very nicely on my hair.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need to use anything strong.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great,  not sure if as well as pinter estate advertised though, it&#x27;s like a really good conditioner, not a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used a straightning iron and this tamed the light frizz.  </li>
            <li>Bonus-it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry, brittle hair!</li>
            <li>It would be a way the company is trying to make money by making sure customers purchase the whole line of products to notice anything.</li>
            <li>Does wonders for damaged hair :)  My favorite deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped my hair tremendously</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got to keep using it in order for it to have an effect, but overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This product is good for dry hair, that is why i bought it.</li>
            <li>of all the hair masks i have purchased, this is the one i keep going back to and mybeautycenter is the place to get it for cheap!!</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel soft, conditioned and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to use a protein treatment (well one that is worth its salt) and just rinse and detangle.</li>
            <li>I love how soft this mask makes my hair.</li>
            <li>I only gave it three stars because it smells nice.</li>
            <li>All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li>think that perhaps this product would perform better with a different hair type.  </li>
            <li>which is exactly what i am looking for.  </li>
            <li>This smells lovely and does the job at the same time.</li>
            <li>, my hair is so smooth, silky and shiny and feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>saw results at the first time of use.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommended for curly hair that has been damaged by chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually found that some cheaper alternative brands (even argan oil) softened my damaged hair better than Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t need much, so it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>such good offers!!!&lt;br /&gt;Btw, supplier was OOahu (or something similar).</li>
            <li>oil contains a high percentage of vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant that protects hair from free-radicals and against environmental damage.&lt;br /&gt;Blow</li>
            <li>I have it many tries, using different shampoos and leaving it on more than 1 hr.</li>
            <li>I bought it and it arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I love this product because I have very unmanagable hair and its the only thing that really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wish it was available in a pump bottle:(  Smells Awesome!</li>
            <li>You can use it in the evening or sleep with it in your hair and rinse out in the morning for super soft repaired hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed it works better when I dry some of the water of my hair with a towel, I add the mask, and I leave it on (with a towel around) for over 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I use a small amount as a stay in conditioner and it makes my hair more smooth.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>However, when I woke up the following day the light frizz had returned.  </li>
            <li>This product adds a lot of moisture to my dreads and it keeps my hair very moist.</li>
            <li>Absolutely unnacceptable!!&lt;br /&gt;Please think twice when you see</li>
            <li>dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bizarre for me see the text in english say one time to stay with the product and another time in spanish.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>This product really recovered my hair.</li>
            <li>After dishing out 42 bucks at the store, I expected a better result.</li>
            <li>Due to the cost of this product, I will use it to the end, but I will be on the lookout for a product better suited to my hairtype.</li>
            <li>My hair is exceptionally dry and breaks easily leaving me with split ends.  </li>
            <li>Does not take a long time to enjoy the benefits of the conditioning.</li>
            <li>Sometimes its good to change deep condiotioner don&#x27;t just stick to the same one all the time, the hair get tire of the same products.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t see the point of a product which is so $$$ yet calls for a top off of controlling or texturizing products after use; it negates the entire point and one could just stick with a lesser conditioner if this is the case.</li>
            <li>All decent protein conditioners should be followed up with moisture conditioner.</li>
            <li>I will try it more, to see if my hair texture or something improves, nothing makes my very, very thin hair any better.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who has unruly, damaged summertime hair.</li>
            <li>I had some problem with my hair after getting high lights.</li>
            <li>For my daughter of mixed ethnicity and for my natural hair, I can tell a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>I just use my normal conditioner.  </li>
            <li>, at least my hair was smelling nice for about 24 hours............</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive nose which is why I probably noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>first time purchase and will be the last time as well!!</li>
            <li>Last week someone actually commented on how shinny and healthy my hair looked and I can&#x27;t remember the last time that happened.</li>
            <li>I had fine, limp, slippery hair until the gray came in.</li>
            <li>In all instances my hair was left very dry, and with a cheap smell (the perfume is awful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I got extremely soft hair</li>
            <li>I have medium length, reasonably straight, color-treated blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything to improve it, but so far nothing does.</li>
            <li>When a professional person buy and try the product then trust their rating.</li>
            <li>Immediately after using this treatment, my hair was soft, shiny, and the breakage was dramatically minimized.</li>
            <li>All the demage was fixed</li>
            <li>If you have damaged hair and need intense repair look no further GET THIS NOW!!!</li>
            <li>The wild gray now is shiny silver instead.</li>
            <li>But for me, others M oil conditioning products on the market work better and the price of this product surely added to the disappointed.</li>
            <li>My dry, super, super fine, almost paper thin hair, is a little shinier after one use.</li>
            <li>The products are very special and I a usually for all tipes pieces, cases for the stores recently.</li>
            <li>would strongly recommend this to anyone who has coarse,dry and dull hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that’s fizzy, brittle and prone to breakage, because it penetrates deep inside the hair fiber, softens the cuticle scales and helps them lay down flat, leaving the hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Cons: I lost my curls and got major frizz in return.</li>
            <li>Forgin language is fine with me, but at least make this product work with my hair.</li>
            <li>Unlike others, this product not only gives me body, but also restores my natural curls.  </li>
            <li>Using this only once a month makes my hair soft and silky like baby hair, but at the same time not limp or flat.</li>
            <li>The appearance, color and texture are different from those who already bought and also the smell is bad, different from normal in that have good smell.</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Absolutely unnacceptable!!&lt;br /&gt;Please think twice when you see</li>
            <li> dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bizarre for me see the text in english say one time to stay with the product and another time in spanish.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This product really recovered my hair.</li>
            <li> After dishing out 42 bucks at the store, I expected a better result.</li>
            <li> Due to the cost of this product, I will use it to the end, but I will be on the lookout for a product better suited to my hairtype.</li>
            <li> My hair is exceptionally dry and breaks easily leaving me with split ends.  </li>
            <li> Does not take a long time to enjoy the benefits of the conditioning.</li>
            <li> Sometimes its good to change deep condiotioner don&#x27;t just stick to the same one all the time, the hair get tire of the same products.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t see the point of a product which is so $$$ yet calls for a top off of controlling or texturizing products after use; it negates the entire point and one could just stick with a lesser conditioner if this is the case.</li>
            <li> All decent protein conditioners should be followed up with moisture conditioner.</li>
            <li> I will try it more, to see if my hair texture or something improves, nothing makes my very, very thin hair any better.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who has unruly, damaged summertime hair.</li>
            <li> I had some problem with my hair after getting high lights.</li>
            <li> For my daughter of mixed ethnicity and for my natural hair, I can tell a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> I just use my normal conditioner.  </li>
            <li> , at least my hair was smelling nice for about 24 hours............</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive nose which is why I probably noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> first time purchase and will be the last time as well!!</li>
            <li> Last week someone actually commented on how shinny and healthy my hair looked and I can&#x27;t remember the last time that happened.</li>
            <li> I had fine, limp, slippery hair until the gray came in.</li>
            <li> In all instances my hair was left very dry, and with a cheap smell (the perfume is awful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I got extremely soft hair</li>
            <li> I have medium length, reasonably straight, color-treated blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything to improve it, but so far nothing does.</li>
            <li> When a professional person buy and try the product then trust their rating.</li>
            <li> Immediately after using this treatment, my hair was soft, shiny, and the breakage was dramatically minimized.</li>
            <li> All the demage was fixed</li>
            <li> If you have damaged hair and need intense repair look no further GET THIS NOW!!!</li>
            <li> The wild gray now is shiny silver instead.</li>
            <li> But for me, others M oil conditioning products on the market work better and the price of this product surely added to the disappointed.</li>
            <li> My dry, super, super fine, almost paper thin hair, is a little shinier after one use.</li>
            <li> The products are very special and I a usually for all tipes pieces, cases for the stores recently.</li>
            <li> would strongly recommend this to anyone who has coarse,dry and dull hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that’s fizzy, brittle and prone to breakage, because it penetrates deep inside the hair fiber, softens the cuticle scales and helps them lay down flat, leaving the hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Cons: I lost my curls and got major frizz in return.</li>
            <li> Forgin language is fine with me, but at least make this product work with my hair.</li>
            <li> Unlike others, this product not only gives me body, but also restores my natural curls.  </li>
            <li> Using this only once a month makes my hair soft and silky like baby hair, but at the same time not limp or flat.</li>
            <li> The appearance, color and texture are different from those who already bought and also the smell is bad, different from normal in that have good smell.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> My personal trainer told me about this product, we both have long hair</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t rinse it well enough then you can forget about using a roller brush to hair dry your hair as it will feel like there is glue on your hair.</li>
            <li> But I do recommend it as a nightime deep conditioner for those like me who sometimes deep condition and braid wet hair</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m concerned that since this is obviously from a foreign country I know their standards on products will be different.</li>
            <li> I am an afro caribbean female with relaxed 4a hair and this product made my hair very dry after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, maybe the results will come with time or maybe I don&#x27;t have to see or feel anything in my hair to know its working, but I prefer to use any cheaper mask like Neutrogena than this one.</li>
            <li> My husband (who also has long hair) uses it as well</li>
            <li> It says to leave on towel-dried hair for 10 minutes, I left on for an hour due to my hair&#x27;s damage and thickness.</li>
            <li> On the container it has some type of foreign writing that looks Indian or something similar  </li>
            <li> The product also smells a little different then the American one.</li>
            <li> It tames frizzy, dry, and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I use this for a few weeks and then swicht to a different deep condiotioner.</li>
            <li> my hair still dry!</li>
            <li> Product was expected.  </li>
            <li> I then used a wide tooth comb to spread it evenly, combing out all tangles.  </li>
            <li> I had very dry hair due to coloring.</li>
            <li> (I have thick, long waist length coarse curls).</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other restorative hair products and have been disappointed over and over again.  </li>
            <li> I leave this product for half of day, my hair still dry!!  </li>
            <li> After I used half of bottle ,my hair still dry!!!  </li>
            <li> Definitely NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick, curly hair and have a substantial amount of breakage from using the flatiron.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark, dry, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> what your looking to achieve- if you have thin hair and want volume, this would likely work wonders.</li>
            <li> a marketing sham.</li>
            <li> , my hair kept falling a lot after a few times of using.</li>
            <li> I disliked it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very, very dry, terribly thin</li>
            <li> For small amount of money you have grate satisfaction.</li>
            <li> What I also disliked is how it says I need to follow up with a conditioner as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> But this product makes it unbelievably controllable.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes Anne Sullivan (Helen Keller&#x27;s teacher) look lame compared to what it will do for my curly, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and need conditioning and weight, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am disappointed at the hype this brand gets</li>
            <li> Not the worse I have tried, but</li>
            <li> Two months ago my hair was so thin I could not do anything with it.  </li>
            <li> This is false advertising</li>
            <li> The product that I received is expired or false.</li>
            <li> For me it is just shy of a miracle.  </li>
            <li> Still using it, and seems to work well, but wonder if it is fake.</li>
            <li> Sorry I can talk about the product, but I feel I shall tell my experience.</li>
            <li> but it turned out the produce was expired or fake</li>
            <li> me, it looks like fake, but I do not know.</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair and I was desperate enough to pay this outrageous price thinking it would work.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that this is a foreign version.</li>
            <li> This product was very expensive.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> I had to throw it away, so I lost my $60 for this bad product.</li>
            <li> When I had a really bad highlight done and my hair was injured</li>
            <li> I was shocked this product was so horrible coming from MoroccanOil.</li>
            <li> very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> So disappointed!!</li>
            <li> this is one of the worst hair masks/deep conditioner I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this product and I received something completely different! In this description it says &amp;#34; Restorative Hair Mask&amp;#34; and I did took in consideration that the packaging may vary but I never taught I would get a completely different product!!!! What I receive is &amp;#34; Intensive Hydrating Mask&amp;#34; which is completely different from smell and look and it does not work!!!! This is false advertising and I&#x27;m definetely contacting the seller to get my money back!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> of all the hair masks i have purchased, this is the one i keep going back to and mybeautycenter is the place to get it for cheap!!</li>
            <li> For my daughter of mixed ethnicity and for my natural hair, I can tell a significant difference.  Makes hair feel soft, conditioned and more manageable.  Love this product.  Wish it was available in a pump bottle:(  Smells Awesome!</li>
            <li> Great product for dry, brittle hair! Fast delivery. Very pleased!  I was thrilled with the larger size and had worked to find the best price. I will order  again!  What I have found that works best with this product is to shampoo, put on the mask and leave in for 20-30 minutes, rinse and use normal conditioner.  Your hair will feel like silk. It tames frizzy, dry, and brittle hair. I use this once a week and also use the same brand, moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> very disappointed!  After I used half of bottle ,my hair still dry!!!  I leave this product in my hair for 2 hours. my hair still dry! I leave this product for half of day, my hair still dry!!  Then I leave this product in my hair for 20 hours, my hair still dry!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase this in Deva concepts again!!&lt;br /&gt;This product is different from what I purchase from salon. I don&#x27;t understand what it says in the bottle. maybe Arabic or Thai?! Forgin language is fine with me, but at least make this product work with my hair. ok?!&lt;br /&gt;My first time purchase and will be the last time as well!! So disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Awesome love this product it is a must have</li>
            <li> Natural and very effective product.It help me keep my hair in good shape.  For small amount of money you have grate satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair conditioner.  Product was expected.  Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, but didn&#x27;t. After all the hype, I decided to shell out the big bucks and give this RHM a go. Pros: I got extremely soft hair (I have thick, long waist length coarse curls). Cons: I lost my curls and got major frizz in return. I don&#x27;t recommend this product as a \\&quot;condition and go\\&quot; one, even for those who straighten their hair because it lacks luster as well. But I do recommend it as a nightime deep conditioner for those like me who sometimes deep condition and braid wet hair overnight then skip the wash and cond the next day, as this method will leave hair softened and unfrizzed. But for me, others M oil conditioning products on the market work better and the price of this product surely added to the disappointed. I just don&#x27;t see the point of a product which is so $$$ yet calls for a top off of controlling or texturizing products after use; it negates the entire point and one could just stick with a lesser conditioner if this is the case. SO...prior to purchase, know your hair type and what your looking to achieve- if you have thin hair and want volume, this would likely work wonders. If you have thick hair and need conditioning and weight, this is not the product for you. Not the worse I have tried, but certainly far from the best.</li>
            <li> This is a protein treatment a protein treatment helps to restore damaged hair, be it chemically treated, or just damage from heat stylers. If you don&#x27;t fall into these groups it&#x27;s probably best to stick with hydrating masks. Don&#x27;t expect to use a protein treatment (well one that is worth its salt) and just rinse and detangle. This is a strengthening conditioner, its purpose is to bond protein to your hair to protect it from damage, thus totally different to moisturising conditioners. All decent protein conditioners should be followed up with moisture conditioner. Use the products as they are designed to be used and you should hopefully achieve the desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent treatment, not the strongest I&#x27;ve ever used but I have very healthy hair so I don&#x27;t need to use anything strong. This product gives me beautiful, silky soft hair every time and my ends are in very good condition.</li>
            <li> this is one of the worst hair masks/deep conditioner I have ever tried. I have it many tries, using different shampoos and leaving it on more than 1 hr. In all instances my hair was left very dry, and with a cheap smell (the perfume is awful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a marketing sham. Will never buy again. I bought it at a local store that won&#x27;t allow returns otherwise it would have gone back.</li>
            <li> I was very excited and eager to try this Restorative Hair Mask.  It was recommended to me by my stylist. I have medium length, reasonably straight, color-treated blonde hair.  I shampooed my hair and then applied a generous amount of RHM throughout my hair.  I then used a wide tooth comb to spread it evenly, combing out all tangles.  I waited about 10-15 minutes to rinse as per directions.  I let my hair dry naturally.  It definitely appeared fuller and shinier.  However, there was a bit of a frizz to it.  This I did not like.  I used a straightning iron and this tamed the light frizz.  However, when I woke up the following day the light frizz had returned.  I again used the straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;This mask is not meant for daily use.  I&#x27;ve used it twice since I purchased it and between those uses I just use my normal conditioner.  It does look healthier and shinier as compared to when I was using the conditioner alone.&lt;br /&gt;I think that perhaps this product would perform better with a different hair type.  Due to the cost of this product, I will use it to the end, but I will be on the lookout for a product better suited to my hairtype.</li>
            <li> This product is good for your hair, leave your hair very shiny. I bought it and it arrived pretty fast. it works for me. Sometimes its good to change deep condiotioner don&#x27;t just stick to the same one all the time, the hair get tire of the same products. I use this for a few weeks and then swicht to a different deep condiotioner. This product is good for dry hair, that is why i bought it.</li>
            <li> My daughter talked me into using this product.  I was hesitant because of the price.  My hair is exceptionally dry and breaks easily leaving me with split ends.  I take excellent care of my hair, but old age has not been its friend.  I actually leave the mask on for an hour or two, not according to directions but it works for me.  Unlike others, this product not only gives me body, but also restores my natural curls.  For me it is just shy of a miracle.  I do follow up with a good Moroccan oil conditioner, but I was told I would need to when I purchased the product.  Two months ago my hair was so thin I could not do anything with it.  I now look like I have hair.  Last week someone actually commented on how shinny and healthy my hair looked and I can&#x27;t remember the last time that happened.</li>
            <li> I put out big $$$$$$$$$$$ for this product. $45.00, bought in an actual store. I have used it once. Smells really nice. My dry, super, super fine, almost paper thin hair, is a little shinier after one use. I will try it more, to see if my hair texture or something improves, nothing makes my very, very thin hair any better. It&#x27;s very, very dry, terribly thin (always was)....I have tried everything to improve it, but so far nothing does. I need more hair follcles, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, at least my hair was smelling nice for about 24 hours............so that was good.</li>
            <li> Product is upto the mark and I will recommend it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wifes chemically burnt hair and she loves it she said it worked wonders on her hair, she can&#x27;t stop talking about it.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other restorative hair products and have been disappointed over and over again.  However, Moroccanoil Restorative Hair Mask is very effective!  Love this product!  It works!  And it smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this product because I have very unmanagable hair and its the only thing that really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has coarse,dry and dull hair.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good too and it will get you hooked.... I give it 5 Stars...</li>
            <li> This product works well! I&#x27;m so glad about this item! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Questioned the quality of the product, because the container is printed differently than the one posted online. Some sort of middle-eastern language. Still using it, and seems to work well, but wonder if it is fake.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great,  not sure if as well as pinter estate advertised though, it&#x27;s like a really good conditioner, not a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as to the smell, smells like hair salon to me, didn&#x27;t upset a pregnant/post-partum tummy either</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t feel any difference in my hair with this product. I have bleached hair and I was desperate enough to pay this outrageous price thinking it would work. I cannot detangle my hair after using it. I&#x27;m not a professional, maybe the results will come with time or maybe I don&#x27;t have to see or feel anything in my hair to know its working, but I prefer to use any cheaper mask like Neutrogena than this one. Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product adds a lot of moisture to my dreads and it keeps my hair very moist. which is exactly what i am looking for.  I have wool like hair which needs a lot of moisture. This smells lovely and does the job at the same time.</li>
            <li> Is not the same product sold in stores, it looks the same but it&#x27;s not the same in any way! Even the smell &amp; texture is different! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  You can use it in the evening or sleep with it in your hair and rinse out in the morning for super soft repaired hair. Bonus-it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I had very dry hair due to coloring. This product brought my hair back it&#x27;s shine and softness. I also use the curl cream, I love it! It smells good too.</li>
            <li> My personal trainer told me about this product, we both have long hair and I mentioned how nice, shiny and silky her hair looked and she had been using moroccan oil for about a month. I was sold!     I purchased and I am in love with this product, my hair is so smooth, silky and shiny and feels so soft. I use it once a week, leave it in for a good 15 minutes and rinse. My husband (who also has long hair) uses it as well and he also likes the product.     Would definitely recommend for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Delivery on time</li>
            <li> Excellent product. good experince with seller.</li>
            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> Sorry I can talk about the product, but I feel I shall tell my experience. Product came on time, but the expiring date and the scan code had been scratched so can not be read. So I assume I got an expire product. Absolutely unnacceptable!!&lt;br /&gt;Please think twice when you see such good offers!!!&lt;br /&gt;Btw, supplier was OOahu (or something similar).</li>
            <li> This stuff makes Anne Sullivan (Helen Keller&#x27;s teacher) look lame compared to what it will do for my curly, dry hair.  I&#x27;ll never be accused of witchcraft with this stuff.  My curly hair behaves so much better now.</li>
            <li> I have ordered a 16.9 ounce but the seller sent me a 8.5 ounce. I asked the seller to exchange to the this one but the seller refused to send me a label. So I had to use it but it turned out the produce was expired or fake, my hair kept falling a lot after a few times of using. I had to throw it away, so I lost my $60 for this bad product.</li>
            <li> The best hair product ever!</li>
            <li> Almost finished and so far it has worked very nicely on my hair. Does not take a long time to enjoy the benefits of the conditioning.</li>
            <li> Very, very good. The products are very special and I a usually for all tipes pieces, cases for the stores recently.</li>
            <li> I used Kerastase products including the hair masks for years and thought they were the best you could get. Until Morrocanoil!  My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years and I colour it every 20 days and use loads of heat styling tools too. My hair is stronger and shinier, with almost none frizz! The oil is also superb!  Want to get the hole line now.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair mask that I have ever used. I love the fact that it made with my favorite product argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regenerates Damaged Hair Cells With Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil contains a high percentage of vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant that protects hair from free-radicals and against environmental damage.&lt;br /&gt;Blow dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure. Argan oil may prevent this damage and protect our hair against aggressive factors, maintaining it healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is an excellent rescue for hair that’s fizzy, brittle and prone to breakage, because it penetrates deep inside the hair fiber, softens the cuticle scales and helps them lay down flat, leaving the hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I disliked it. The product that I received is expired or false. The appearance, color and texture are different from those who already bought and also the smell is bad, different from normal in that have good smell. The packaging is also different from all those who have already bought.</li>
            <li> Good seller! Everything&#x27;s alright. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bizarre for me see the text in english say one time to stay with the product and another time in spanish.&lt;br /&gt;For me, it looks like fake, but I do not know. I already  try to contact the seller, but it was inconsiderable what they said.</li>
            <li> I am an afro caribbean female with relaxed 4a hair and this product made my hair very dry after using. It did however make my hair feel and appear more &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34;.... so if you use you&#x27;ll have to follow up with a moisturizing deep conditioner/treatment as well. Definitely NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product was very expensive. I use Moroccan Oil all the time and it&#x27;s great. When I had a really bad highlight done and my hair was injured I purchased this product becaue of the good experience I had with Moroccan Oil (The OIL, not hair mask). This product left my hair feeling sticky. I rinsed it well and my hair didn&#x27;t even feel like it had been conditioned. If you don&#x27;t rinse it well enough then you can forget about using a roller brush to hair dry your hair as it will feel like there is glue on your hair. The container says this is from Israel. It was not sealed on the outside with anykind of shrink wrap. I wonder if someone used the container and put something else in the jar. I was shocked this product was so horrible coming from MoroccanOil. I thought about getting a tester from a hair salon to see if it is in fact the same product.</li>
            <li> When a professional person buy and try the product then trust their rating. This product Rock. I use it regularly and started to restore all the damage in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bushra/Ohio</li>
            <li> moroccanoil a melhor máscara capilar restauradora, vendedor confiável,  demora um puco a entrega, pois vem de israel do outro lado do mundo</li>
            <li> Another great product from Moroccanoil. I have coarse, thick, curly hair and have a substantial amount of breakage from using the flatiron. Immediately after using this treatment, my hair was soft, shiny, and the breakage was dramatically minimized. It says to leave on towel-dried hair for 10 minutes, I left on for an hour due to my hair&#x27;s damage and thickness. I highly recommend this to anyone who has unruly, damaged summertime hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark, dry, wavy hair. This product does make my hair smoother and softer. Even if I just put it on for a couple of minutes I can tell the difference. I noticed it works better when I dry some of the water of my hair with a towel, I add the mask, and I leave it on (with a towel around) for over 10 minutes. Then I rinse it.  I like using it but it&#x27;s very expensive. The bottle will last forever though.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;I saw results at the first time of use.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommended for curly hair that has been damaged by chemicals.</li>
            <li> I din&#x27;t receive the product but a payed for it. The hotel did&#x27;nt find the product at the moment I was there.</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> Does wonders for damaged hair :)  My favorite deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got to keep using it in order for it to have an effect, but overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this mask makes my hair. I have been trying to grow my hair out for years and I am convinced this mask has helped me finally get longer hair! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a mask to help protect hair against breakage.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount as a stay in conditioner and it makes my hair more smooth. I recommend it</li>
            <li> I had some problem with my hair after getting high lights. This product really recovered my hair. All the demage was fixed</li>
            <li> If you have damaged hair and need intense repair look no further GET THIS NOW!!! It&#x27;s helped my hair tremendously</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually found that some cheaper alternative brands (even argan oil) softened my damaged hair better than Moroccan oil. After dishing out 42 bucks at the store, I expected a better result. What I also disliked is how it says I need to follow up with a conditioner as well! It would be a way the company is trying to make money by making sure customers purchase the whole line of products to notice anything. Overall, I am disappointed at the hype this brand gets and I didn&#x27;t see any results. I only gave it three stars because it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because in stores its close to 80 bucks. I was very disappointed that this is a foreign version. On the container it has some type of foreign writing that looks Indian or something similar  I&#x27;m not sure. The product also smells a little different then the American one. I have a very sensitive nose which is why I probably noticed the difference. Also I&#x27;m concerned that since this is obviously from a foreign country I know their standards on products will be different. I hope this does not contain anything that&#x27;s hazardous to my health.</li>
            <li> I had fine, limp, slippery hair until the gray came in. Now it&#x27;s wiry and fly away and bushy. But this product makes it unbelievably controllable. Using this only once a month makes my hair soft and silky like baby hair, but at the same time not limp or flat. The wild gray now is shiny silver instead. I don&#x27;t know how this can work, but it does. It eliminates the static in winter too. How is this possible? It&#x27;s miraculous. And how come I only have to use it once a month and the results are lasting? Why doesn&#x27;t it wash out with the shampoos in between? I don&#x27;t know, but it works. And you don&#x27;t need much, so it&#x27;s well worth the price. (There are several Moroccan Oils on the market, but I&#x27;ve heard that this one, Moroccanoil - one word - is the best.)</li>
