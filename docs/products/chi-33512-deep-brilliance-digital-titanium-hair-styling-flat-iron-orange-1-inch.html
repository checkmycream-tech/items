            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product :)  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase this iron because it was not ceramic, and it was bright orange.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, brand name they wanted, lower cost.</li>
            <li>Good value.  </li>
            <li>Heat settings good and adjustable.  </li>
            <li>My good one broke</li>
            <li>and it still looks good</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend!!</li>
            <li>(I do have a lot of hair) and it worked quickly and beautifully!</li>
            <li>I especially enjoy the timed mode on iron as I know many times women tend to forget to unplug the iron.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with this Chi, until this morning.</li>
            <li>I am VERY pleased.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>This straightener works better than a ceramic straightener!  </li>
            <li>It is the most amazing straightner ever!</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li>but I love the color!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this CHI!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love Chi products!</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick and the price was great.</li>
            <li>Amazing straightener.</li>
            <li>that was fast - she said this flatiron was awesome</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s a nice Orange.</li>
            <li>gives nice result&lt;</li>
            <li>be so nice</li>
            <li>This iron heats up fast and does a wonderful job for my hair.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>This iron is as good or better than the Chi Iron</li>
            <li>Love the color, love the difference it made on my hair!  </li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t believe me but a good flat iron can make your hair look so much better!!!</li>
            <li>and i am impressed so far with the titanium plate</li>
            <li>But if you have a perm/relaxer, or softer, more manageable hair, it will do quite nicely.</li>
            <li>but this is the BEST by far.</li>
            <li>She says this is by far the best</li>
            <li>Great product so worth the money</li>
            <li>Overall great price and great product.</li>
            <li>It did do a great job, but took much longer to warm up, get kinks out of my hair, and it seemed that by afternoon, I would need to touch up because the waves would return.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working just as great as when I first purchased it, and the swivel cord is convenient and hasn&#x27;t frayed at all.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>First off I LOVE my chi!!</li>
            <li>I loved the sample of the Silk Infusion that was included, so much that I ran out and purchased more!  </li>
            <li>but wasn&#x27;t sure which one to get.  </li>
            <li>Just using it for about 20 minutes most mornings.</li>
            <li>Girls love it.</li>
            <li>Would gladly reorder again and recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>My favorite color is orange</li>
            <li>I received many compliments.</li>
            <li>The color is not my favorite-</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for a friend and she&#x27;s in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I would replace all of my curling irons with this one if I were more into curly hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using theres I bought myself one since I felt this one worked much better than the Chee</li>
            <li>When she saw it she &#x27;fell in love&#x27; with it.  </li>
            <li>I personally was impressed with the service.  </li>
            <li>and i have not yet been able to re-create the hair style she did</li>
            <li>I was not too sure about the color</li>
            <li>and i love the straightener.</li>
            <li>i love the hair products as well</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll enjoy!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great hair straightener that I highly recommend getting this one!</li>
            <li>but I did like the adjustable settings and her favorite color</li>
            <li>Love that this does have temperature control settings.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>Purchased to replace my revlon straightener and soooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love how I can put what degree</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>This Chi flat iron is the best one I have ever used.</li>
            <li>ceramic Chi flat iron, which was the best iron I had ever owned until I got this one.  </li>
            <li>One Off The Best Flat Irons I&#x27;ve Ever Had!</li>
            <li>I am not a hair expert for sure, but this product has been easy and dependable.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for offering this wonderful product on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>part is it is cheap and works fine for my curly freezy hair!</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about my CHI!</li>
            <li>My last one lasted over 10 years and this one is just as good!</li>
            <li>This gets rolled up once cool and tossed in a basket, and it still lasts!</li>
            <li>easy to handle.</li>
            <li>-Easy to operate&lt;br /&gt;- easy to carry&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Easy to use,good for styling/ curling.[[ASIN:B004HFBC9W Chi 33512</li>
            <li>Was more than i expected, works great no problems so far, great price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great extra</li>
            <li>I bought this flatiron because my hair was starting to fall out, and my stylist recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;The situation has greatly improved.</li>
            <li>I have had many different brands over the years and this one by far I&#x27;d the best!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I saved money because it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>I was worried about ordering this because of some of the reviews that said it stopped working, but it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>- I had an original Chee that still works fine..</li>
            <li>Heats quick, easy to use, and leaves hair nice and straight.</li>
            <li>The flat iron is working great and is exceeding my expectations.</li>
            <li>Great flat irons!</li>
            <li>It has a nice, long cord, which is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>She had the original CHI for almost 7 years and it gave out.</li>
            <li>an original, 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have owned many chi&#x27;s and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>, she is very picky about her straightners, but she was more than satisfied when she used this for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have owned so far.</li>
            <li>And, the price is right too!  </li>
            <li>My beautician recommended this product and she was absolutely right!</li>
            <li>Turns out the research was right!  </li>
            <li>I love how fast it heats up-within seconds.</li>
            <li>Once I set the number of minutes I want, it would be good for it to be that way the next time I turn it on....automatically.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No burning, my hair is very shiny and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li>It is fast, which I love.  </li>
            <li>I let it cool off and tried again - nothing.  </li>
            <li>But the true test was for my 6 yro.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly and quickly, on my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I was unsure of what the titanium would b like compared to ceramic, honestly I find it to be a little better!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out like some and gets hot very quickly...</li>
            <li>My hair is also super shiny after having used it.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and gets my hair just the way i like it</li>
            <li>Came extremely quick.</li>
            <li>Pretty fantastic if you ask me.  </li>
            <li>Needed a new case and after many days of searching this was the one-</li>
            <li>Anyone using this straightener should also know, you should use a product to safeguard your hair from heat damage as this thing gets soooooo hot!  </li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the flat irons.</li>
            <li>I will never buy any other kind EVER AGAIN!</li>
            <li>I have coarse, latin, curly hair, and this Chi works the magic!</li>
            <li>It heats quickly, and gets super hot.  </li>
            <li>It straightens really well and leaves my hair smooth and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is wavy and smooth but she likes it to be straight.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend purchasing this iron to anyone and it is worth the price I purchased it for.</li>
            <li>My hair came out looking salon fresh.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite items i&#x27;ve ordered so far from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I thought with this straightener I&#x27;d be able to go natural, but I ended up giving in and just getting a relaxer.</li>
            <li>She said it works better than her old CHI</li>
            <li>It has really high heat too, and the settings are easy to work.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super curly and it straightens and stays straight!</li>
            <li>but the price was right on Amazon.</li>
            <li>She was right on the mark.</li>
            <li>but anyways sent it back today I really wanted to like may try to reorder if I don&#x27;t get another hs1 which I really liked but broke</li>
            <li>My hair gets straight quick and stays that way all day.</li>
            <li>This Chi heats up super fast and holds it&#x27;s heat throughout the straightening process.  </li>
            <li>It smooths out your hair super straight.</li>
            <li>Her previous Chi lasted a good 7 years...</li>
            <li>My cheap flat iron worked just fine after being in storage for 8 months.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this model because of the good reviews and to save a little money.  </li>
            <li>It has lasted 2 years with no issues, used often, heats fast, high heat, styles and straightens hair, make it smooth and shiny, or can make waves.</li>
            <li>And I love the digital adjustments.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife back in Feb 2012, she used it for about 30 days, and then it wouldn&#x27;t work any more.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!  </li>
            <li>and my daughter absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it was for course/curly hair until AFTER I ordered it and at first that concerned me.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair that has wave</li>
            <li>I love the Chi Deep Brilliance too!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can set the heat setting to how hot you want it and that it has a timer for an automatic shut off (I ruined my last Chi by letting it stay on all day).</li>
            <li>Very up to date and convenient!</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener and it worked well when i first got it</li>
            <li>I guess it gets so hot hair</li>
            <li>I have had so many different straighteners</li>
            <li>, it straightens the first time so dress time is shortened.</li>
            <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong and it straightens my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love the digital dial,timer,color, how sturdy the chi brilliance is.</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended to quickly get the job done.</li>
            <li>Works really great on all types of hair and with half  or quarter of the time as my old Revlon.  </li>
            <li>With the right styling products, those frizzies stay away for almost the whole day.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Chi needs more flat irons like these.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love my flat iron its just the gratest.</li>
            <li>I truly love my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My favorite flat iron EVER!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>What a time to break, right before New Years Eve!</li>
            <li>It gets really hot, and gets the hair really straight.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast, love the digital display that a normal chi doesn&#x27;t have, always stays hot, I don&#x27;t have to take breaks to give it time to get really hot again.</li>
            <li>Super quick to heat up - even 2 years later.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and curly, so I was impressed that my hair was left smooth, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I AM SOOOOO IN LOVE WITH MY CHI DB FLAT IRONS!!!!</li>
            <li>The exterior is cheap plastic that gets hot enough on the plastic that you can burn yourself while using it.  </li>
            <li>least it does a pretty good job, and it doesn&#x27;t catch your strands in the plates.  </li>
            <li>This one seems to be just as good as the old one for half the price...</li>
            <li>and they heat up really fast.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Heats lightening fast, thermometer takes the guesswork out of knowing when it&#x27;s heated.  </li>
            <li>ALL READY...</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very autumny orange</li>
            <li>VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>She says \\&quot;everything you order gets here really fast!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This makes straighting so much easier.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It straightens hair really well</li>
            <li>but I really like the Velcro cord keeper</li>
            <li>I could not be happier with this replacement, this iron makes my so straight and shiny</li>
            <li>It does a good job of smoothing out the top layers, but it does NOT really straighten thickly textured hair.</li>
            <li>And it got just hot enough to straighten my super curly hair and not burn my hair or my hands.</li>
            <li>great item if ur girlfriend spends all day in the mirror doing hair, cuts time in half compared to other hot irons.</li>
            <li>This is a genuine Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li>I had to get out my cheap flat iron for storage in order to finish my hair.  </li>
            <li>It straighten her hair better than any other straightener that I have use.</li>
            <li>I have fine, long relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>all have long straight hair - this iron gives a smooth shinny look and curls the ends</li>
            <li>Nice but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this flat iron for smooth, wavy hair even though it&#x27;s not advertised as being for this type of hair.</li>
            <li>I owned the original Chi flat iron for 5 years before it died.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick curly (mostly very wavy and frizzy) hair, and had a classic CHI that did a good job until it died.  </li>
            <li>Product feels sturdy in hand, much better than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li>This iron replaced my much older, cheaper one.  </li>
            <li>Its more of a deep red-orange on the outside</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this iron but it only lasted a few months.  </li>
            <li>My teenage girls flat iron works better than this and they purchsed theirs at a beauty supply store for $19.99...</li>
            <li>DO not waste your money!!</li>
            <li>I can put it straight to my dry, curly hair and it will quickly straighten out.  </li>
            <li>BUT IT WAS A SURE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and love it every time.</li>
            <li>Thick hair textures are better off putting a hot comb to their roots because this product won&#x27;t quite do the trick.</li>
            <li>I will be buying a few more.</li>
            <li>I did her entire head in 25 min which used to take more than 90 min with my old flat iron</li>
            <li>My daughter wanted a new straightener for her birthday</li>
            <li>I spent a substantial amount of money of this item, but I think it must have been more for the name than the actual sincerity of the product.</li>
            <li>It heats very quickly, I&#x27;ve had it for months and the plates have yet to be marked or scratched, and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same sections multiple times.  </li>
            <li>Do not be lured by the pretty colors and low price!  </li>
            <li>Spend the extra money on the ORIGINAL Chi Flat Iron by Farouk - you will not be diappointed.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that the instructions to use the iron were not very clear, but I was able to figure out the different modes on the iron.</li>
            <li>I have used other flat irons, and so far, this has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and i thought i was one of the lucky ones, but it simply stopped heating after 2-3 months of moderate use.</li>
            <li>I got past the bright orange easily enough- who&#x27;s looking at your flat iron?  </li>
            <li>Love that all of its components are lead-free(again, unlike my previous flat iron).</li>
            <li>And it did not work nearly as well as the original black CHI.</li>
            <li>I love the auto-off feature since my daughter kept forgetting to turn off our previous flat iron.</li>
            <li>It does not pull and tug like her old straightener and does not seem like its burning or breaking her hair.</li>
            <li>The Chi Deep Brilliance straightens hair really well in one stroke.</li>
            <li>I used to smell burning hair and told her to ease up on the using her old straightner, she asked for a CHI</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this flat-iron to anyone wanting a salon quality product at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter for Christmas (it was the only thing she asked for)  and besides being a reasonable price it works well</li>
            <li>I could get it straight with a regular straightner</li>
            <li>I use less heat and it leaves my hair shiny and super smooth with less effort.</li>
            <li>It also comes with this hair serum that makes your hair feel sooo soft.</li>
            <li>and I use it to straighten my natural hair as well as wigs and weaves.</li>
            <li>and it still feels soft.  </li>
            <li>I will also point out that I am a busy Mom, and don&#x27;t overly baby my hair products.</li>
            <li>She is biracial &amp; has really curly hair, it&#x27;s still the same texture as mine</li>
            <li>This flat iron is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>The price was also reasonable for flat irons that work so well.</li>
            <li>Too much money for a flat iron</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight for a long time.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact performance that was expected.</li>
            <li>The traditional Chi flat iron doesn&#x27;t allow for temperature adjustment and was way too hot for my hair.</li>
            <li>The flat iron was shipped out and received in decent timing about 5 days.</li>
            <li>After searching the internet about this straight iron I found that several people had problems with theirs being defective and breaking after a short period of time as well.</li>
            <li>I intended to return it after using it the first time, but due to return shipping costs and restocking fees, I would&#x27;ve paid $30 for my \\&quot;trial</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not available on many other straighteners.</li>
            <li>But anyone with really long, thick hair had better have toned muscles.  </li>
            <li>I mean never, been this soft, silky, and beautiful with any other flat iron she&#x27;s used in the past.  </li>
            <li>when I first used this just straightened my bangs worked fine few days later tried plugged in turned on few minutes later would not come back on even when pressing reset</li>
            <li>Heats up fast amd not as damaging as some other straighteners.</li>
            <li>It says it reaches 410 degrees but after a few uses it barely gets hot.</li>
            <li>I was worried that for such a low price I would get a bad product, but this straightener works great.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this flat iron approximately a month ago and am in love with this.  </li>
            <li>Extra long cord, very sturdy, even worked on wet hair.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product :)  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this iron because it was not ceramic, and it was bright orange.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, brand name they wanted, lower cost.</li>
            <li> Good value.  </li>
            <li> Heat settings good and adjustable.  </li>
            <li> My good one broke</li>
            <li> and it still looks good</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend!!</li>
            <li> (I do have a lot of hair) and it worked quickly and beautifully!</li>
            <li> I especially enjoy the timed mode on iron as I know many times women tend to forget to unplug the iron.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this Chi, until this morning.</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> This straightener works better than a ceramic straightener!  </li>
            <li> It is the most amazing straightner ever!</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> but I love the color!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this CHI!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love Chi products!</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Amazing straightener.</li>
            <li> that was fast - she said this flatiron was awesome</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s a nice Orange.</li>
            <li> gives nice result&lt;</li>
            <li> be so nice</li>
            <li> This iron heats up fast and does a wonderful job for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> This iron is as good or better than the Chi Iron</li>
            <li> Love the color, love the difference it made on my hair!  </li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t believe me but a good flat iron can make your hair look so much better!!!</li>
            <li> and i am impressed so far with the titanium plate</li>
            <li> But if you have a perm/relaxer, or softer, more manageable hair, it will do quite nicely.</li>
            <li> but this is the BEST by far.</li>
            <li> She says this is by far the best</li>
            <li> Great product so worth the money</li>
            <li> Overall great price and great product.</li>
            <li> It did do a great job, but took much longer to warm up, get kinks out of my hair, and it seemed that by afternoon, I would need to touch up because the waves would return.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working just as great as when I first purchased it, and the swivel cord is convenient and hasn&#x27;t frayed at all.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> First off I LOVE my chi!!</li>
            <li> I loved the sample of the Silk Infusion that was included, so much that I ran out and purchased more!  </li>
            <li> but wasn&#x27;t sure which one to get.  </li>
            <li> Just using it for about 20 minutes most mornings.</li>
            <li> Girls love it.</li>
            <li> Would gladly reorder again and recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> My favorite color is orange</li>
            <li> I received many compliments.</li>
            <li> The color is not my favorite-</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend and she&#x27;s in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I would replace all of my curling irons with this one if I were more into curly hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using theres I bought myself one since I felt this one worked much better than the Chee</li>
            <li> When she saw it she &#x27;fell in love&#x27; with it.  </li>
            <li> I personally was impressed with the service.  </li>
            <li> and i have not yet been able to re-create the hair style she did</li>
            <li> I was not too sure about the color</li>
            <li> and i love the straightener.</li>
            <li> i love the hair products as well</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll enjoy!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great hair straightener that I highly recommend getting this one!</li>
            <li> but I did like the adjustable settings and her favorite color</li>
            <li> Love that this does have temperature control settings.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace my revlon straightener and soooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love how I can put what degree</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> This Chi flat iron is the best one I have ever used.</li>
            <li> ceramic Chi flat iron, which was the best iron I had ever owned until I got this one.  </li>
            <li> One Off The Best Flat Irons I&#x27;ve Ever Had!</li>
            <li> I am not a hair expert for sure, but this product has been easy and dependable.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for offering this wonderful product on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> part is it is cheap and works fine for my curly freezy hair!</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about my CHI!</li>
            <li> My last one lasted over 10 years and this one is just as good!</li>
            <li> This gets rolled up once cool and tossed in a basket, and it still lasts!</li>
            <li> easy to handle.</li>
            <li> -Easy to operate&lt;br /&gt;- easy to carry&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Easy to use,good for styling/ curling.[[ASIN:B004HFBC9W Chi 33512</li>
            <li> Was more than i expected, works great no problems so far, great price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great extra</li>
            <li> I bought this flatiron because my hair was starting to fall out, and my stylist recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;The situation has greatly improved.</li>
            <li> I have had many different brands over the years and this one by far I&#x27;d the best!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I saved money because it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering this because of some of the reviews that said it stopped working, but it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> - I had an original Chee that still works fine..</li>
            <li> Heats quick, easy to use, and leaves hair nice and straight.</li>
            <li> The flat iron is working great and is exceeding my expectations.</li>
            <li> Great flat irons!</li>
            <li> It has a nice, long cord, which is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> She had the original CHI for almost 7 years and it gave out.</li>
            <li> an original, 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have owned many chi&#x27;s and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> , she is very picky about her straightners, but she was more than satisfied when she used this for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have owned so far.</li>
            <li> And, the price is right too!  </li>
            <li> My beautician recommended this product and she was absolutely right!</li>
            <li> Turns out the research was right!  </li>
            <li> I love how fast it heats up-within seconds.</li>
            <li> Once I set the number of minutes I want, it would be good for it to be that way the next time I turn it on....automatically.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No burning, my hair is very shiny and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li> It is fast, which I love.  </li>
            <li> I let it cool off and tried again - nothing.  </li>
            <li> But the true test was for my 6 yro.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and quickly, on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was unsure of what the titanium would b like compared to ceramic, honestly I find it to be a little better!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out like some and gets hot very quickly...</li>
            <li> My hair is also super shiny after having used it.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and gets my hair just the way i like it</li>
            <li> Came extremely quick.</li>
            <li> Pretty fantastic if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> Needed a new case and after many days of searching this was the one-</li>
            <li> Anyone using this straightener should also know, you should use a product to safeguard your hair from heat damage as this thing gets soooooo hot!  </li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the flat irons.</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other kind EVER AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I have coarse, latin, curly hair, and this Chi works the magic!</li>
            <li> It heats quickly, and gets super hot.  </li>
            <li> It straightens really well and leaves my hair smooth and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is wavy and smooth but she likes it to be straight.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend purchasing this iron to anyone and it is worth the price I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> My hair came out looking salon fresh.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite items i&#x27;ve ordered so far from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought with this straightener I&#x27;d be able to go natural, but I ended up giving in and just getting a relaxer.</li>
            <li> She said it works better than her old CHI</li>
            <li> It has really high heat too, and the settings are easy to work.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super curly and it straightens and stays straight!</li>
            <li> but the price was right on Amazon.</li>
            <li> She was right on the mark.</li>
            <li> but anyways sent it back today I really wanted to like may try to reorder if I don&#x27;t get another hs1 which I really liked but broke</li>
            <li> My hair gets straight quick and stays that way all day.</li>
            <li> This Chi heats up super fast and holds it&#x27;s heat throughout the straightening process.  </li>
            <li> It smooths out your hair super straight.</li>
            <li> Her previous Chi lasted a good 7 years...</li>
            <li> My cheap flat iron worked just fine after being in storage for 8 months.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this model because of the good reviews and to save a little money.  </li>
            <li> It has lasted 2 years with no issues, used often, heats fast, high heat, styles and straightens hair, make it smooth and shiny, or can make waves.</li>
            <li> And I love the digital adjustments.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife back in Feb 2012, she used it for about 30 days, and then it wouldn&#x27;t work any more.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!  </li>
            <li> and my daughter absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was for course/curly hair until AFTER I ordered it and at first that concerned me.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair that has wave</li>
            <li> I love the Chi Deep Brilliance too!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can set the heat setting to how hot you want it and that it has a timer for an automatic shut off (I ruined my last Chi by letting it stay on all day).</li>
            <li> Very up to date and convenient!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener and it worked well when i first got it</li>
            <li> I guess it gets so hot hair</li>
            <li> I have had so many different straighteners</li>
            <li> , it straightens the first time so dress time is shortened.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong and it straightens my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love the digital dial,timer,color, how sturdy the chi brilliance is.</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended to quickly get the job done.</li>
            <li> Works really great on all types of hair and with half  or quarter of the time as my old Revlon.  </li>
            <li> With the right styling products, those frizzies stay away for almost the whole day.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Chi needs more flat irons like these.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love my flat iron its just the gratest.</li>
            <li> I truly love my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My favorite flat iron EVER!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this flat iron!  </li>
            <li> What a time to break, right before New Years Eve!</li>
            <li> It gets really hot, and gets the hair really straight.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast, love the digital display that a normal chi doesn&#x27;t have, always stays hot, I don&#x27;t have to take breaks to give it time to get really hot again.</li>
            <li> Super quick to heat up - even 2 years later.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and curly, so I was impressed that my hair was left smooth, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I AM SOOOOO IN LOVE WITH MY CHI DB FLAT IRONS!!!!</li>
            <li> The exterior is cheap plastic that gets hot enough on the plastic that you can burn yourself while using it.  </li>
            <li> least it does a pretty good job, and it doesn&#x27;t catch your strands in the plates.  </li>
            <li> This one seems to be just as good as the old one for half the price...</li>
            <li> and they heat up really fast.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Heats lightening fast, thermometer takes the guesswork out of knowing when it&#x27;s heated.  </li>
            <li> ALL READY...</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very autumny orange</li>
            <li> VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> She says \\&quot;everything you order gets here really fast!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This makes straighting so much easier.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It straightens hair really well</li>
            <li> but I really like the Velcro cord keeper</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this replacement, this iron makes my so straight and shiny</li>
            <li> It does a good job of smoothing out the top layers, but it does NOT really straighten thickly textured hair.</li>
            <li> And it got just hot enough to straighten my super curly hair and not burn my hair or my hands.</li>
            <li> great item if ur girlfriend spends all day in the mirror doing hair, cuts time in half compared to other hot irons.</li>
            <li> This is a genuine Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had to get out my cheap flat iron for storage in order to finish my hair.  </li>
            <li> It straighten her hair better than any other straightener that I have use.</li>
            <li> I have fine, long relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> all have long straight hair - this iron gives a smooth shinny look and curls the ends</li>
            <li> Nice but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this flat iron for smooth, wavy hair even though it&#x27;s not advertised as being for this type of hair.</li>
            <li> I owned the original Chi flat iron for 5 years before it died.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick curly (mostly very wavy and frizzy) hair, and had a classic CHI that did a good job until it died.  </li>
            <li> Product feels sturdy in hand, much better than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li> This iron replaced my much older, cheaper one.  </li>
            <li> Its more of a deep red-orange on the outside</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this iron but it only lasted a few months.  </li>
            <li> My teenage girls flat iron works better than this and they purchsed theirs at a beauty supply store for $19.99...</li>
            <li> DO not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I can put it straight to my dry, curly hair and it will quickly straighten out.  </li>
            <li> BUT IT WAS A SURE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love it every time.</li>
            <li> Thick hair textures are better off putting a hot comb to their roots because this product won&#x27;t quite do the trick.</li>
            <li> I will be buying a few more.</li>
            <li> I did her entire head in 25 min which used to take more than 90 min with my old flat iron</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted a new straightener for her birthday</li>
            <li> I spent a substantial amount of money of this item, but I think it must have been more for the name than the actual sincerity of the product.</li>
            <li> It heats very quickly, I&#x27;ve had it for months and the plates have yet to be marked or scratched, and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same sections multiple times.  </li>
            <li> Do not be lured by the pretty colors and low price!  </li>
            <li> Spend the extra money on the ORIGINAL Chi Flat Iron by Farouk - you will not be diappointed.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that the instructions to use the iron were not very clear, but I was able to figure out the different modes on the iron.</li>
            <li> I have used other flat irons, and so far, this has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li> and i thought i was one of the lucky ones, but it simply stopped heating after 2-3 months of moderate use.</li>
            <li> I got past the bright orange easily enough- who&#x27;s looking at your flat iron?  </li>
            <li> Love that all of its components are lead-free(again, unlike my previous flat iron).</li>
            <li> And it did not work nearly as well as the original black CHI.</li>
            <li> I love the auto-off feature since my daughter kept forgetting to turn off our previous flat iron.</li>
            <li> It does not pull and tug like her old straightener and does not seem like its burning or breaking her hair.</li>
            <li> The Chi Deep Brilliance straightens hair really well in one stroke.</li>
            <li> I used to smell burning hair and told her to ease up on the using her old straightner, she asked for a CHI</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this flat-iron to anyone wanting a salon quality product at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas (it was the only thing she asked for)  and besides being a reasonable price it works well</li>
            <li> I could get it straight with a regular straightner</li>
            <li> I use less heat and it leaves my hair shiny and super smooth with less effort.</li>
            <li> It also comes with this hair serum that makes your hair feel sooo soft.</li>
            <li> and I use it to straighten my natural hair as well as wigs and weaves.</li>
            <li> and it still feels soft.  </li>
            <li> I will also point out that I am a busy Mom, and don&#x27;t overly baby my hair products.</li>
            <li> She is biracial &amp; has really curly hair, it&#x27;s still the same texture as mine</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> The price was also reasonable for flat irons that work so well.</li>
            <li> Too much money for a flat iron</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight for a long time.  </li>
            <li> This is the exact performance that was expected.</li>
            <li> The traditional Chi flat iron doesn&#x27;t allow for temperature adjustment and was way too hot for my hair.</li>
            <li> The flat iron was shipped out and received in decent timing about 5 days.</li>
            <li> After searching the internet about this straight iron I found that several people had problems with theirs being defective and breaking after a short period of time as well.</li>
            <li> I intended to return it after using it the first time, but due to return shipping costs and restocking fees, I would&#x27;ve paid $30 for my \\&quot;trial</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not available on many other straighteners.</li>
            <li> But anyone with really long, thick hair had better have toned muscles.  </li>
            <li> I mean never, been this soft, silky, and beautiful with any other flat iron she&#x27;s used in the past.  </li>
            <li> when I first used this just straightened my bangs worked fine few days later tried plugged in turned on few minutes later would not come back on even when pressing reset</li>
            <li> Heats up fast amd not as damaging as some other straighteners.</li>
            <li> It says it reaches 410 degrees but after a few uses it barely gets hot.</li>
            <li> I was worried that for such a low price I would get a bad product, but this straightener works great.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron approximately a month ago and am in love with this.  </li>
            <li> Extra long cord, very sturdy, even worked on wet hair.</li>

            <li> When I ordered this flat iron for my daughter, I didn&#x27;t realize that it was made for highly coarse hair</li>
            <li> Price for new ones are half what they used to be...</li>
            <li> Ordered chi deep brilliance flat iron and instead they sent a blow dryer!</li>
            <li> this was the only flat iron that straighting nappy hair!</li>
            <li> I should have heeded the advice of the earlier reviewers, this thing won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> At least I got a holder for the thing, so it is not lying around hot if I forget it....</li>
            <li> this flat iron works</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron for my granddaughter who is going away to college.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried flat irons before, but none of them have worked as well as the Chi.  </li>
            <li> If you need a styling flat iron, I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I like the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I want to flat iron everyone&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> So far, I have forgotten only twice in the few months</li>
            <li> It was light, thick, and fluffy.</li>
            <li> (they only have a limited number of authorized sellers....</li>
            <li> This is the least expensive flat iron that has successfully tamed my curly hair - I highly recommend this if you have thick, curly, or long hair</li>
            <li> This flat iron ROCKS!!</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try a non-ceramic iron, as that is all I&#x27;ve ever used, but I did some research and found that titanium is supposedly much better.  </li>
            <li> I know how long it takes me to deal with my hair.  </li>
            <li> But it does allow you to set up a clock to \\&quot;go off in 17 min\\&quot; or however long you want to keep it on.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t taken so long to decide to purchase one.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I have to get a new one is because I&#x27;m hard on the cord.</li>
            <li> We returned it to Discounts Jungle, and they either repaired or replaced it, and send it back (postage due).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know their hair was that long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a fan of the flat iron until now!</li>
            <li> but only a few months later it broke.</li>
            <li> started again when new also noticed when using it seemed when clamped down uneven</li>
            <li> This is a very expensive hair tool that I found here and very affordable and it came at my house fast.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that naturally curls, waves, and kinks in a lot of places.  </li>
            <li> However, I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t run as smoothly down my thick hair, and it doesn&#x27;t leave as much of a silky sheen</li>
            <li> I bought this because my Sedu had finally broken down and the CHI Deep Brilliance was rated so highly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for only 6 months - was hoping to get at least a year out of it - and it died.  </li>
            <li> I can set it so that after a few minutes or after I leave for the day, it will definitely shut off.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not coarse, but not fine either.  </li>
            <li> I am an African American female and this product straightens my hair, but fails to deliver the curl that one would expect with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with the iron so far and feel the past reviews are not very truthful.  </li>
            <li> My other Chi was pre-timed when you turned it on.  </li>
            <li> other way</li>
            <li> look to my hair as the porcelin plates on the other Chis do.  </li>
            <li> If you go quickly and carelessly however, hair will snag underneath the chrome plates and pull!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t auto shut off after remaining on for extended period of time...</li>
            <li> Usually I can&#x27;t stand them because they take too long to get the job over and done with</li>
            <li> The Chi deep Brilliance is marketed towards thick, course &#x27;ethnic&#x27; hair, which I have.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it out on my younger sibling who has a TON of curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> She had a less expensive one and really wanted a Chi.  </li>
            <li> Hands Down</li>
            <li> I have &#x27;beachy curls&#x27; and it whips thru them in less than 10 min.</li>
            <li> I previously owned (and still have as backup)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so skeptical of the low prices fo the Originial Chi Amazon, that I&#x27;m going to Trade Secret to get mine - even though I will spend twice as much.</li>
            <li> She has thick long hair</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s not like my wife is styling hair for a living, and using the iron all day long.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and found this one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and she can straighten her hair in about half the time!</li>
            <li> this Chi is pretty heavy to hold; with shorter to-shoulder hair, it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> it is a waste!</li>
            <li> Not real happy with the product though.</li>
            <li> The instructions for the amount of heat was somewhat confusing to me as I would set the timer instead of the temperature.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for fully natural/afro or thickly textured hair types.</li>
            <li> I was not very happy.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find and expensive at stores</li>
            <li> Not happy at all and will request refund.</li>
            <li> After talking to Farouk on the phone about my broken product they informed me that they do not offer warranties on CHIs sold by unauthorized sellers.</li>
            <li> Overall very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick unmanageable hair!</li>
            <li> I AM DISAPPOINTED, NOT SURE IF THE PRODUCT WAS DEFECTIVE WHEN SOLD  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed the moment I unpackaged it.</li>
            <li> and it was done :(</li>
            <li> I thought chi was a reliable brand but very disappointed</li>

            <li> I AM DISAPPOINTED, NOT SURE IF THE PRODUCT WAS DEFECTIVE WHEN SOLD  BUT IT WAS A SURE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> Ordered chi deep brilliance flat iron and instead they sent a blow dryer! Not happy at all and will request refund.</li>
            <li> These work great on my hair and the pricing was excellent.  I like that you can adjust the heat and they heat up really fast.  My hair stays straight for a long time.  Great flat irons!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this flat iron works great straightening it! And I love the digital adjustments. My favorite flat iron EVER!</li>
            <li> I knew my daughter wanted a chi..but wasn&#x27;t sure which one to get.  I did a little research and found this one, she is very picky about her straightners, but she was more than satisfied when she used this for the first time yesterday.  Great product and a great price compared to buying it out of the store!</li>
            <li> Everything came as described. Works very well. Product feels sturdy in hand, much better than the previous one I had. Love that all of its components are lead-free(again, unlike my previous flat iron).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife back in Feb 2012, she used it for about 30 days, and then it wouldn&#x27;t work any more. We returned it to Discounts Jungle, and they either repaired or replaced it, and send it back (postage due). After another 30 days it broke again. We are now beyond the time period that the vendor will warranty. Not real happy with the product though. I mean, it&#x27;s not like my wife is styling hair for a living, and using the iron all day long. Just using it for about 20 minutes most mornings. I should have heeded the advice of the earlier reviewers, this thing won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Super quick to heat up - even 2 years later.  Cord doesn&#x27;t tangle - feels sturdy in your hands.  If you go quickly and carelessly however, hair will snag underneath the chrome plates and pull!</li>
            <li> Both of my daughters wanted this for Christmas. It was hard to find and expensive at stores so I turned to Amazon. Good quality, brand name they wanted, lower cost. It has lasted 2 years with no issues, used often, heats fast, high heat, styles and straightens hair, make it smooth and shiny, or can make waves. easy to handle. Girls love it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this flat iron!  I loved the sample of the Silk Infusion that was included, so much that I ran out and purchased more!  The iron kept it&#x27;s temperature and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was burning or damaging my hair.  My hair is very thick and curly, so I was impressed that my hair was left smooth, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener for my daughter. She had a less expensive one and really wanted a Chi.  She loves this iron. It does not pull and tug like her old straightener and does not seem like its burning or breaking her hair. Her hair actually feels softer.  Great price too!!!!!</li>
            <li> great quality, my daughter loved it</li>
            <li> It was a great transaction.  The product shipped on time with no hassles.  Good value.  I would buy again from this seller. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a genuine Chi flat iron. I&#x27;ve had it a while now and it&#x27;s still working just as great as when I first purchased it, and the swivel cord is convenient and hasn&#x27;t frayed at all. I received it in the mail in a timely manner and have been using it just about every day since.</li>
            <li> Was more than i expected, works great no problems so far, great price.  Would definately order from this site in the future.</li>
            <li> The Chi Deep Brilliance straightens hair really well in one stroke. This is the exact performance that was expected. It is highly recommended to quickly get the job done.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for offering this wonderful product on Amazon!  This straightener works better than a ceramic straightener!  And, the price is right too!  Anyone using this straightener should also know, you should use a product to safeguard your hair from heat damage as this thing gets soooooo hot!  Thanks again!  Cheers xoxo Ash</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!  I used to smell burning hair and told her to ease up on the using her old straightner, she asked for a CHI now I don&#x27;t smell burnt hair throughout the house and she swears by it.</li>
            <li> Heats lightening fast, thermometer takes the guesswork out of knowing when it&#x27;s heated.  Extra long cord, very sturdy, even worked on wet hair.</li>
            <li> great item if ur girlfriend spends all day in the mirror doing hair, cuts time in half compared to other hot irons. she says she loves it i can tell the difference it has made on her hair. these irons work great!!!!!</li>
            <li> The flat iron is working great and is exceeding my expectations. Would gladly reorder again and recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This stopped working after 2 times. And it did not work nearly as well as the original black CHI. After talking to Farouk on the phone about my broken product they informed me that they do not offer warranties on CHIs sold by unauthorized sellers. (they only have a limited number of authorized sellers....jcPenny, Ulta, Beautybrands ect). Overall very disappointed with this product. After searching the internet about this straight iron I found that several people had problems with theirs being defective and breaking after a short period of time as well. DO not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I AM SOOOOO IN LOVE WITH MY CHI DB FLAT IRONS!!!! I HAVE BEEN SO HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT ALL READY...THANKS SO MUCH</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the real deal.  It&#x27;s CHI by Farouk, as opposed to the cheapie line CHI home, sold at WalMart.  It heats quickly, and gets super hot.  It straightens really well and leaves my hair smooth and frizz-free.  I would definitely recommend this flat-iron to anyone wanting a salon quality product at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product has an auto shut-off option.  It&#x27;s a great extra that&#x27;s not available on many other straighteners.</li>
            <li> I bought this flatiron because my hair was starting to fall out, and my stylist recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;The situation has greatly improved.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron approximately a month ago and am in love with this.  My favorite color is orange so it fits perfectly with my decor.  I have not had any problems with the iron so far and feel the past reviews are not very truthful.  The only problem I have is that the instructions to use the iron were not very clear, but I was able to figure out the different modes on the iron. I especially enjoy the timed mode on iron as I know many times women tend to forget to unplug the iron. I can set it so that after a few minutes or after I leave for the day, it will definitely shut off.  I would recommend purchasing this iron to anyone and it is worth the price I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for our daughter, it was here in 3 days....WOW... that was fast - she said this flatiron was awesome - she was running around the house with it saying: I got a CHI, I got a CHI.....cant beat this price either -</li>
            <li> I purchased this Chi  on November 27, 2011. It is now December 29th and I went to use it this morning and it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on! What a time to break, right before New Years Eve! I tried pressing the reset button, even plugging into different wall outlets (thinking the one in the bathroom was not working properly). I was very satisfied with this Chi, until this morning. Now I&#x27;m on the hunt to find another one, maybe even go back to the Chi that isn&#x27;t digital, they seem to work forever!!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. The traditional Chi flat iron doesn&#x27;t allow for temperature adjustment and was way too hot for my hair. Every time I would straighten my hair, there was a burning smell. Also I would often burn my scalp when trying to straighten my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That does not happen with this one. I have fine, long relaxed hair. I keep it on 300 degrees and it works so well. I could instantly see the difference. My hair came out looking salon fresh. It was light, thick, and fluffy. My style lasted the longest it ever has. My hair looked rather radiant. I received many compliments. There&#x27;s no burning smell when I straighten my hair. Chi needs more flat irons like these.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas (it was the only thing she asked for)  and besides being a reasonable price it works well and my daughter absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have owned so far. It takes away my frizzies in a hurry. With the right styling products, those frizzies stay away for almost the whole day. I love how fast it heats up-within seconds. I love the auto-off feature since my daughter kept forgetting to turn off our previous flat iron.The color is not my favorite- it&#x27;s a very autumny orange but the price was right on Amazon.</li>
            <li> First off I LOVE my chi!! It is the most amazing straightner ever! My hair is super curly and it straightens and stays straight! I could get it straight with a regular straightner but it only last for a couple hours. With the Chi, I straighten my hair and it stays that way ALL day and even the next morning there are only a couple curls! I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the flat irons. The price was also reasonable for flat irons that work so well.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend and she&#x27;s in love with it.  VERY happy.  AWESOME product, straightens AND does really beautiful spiral curls.  I would replace all of my curling irons with this one if I were more into curly hair.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS STRAIGHTENER IN JUNE. I LOVE IT. IT WORKS VERY WELL. I HAVE NO COPLAINTS AND WOULD RECOMEND TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Chi in August and it broke within 8 months.  I had to get out my cheap flat iron for storage in order to finish my hair.  My cheap flat iron worked just fine after being in storage for 8 months.  Too much money for a flat iron that&#x27;s not dependable.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite items i&#x27;ve ordered so far from Amazon. works great heats up in no time. Really like it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron.  It gets really hot, and gets the hair really straight.  I have used other flat irons, and so far, this has been my favorite.  My hair is also super shiny after having used it.  It has a nice, long cord, which is a nice feature.  I also like the timer feature.</li>
            <li> Have had a Chi for years....got this one because of the auto feature, which, it turns out, has to be preset manually after you turn it on.  RATS.&lt;br /&gt;Who does that?  So, basically, you DO have to remember to turn it off when you are through with it.  Again: RATS.  My other Chi was pre-timed when you turned it on.  You could change the number of minutes, but each time you turned it on, the preset was in place already (from your initial setting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the matter with these mfgrs?  They don&#x27;t consult women on what women want.  I know how long it takes me to deal with my hair.  Once I set the number of minutes I want, it would be good for it to be that way the next time I turn it on....automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this Chi is pretty heavy to hold; with shorter to-shoulder hair, it&#x27;s not too bad.  But anyone with really long, thick hair had better have toned muscles.  At least I got a holder for the thing, so it is not lying around hot if I forget it....but, man, the electricity it burns: $$$$.  So far, I have forgotten only twice in the few months I have had it...so I am still in training....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least it does a pretty good job, and it doesn&#x27;t catch your strands in the plates.  Heat settings good and adjustable.  But auto-timed it ain&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 chi straighteners before this one. They each lasted 5 years or longer. The only reason I have to get a new one is because I&#x27;m hard on the cord. This titanium is amazing though!! I use less heat and it leaves my hair shiny and super smooth with less effort. So glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> Both 2 for my daughters for Christmas - I had an original Chee that still works fine..&lt;br /&gt;After using theres I bought myself one since I felt this one worked much better than the Chee I already had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have long straight hair - this iron gives a smooth shinny look and curls the ends&lt;br /&gt;of our hair very nice.  I recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> This is the second chi I have owned that stopped working in under a year. I was not very happy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron for my granddaughter who is going away to college.  When she saw it she &#x27;fell in love&#x27; with it.  I personally was impressed with the service.  We ordered this on August 5th and even with the standard shipping it arrived on the 8th.  Pretty fantastic if you ask me.  She says \\&quot;everything you order gets here really fast!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had my beautian refer me to this product and i am impressed so far with the titanium plate and i have not yet been able to re-create the hair style she did however i have not burnt nor crimped it yet. So, woman dancing !</li>
            <li> This iron replaced my much older, cheaper one.  I am VERY pleased.  I like the digital settings and automatic shut-off.  My hair is not coarse, but not fine either.  Works great!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks! Needed a new case and after many days of searching this was the one- great, well made product- she loves it!</li>
            <li> This is the least expensive flat iron that has successfully tamed my curly hair - I highly recommend this if you have thick, curly, or long hair</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about my CHI! It does an amazing job! I have very thick unmanageable hair! This makes straighting so much easier. I have had many different brands over the years and this one by far I&#x27;d the best! I was not too sure about the color but, it&#x27;s a nice Orange.</li>
            <li> My niece was asking for this for Christmas. I did not know what a Chi even was. She however did and loves it. She has thick long hair and she couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This is a very expensive hair tool that I found here and very affordable and it came at my house fast. I love this hair toll and I would recomend this product for the best price around!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my Sedu had finally broken down and the CHI Deep Brilliance was rated so highly.  I didn&#x27;t realize it was for course/curly hair until AFTER I ordered it and at first that concerned me.  But I decided I would try it and OMG works great on my caucasian hair too!!  I have pretty \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair that has wave (I do have a lot of hair) and it worked quickly and beautifully! No burning, my hair is very shiny and feels healthy.  Does not pull your hair at all! I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> -Easy to operate&lt;br /&gt;- easy to carry&lt;br /&gt;- gives nice result&lt;br /&gt;bets part is it is cheap and works fine for my curly freezy hair!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years now and i love the straightener. i love the hair products as well</li>
            <li> when I first used this just straightened my bangs worked fine few days later tried plugged in turned on few minutes later would not come back on even when pressing reset so I asked for return labels then I decided to try again and now it works but kinda scared to keep something that stopped then started again when new also noticed when using it seemed when clamped down uneven therefore when I straightened my hair it didn&#x27;t get all of it till I turned iron other way maybe I just recd a defective one but anyways sent it back today I really wanted to like may try to reorder if I don&#x27;t get another hs1 which I really liked but broke</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter and I have straighten her hair for her several times. It straighten her hair better than any other straightener that I have use.</li>
            <li> My good one broke so I bought this thinking it would save me.  Pass on it, I bought another one two days later.  It fried my hair, fried my plug and burned the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, love the digital display that a normal chi doesn&#x27;t have, always stays hot, I don&#x27;t have to take breaks to give it time to get really hot again. I can straighten my hairs after it being up all day or even curly and it still looks good</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and my cousin loves it. It really is a great buy.It straightens hair really well</li>
            <li> So far so good!  It&#x27;s a wonderful product :)  I saved almost $40 off what the stores charge.  Straightener works well!  You&#x27;ll enjoy!</li>
            <li> I was worried that for such a low price I would get a bad product, but this straightener works great.  It is fast, which I love.  My hair gets straight quick and stays that way all day.</li>
            <li> It says it reaches 410 degrees but after a few uses it barely gets hot. I thought chi was a reliable brand but very disappointed</li>
            <li> This product was received as promised. I love the Chi Deep Brilliance too! I have owned many chi&#x27;s and this is by far my favorite. Does not pull at all!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great hair straightener that I highly recommend getting this one! I love the fact that you can set the heat setting to how hot you want it and that it has a timer for an automatic shut off (I ruined my last Chi by letting it stay on all day). I use this everyday and love it every time. I especially loved the oil that came with it to protect your hair. It works great and is the perfect compliment to the iron.</li>
            <li> I was unsure of what the titanium would b like compared to ceramic, honestly I find it to be a little better! I ts not orange like the picture but I love the color! Its more of a deep red-orange on the outside but it is regular orange on the inside. Heat options &amp; timer-awesome but I really like the Velcro cord keeper</li>
            <li> This product does not work well with my hair at all. I am an African American female and this product straightens my hair, but fails to deliver the curl that one would expect with a flat iron. I spent a substantial amount of money of this item, but I think it must have been more for the name than the actual sincerity of the product. It&#x27;s a waste of money. My teenage girls flat iron works better than this and they purchsed theirs at a beauty supply store for $19.99...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried flat irons before, but none of them have worked as well as the Chi.  Very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> When I ordered this flat iron for my daughter, I didn&#x27;t realize that it was made for highly coarse hair (I found that out when it arrived).  My daughter&#x27;s hair is wavy and smooth but she likes it to be straight.  She wanted to try this iron nonetheless, so she did.  The result is that her hair turns out beautiful every time she uses it.  It has never, and I mean never, been this soft, silky, and beautiful with any other flat iron she&#x27;s used in the past.  She doesn&#x27;t set the heat to its highest setting when she uses it - probably somewhere in the middle of the heat settings.  I would highly recommend this flat iron for smooth, wavy hair even though it&#x27;s not advertised as being for this type of hair.</li>
            <li> The Chi deep Brilliance is marketed towards thick, course &#x27;ethnic&#x27; hair, which I have. It does a good job of smoothing out the top layers, but it does NOT really straighten thickly textured hair. Even after washing, deep conditioning and blow drying my hair for preparation, the 410 degree titanium plates could not give a uniform &amp;#34;straightened&amp;#34; look to my hair. I don&#x27;t recommend it for fully natural/afro or thickly textured hair types.But if you have a perm/relaxer, or softer, more manageable hair, it will do quite nicely. I thought with this straightener I&#x27;d be able to go natural, but I ended up giving in and just getting a relaxer. Thick hair textures are better off putting a hot comb to their roots because this product won&#x27;t quite do the trick. BUT I do like that it can create the illusion of a flattened/presentable look if you use it correctly. It also comes with this hair serum that makes your hair feel sooo soft. I also like it because it&#x27;s orange and reminds me of Nickelodeon.</li>
            <li> Love it! Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t auto shut off after remaining on for extended period of time... But it does allow you to set up a clock to \\&quot;go off in 17 min\\&quot; or however long you want to keep it on. Also allows you to pick the temperature for each use. Very up to date and convenient!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener and it worked well when i first got it but only a few months later it broke. it will not even turn on. for the price of a chi it should have worked for years and years</li>
            <li> This was to the best I purchased its a chi it should be I guess it gets so hot hair be so nice</li>
            <li> My wife seems to like it and has used it daily for over a year with out problems.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004HFBC9W Chi Deep Brilliance Digital Titanium Hair Styling Flat Iron 1\\&quot; Orange]]  I owned the original Chi flat iron for 5 years before it died.  I decided to try this model because of the good reviews and to save a little money.  I was disappointed the moment I unpackaged it. The exterior is cheap plastic that gets hot enough on the plastic that you can burn yourself while using it.  I intended to return it after using it the first time, but due to return shipping costs and restocking fees, I would&#x27;ve paid $30 for my \\&quot;trial use\\&quot; so I kept it.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for only 6 months - was hoping to get at least a year out of it - and it died.  I was in the middle of styling my hair when I noticed it was off.  I tried to turn it back on - nothing.  I tried the reset button - nothing.  I let it cool off and tried again - nothing.  Do not be lured by the pretty colors and low price!  Spend the extra money on the ORIGINAL Chi Flat Iron by Farouk - you will not be diappointed.  I&#x27;m so skeptical of the low prices fo the Originial Chi Amazon, that I&#x27;m going to Trade Secret to get mine - even though I will spend twice as much.</li>
            <li> Overall great price and great product. This was $200 in store and I&#x27;m glad I saved money because it was well worth it. I have had this for over 1 year and I use it to straighten my natural hair as well as wigs and weaves. Another satisfied customer!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter for her birthday. She had the original CHI for almost 7 years and it gave out. I was concerned about how well this one would work but I did like the adjustable settings and her favorite color is orange. She loves it! She said it works better than her old CHI and she can straighten her hair in about half the time! Shipping was very quick and the price was great. I am so glad I purchased this CHI!</li>
            <li> I have had so many different straighteners but this is the BEST by far. I will never buy any other kind EVER AGAIN! GREAT PRICE, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> This Chi heats up super fast and holds it&#x27;s heat throughout the straightening process.  It has really high heat too, and the settings are easy to work.  However, I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t run as smoothly down my thick hair, and it doesn&#x27;t leave as much of a silky sheen look to my hair as the porcelin plates on the other Chis do.  Great value for the price I payed though!</li>
            <li> This iron heats up fast and does a wonderful job for my hair. I have had no problems and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love my flat iron its just the gratest.It heats up quickly and gets my hair just the way i like it</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted a new straightener for her birthday so she picked this one.  She has had numerous straighteners through her 24 years.  She says this is by far the best, it straightens the first time so dress time is shortened.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly (mostly very wavy and frizzy) hair, and had a classic CHI that did a good job until it died.  I could not be happier with this replacement, this iron makes my so straight and shiny and it still feels soft.  I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> This iron is as good or better than the Chi Iron I paid over $100.0 for. I recommend it and plan to buy another one for a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this iron but it only lasted a few months.  All of a sudden in the middle of use it just went out. The electronics on it stopped working and it was done :(</li>
            <li> This flat iron ROCKS!! It smooths out your hair super straight. I have coarse, latin, curly hair, and this Chi works the magic! The flat iron was shipped out and received in decent timing about 5 days.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating bc I love it! I like it bc this was the only flat iron that straighting nappy hair! I dislike nothing! I recommand to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> She was right on the mark. I am not a hair expert for sure, but this product has been easy and dependable.</li>
            <li> I use this Chi several times a week.  Works really great on all types of hair and with half  or quarter of the time as my old Revlon.  Love that this does have temperature control settings.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> Her previous Chi lasted a good 7 years... Price for new ones are half what they used to be... This one seems to be just as good as the old one for half the price... Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  The instructions for the amount of heat was somewhat confusing to me as I would set the timer instead of the temperature.  If you need a styling flat iron, I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I love Chi products! My last one lasted over 10 years and this one is just as good! This even has an auto off timer you can set! I will never buy another brand!  I will also point out that I am a busy Mom, and don&#x27;t overly baby my hair products. This gets rolled up once cool and tossed in a basket, and it still lasts!</li>
            <li> Chi is the best straightener on the market. I only use Chi for straightening. Heats up fast amd not as damaging as some other straighteners.</li>
            <li> I truly love my flat iron. Easy to use,good for styling/ curling.[[ASIN:B004HFBC9W Chi 33512 Deep Brilliance Digital Titanium Hair Styling Flat Iron, Orange, 1 Inch]]</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!  Love the color, love the difference it made on my hair!  My husband doesn&#x27;t believe me but a good flat iron can make your hair look so much better!!!</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering this because of some of the reviews that said it stopped working, but it works fantastic. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong and it straightens my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> Hight quality--good price!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t taken so long to decide to purchase one.  My beautician recommended this product and she was absolutely right!</li>
            <li> The power and settings buttons didnt interfere with my hand held positon, so im very Happy. And it got just hot enough to straighten my super curly hair and not burn my hair or my hands. Great product so worth the money</li>
            <li> it worked perfectly in the beginning and i thought i was one of the lucky ones, but it simply stopped heating after 2-3 months of moderate use. don&#x27;t buy this! it is a waste!</li>
            <li> This Chi flat iron is the best one I have ever used. I have &#x27;beachy curls&#x27; and it whips thru them in less than 10 min. But the true test was for my 6 yro. She is biracial &amp; has really curly hair, it&#x27;s still the same texture as mine but it&#x27;s curly. I did her entire head in 25 min which used to take more than 90 min with my old flat iron</li>
            <li> Came extremely quick. Works perfectly. Purchased to replace my revlon straightener and soooooo glad I did. It works perfectly and quickly, on my thick hair. Strongly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this iron because it was not ceramic, and it was bright orange.  I got past the bright orange easily enough- who&#x27;s looking at your flat iron?  I was afraid to try a non-ceramic iron, as that is all I&#x27;ve ever used, but I did some research and found that titanium is supposedly much better.  Turns out the research was right!  It heats very quickly, I&#x27;ve had it for months and the plates have yet to be marked or scratched, and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same sections multiple times.  I have long, thick hair that naturally curls, waves, and kinks in a lot of places.  Of course, it helps to blow-dry it before ironing, but I don&#x27;t have to with this iron- I can put it straight to my dry, curly hair and it will quickly straighten out.  I previously owned (and still have as backup) an original, 1&amp;#34; ceramic Chi flat iron, which was the best iron I had ever owned until I got this one.  It did do a great job, but took much longer to warm up, get kinks out of my hair, and it seemed that by afternoon, I would need to touch up because the waves would return.  I don&#x27;t have this issue with the Deep Brilliance, and will definitely replace this with another of the same when/if it burns out!</li>
            <li> Amazing straightener.</li>
            <li> I like the flat iron.  It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out like some and gets hot very quickly...I need that especially in the mornings!!  I would def recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> For the price, the quality is great! Heats quick, easy to use, and leaves hair nice and straight. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This works as well as any salon one and my daughter loves it! I will be buying a few more.</li>
            <li> Love how I can put what degree I want the temperature!  Works perfect, had one before and dropped it in water so I had to buy another but I would buy another lone of these if I needed  to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a fan of the flat iron until now! Today I received my chi and it was shipped two days ago. So great timing! I decided to try it out on my younger sibling who has a TON of curly thick hair. And I was amazed at how it straightened within one passing. I wish I could post a picture I didn&#x27;t even know their hair was that long! I love the digital dial,timer,color, how sturdy the chi brilliance is. Hands Down One Off The Best Flat Irons I&#x27;ve Ever Had! Usually I can&#x27;t stand them because they take too long to get the job over and done with but this chi is awesome I want to flat iron everyone&#x27;s hair it&#x27;s so convent!</li>
