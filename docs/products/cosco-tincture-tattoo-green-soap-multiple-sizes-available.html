            <li>Pretty good product I could say.</li>
            <li>Cosco Green Soap is the best for tattooing, I have been using it for many years and many more to come.</li>
            <li>it made it easy for me</li>
            <li>Checked with a more experienced artist and found out that what I got works the same but would have been cheaper than what I paid.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was incredibly nice and delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>Made the extra unwanted ink come right off without messing the work up its a great product!</li>
            <li>but I bought them for a tattoo artist that I bet he&#x27;s doing fine by using this</li>
            <li>Great value especially considering the concentration of the soap.  </li>
            <li>Took their time but green soap is the best.</li>
            <li>Always great, this is the only soap I use for tattooing</li>
            <li>the green soap is quite good and we trust it to be a good cleaning agent</li>
            <li>Our whole shop smells of this product !!!</li>
            <li>I was already familiar with this product but after moving I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>it wipes clean and no irritation and no side affects</li>
            <li>As expected great price</li>
            <li>thanks for offering this product so we have it to be safe and sterile.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve bumped it up to full marks for their score.  </li>
            <li>and I will get more Thanks</li>
            <li>If you tattoo or just learning, it&#x27;s a great idea to have green soap available</li>
            <li>Arrived Quick and just as described...</li>
            <li>Ordering it this was has proved to be effective and it came even more quickly than expected</li>
            <li>As described and shipped quick.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for use with tattooing, prodect is excellent and will last you a long time if using it for tattooing, mix 8 to 1 water/soap..</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!!</li>
            <li>Bottles were sealed &amp; was exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>The service was fast, and the product description was accurate.</li>
            <li>would be nice if it come in a bigger container</li>
            <li>The tincture of green soap is good for keeping the thing clean.</li>
            <li>It was delivered at the right time.</li>
            <li>i use this stuff to clean up tattoo&#x27;s, and really does the job at cleaning up ink, stencil marks, blood ect,.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and it smells good too....</li>
            <li>Really good if you water it down first</li>
            <li>this product is exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li>This product or anything similar should not be used for tattooing for many reasons.</li>
            <li>This is a must for any one interested in tattooing.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for tattooing and it is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>Though it definitely is great, and it&#x27;s a big bottle to use for a long time.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order again when I need more.</li>
            <li>First of all I didn&#x27;t recieve 1 pint I recieved 16 fl oz.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t recieve what I thought I was paying for.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>THIS HAS BEEN SOME GOOD GREEN SOAP,</li>
            <li>is what the hospitals use,its even got a litle alcohol in it for sterilization, its got ethanol,it the real deal,because its hospital grade,and i think this is a good co. for getting green soap.</li>
            <li>Might have it mixed to strong is why it stings.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>Cosco sells this stuff universally at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>very pleased.will order again.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, bottle sealed</li>
            <li>This stuff works really weel.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Cleans up very well.</li>
            <li>Not to much to write on this.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm and like always fast delivery</li>
            <li>Plus it made my whole apartment smell like tattoo parlor.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Always have some green soap handy when doing a tattoo.</li>
            <li>it does not however get the full 5 stars because its a totally different brand than cosco...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and lasts a very long time</li>
            <li>Bottles were not completely full but all in all its a okay product for the price.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOOMEND IT.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>a little watered down but stil has that great shop smell</li>
            <li>Make sure when you buy it from amazon that you are not buying pre diluted green soap.</li>
            <li>so yay green soap :)</li>
            <li>Green soap works better than anything else for removing excess tattoo ink when you are working.  </li>
            <li>It says right on the label you can see \\&quot; for external use</li>
            <li>its still works amazing and does what its suppose to do and is still medical grade green soap...</li>
            <li>Got exactly what i ordered, and received it earlier then estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>i put a little in my squirt bottle and add water because its so strong and it lasts longer that way...</li>
            <li>Works all the time never fails, great item ill keep using it myself , and recommend it to other personnel</li>
            <li>If you order this to product from a non professional distributor you may end up being investigated and reviewed.</li>
            <li>i also recommend this seller, i got my product in 2 days, the packaging was legit, and they were just professional about it.</li>
            <li>if your worried about a pint being enough I guess it depends on how much work you do.</li>
            <li>was delivered fast and serves its job  simple as that</li>
            <li>i like this green soap, it was better than the last one i was using.  </li>
            <li>I tried using this for tattoo transferring, and I&#x27;m still not very sure how exactly to make it work where it won&#x27;t blur the transfer too much, so that&#x27;s something to look into before ordering this product.</li>
            <li>this one cleans off the ink well and if u need to do another print on a person and its hard to get the stencil off, this green soap is good for that also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i hope i was able to help the ones that think they got the wrong product,because if you got whats on this web page ,you got the real stuff,hospital grade,the strongest you can get.</li>
            <li>if you were to put this into the blood stream you could cause some major problems.</li>
            <li>I clearly didn&#x27;t read that it was only a pint.  </li>
            <li>good luck,  crazy rick</li>
            <li>i ordered the cosco brand green soap and i think its a better product than that green soap they put a tattoo</li>
            <li>Exactly what you would expect for green soap.</li>
            <li>on.this is the real deal it tells you right on the bottle its for surgical grade liquid soap,and tattooing is a little like surgiary.this green soap</li>

            <li> Pretty good product I could say.</li>
            <li> Cosco Green Soap is the best for tattooing, I have been using it for many years and many more to come.</li>
            <li> it made it easy for me</li>
            <li> Checked with a more experienced artist and found out that what I got works the same but would have been cheaper than what I paid.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was incredibly nice and delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> Made the extra unwanted ink come right off without messing the work up its a great product!</li>
            <li> but I bought them for a tattoo artist that I bet he&#x27;s doing fine by using this</li>
            <li> Great value especially considering the concentration of the soap.  </li>
            <li> Took their time but green soap is the best.</li>
            <li> Always great, this is the only soap I use for tattooing</li>
            <li> the green soap is quite good and we trust it to be a good cleaning agent</li>
            <li> Our whole shop smells of this product !!!</li>
            <li> I was already familiar with this product but after moving I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> it wipes clean and no irritation and no side affects</li>
            <li> As expected great price</li>
            <li> thanks for offering this product so we have it to be safe and sterile.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve bumped it up to full marks for their score.  </li>
            <li> and I will get more Thanks</li>
            <li> If you tattoo or just learning, it&#x27;s a great idea to have green soap available</li>

            <li> Really good if you water it down first</li>
            <li> this product is exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li> This product or anything similar should not be used for tattooing for many reasons.</li>
            <li> This is a must for any one interested in tattooing.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for tattooing and it is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>

            <li> First of all I didn&#x27;t recieve 1 pint I recieved 16 fl oz.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t recieve what I thought I was paying for.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> THIS HAS BEEN SOME GOOD GREEN SOAP,</li>
            <li> is what the hospitals use,its even got a litle alcohol in it for sterilization, its got ethanol,it the real deal,because its hospital grade,and i think this is a good co. for getting green soap.</li>
            <li> Might have it mixed to strong is why it stings.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Cosco sells this stuff universally at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> very pleased.will order again.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, bottle sealed</li>
            <li> This stuff works really weel.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Cleans up very well.</li>
            <li> Not to much to write on this.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and like always fast delivery</li>
            <li> Plus it made my whole apartment smell like tattoo parlor.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Always have some green soap handy when doing a tattoo.</li>
            <li> it does not however get the full 5 stars because its a totally different brand than cosco...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> Bottles were not completely full but all in all its a okay product for the price.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOOMEND IT.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> a little watered down but stil has that great shop smell</li>
            <li> Make sure when you buy it from amazon that you are not buying pre diluted green soap.</li>
            <li> so yay green soap :)</li>
            <li> Green soap works better than anything else for removing excess tattoo ink when you are working.  </li>
            <li> It says right on the label you can see \\&quot; for external use</li>
            <li> its still works amazing and does what its suppose to do and is still medical grade green soap...</li>
            <li> Got exactly what i ordered, and received it earlier then estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> i put a little in my squirt bottle and add water because its so strong and it lasts longer that way...</li>
            <li> Works all the time never fails, great item ill keep using it myself , and recommend it to other personnel</li>
            <li> If you order this to product from a non professional distributor you may end up being investigated and reviewed.</li>
            <li> i also recommend this seller, i got my product in 2 days, the packaging was legit, and they were just professional about it.</li>
            <li> if your worried about a pint being enough I guess it depends on how much work you do.</li>
            <li> was delivered fast and serves its job  simple as that</li>
            <li> i like this green soap, it was better than the last one i was using.  </li>
            <li> I tried using this for tattoo transferring, and I&#x27;m still not very sure how exactly to make it work where it won&#x27;t blur the transfer too much, so that&#x27;s something to look into before ordering this product.</li>
            <li> this one cleans off the ink well and if u need to do another print on a person and its hard to get the stencil off, this green soap is good for that also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i hope i was able to help the ones that think they got the wrong product,because if you got whats on this web page ,you got the real stuff,hospital grade,the strongest you can get.</li>
            <li> if you were to put this into the blood stream you could cause some major problems.</li>
            <li> I clearly didn&#x27;t read that it was only a pint.  </li>
            <li> good luck,  crazy rick</li>
            <li> i ordered the cosco brand green soap and i think its a better product than that green soap they put a tattoo</li>
            <li> Exactly what you would expect for green soap.</li>
            <li> on.this is the real deal it tells you right on the bottle its for surgical grade liquid soap,and tattooing is a little like surgiary.this green soap</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a tattooist or you just want a strong green cleaner... pick this bottle of green soap up!</li>
            <li> im not sure really what it is for, but he didnt complain</li>
            <li> But it definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> green soap arrived earlier then i expected and it works really well.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to use it as long as it is out.</li>
            <li> its in concentrate form, so 8 oz of this stuff goes a long way when mixing it with water.</li>
            <li> I misunderstood and expected a larger bottle</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t show a picture of the big bottle if it&#x27;s only going to be the little bottle</li>
            <li> so it does not come loose while in shipping and for that we are giving this item 3 stars</li>
            <li> I had read reviews that people did not get the Cosco brand Green soap or that the package came in leaking which made me reluctant to order the product, finally I decided not think about it and made my purchase</li>
            <li> Shipped in a tightly wrapped ziplock bag in inside a bubble wrap &amp;#34;envelope&amp;#34; to insure if it was damaged there would be less chance of extra damage.</li>
            <li> the ethanol is what breaks down the carbon for your stencil,which i don&#x27;nt use it for my stencils ,i use stencil stay,and i use green soap for cleaning and dabing the skin to get acess ink off,but remember you dilute this product nine parts of water to 1 part of the soap.this pint of soap will last you along time if used correct.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Cosco Green Soap, but received a completely different brand of green soap that I&#x27;ve never heard of before.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was a little crushed but did not affect the product.</li>
            <li> I got a lot less than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with about half a bottle of product.</li>
            <li> Its soap can&#x27;t really mess that up</li>
            <li> Bottle was damaged a little.</li>
            <li> Was smashed bottle a little bit.</li>
            <li> arrived fast and no leaking which I was afraid of.  </li>
            <li> but when we opened it there was green soap all over in the packaging .  </li>
            <li> for those that don&#x27;t know the ratio i will quote this products description &amp;#34;1 part green soap and 9 parts water as a skin wash and for applying stencils.</li>
            <li> Remember to mix it in a 1:4 ratio green soap to distilled water.  </li>
            <li> I received the pictured product, it was Costco brand Tincture of Green soap,</li>
            <li> and it smells like Green Soap</li>
            <li> Was not cosco green soap.  </li>
            <li> PICTURE IS SLIGHTLY MISLEADING , PRODUCT IS SMALL BOTTLE</li>
            <li> As usual delivered In timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this is doing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Talked it over with the seller and they gave me a refund without asking for the wrong item back.  </li>
            <li> This is a small bottle for those of us who may not do a lot of inking or do it often.</li>
            <li> None of my customers has complained of any infections are anything.</li>
            <li> Works well mix it about twice as thin as the directions say or its just too slimmy and soapy</li>
            <li> So not a happy camper and don&#x27;t have time to deal with exchanges.  </li>
            <li> I dont know what happined with other customers that gave bad reviews</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t used it yet, but were very disappointed to receive a different product than was advertised.  </li>
            <li> I saw some on here and for those of you who don&#x27;t check that before you buy i feel sorry for ya.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was not so expensive.</li>
            <li> ill buy it again.</li>
            <li> CRAZY RICK</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not to bad.</li>
            <li> I just hate the way it smells and leave my hands feeling afterwards.</li>

            <li> GREAT DEAL!! FAST SHIPPING!!</li>
            <li> This product or anything similar should not be used for tattooing for many reasons. It says right on the label you can see \\&quot; for external use only\\&quot;. if you were to put this into the blood stream you could cause some major problems. Also as a skin prep this would do no could against bacterial infections like MRSA. If you order this to product from a non professional distributor you may end up being investigated and reviewed.</li>
            <li> i guess he used it when  he did his tat im not sure really what it is for, but he didnt complain</li>
            <li> the green soap is quite good and we trust it to be a good cleaning agent but when we opened it there was green soap all over in the packaging .  there needs to be a better way of securing the lid so it does not come loose while in shipping and for that we are giving this item 3 stars</li>
            <li> Good product, does the job right and is everything it says it is, verry happy and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works wonders! So glad I could find it for so cheap! Thanks whoever posted this wonderful product, it really helped me out!</li>
            <li> Got it on time and just when I needed it thanks alot works great</li>
            <li> thanks for offering this product so we have it to be safe and sterile. I love it and I will continue to use it as long as it is out.</li>
            <li> if looking for cheaper product then you get cheaper results. I recommend this product  to anyone who is concerned with great results.&lt;br /&gt;  You get what You pay for. great product with great results.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used while tattooing! Makes my apartment smell like a tattoo shop too! Smells and works wonderfully! :)</li>
            <li> oh that was perfect. the size and the price for it you couldn&#x27;t beat it.it would be nice if it come in a bigger container</li>
            <li> I received my package, happy with the delivery and with the product. My only issue is, it&#x27;s shown with a refill bottle which it did not come with. I think the advertisement showed a refill bottle and should&#x27;ve came with one, this is showing a product that&#x27;s not being sent. I would&#x27;ve given 5 stars if I received the items as shown. Dissatisfied with that part.</li>
            <li> Stuff works good. Always have some green soap handy when doing a tattoo. Make sure when you buy it from amazon that you are not buying pre diluted green soap. I saw some on here and for those of you who don&#x27;t check that before you buy i feel sorry for ya. i think its crappy that people can sell a misleading product like that. for those that don&#x27;t know the ratio i will quote this products description &amp;#34;1 part green soap and 9 parts water as a skin wash and for applying stencils. This means you can make 9 gallons of solution with A 1 Gallon Bottle!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is what you see is what you get. Unlike a lot of products you order. A must buy if you need a reliable cleaning agent for tattooing. You will not be dissapointed because you get what you are paying for</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
            <li> Love the stuff! Just wish it was not so expensive. I need to buy in larger quantities so as it will not freeze because the alcohol content I think I will. ALL GOOD!</li>
            <li> Pretty good product I could say. None of my customers has complained of any infections are anything. I also use it as a scrub before I prep I just hate the way it smells and leave my hands feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t show a picture of the big bottle if it&#x27;s only going to be the little bottle</li>
            <li> This is a great product that came on time.  Remember to mix it in a 1:4 ratio green soap to distilled water.  Cosco sells this stuff universally at a reasonable price.  I would recommend this to any tattoo artist of any level...gets the job done.</li>
            <li> A must for any tattoo artist.</li>
            <li> a little watered down but stil has that great shop smell</li>
            <li> works good dilute with distilled water. I use it for wiping off ink works great.  have&#x27;t used it for stencil application yet but will try to compare to stencil stuff</li>
            <li> arrived fast and no leaking which I was afraid of.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> Met all the expectations and does what its supposed to do when tattooing. ill buy it again. great product for a beginning artist</li>
            <li> Works like it should it&#x27;s a great tool to be used with my tattoo kit very pleased.will order again. thanks</li>
            <li> If you tattoo or just learning, it&#x27;s a great idea to have green soap available</li>
            <li> such wonderful product it is nice to be safe and clean so yay green soap :) :) yay i have a lifetime supply the way i go thru it lol</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, bottle sealed</li>
            <li> I had read reviews that people did not get the Cosco brand Green soap or that the package came in leaking which made me reluctant to order the product, finally I decided not think about it and made my purchase and I received the Cosco brand soap and it was packaged perfectly. I am a tattoo apprentice so this is a necessity in what I love to do and am extremely happy that I made the choice to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> The best soap on the market for tattoos. I use this for my own tattoos and for all the tattoos I do.</li>
            <li> Great job with packaging. No damage. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This stuff works really weel. I like using this more then what i was using. It works a\so awesomely. great stuff</li>
            <li> Took their time but green soap is the best.</li>
            <li> Love it came quick, smells great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is hardcore, i like that its in concentrate form, so 8 oz of this stuff goes a long way when mixing it with water. i use this stuff to clean up tattoo&#x27;s, and really does the job at cleaning up ink, stencil marks, blood ect,. i definitely recommend this product to anyone. i also recommend this seller, i got my product in 2 days, the packaging was legit, and they were just professional about it. i can say i&#x27;ll by this product again when i run out. :)</li>
            <li> Shipped in a tightly wrapped ziplock bag in inside a bubble wrap &amp;#34;envelope&amp;#34; to insure if it was damaged there would be less chance of extra damage. The tin seal was unbroken. no spillage occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I received the pictured product, it was Costco brand Tincture of Green soap, 30% alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Beginners tip: Dilute this in a spraybottle. But you should know that by now.</li>
            <li> Bottle was sealed and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Picture shows 2 bottles so that&#x27;s what you assume your getting</li>
            <li> Bottle was damaged a little. Dent in the side. Not an issue. Great shipping and product was as described. Will be ordering more. Thank you</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and it smells good too.... Directions even say u can use it as shampoo.... I find that very interesting....</li>
            <li> Arrived Quick and just as described... Would def. Buy Again :)</li>
            <li> Got exactly what i ordered, and received it earlier then estimated delivery date. I dont know what happined with other customers that gave bad reviews but im pleased</li>
            <li> Works well mix it about twice as thin as the directions say or its just too slimmy and soapy</li>
            <li> Always great, this is the only soap I use for tattooing it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Work great! Cleans and sanitizes well, along with the stincle doesn&#x27;t wipe off. Great deal I love this product more than life itself!</li>
            <li> This is a must for any one interested in tattooing. Dilute it 10 parts distilled water and 1 part soap. Don&#x27;t make this at home. It&#x27;s cheap and lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> It arrived in good time, but that picture sure is deceiving. I got a lot less than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> works great just what I needed. Tattoo ink wipes clean.wiish it was larger&lt;br /&gt;I will get the bigger 1 next time.</li>
            <li> Greatest, was the dankk</li>
            <li> must need for tattoos</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described. I purchased it for tattooing and it is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sealed and just in time :)</li>
            <li> very good buy works great</li>
            <li> I tried using this for tattoo transferring, and I&#x27;m still not very sure how exactly to make it work where it won&#x27;t blur the transfer too much, so that&#x27;s something to look into before ordering this product. Though it definitely is great, and it&#x27;s a big bottle to use for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was already familiar with this product but after moving I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Ordering it this was has proved to be effective and it came even more quickly than expected</li>
            <li> I have only used it on a practice skin and fruits because I am apprenticing.</li>
            <li> The service was fast, and the product description was accurate.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy! I&#x27;ll get 4 big spray bottles out of this one bottle of concentrate. If you&#x27;re a tattooist or you just want a strong green cleaner... pick this bottle of green soap up!</li>
            <li> Very nice safe product. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Made the extra unwanted ink come right off without messing the work up its a great product! Thank you to thw inventers! :-)</li>
            <li> Cosco Green Soap is the best for tattooing, I have been using it for many years and many more to come. It takes the ink off the skin very easy so the tattoo cleans up perfect.</li>
            <li> Works great. if your worried about a pint being enough I guess it depends on how much work you do. But it definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this is doing but I bought them for a tattoo artist that I bet he&#x27;s doing fine by using this</li>
            <li> It was delivered at the right time. Perfect for tattooing and definitely worth the buy. Highly recommended. I will definitely order again when I need more.</li>
            <li> As described and shipped quick.</li>
            <li> First of all I didn&#x27;t recieve 1 pint I recieved 16 fl oz. the smaller bottle. And it was not the brand advertised. Haven&#x27;t used it yet and it smells like Green Soap but I&#x27;m pretty dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t recieve what I thought I was paying for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been burning through this stuff like no tomorrow and it is great. Exactly what you would expect for green soap. Dilutes good if you need it to. Cleans up very well. Packaging was incredibly nice and delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> Not to much to write on this. It does what its supposed to do. I am satisfied. Thank you guys</li>
            <li> Needs to come with info on how to mix it with water and it burn win using it. But it&#x27;s not to bad.</li>
            <li> When I got this product in the mail it had leaked all over the box and I ended up with about half a bottle of product.</li>
            <li> Really good if you water it down first</li>
            <li> Great product delivered on time</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Would buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> Works all the time never fails, great item ill keep using it myself , and recommend it to other personnel</li>
            <li> Would have liked to have gotten what I ordered.  Was not cosco green soap.  Checked with a more experienced artist and found out that what I got works the same but would have been cheaper than what I paid.  So not a happy camper and don&#x27;t have time to deal with exchanges.  Have tat jobs coming up this weekend and this is now all I have.  Feel kinda worked over in this situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talked it over with the seller and they gave me a refund without asking for the wrong item back.  So I&#x27;ve bumped it up to full marks for their score.  Yeah folks these guys might make an oops but they go out of their way to fix it.</li>
            <li> A must for any tattooist. This is a small bottle for those of us who may not do a lot of inking or do it often. Good price, right product, delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Green soap works better than anything else for removing excess tattoo ink when you are working.  This product is the best and I have used it for over 30 years!!!</li>
            <li> Never used this product before , got it to do tattoo stencil work and for sanitation before and after work it transfers the pattern well and stings when cleaning afterwords. Might have it mixed to strong is why it stings. I am happy with this product. And should buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and like always fast delivery</li>
            <li> was delivered fast and serves its job  simple as that ... good stuff</li>
            <li> Definitely does what you expect it to. Plus it made my whole apartment smell like tattoo parlor. :3 Hooray .</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for use with tattooing, prodect is excellent and will last you a long time if using it for tattooing, mix 8 to 1 water/soap.. Great product..</li>
            <li> Need to show the matching size bottle as the title. Not two different sizes. Or even do a combination pack.</li>
            <li> great soap, works great</li>
            <li> Its soap can&#x27;t really mess that up</li>
            <li> great product and service</li>
            <li> Great for tattoos i love that smell</li>
            <li> green soap arrived earlier then i expected and it works really well. it wipes clean and no irritation and no side affects</li>
            <li> i like this green soap, it was better than the last one i was using.  this one cleans off the ink well and if u need to do another print on a person and its hard to get the stencil off, this green soap is good for that also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;alos dont be fooled by the picture, you get the pint on the left. you dont get both!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall&#x3D; good quality/ okay price</li>
            <li> I misunderstood and expected a larger bottle but that was my fault. I clearly didn&#x27;t read that it was only a pint.  But I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> PICTURE IS SLIGHTLY MISLEADING , PRODUCT IS SMALL BOTTLE</li>
            <li> Very good company very good.</li>
            <li> For all your tattoo needs</li>
            <li> love these for the price</li>
            <li> My husband uses it all the time. He likes it will buy more when he runs out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> The only reason this didn&#x27;t get a five is because it isn&#x27;t Cosco. Its a generic brand but still does as it should. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> If your gonna get into tattooing like i am, Then this is a must. I haven&#x27;t used many products like this, but i know for a fact&lt;br /&gt;this is a clean and VERY good way to apply a stencil.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I love it and I will get more Thanks</li>
            <li> Was smashed bottle a little bit. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> So nice to tattoo thank you</li>
            <li> i ordered the cosco brand green soap and i think its a better product than that green soap they put a tattoo co name on.this is the real deal it tells you right on the bottle its for surgical grade liquid soap,and tattooing is a little like surgiary.this green soap is what the hospitals use,its even got a litle alcohol in it for sterilization, its got ethanol,it the real deal,because its hospital grade,and i think this is a good co. for getting green soap. the ethanol is what breaks down the carbon for your stencil,which i don&#x27;nt use it for my stencils ,i use stencil stay,and i use green soap for cleaning and dabing the skin to get acess ink off,but remember you dilute this product nine parts of water to 1 part of the soap.this pint of soap will last you along time if used correct. i hope i was able to help the ones that think they got the wrong product,because if you got whats on this web page ,you got the real stuff,hospital grade,the strongest you can get. good luck,  crazy rick THIS HAS BEEN SOME GOOD GREEN SOAP,ITS LASTED FOREVER, AND THE PRICE FOR REAL MEDICAL SOAP ,YOU CANT BEAT IT, ITS HOPITAL GRADE FOR SURE AND IT&#x27;S CONCETRATED AND I&#x27;M ORDERED ANOTHER BOTTLE NOW,ITS IN MY CART. CRAZY RICK</li>
            <li> perfect, just as described</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the bigger size but it dint matter I just dint read what size I was getting work well and clean up good</li>
            <li> thank you for allowing me to use this product at suck a great price. i am pleased with my order for this item</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly &amp; in good condition! Bottles were sealed &amp; was exactly what I was expecting! Love this stuff! Works great &amp; it smells good too!!</li>
