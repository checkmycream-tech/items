            <li>I think Japanese women have beautiful skin</li>

            <li>This gel formula is amazing and after using it for a couple of days I noticed that not only was my face smoother and healthier/ more plump but the hydration it provides lasts all day and improves the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>And the price is right too!</li>
            <li>Goes on super creamy and rich,  Your face just soaks it in and  </li>
            <li>This really makes my skin feel and look better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll describe my full experience and hopefully help you to decide whether or not it&#x27;s for you --</li>
            <li>So, you have to apply more &#x27;real&#x27; moisturizer *</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this in Dr. Oz&#x27;s magazine, so I tried it, not expecting much; well, I liked it so much that I ordered a jar.  </li>
            <li>After one day, I noticed a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>Goes on well and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>and I go through the product quickly.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and dry patches on my face from sun damage.</li>
            <li>Tried it and instantly fell in love!</li>
            <li>There is no product I am aware of on the market that completely removes wrinkles, other than with surgery, but I am very impressed with how much difference this product has made!!  </li>
            <li>so far, I love it.....</li>
            <li>Most effective in plumping out lines for the first few applications.</li>
            <li>It looks heavy but feels cool, light and refreshing on your face.</li>
            <li>Very, very highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>The best product we have ever used for dry skin, not cheap but worth every dime.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>This is my third day -- and it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>My skin looks much better and also much younger.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle, I&#x27;ve let friends try and they too fell in love.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works..it does what it says it will do...love it!</li>
            <li>nice and moisturizing for very dry skin - reasonably priced</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and had significant wrinkles around my mouth, eyes and between the brows.  </li>
            <li>It is the first product in a long time that has me considering replacing my favorite -- oil if Olay Regenerist serum.</li>
            <li>Further, after a few hours, my face was incredibly shiny.  </li>
            <li>I was nipped in the face by a large dog and this stuff has helped the scars fade away.</li>
            <li>and I am not a young person I am 60 years old, but using this product the skin has a different texture, I am happy I find this cream,</li>
            <li>It not only reduces fine lines, but it makes the skin glow.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful,cooling moisturizer with a very light astringent action that tightens your pores as it dries and brightens your entire face.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and extremely dry skin, Moisturizing is vital to being able to feel confident enough to go out for the day.</li>
            <li>This made my face very irritated.</li>
            <li>Was looking for something with anti-aging properties that was still light enough to wear in the summer.</li>
            <li>give your over 50 skin a real treat.</li>
            <li>This product really does temporarily plump your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin was really showing it and was showing age that it hadn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li>and her face was absolutely glowing.</li>
            <li>Really works but can get it cheaper at Walgrens..</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to see an effect (if you use too much, you&#x27;ll have to wait awhile before it fully dries).  </li>
            <li>I also find this to be very moisturizing, probably from the hyaluronic acid, which is a polymer that hangs on to a lot of water.  </li>
            <li>Very impractical.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says it would do.</li>
            <li>This has really helped,I no longer have the dryness and flaking.</li>
            <li>the skin gives it a very well rested look.</li>
            <li>It becomes very supple and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Very happy with results considering I am 65 and tried multiple different products in the past.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very moist plus it has hyaluronic acid which Dr. Oz highly recommends for the skin combined with a vitamin C skin product.  </li>
            <li>If this product ever gets discontinued like so many others, I will be extremely bummed!</li>
            <li>I a 66 and have tried so many face creams, both inexpensive drug store purchases as well as more expensive brands I got from QVC.  </li>
            <li>She was older than I am.</li>
            <li>Instead of making the skin feel moisturized and refreshed, it feels mostly gooey -- and then it dries, and makes the skin feel tight.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Wow, never before!!  </li>
            <li>I am surprised, given that it is not an over-priced product!!  </li>
            <li>but I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I normally use a cream blush and today, it just wouldn&#x27;t stick to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I must say it&#x27;s working because my skin is very hydrated, not dry, and I still look very youthful.</li>
            <li>I have always taken VERY good care of my skin -- and I had used a very expensive line of products that cost upwards of $200 for years.</li>
            <li>; I read the reviews before ordering the first time and decided it was inexpensive enough to try it.  </li>
            <li>I usually avoid gel-based moisturizers because they&#x27;re mostly glorified waters with film formers.</li>
            <li>This was pretty much my last resort try</li>
            <li>The first time I tried Hada Labo Tokyo, I got a sample in my Real Simple magazine and after two uses, I knew I had found my fountain of youth.</li>
            <li>I used every last drop of the first jar.</li>
            <li>Been on my first jar for over a month, am 54, have sensitive skin, pock marks, and a deep crease between my eyes for about 20 years.  </li>
            <li>love this, small amount goes far, not greasy..</li>
            <li>My dry skin was gone in days and within a few weeks my white heads were gone for good.</li>
            <li>It is an exact replica of other, very expensive gel moisturizers that are becoming popular in the marketplace under high-end cosmetic names, which are going for $60 - $90 a jar.</li>
            <li>: completely inoffensive scent</li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>whatever) and blasts their proprietary hyaluronic acid blend into your pores so that when you wake up, your skin is hydrated, bouncy, firm and smooth like a balloon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Having previously been in the makeup industry (MAC, Trish McEvoy), I am very selective with products and never buy something I don&#x27;t try first.</li>
            <li>Allure and Marie Claire both had reviews of Hada Labo products in the past year, and I was intrigued, so when I saw it available on Amazon, I was eager to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s not a permanent effect, but when I really really need to look 10 years younger, I go do a microcurrent facial</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to open my third jar.</li>
            <li>The crease is barely visible without makeup on!  </li>
            <li>My skin usually feels dry and itchy and this just makes it feel better.</li>
            <li>I have a very dry t zone and it really helps.</li>
            <li>Despite being a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; this stuff is pretty thick, not as light as other gel moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Went back to Dermalogica and my face is back to normal.</li>
            <li>I am constantly looking for new, non-surgical facial treatments for wrinkles and I will not consider surgery.  </li>
            <li>I am almost 30, and really no wrinkles and maybe a few fine lines (barely)!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68, and on social security now, so I can&#x27;t afford the line I once could.</li>
            <li>My skin is never dry in the morning after using this product.</li>

            <li> I think Japanese women have beautiful skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about three months and have seen a huge improvement in the hydration of my skin.  </li>

            <li> I use this nightly and wake up with a soft, smooth face that feels like it&#x27;s been plumped overnight - in a good way.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin that is sensitive</li>
            <li> My new favorite skin cream!</li>
            <li> This gel formula is amazing and after using it for a couple of days I noticed that not only was my face smoother and healthier/ more plump but the hydration it provides lasts all day and improves the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> And the price is right too!</li>
            <li> Goes on super creamy and rich,  Your face just soaks it in and  </li>
            <li> This really makes my skin feel and look better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll describe my full experience and hopefully help you to decide whether or not it&#x27;s for you --</li>
            <li> So, you have to apply more &#x27;real&#x27; moisturizer *</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in Dr. Oz&#x27;s magazine, so I tried it, not expecting much; well, I liked it so much that I ordered a jar.  </li>
            <li> After one day, I noticed a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> Goes on well and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> and I go through the product quickly.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and dry patches on my face from sun damage.</li>
            <li> Tried it and instantly fell in love!</li>
            <li> There is no product I am aware of on the market that completely removes wrinkles, other than with surgery, but I am very impressed with how much difference this product has made!!  </li>
            <li> so far, I love it.....</li>
            <li> Most effective in plumping out lines for the first few applications.</li>
            <li> It looks heavy but feels cool, light and refreshing on your face.</li>
            <li> Very, very highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> The best product we have ever used for dry skin, not cheap but worth every dime.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> This is my third day -- and it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> My skin looks much better and also much younger.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle, I&#x27;ve let friends try and they too fell in love.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works..it does what it says it will do...love it!</li>
            <li> nice and moisturizing for very dry skin - reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and had significant wrinkles around my mouth, eyes and between the brows.  </li>
            <li> It is the first product in a long time that has me considering replacing my favorite -- oil if Olay Regenerist serum.</li>
            <li> Further, after a few hours, my face was incredibly shiny.  </li>
            <li> I was nipped in the face by a large dog and this stuff has helped the scars fade away.</li>
            <li> and I am not a young person I am 60 years old, but using this product the skin has a different texture, I am happy I find this cream,</li>
            <li> It not only reduces fine lines, but it makes the skin glow.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful,cooling moisturizer with a very light astringent action that tightens your pores as it dries and brightens your entire face.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and extremely dry skin, Moisturizing is vital to being able to feel confident enough to go out for the day.</li>
            <li> This made my face very irritated.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something with anti-aging properties that was still light enough to wear in the summer.</li>
            <li> give your over 50 skin a real treat.</li>
            <li> This product really does temporarily plump your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was really showing it and was showing age that it hadn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li> and her face was absolutely glowing.</li>
            <li> Really works but can get it cheaper at Walgrens..</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to see an effect (if you use too much, you&#x27;ll have to wait awhile before it fully dries).  </li>
            <li> I also find this to be very moisturizing, probably from the hyaluronic acid, which is a polymer that hangs on to a lot of water.  </li>
            <li> Very impractical.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says it would do.</li>
            <li> This has really helped,I no longer have the dryness and flaking.</li>
            <li> the skin gives it a very well rested look.</li>
            <li> It becomes very supple and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Very happy with results considering I am 65 and tried multiple different products in the past.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very moist plus it has hyaluronic acid which Dr. Oz highly recommends for the skin combined with a vitamin C skin product.  </li>
            <li> If this product ever gets discontinued like so many others, I will be extremely bummed!</li>
            <li> I a 66 and have tried so many face creams, both inexpensive drug store purchases as well as more expensive brands I got from QVC.  </li>
            <li> She was older than I am.</li>
            <li> Instead of making the skin feel moisturized and refreshed, it feels mostly gooey -- and then it dries, and makes the skin feel tight.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wow, never before!!  </li>
            <li> I am surprised, given that it is not an over-priced product!!  </li>
            <li> but I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I normally use a cream blush and today, it just wouldn&#x27;t stick to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I must say it&#x27;s working because my skin is very hydrated, not dry, and I still look very youthful.</li>
            <li> I have always taken VERY good care of my skin -- and I had used a very expensive line of products that cost upwards of $200 for years.</li>
            <li> ; I read the reviews before ordering the first time and decided it was inexpensive enough to try it.  </li>
            <li> I usually avoid gel-based moisturizers because they&#x27;re mostly glorified waters with film formers.</li>
            <li> This was pretty much my last resort try</li>
            <li> The first time I tried Hada Labo Tokyo, I got a sample in my Real Simple magazine and after two uses, I knew I had found my fountain of youth.</li>
            <li> I used every last drop of the first jar.</li>
            <li> Been on my first jar for over a month, am 54, have sensitive skin, pock marks, and a deep crease between my eyes for about 20 years.  </li>
            <li> love this, small amount goes far, not greasy..</li>
            <li> My dry skin was gone in days and within a few weeks my white heads were gone for good.</li>
            <li> It is an exact replica of other, very expensive gel moisturizers that are becoming popular in the marketplace under high-end cosmetic names, which are going for $60 - $90 a jar.</li>
            <li> : completely inoffensive scent</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  </li>
            <li> whatever) and blasts their proprietary hyaluronic acid blend into your pores so that when you wake up, your skin is hydrated, bouncy, firm and smooth like a balloon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Having previously been in the makeup industry (MAC, Trish McEvoy), I am very selective with products and never buy something I don&#x27;t try first.</li>
            <li> Allure and Marie Claire both had reviews of Hada Labo products in the past year, and I was intrigued, so when I saw it available on Amazon, I was eager to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not a permanent effect, but when I really really need to look 10 years younger, I go do a microcurrent facial</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting ready to open my third jar.</li>
            <li> The crease is barely visible without makeup on!  </li>
            <li> My skin usually feels dry and itchy and this just makes it feel better.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry t zone and it really helps.</li>
            <li> Despite being a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; this stuff is pretty thick, not as light as other gel moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Went back to Dermalogica and my face is back to normal.</li>
            <li> I am constantly looking for new, non-surgical facial treatments for wrinkles and I will not consider surgery.  </li>
            <li> I am almost 30, and really no wrinkles and maybe a few fine lines (barely)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68, and on social security now, so I can&#x27;t afford the line I once could.</li>
            <li> My skin is never dry in the morning after using this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product even though it is more expensive than the drugstore skincare/makeup products I usually buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that I&#x27;ll notice less apparent wrinkles with further use.</li>
            <li> My skin has been so hydrated these last months, even in the dry heat!  </li>
            <li> Hands start to show age by wrinkling and look dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it both in the morning and at night, and it really diminished the small wrinkles as well as making my face look much less blotchy.  </li>
            <li> I went from not needing anything to hyper dry, flaking, dull and old looking skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing that worked was vigorously scrubbing my face every other day with a wash cloth until my skin was red and raw.</li>
            <li> I let it soak in and dry for a minute then apply my daily routine of make up.&lt;br /&gt;I usually oppose jars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t replace Juvaderm, Restalyne or other fillers</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it anywhere other than Amazon or Ulta</li>
            <li> A sample of it was included with some other order I made online.</li>
            <li> I use as my night cream as I find it a bit thick for a daily under makeup moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I ordered a jar of this from Amazon for less than $25.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a gel, but I like to think of it as a treatment and hydration product with a little body so it stays with you longer.</li>
            <li> My skin is firm and &amp;#34;bouncy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have two areas on my left my cheek where the skin was broken.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling slick or sticky.</li>
            <li> hyaluronic acid is usually a byproduct of poultry processing, although it can be expressed in bacteria.  </li>
            <li> but there were small scars left.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to buy.</li>
            <li> I have been stopped by at least 10 people, four of whom were strangers, to ask what I use on my face.</li>
            <li> (either it&#x27;s unscented or I just haven&#x27;t noticed the scent because it&#x27;s so subtle).</li>
            <li> This is not a good product to use under makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> thing I&#x27;d recommend, use a VERY small amount and pat into your skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frugal and skeptical person when it comes to these types of products</li>
            <li> It is, unfortunately, a &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> $25 went into trash to bad.</li>
            <li> Terrible concistency.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good product so far, I love it.....</li>
            <li> Light and non-greasy but keeps skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for two days but I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  I have seen a great difference in my facial skin.  I will reorder again!</li>
            <li> This made my face very irritated. Will not be using this product. Went back to Dermalogica and my face is back to normal.</li>
            <li> Terrible concistency. It makes your face sticky after you put it on your face even your hands ger sticky and you have to wash the cream of. I did not see any difference on my face after using if for couple of weeks. $25 went into trash to bad. I would not recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> My new favorite skin cream!</li>
            <li> Excellent product with good results...Recommended</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have a very dry t zone and it really helps. The product is silky and is great to use before bed. My skin is never dry in the morning after using this product. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out either. I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> Good product; am using but prefer more emollients.</li>
            <li> OK but not like sample.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something with anti-aging properties that was still light enough to wear in the summer. Despite being a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; this stuff is pretty thick, not as light as other gel moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my skin, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: completely inoffensive scent (either it&#x27;s unscented or I just haven&#x27;t noticed the scent because it&#x27;s so subtle). Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling slick or sticky.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this product and should get it by the gallons.  I saw a sample in a magazine and tried it on the back of my hands.  Hands start to show age by wrinkling and look dry.  This is amazing...it plumps the skin, lasts all day and gives your skin a nice sheen.  Definitely tell everyone I meet about this product.....give your over 50 skin a real treat. We use it on our face every day.</li>
            <li> Tried many face creams and have not noticed any results EXCEPT this one!  Very, very highly recommend!  You use a smidgen each night and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frugal and skeptical person when it comes to these types of products and I never bother with writing reviews but this time, I am so impressed!  All I can say is &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34; I read the reviews before ordering the first time and decided it was inexpensive enough to try it.  AMAZING!  Been on my first jar for over a month, am 54, have sensitive skin, pock marks, and a deep crease between my eyes for about 20 years.  The crease is barely visible without makeup on!  I&#x27;ve been told numerous times by co-workers how great my skin looks.  Wow, never before!!  I am so in love with this product, I just ordered 2 more to give 1 to my bff to try and I added the eye/wrinkle corrector to boot for both of us.  If this product ever gets discontinued like so many others, I will be extremely bummed!</li>
            <li> Most effective in plumping out lines for the first few applications. Gives the skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance free moisturizer with a gel-like consistency as opposed to a lotion.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about three months and have seen a huge improvement in the hydration of my skin.  I had been on the search for a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t break me out and my search is over.  If you have problems with moisturizing lotions, I&#x27;d give this a shot.  I&#x27;ll never be without this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product really does temporarily plump your skin. It doesn&#x27;t replace Juvaderm, Restalyne or other fillers but it does give my skin a nice plumpness. I am 44 years and I have the beginning of jowls and marionette lines. I notice a difference when I use this product, I look more refreshed. And the price is right too!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in Dr. Oz&#x27;s magazine, so I tried it, not expecting much; well, I liked it so much that I ordered a jar.  I a 66 and have tried so many face creams, both inexpensive drug store purchases as well as more expensive brands I got from QVC.  This really makes my skin feel and look better.  I use it both in the morning and at night, and it really diminished the small wrinkles as well as making my face look much less blotchy.  I like it and I hope you will too.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I noticed immediate results. My skin feels so supple.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the anti-aging hydrator and use both in conjunction. I have always taken VERY good care of my skin -- and I had used a very expensive line of products that cost upwards of $200 for years. I&#x27;m 68, and on social security now, so I can&#x27;t afford the line I once could. My skin was really showing it and was showing age that it hadn&#x27;t before. I met a woman when out shopping and her face was absolutely glowing. She was older than I am. I asked her what she used, and she told me about Hada Labo. I don&#x27;t know her name, but I bless her. I logged onto amazon and bought the skin plumping gel cream and the anti-aging hydrator and began to use them. Within two days, I saw a difference so remarkable that I am returning for more products. This is my third day -- and it just keeps getting better. I have actually seen lines diminish after just two days. My skin is firm and &amp;#34;bouncy&amp;#34;. I am now ordering the skin whitener to see how it can help age spots. If amazon ever stops carrying these products, I&#x27;ll stop shopping at amazon.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This is the best! Goes on super creamy and rich,  Your face just soaks it in and  no greasiness</li>
            <li> Awesome my skin feels so good when I use this!!</li>
            <li> I read a number of reviews before deciding on this product. Having previously been in the makeup industry (MAC, Trish McEvoy), I am very selective with products and never buy something I don&#x27;t try first. However, I gave this one a shot and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a gel, but I like to think of it as a treatment and hydration product with a little body so it stays with you longer. After one day, I noticed a tremendous difference. My skin was feeling a bit parched before and is now radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d recommend, use a VERY small amount and pat into your skin! I wait about a minute before applying makeup as initially it may feel a bit &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; to the touch until it settles into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A truly amazing product!</li>
            <li> love this, small amount goes far, not greasy..</li>
            <li> I have notices a huge difference and have never written a review before.  I have noticed a difference in my neck too.  I even told my co-worker and sister and they are ordering it too!  I am 48 so I am trying everything. :)</li>
            <li> Does what it claims will do. Very happy with results considering I am 65 and tried multiple different products in the past. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> love it mix it with my diy oils great gel like formula it is the last step in my skin care regimen wonderful texture and very soothing have ordered. extra jars is truly a great product at a good price will continue to buy  try this cream you will love it. uddate just bought 3 more jars added artifili a skin plumper as an added boost wow mixes in perfectly with the gel cream and makes it even more fabulous!</li>
            <li> A skin must. I use as my night cream as I find it a bit thick for a daily under makeup moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really works but can get it cheaper at Walgrens..</li>
            <li> I got free samples of this product from an order I placed on another website and fell in love. I have rosacea and extremely dry skin, Moisturizing is vital to being able to feel confident enough to go out for the day. This gel formula is amazing and after using it for a couple of days I noticed that not only was my face smoother and healthier/ more plump but the hydration it provides lasts all day and improves the appearance of my skin. I can not rave about it enough and can say that I recently ran out and my skin did not like being without it. I highly recommend this product even though it is more expensive than the drugstore skincare/makeup products I usually buy. Definitely worth the investment!!!</li>
            <li> I am constantly looking for new, non-surgical facial treatments for wrinkles and I will not consider surgery.  I am 63 years old and had significant wrinkles around my mouth, eyes and between the brows.  I had been able to see some improvement with an Avon product but that has been discontinued.  I&#x27;ve tried others, from Estee Lauder to Strivictin and this is the only one that I see improvement in the deepness of the wrinkles!!  I am surprised, given that it is not an over-priced product!!  There is no product I am aware of on the market that completely removes wrinkles, other than with surgery, but I am very impressed with how much difference this product has made!!  I will definitely buy it again!!</li>
            <li> you can fell the difference using this cream gel.... and I am not a young person I am 60 years old, but using this product the skin has a different texture, I am happy I find this cream,</li>
            <li> product works and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  I will use it for awhile before deciding for life.</li>
            <li> I usually avoid gel-based moisturizers because they&#x27;re mostly glorified waters with film formers. As a Hada Labo milk and lotion user, i was hesitant to try this gel-creme (was it even necessary?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if you use this as the *last step* in your skincare regimen (like a sleeping mask)- it seals everything in (your serum, lotion, whatever) and blasts their proprietary hyaluronic acid blend into your pores so that when you wake up, your skin is hydrated, bouncy, firm and smooth like a balloon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer now, and use this whenever i&#x27;m dehydrated to plump up my skin and re-drench it in moisture. Use it as your last step so it locks everything in.  A great product that does what it says for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.  It is the first product in a long time that has me considering replacing my favorite -- oil if Olay Regenerist serum.</li>
            <li> Non greasy and absorbs into the skin with an oily feel.  Works great!</li>
            <li> This is amazing as well.as the cleanser.  My skin looks much better and also much younger. It is the best serum I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it does what it says.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Silky like feeling and skin looks great.  Summer V</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.  But I haven&#x27;t seen too many results yet.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.  I&#x27;ll describe my full experience and hopefully help you to decide whether or not it&#x27;s for you -- whether you will like this product may depend on your intended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, what I love: the texture and consistency are great.  This is a very smooth product and it rubs into the skin easily.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to see an effect (if you use too much, you&#x27;ll have to wait awhile before it fully dries).  I find it non-irritating and I think it&#x27;s wonderful that this product is completely unscented.  I also find this to be very moisturizing, probably from the hyaluronic acid, which is a polymer that hangs on to a lot of water.  (It&#x27;s the same compound used in some contact lens rewetting drops!)  Hyaluronic acid is also very good at plumping the skin around fine lines, and I noticed a bit of that with this product, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, what I don&#x27;t like.  This is not a good product to use under makeup.  I normally use a cream blush and today, it just wouldn&#x27;t stick to my skin.  Further, after a few hours, my face was incredibly shiny.  This moisturizer is the only thing I used that was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: hyaluronic acid is usually a byproduct of poultry processing, although it can be expressed in bacteria.  This product also contains collagen, which can ONLY come from animal sources.  So this is not a vegan product, if that is of concern to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, if you are looking for a good nighttime moisturizer and will not be putting makeup on over this, I highly recommend this product.  However, if you are looking for something to wear under makeup during the day, you will want to keep looking.</li>
            <li> Its the best!!! I love it, my lines are almost gone!😆</li>
            <li> This product does what it says. I will continue to order more.</li>
            <li> I love the product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get rid of my flakey skin and white heads. I have always had flaking skin on my nose and around my mouth, and white heads on the side of my nose and chin. The only thing that worked was vigorously scrubbing my face every other day with a wash cloth until my skin was red and raw. This was pretty much my last resort try and OMG I wish I had found this years ago! My dry skin was gone in days and within a few weeks my white heads were gone for good. This is my miracle product! Hopefully it works for you!</li>
            <li> Like  the product, but by no means does it plump your skin I will not be buying again</li>
            <li> Ladies, best cream I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Goes on well and absorbs quickly. Great under makeup.</li>
            <li> Used as directed, I am seeing results</li>
            <li> love this cream. feels good going on, have noticed a bit of improvement of my smile creases.</li>
            <li> The best product we have ever used for dry skin, not cheap but worth every dime.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this product. My skin usually feels dry and itchy and this just makes it feel better. Refreshed it a good word for it. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to buy. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere other than Amazon or Ulta and I go through the product quickly. It is not even 2 ounces. It&#x27;s not the best value, but I haven&#x27;t tried anything that works for my skin like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Allure and Marie Claire both had reviews of Hada Labo products in the past year, and I was intrigued, so when I saw it available on Amazon, I was eager to give it a try.  It is, unfortunately, a &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34;  Instead of making the skin feel moisturized and refreshed, it feels mostly gooey -- and then it dries, and makes the skin feel tight.  So, you have to apply more &#x27;real&#x27; moisturizer *after* you&#x27;ve moisturized with this one.  Very impractical.</li>
            <li> Love the cream.  My skin feels smooth and happy. Don&#x27;t buy. Cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It took about two weeks for me to be really impressed, but I won&#x27;t go without this now. I use this nightly and wake up with a soft, smooth face that feels like it&#x27;s been plumped overnight - in a good way.This was one product in a series of moisturizers I tried when my skin seemed to change overnight. I went from not needing anything to hyper dry, flaking, dull and old looking skin. This changed all of that. Happy I found it.</li>
            <li> she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;worth the money</li>
            <li> nice and moisturizing for very dry skin - reasonably priced</li>
            <li> It really does what it says it would do. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Wow.  Well, it&#x27;s not a permanent effect, but when I really really need to look 10 years younger, I go do a microcurrent facial and/or this for 2 days.  It&#x27;s effective and works.  I will be buying again when this runs out - it has its own designated place in my cosmetics case for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks. I&#x27;ve noticed improved skin textures and reduced dryness. I&#x27;m hoping that I&#x27;ll notice less apparent wrinkles with further use.</li>
            <li> It exceeded my expectations. It filled in all the valleys and made my skin look refreshed.</li>
            <li> Love this gel cream. I have fair skin and dry patches on my face from sun damage. I tried many prescriptions from my dermatologist and suggestions from my MD. Nothing worked. This has really helped,I no longer have the dryness and flaking. I use it a couple times a day and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from an order at sephora. Tried it and instantly fell in love! I am almost 30, and really no wrinkles and maybe a few fine lines (barely)! I use all anti aging skin care products because for one I am a licensed esthetician so I know what my skin needs! Second I want to prevent wrinkles before they appear so I&#x27;m using anti aging products as a preventative. I must say it&#x27;s working because my skin is very hydrated, not dry, and I still look very youthful. I love this product because it&#x27;s a nice gel and really does plump up the skin gives it a very well rested look. Doesn&#x27;t make you puffy, just fills the skin with moisture and you can see and feel it. It becomes very supple and hydrated. I refused to pay the outrageous price through sephora so that&#x27;s why I searched and found on amazon. Same product just cheaper. I am on my second bottle, I&#x27;ve let friends try and they too fell in love. I highly reccomend this!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried Hada Labo Tokyo, I got a sample in my Real Simple magazine and after two uses, I knew I had found my fountain of youth. This skin plumping gel cream is a miracle worker! I have been stopped by at least 10 people, four of whom were strangers, to ask what I use on my face. It not only reduces fine lines, but it makes the skin glow. Remarkable!</li>
            <li> I found this cream by accident. A sample of it was included with some other order I made online. It is an exact replica of other, very expensive gel moisturizers that are becoming popular in the marketplace under high-end cosmetic names, which are going for $60 - $90 a jar. I ordered a jar of this from Amazon for less than $25. It is a wonderful,cooling moisturizer with a very light astringent action that tightens your pores as it dries and brightens your entire face. It is correctly called a &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; cream because your face seems to lose its wrinkles immediately.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase. I really like this product. It is a bit gel like but does not leave a gel sticky feel at all. It goes on smooth and feels great. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I love the Hada Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Cream.  It makes my skin feel very moist plus it has hyaluronic acid which Dr. Oz highly recommends for the skin combined with a vitamin C skin product.  Thank you.  Mae Marley</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar and I love this stuff. I was nipped in the face by a large dog and this stuff has helped the scars fade away. I have two areas on my left my cheek where the skin was broken. It didn&#x27;t require stitches but there were small scars left.&lt;br /&gt; I started using this after the scabs healed and I use it twice a day. I&#x27;ve found a little goes a long way. This leaves my face feeling pleasantly moisturized. It feels and looks like a gel. I let it soak in and dry for a minute then apply my daily routine of make up.&lt;br /&gt;I usually oppose jars but you&#x27;re able to get ALL of the product. I used every last drop of the first jar. I just make sure that I wash my hands before I dip my finger in and I don&#x27;t double dip.  Jar products can be a breeding ground for bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;This product is sold with similar ingredients, under the same company ,in Japan called Rohto Pharmaceuticals . It is the sister to Mentholatum USA that sells had Hada and labo. I think Japanese women have beautiful skin and I wish staying out of the sun was the &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; thing to do here in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/28/15 I&#x27;m getting ready to open my third jar. I would best describe this as a gel /moisturizer/ serum. I wish it had sunscreen but my makeup does. It looks heavy but feels cool, light and refreshing on your face. I still use it twice a day. I have fair skin that is sensitive and I have not had any issues with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin has been so hydrated these last months, even in the dry heat!  Feels great, not greasy or sticky!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works..it does what it says it will do...love it!</li>
