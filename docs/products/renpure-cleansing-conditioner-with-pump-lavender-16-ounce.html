    <ol>
            <li>This is a awesome product!</li>
            <li>Amazing results!!!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser was really impressed.</li>
            <li>The lavender is wonderful and soothing and helps just as well with keeping the itchy scalp at bay.</li>
            <li>They are wonderful for a fraction of the cost of Wen products which are way overpriced!</li>
            <li>Just as good as Wen!  </li>
            <li>Great body to the hair.  </li>
            <li>but I am thrilled!  </li>
            <li>Renpure Solutions Cleansing Conditioner is the most amazing and best non-soap hair cleanser I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Great just love it</li>
            <li>One good thing I would say about this cleansing conditioner, however, is that it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Its better than Wen!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>My favorite scent from RenPure!</li>
            <li>I love these products!  </li>
            <li>but when I undid my curls in the morning, the result was AMAZING.</li>
            <li>And my hair turned out great, very moisturized and great texture.  </li>
            <li>My Results: &amp;#34;Renpure&amp;#34; is comparable to &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; in that my color-treated hair did not fade, the lovely scent lingers and my hair looks good.  </li>
            <li>my hair is so nice</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 1 month now and my hair is much more softer, shinier and more healthy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled on this product.  </li>
            <li>and I swear the color looks so much better.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I get for going cheap!</li>
            <li>love this brand and their co wash and cleaning shampoos without soap your hair is more moist and if you use hair dye</li>
            <li>What more could you want.  </li>
            <li>I recommend following the exact instructions to achieve the best results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had pretty good success with Renpure&#x27;s &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34; conditioner, and I&#x27;d recommend it as a co-wash alternative to this.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper and maybe even better!</li>
            <li>and my hair is now breakage and split end free.</li>
            <li>Used this morning and my hair feels nice and soft and not greasy at all!</li>
            <li>My hair is full, bouncy and shiny, and even though I still had split ends, you couldn&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the scent of the pomegranate one, too fruity sweet for me.</li>
            <li>Nice natural scent.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>There are those times in life that you realize as much as you love &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; it&#x27;s overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sensitive to fragrances but loved the fragrance of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and is as good as shampoo for cleansing my very oily hair and lasts just as long as a good shampooing.</li>
            <li>I used this last night (followed up with Renpure Amazing Miracle as a conditioner, then the Renpure Whipped Coconut</li>
            <li>Works great on my short hair, not sure for long hair, but for the price great product!</li>
            <li>A long term guy friend complimented me on my amazing hair today.</li>
            <li>out amazing how much longer things last.....</li>
            <li>It works just the same as Wen Hair Shampoo but more cheaper.</li>
            <li>The washing process was simple and I really enjoyed the leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft but free of dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>My hair use to be flat in volume and color, but now it feels healthy</li>
            <li>My hair is colored and this product keeps it moisturized, clean and soft with lots of body.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my hair shiny, soft and full of body.</li>
            <li>Once a month I use deep conditioner (but don&#x27;t think I really need to anymore) and once a month I clarify with a very gentle sulfite free clarifying shampoo and apple cider vinegar rinse.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different &#x27;flavors&#x27; of Renpure cleansing conditioners and this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I just use a little light leave in conditioner afterwards and sometimes mousse or a light spray gel.</li>
            <li>All day my hair has been bouncy and it looks so much thicker.</li>
            <li>Up until I bought this product, I used regular, light conditioner - but when I saw this cleansing conditioner, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Renpure is ONE-THIRD the price and so much</li>
            <li>Very light, a little bight lighter than the coconut or mint varieties.</li>
            <li>From the very first use, my curls and waves were back!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about using Wen Hair care products but does not want to break the bank.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brand and this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to people with curly hair.</li>
            <li>The price of &amp;#34;Renpure&amp;#34; is right where it should be, the scent is on note but the consistency is the big difference.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>My family members were actually the first to notice the change and look of my hair.</li>
            <li>I saw a big difference after my first use.</li>
            <li>This is only my first time using the product</li>
            <li>Decided to go natural and give my hair a break for a while.</li>
            <li>(I wear my hair natural.).</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference.</li>
            <li>hair has lost the frizz and is soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>Conditioning effectively is crucial for curly hair, especially in the hot, humid summer.</li>
            <li>A couple times a month I still blow dry my hair straight using a thermal protection product.</li>
            <li>right before I blow dried) and noticed a difference right away, but the moment of truth would come the next morning since whatever volume I muster after blow drying usually dies after I sleep on it.</li>

            <li> (I wear my hair natural.).</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference.</li>
            <li> hair has lost the frizz and is soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> Conditioning effectively is crucial for curly hair, especially in the hot, humid summer.</li>

            <li> right before I blow dried) and noticed a difference right away, but the moment of truth would come the next morning since whatever volume I muster after blow drying usually dies after I sleep on it.</li>
            <li> So with trepidation I purchased &amp;#34;Renpure Lavender Cleansing Conditioner,&amp;#34; since it is 4X less expensive than &amp;#34;WEN.&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Renpure Lavender&amp;#34; has a sweet scalp-tingling scent but the consistency of this shampoo is much too thin and watery, the shampoo does not grab on to the hair like &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; does so you will use more product to properly cleanse and condition the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a devoted fan of the Renpure Rosemary Mint Cleansing Conditioner for two years, but my thin hair lacks volume and gets flat so quickly.</li>
            <li> I had pretty high hopes, but alas, it leaves my hair greasy, limp, and my scalp smells unwashed the next day</li>
            <li> My hair usually feels soft and it&#x27;s easier to brush after I use Wen, but I don&#x27;t get that same feeling when I use this cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> As per usual with Renpure, my hair was also really soft.</li>
            <li> Was using very expensive salon products, that didn&#x27;t really help much.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try it at first, but decided to try it anyways.</li>
            <li> and I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried, this one doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or oily soon after.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Rosemary Mint, but wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I don&#x27;t see any real changes to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> That cuts down on product to purchase.</li>
            <li> I had to wash it down immediately after to avoid sticky hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the other stuff, Wen, and it made my hair limp.  </li>
            <li> Also, found I was losing less hair when I washed it too.</li>
            <li> A little leery about making my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> The product was leaking out a bit from the nozzle (even though it&#x27;s locked) and it was a bit messy trying to take the bottle out of the little bag it comes in.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and get tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> wavy/curly medium length hair was so damaged from sulfate shampoos, coloring, heat styling and hard water, that it was like straw.</li>
            <li> This item came in poor shape.  </li>
            <li> It would be 5 Stars if not for the thin and watery consistency, the cost fits my budget</li>
            <li> I gave away all my expensive shampoos, conditioners and silicone styling products to my friends.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the mote expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try WEN, but was scared because it was so expensive.  </li>
            <li> 100x times healthier than when I used the expensive products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using very expensive shampoos and conditioners for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li> Since it is not a shampoo, you don&#x27;t get any of the nasty chemicals that shampoos have.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Love this! Its better than Wen! Doesnt have Alcohol in it that dries the hair!  My hair isnt falling out anymore ! My hair is so soft and shiny! LOVE IT! You can get this cheaper at bed and bath beyond! 7.99! Also can use their coupons!</li>
            <li> This is a awesome product! It works just the same as Wen Hair Shampoo but more cheaper. I was skeptical to try it at first, but decided to try it anyways. I have been using it for about 1 month now and my hair is much more softer, shinier and more healthy! My family members were actually the first to notice the change and look of my hair. I saw a big difference after my first use. I recommend following the exact instructions to achieve the best results. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about using Wen Hair care products but does not want to break the bank.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different &#x27;flavors&#x27; of Renpure cleansing conditioners and this one is my favorite! My hair is colored and this product keeps it moisturized, clean and soft with lots of body.  Since it is not a shampoo, you don&#x27;t get any of the nasty chemicals that shampoos have.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months and I use it every other day. This product makes my hair shiny, soft and full of body. It literally feels like silk.</li>
            <li> My type 2c wavy/curly medium length hair was so damaged from sulfate shampoos, coloring, heat styling and hard water, that it was like straw. Lots of breakage, split ends and no curl, just frizz.  Was using very expensive salon products, that didn&#x27;t really help much. Decided to go natural and give my hair a break for a while. I read &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; and decided to try co-washing. Was going to try Wen, when I found this in the local drugstore for 1/4 the price of Wen, 6 months ago. Amazing results!!! From the very first use, my curls and waves were back!!! Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Also, found I was losing less hair when I washed it too. So easy to use! It rinses out easier than regular shampoos and no need for a rinse out 2nd conditioner. I just use a little light leave in conditioner afterwards and sometimes mousse or a light spray gel. My hair is full, bouncy and shiny, and even though I still had split ends, you couldn&#x27;t tell. My hairdresser was really impressed. Gave her a bottle to try and now she uses it. Recently I cut 4 inches off and my hair is now breakage and split end free. I also like the Rosemary mint.  I don&#x27;t care for the scent of the pomegranate one, too fruity sweet for me. I gave away all my expensive shampoos, conditioners and silicone styling products to my friends. Once a month I use deep conditioner (but don&#x27;t think I really need to anymore) and once a month I clarify with a very gentle sulfite free clarifying shampoo and apple cider vinegar rinse. A couple times a month I still blow dry my hair straight using a thermal protection product. When I wash after my hair doesn&#x27;t show any damage.  I will never use regular shampoo again!</li>
            <li> This is only my first time using the product but I am thrilled!  It was very easy to use. And my hair turned out great, very moisturized and great texture.  (I wear my hair natural.). The washing process was simple and I really enjoyed the leave-in conditioner.  That cuts down on product to purchase.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the mote expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Great body to the hair.  Nice natural scent.  Very light, a little bight lighter than the coconut or mint varieties.</li>
            <li> A little leery about making my hair greasy. Used this morning and my hair feels nice and soft and not greasy at all! Definitely recommend and will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Works great on my short hair, not sure for long hair, but for the price great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a devoted fan of the Renpure Rosemary Mint Cleansing Conditioner for two years, but my thin hair lacks volume and gets flat so quickly. I used this last night (followed up with Renpure Amazing Miracle as a conditioner, then the Renpure Whipped Coconut Leave-In Conditioner and just a quarter-sized amount of coconut oil right before I blow dried) and noticed a difference right away, but the moment of truth would come the next morning since whatever volume I muster after blow drying usually dies after I sleep on it. I always pin curl my hair at night to add volume but when I undid my curls in the morning, the result was AMAZING. Wow, what a difference. All day my hair has been bouncy and it looks so much thicker. As per usual with Renpure, my hair was also really soft.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using very expensive shampoos and conditioners for over 15 years.  I&#x27;ve been wanting to try WEN, but was scared because it was so expensive.  I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled on this product.  My hair looks 100x times healthier than when I used the expensive products.  My hair use to be flat in volume and color, but now it feels healthy and I swear the color looks so much better.  I would recommend trying this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent from RenPure! I use it everyday and get tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> Just as good as Wen!  Much cheaper and maybe even better!</li>
            <li> Renpure Solutions Cleansing Conditioner is the most amazing and best non-soap hair cleanser I have ever tried. Unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried, this one doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or oily soon after. It makes my hair soft and is as good as shampoo for cleansing my very oily hair and lasts just as long as a good shampooing. I usually use the Rosemary Mint, but wanted to try something different. The lavender is wonderful and soothing and helps just as well with keeping the itchy scalp at bay. Highly recommend this brand and this product.</li>
            <li> This item came in poor shape.  The product was leaking out a bit from the nozzle (even though it&#x27;s locked) and it was a bit messy trying to take the bottle out of the little bag it comes in.  I had to wash it down immediately after to avoid sticky hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, for the product itself.  I&#x27;m looking for a cheaper alternative to the Wen Cleaning Conditioner and this looked like it&#x27;ll do the trick.  Needless to say, I don&#x27;t see any real changes to my hair.  My hair usually feels soft and it&#x27;s easier to brush after I use Wen, but I don&#x27;t get that same feeling when I use this cleansing conditioner.  I guess for it&#x27;s price, you shouldn&#x27;t be expecting a lot.  That&#x27;s what I get for going cheap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been co-washing for about a year. Up until I bought this product, I used regular, light conditioner - but when I saw this cleansing conditioner, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I had pretty high hopes, but alas, it leaves my hair greasy, limp, and my scalp smells unwashed the next day (I shower at night). I&#x27;ve had pretty good success with Renpure&#x27;s &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34; conditioner, and I&#x27;d recommend it as a co-wash alternative to this. One good thing I would say about this cleansing conditioner, however, is that it smells nice.</li>
            <li> love this brand and their co wash and cleaning shampoos without soap your hair is more moist and if you use hair dye it does not&lt;br /&gt;wash out amazing how much longer things last.....</li>
            <li> There are those times in life that you realize as much as you love &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; it&#x27;s overpriced for what it is. I am also intent on sticking to my budget. So with trepidation I purchased &amp;#34;Renpure Lavender Cleansing Conditioner,&amp;#34; since it is 4X less expensive than &amp;#34;WEN.&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Renpure Lavender&amp;#34; has a sweet scalp-tingling scent but the consistency of this shampoo is much too thin and watery, the shampoo does not grab on to the hair like &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; does so you will use more product to properly cleanse and condition the hair. The price of &amp;#34;Renpure&amp;#34; is right where it should be, the scent is on note but the consistency is the big difference. My Results: &amp;#34;Renpure&amp;#34; is comparable to &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; in that my color-treated hair did not fade, the lovely scent lingers and my hair looks good.  However, as for bounce and shine, &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; stands alone. If &amp;#34;Renpure&amp;#34; used a thicker consistency I think it would increase volume and improve shine. It would be 5 Stars if not for the thin and watery consistency, the cost fits my budget and that&#x27;s the key.</li>
            <li> I love these products!  They are wonderful for a fraction of the cost of Wen products which are way overpriced!</li>
            <li> I tried the other stuff, Wen, and it made my hair limp.  After 12 hours, it looked greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renpure is ONE-THIRD the price and so much better!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has lost the frizz and is soft and bouncy.  What more could you want.  Uh, except my pump doesn&#x27;t work, so I took the pump from the Wen bottle and put it on my Renpure.</li>
            <li> Great just love it my hair is so nice</li>
            <li> Conditioning effectively is crucial for curly hair, especially in the hot, humid summer. I&#x27;ve been using Renpure for a year. I bought this lavender scented Renpure after finding it on Amazon. A long term guy friend complimented me on my amazing hair today. In nine years of friendship, my friend has never complimented my hair before. I am pretty sensitive to fragrances but loved the fragrance of this conditioner. I highly recommend it to people with curly hair. It leaves my hair soft but free of dirt and oil.</li>
