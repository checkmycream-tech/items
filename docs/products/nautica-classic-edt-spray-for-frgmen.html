            <li>I could not believe this was available for the price I paid for this.&lt;br /&gt;Its smells great and clean.</li>
            <li>Its a nice one for people like me who on some days dont want a very strong fragrance but want something light</li>
            <li>VERY quick delivery! &amp; packaged safely.</li>
            <li>I saw this on Amazon and it is very cheap, before i made my order</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light and that&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
            <li>Fresh and light, somewhat more like an aftershave than a cologne in complexity, but perfectly acceptable as a daytime spring fragrance if applied lightly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very smooth smelling spice.</li>
            <li>the cologne is very light but still playful and gives of a feeling or relaxation to both the wearer and the person smelling them</li>
            <li>Very good masculine scent!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overwhelming and has a light, yet very enjoyable aroma.  </li>
            <li>nice clean smell, good for a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>the fragance is ok... not bad... but not that good...</li>
            <li>This fragrance is super cheap, yet smells great.</li>
            <li>Good perfume for reasonable price!!</li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s an ok cologne.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li>The bottle is lovely for a gift for a man.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>but I love using a spray or two before I go wherever I&#x27;m headed.  </li>
            <li>was damn cheap!</li>
            <li>It has a fresh,clean smell that I love on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Love, love, loooove this scent.</li>
            <li>I took a sip of egg nog and heard a woman whisper in my ear, \\&quot;What a stunning sense of intrigue</li>
            <li>I have had the Nautica \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; before and it is a much better product.</li>
            <li>Love this for my husband.  </li>
            <li>Much better price for it here at Amazon than in the department store.</li>
            <li>Some of my friends love it, some of them abhor it.</li>
            <li>it is ok.</li>
            <li>So I figure for sure we can get this straightened out with Amazon,</li>
            <li>My girlfriend likes it though :)</li>
            <li>think I love myself :)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK cologne, you get what you pay for I suppose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>it is really refreshing</li>
            <li>, he loved it and the price was fantastic, plus s&amp;h free........</li>
            <li>its somewhat refreshing too.</li>
            <li>Ok, I thought it&#x27;s just 16 bucks for a 3.4Oz bottle, let&#x27;s give it a try.</li>
            <li>This was at the top of the list.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and we both really love the scent.  </li>
            <li>BUT FIND IT IS PRICEY IN MOST OF THE DEPARTMENT STORES</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend because it&#x27;s his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>However, I think Nautica Voyage smells better</li>
            <li>Glad I came across this.</li>
            <li>I do believe it to be better suited for daytime use though, as opposed to an evening scent.</li>
            <li>The light, refreshing scent of this cologne is quite nice.  </li>
            <li>and I encourage winning women with charm, not drugs)</li>

            <li>I think it smells pretty good</li>
            <li>Amazon yet again you have delivered a product as promised and it is exactly what I wanted and needed and got it for a fair price well way below market price and what I would have paid in Macy&#x27;s or Lord and Taylor....</li>
            <li>I really loved this perfume when i first sampled it in a target store.</li>
            <li>pretty good smell.</li>
            <li>Nice cool looking bottle as well.</li>

            <li>i want to keep using this cologne for a very very long time it is awesome</li>
            <li>although you need to spray a bit more of it if you like your cologne/perfume to be strong.</li>
            <li>I got the package quickly and it was nice to find them in front of the house.</li>
            <li>I love it, is not too strong, but it feels.</li>
            <li>Everyone has his own preferences when it comes to products such as this, so trying it out before you buy it would be of great benefit to you and your wallet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price for an old favorite.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s light and sexy.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was hesitant to buy this, assuming that nothing this cheap could ever smell good.  </li>
            <li>excellent care and products at the expected time as well as the just boxes to package size</li>

            <li>and I really love getting it at such a great price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong like Banana Republic cologne</li>

            <li>Fresh and fierce good for extremely hot day</li>
            <li>I sure this has a fresh clean smell he will love.</li>
            <li>I first bought this at a local store after smelling about 15-20 colognes and I thought it was one of the best and cost me about $40-50.</li>
            <li>This has quickly become one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;m not a fan of the more oceany scents, but this one is great.</li>

            <li>It was such a great deal</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>

            <li>is important have this product</li>
            <li>I love it so much :) .</li>
            <li>They are either too strong, or too mild, or have a strong smell but not as fragrant.</li>
            <li>It does smell good, however it does not last for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Good smell for young men, not too pricey, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It is not to strong and the price was just right!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because is a product cheaper than other products, and is very good brand in the market</li>
            <li>Really!!!  AYFKM.</li>
            <li>Its a very fresh scent, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li>After he sprayed this on,the scent was very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Present for my husband - he loved it and it came very quickly.</li>
            <li>It totally worth it!</li>
            <li>This is the original fragrance, not a copy.  </li>
            <li>Chrome is way better for a hot date.</li>
            <li>But the product is worth the wait!</li>
            <li>excelente producto original funciona sin problemas gracias recomiendo para este vendedor el producto fue despachado dentro de la estimacion propuesta</li>
            <li>excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li>I read some of the comments people saying its not the original</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would see it as duplicate/not original perfume</li>
            <li>and yes it was in original box ect.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It is a soft yet appealing smell that the women love</li>
            <li>Wow, such a clean, wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>if you like clean smells</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean and not too over strong.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that Blue was going to be so pleasant.  </li>
            <li>so we are not the only ones who find it pleasant.</li>
            <li>Simply put, it&#x27;s a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>One time it would have aquatic tones and smell pleasant and the next use it would smell like rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this based on the many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>But the fragrance is not staying long, nor it&#x27;s strong, which may be good for some.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but when I first tried it this morning, the one thing I easily distinguished is that its cheap, and I am yet to identify the fragance with something of grandeur.  </li>
            <li>It is large and creative.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great clean smell, not too stout or overly sweet or bitter.</li>
            <li>It is a very fresh and clean scent that is not too powerful.</li>
            <li>Shipping was great, reached sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>Does not stay on for long, or it would have received 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Great perfume... for 3-4 hours :p</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit sweet and weak.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I dont have much thing to say about this, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift, so I do not have much to compare it to since I do not wear Nautica, but I do not think you can find a better price for this cologne.  </li>
            <li>For the amount you pay, you receive quite a bit, so... good enough.</li>
            <li>Do not expect any romantic or erotic character.</li>
            <li>A good price for such a useable cologne.</li>
            <li>i bought this perfume for my husband and i love the smell and the price really recomend it  </li>
            <li>We did have a problem with one bottle, the whole glass top came off with the lid.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the low  price - my son loves it !</li>
            <li>and I thought that it was going to be a mild clean scent</li>
            <li>, this is my personal opinion and my rewiew have a good day</li>
            <li>NIce fragrance, masculine, not flowery.  </li>
            <li>and I just fell out of love with this haha.</li>
            <li>I love the sellers price and the fast delivery on this item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly potent but it&#x27;s very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Good as gifts or for personal use.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and it was an okay scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing, but not by much.  </li>
            <li>Way too sweet smelling for me.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a substance to spray on my body that made me smell better but not worse.</li>
            <li>not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>For the price, not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful cologne, and for $14, it certainly beats Kohls selling it for $35 for a bottle half the size.</li>
            <li>Wanted something not too strong, but classy and elegant.</li>
            <li>Nautica Blue is by far one of the best smelling colognes the deep sandalwood smell with the sweet peach and pinapple notes is amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a strong hit when you first spray it on, but it mellows out throughout the day and you get a lot of whiffs of</li>
            <li>The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>GENUINE AND HONEST SELLER, SUPER FAST SHIPPING, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, AAA+++</li>
            <li>This is a great fragrance, ordered for my husband, the only thing that actually is not very durable, and in relation to the service of amazon, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very slightly sweet smelling, and has a very crisp , clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of mild scents, this is for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and not over-powering.</li>
            <li>the smell wears off too quickly.  </li>
            <li>It arrived so quick.</li>
            <li>This scent has really mild smell.</li>
            <li>I like mild scents and I prefer using cK</li>
            <li>This item is so worthy for under $20.</li>
            <li>but this has a mild smell</li>
            <li>Its really worth the money you spend for a cool mild scent.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is very pleasant to work daily sports and beach but within 2 hours of having applied fades into the body, it is also true that the cost is quite low.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to people of all ages, the scent isnt too mature or too young, its a good cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>Natica Blue has a nice clean scent for men.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this for a dear cousin of mine but he ended up buying himself a fresh bottle right before my purchase.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift from my family, it smells very fresh and crisp and reminds me of the ocean.</li>
            <li>I bought it very cheap but the fragrance is not that great and does not last long.</li>
            <li>but i could care less because either way it smells great</li>
            <li>I will start by saying that the product was ready and shipped very quickly via usps.</li>
            <li>For the time it shipped, the scent itself and the overall cost, its a pretty damn good deal.</li>
            <li>This seemed pretty good by the reviews, but everyones different</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never too strong, and wears reasonably well.</li>
            <li>LONG LASTING FOR A GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li>This price is out the door hot!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know whether the product is original or not because this is the first time am trying out Nautical Blue.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I suppose, but I&#x27;ve gotten much better results (and ultimately, comments from girls :P) with other cheap colognes (for example, adidas moves comes to mind).</li>
            <li>be aware, it doesn&#x27;t keep the smell for more than between 5-7 hours&lt;br /&gt;any way, comparing to the price, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Ladies, This fresh, crisp, clean scent might just be the right one for your man too.</li>
            <li>its not often that you get a premium brand for such an amazing price..</li>
            <li>Just get the real thing and enjoy it.</li>
            <li>He likes the fragrance, a light musky and fruity smell, very mellow.</li>
            <li>Great price but not primary cologne I use.</li>
            <li>great product for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Nautica Blue is a great light scent that can be worn daily.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, aquatic, and has a hint of blueberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not even worth 16 bucks.</li>
            <li>Got from american fragrance, nice packaging</li>
            <li>I liked it instantly.</li>
            <li>I guess its a distinct smell.</li>
            <li>but yes a gud one...makes u feel fresh.</li>
            <li>For all you men out there (and women) starting your own fragrance collection, please purchase this product.</li>
            <li>Honestly though, I could still smell the scent the next when I pick up my clothes to wash.</li>
            <li>the glass has some defects, ok assuming that maybe they are selling this cheap because of this, when i tried the EDT sprayed on my body it doesnt last an hour</li>
            <li>For the price, it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I arrive at the expected time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>This particular cologne does not have a strong scent</li>
            <li>For the price, I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Smells like it should be worth twice the price.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth, it was a generous 3.4 Oz bottle.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t smell fresh to my husband or to me, nor is it what I would classify as a \\&quot; light\\&quot; fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nautica Blue also comes in a nice glass bottle and chrome cap.</li>
            <li>and it does have a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I wear it every day, and it makes me feel fresh all day.</li>
            <li>worth the money , just over $ 10.  </li>
            <li>It smells pretty cool</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and manly.</li>
            <li>Nautica Blue has a light, refreshing, non-overpowering smell to it.</li>
            <li>Your money is worth every penny on this item..</li>
            <li>The original might be good but this is not original ...</li>
            <li>according to the proper use, recomendado al 100% for other persons, besides excellent</li>
            <li>The smell goes away pretty quickly, so you&#x27;re going to have to reapply it quite a bit if you want to keep the scent.  </li>
            <li>It tails off pretty quickly, so if you&#x27;re the type that likes smelling like you just put on cologne instead of</li>
            <li>Clean fragrance not overpowering, good for everyday</li>
            <li>As soon as I apply it to my skin, it smells like mild vodka and in few seconds, it gives out a pleasant aquatic fragrance.</li>
            <li>None of my other perfumes are as good.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>Buy one for sell and it sold right away.</li>
            <li>Price is right</li>
            <li>It is just the right size.</li>
            <li>It was just the right price too.</li>
            <li>And the price was just right.</li>
            <li>the reviews were right...</li>
            <li>The reviews from other sites mentioned it was a more sophisticated version of Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water, but it really isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>some reviewers said that this is a knock off/fake, and some are positive reviews, so i give a try, when my order arrive surprise!</li>
            <li>wow and what a great price, my husband has used this for a long time</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the fresh clean shower smell after I used an a particular shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product smells great, and it isn&#x27;t so strong that people get annoyed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d describe the scent with a nice light, oceanic &amp; slightly citrus</li>
            <li>The colonel is not that strong ( at least not to me)Smells good and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I HAVE NO REGRETS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER MORE</li>
            <li>Smell is amazing and lasts long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice crisp clean sharp smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably pay a little more and buy a better cologne.</li>
            <li>Will spend a little more and get something that lasts a bit more.  </li>
            <li>I recommend spending a little more and get a better result.</li>
            <li>Awesome everyday use without sacrificing big bucks.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last for many days but it is definitely worth the money. . . .</li>
            <li>Overall though I can not complain too much because it still was an amazing price, with the correct smell.</li>
            <li>This smells OK - light and fresh, but it reminds me of the Bod Man body sprays available at the Big Blue Box stores.  </li>
            <li>I spent 50 dollars on Drakkar Noire and this cologne smells a billion times better!</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift and my brother stated he enjoys it very much.  </li>
            <li>I like this fragrance very much.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>Cheap but effective stuff, not long lasting but does grab attention when you walk into a room.</li>
            <li>Its a nice subtle tone and this amazon price online makes it even better.</li>
            <li>As expected, the shipping was on spot and amazing as always.</li>
            <li>I purchased one from Amazon at the same price with Marshall, except that it&#x27;s even better with 3.4 fl.</li>
            <li>think it is better to buy at local perfumania</li>
            <li>it smells great but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>, \\&quot;why did they buy this in the first place?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I wanted to test this one, and let&#x27;s just say, I&#x27;m glad it was only 15 dollars for it</li>
            <li>This is my first review on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not buying this, and trying chrome legend for the first time instead.</li>
            <li>I think first of all I should get paid for taking my time to review products I buy.</li>
            <li>but it will not get you that hot date.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my hubby as a Christmas gift &amp; he wears it, he&#x27;s just too old school &amp; likes the cheap stuff....</li>
            <li>It do not last more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>His first fragrance, and will buy again, plus it&#x27;s name brand.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to any one who wants to feel a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>but mine is pretty long lasting and smells great</li>
            <li>Smells fresh, and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>man do i love it, its not overpowering and it lasts quite awhile, i showered and can definitely still smell this.</li>
            <li>it was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves this scent and cringed when I said I got another scent to try, she just loves this one so much!</li>
            <li>I have purchased several bottles of this before in stores, and love the scent.</li>
            <li>pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love this product, i wore it the next day i receive it</li>
            <li>I have been searching for many perfumes in the market and finally I choose this one which is recommended by my friend</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product.i mainly purchased it because of the name and price.it was delivered in quick time,and from the time I used it</li>
            <li>I was impressed.my father got interested</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll give it that much!</li>
            <li>Not too overpowering but it will last most of the day.</li>
            <li>So Much!</li>
            <li>I have never purchased cologne or perfume before without smelling it first until now.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this perfume since last 10 years, just love</li>
            <li>the first day, I anticipated any of my friends would be asking me about the perfume.</li>
            <li>This is OK for daily use.</li>
            <li>, I really liked the lotion, what I expected.</li>
            <li>opinion on this scent is that it smells fresh, cool, and it feels like you&#x27;re near the ocean.  </li>
            <li>Its a good everyday cologne.</li>
            <li>For $15 you get a nice, clean and fresh cologne that last long</li>
            <li>Smells very nice, but doesn&#x27;t last too terribly long.</li>
            <li>The smell of this cologne is very nice, however it does not last long.</li>
            <li>The smell of this cologne is very nice, however it does not last long</li>
            <li>I surprised her fragrance, is very soft, elegant and combines humor with my skin.</li>
            <li>its clean and simple and masculine what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>It doesnt have a strong scent at all, the scent barely lasts.</li>
            <li>smell is rather pleasant, and not overwhelming, although it does take a bit of time to settle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At the time I liked the scent a lot, but I was a little hesitant about buying it again because I thought it was a bit higher priced than it was worth.</li>
            <li>However, for such a large bottle at this price, I don&#x27;t mind spritzing myself more than once a day.</li>
            <li>really liked it due to the benefits</li>
            <li>and while it only lasts couple hours those hours youre just smellin fresh!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean, masculine smell that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Actually, if you wanna buy a cologne with a low price and good scent, I do recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I have purchased Nautica Blue before, from a retail store, but this was such a good deal</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am usually very picky when it comes to cologne because most actually give me a headache, but this cologne does not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this cologne for the first time and don&#x27;t like it too much.</li>
            <li>This cologne is pretty much meant for any occasion, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I pretty much collect colognes.</li>
            <li>i like its cause its not overpowering and its pretty much something that everybody would like.</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of Nautica Blue and have used it before I would recommend purchasing a bottle from a local reputable retailer and let Amazon keep their cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li>Not only did I get a great deal but this company also sent me samples of other fragrances and a pocket mirror.</li>
            <li>The scent is very crisp and clean, my only problem with the product is that the scent does not have much staying power.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh and fun, not too strong or dark.</li>
            <li>Not too strong and enough to be noticed.</li>
            <li>This spray feels and smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Very soft yet powerful.</li>
            <li>As others have said it is purely an aqua.</li>
            <li>You can get overwhelmed at counter and sales people seem to push certain items.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be ordering again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review.</li>
            <li>You know how a scent makes you identify with certain things?  </li>
            <li>personally love this product, and would recommend it to any guy looking for a mild everyday scent.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described, 3.4oz Nautica Blue in the original wrapping.</li>
            <li>the bottle is very stylish in comparison to some other colognes I have, but I use this when I go work out, not something I would wear to a professional event.</li>
            <li>Any man should want to have this as one if not the main cologne in his arsenal!</li>
            <li>Hard to say -- I&#x27;ve had good reports of this from others, but i can&#x27;t quite tell myself --</li>
            <li>the cap / spray top could have been little better since i always tend to rotate if you dont hold it properly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the real thing for so cheap, but this is just blue water in a bottle.</li>
            <li>: if you do wear a white shirt and decide to have some on your shirt you could see a light stain.. but you need to be looking very closely to see it</li>
            <li>I found this huge bottle of Nautica Blue for 12.00.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a complex character to it that isn&#x27;t like any cheap fragrance but is not overbearing like those that are required for more formal settings.</li>
            <li>you want something that will knock your socks off, buy Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana</li>
            <li>I checked Nautica Blue for Men at the mall, they are over $50 dollars with free gift purchase.</li>
            <li>Amazon shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves this cologne.</li>
            <li>To me, it didn&#x27;t soothe much and</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li>My Deodorant lasts much longer than this..</li>
            <li>As I waited at a traffic light, a naked woman on a horse curled her finger, motioning me to follow her.  </li>
            <li>and whenever we get together he thanks me for it-</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much or it is too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s the whole point</li>
            <li>Plus for that price, I cant really complain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased for myself prior and agree it&#x27;s a smooth not over powering smelling scent.</li>
            <li>I came home and picked up a bottle from Amazon since it was so much cheaper</li>
            <li>I ENJOY THE NAUTICA BLUE</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>not really a big loss for me because it was cheap, but I am not planning on buying again.  </li>
            <li>ALL NAUTICA COLOGNES AND THE PRICES ARE SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING THEM IN THE MALL.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>However, the scent does wear off rather quickly, so be ready to apply it again if need be.  </li>
            <li>for me the smell is very ggod</li>
            <li>He uses it so much</li>
            <li>The product came very well packaged and fast.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, and no delays.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I really like about it.</li>
            <li>This just smells really chill.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t remember much about this.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The product came very well packaged and fast.</li>
            <li>thinking it&#x27;s cheap enough for a try...</li>
            <li>but it turned out really well.</li>
            <li>I tested this one out at a Kohls and returned home for the online money search and found it here for really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I expected better</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very affordable here on amazon</li>
            <li>Obviously others really enjoy it</li>
            <li>and I didnt want it to be too much.</li>
            <li>But for a real man in the real world, this won&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li>I think it will be appreciated.  </li>
            <li>This is the real size and a legit product.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE NAUTICA</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like their scent</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY.LOOKING</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>also i feel it wears out very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i recommend only if you want to run the risk and because of the cheap price</li>
            <li>gift for my son&#x27;s 47th Birthday, and yes I might purchase it again, the cost was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>knows he wants to put on a gallon of it in the mornings</li>
            <li>I really</li>
            <li>Smells better than the cheap $3.00 crap, and just as good as the $50 bottles.</li>
            <li>He is not a huge fan of colognes but he liked this one.</li>
            <li>After letting the initial burst dissipate for a few minutes, my nose was met by a refreshing scent that smells clean and fresh, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>Then again it&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li>I actually just wanted to point out that although this cologne smells good when you initially put it on, it barely lasts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice sporty perfume....stays for a long time..not very different or unusual smell</li>
            <li>The spray I received may not be original, I could smell it for only for an hour or so..</li>
            <li>I HAVE ORDERED MANY OTHER COLOGNES HERE</li>
            <li>i wouldnt tell her, but all the other ladies love it too.</li>
            <li>And a better price than in other places.</li>
            <li>it is look like original perfume selling at different department store like Macy, target,sears.</li>
            <li>he actually wanted the original brand</li>
            <li>not to strong but not soft!</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this particular spray by Nautica.</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty big, it&#x27;s the worth the price.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that depends how active the wearer is.</li>
            <li>This product is most definitely a knock off and not the real thing, the smell is strong on the alcohol and it does not last that long.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more in future, but will choose a different cologne that he will enjoy.</li>
            <li>This is definitely not for special occasions, keep a bottle of John Varvatos or BVLGari or something that fits your skin.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 12 year old son for his first cologne.  </li>
            <li>Its not too strong and just right to wear it to work everyday.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would make a good present for a teenage boy in middle or high school.</li>
            <li>Everyone should buy at least one, specially for the Holidays, you never know if your gonna be missing one present; and this one will be an excellent option!</li>
            <li>It was in new condition packed very well.</li>
            <li>I previously bought this scent at a Nautica outlet store and paid quite a bit more than what I paid at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this cologne for less than $15 with free shipping!  </li>
            <li>More than half off what it costed in a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li>If a person(more specifically a female companion) got close to you after a day of wearing the cologne such as after a date, she would be able to smell the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells similar, but quickly diminishes within an hour.</li>
            <li>I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews about this perfume online on different websites and thought of ordering it when I saw this super bargain.</li>
            <li>The classic Nautica scent is still enjoyable, but the Nautica Blue is on a completely different level.  </li>
            <li>My 5 stars is mainly for the product value.</li>
            <li>the cologne smells really nice, it is like smelling clear blue water; as far as i have noticed it lasts pretty long.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend to any wives or girlfriends to purchase for their men.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>After reading several reviews i finally  bought this item, it smells really great but only lasts for a short while.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>Highly recomended</li>
            <li>other reviewers have said, this is a great everyday scent that is affordable and won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>I have smelled this in a store prior and liked it - it&#x27;s going to be a Christmas-gift like the other colognes.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little better product from Nautica but for the price (~ $15)</li>
            <li>So it takes  a little more time.  </li>
            <li>I was worried due to the price, but it is long lasting and smells great.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>It is reminiscent of the cheap cologne peddled by street vendors carried in a backpack full of other knockoffs.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a while, noticed that the smell isn&#x27;t as strong as my other NauticaBlue bottle.</li>
            <li>It was hard for me to wrap it up, I had to use a couple more times first.</li>
            <li>great buy and ill do it again</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it&#x27;s absolutely sweet and soft smelling with just enough musk.</li>
            <li>I put this on everyday, and I plan on making more purchases.</li>
            <li>am going to buy few more of these.</li>
            <li>I wish the scent last longer, but worth the price</li>
            <li>&quot; is one of my favorite daytime colognes for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>that sometimes I had to back away from men who wearing such strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very nice, but faint fragrance.</li>
            <li>Nautica Blue has a very different smell but totally mor suitable for my age</li>
            <li>Anyways, this is a nice spray if you want to try out the fragrance and require it for short duration, but wouldn&#x27;t bet on it to last long.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been exploring new scents but, this is a go to fave.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try something new</li>
            <li>This cologne has a nice subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>This scent fades significantly in the first few hours, and is completely gone by the end of a work day.</li>
            <li>Very masculine scent.</li>
            <li>The cologne has a very classy smell to it, but it doesn&#x27;t overpower anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Classic before and smells a lot more subtle, fresh, and does not attack the nose, unlike the Blue.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have always had a sensitivity to perfumes, colognes, and chemical scents (such as those you&#x27;d find in soap, shampoo, cleaners, etc), which in turn has prevented me from ever being interested in cologne.</li>
            <li>but he used his own words to describe the smell... not good.</li>
            <li>the price is pretty low online</li>
            <li>I ordered Nautica Blue for my husband since he like it a lot more than the much more expensive colognes I got for him.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Nautica Blue, so this is a knock off.</li>
            <li>The price here is much better than usual.</li>
            <li>I love it as an everyday daytime cologne!</li>
            <li>I got tired of walking into local department stores and paying over 40$ for cologne this was priced right and smells nice.</li>
            <li>This cologne is the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; but as soon as i opened i could tell this wasnt the same high quality item you could buy in a department store.</li>
            <li>im so unhappy with this, when you use it smells good and smells like the original ones that i been had, but left 1 hout the smell gone</li>
            <li>I am so unhappy with this, when you use it smells good and smells like the original ones that i been had, but left 1 hour the smell gone.</li>
            <li>This smells fine for my 13 year old son, but I would recommend for my husband because the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>and it is more long lasting than Nautica Blue.</li>
            <li>Cool water is my other choice</li>
            <li>I am half tempted to go out to a department store and get a bottle of this and compare the 2 just to be sure that they are the same.</li>
            <li>I had previously read reviews of fakes being sold on Amazon so when I needed more I searched my purchase history with the hope of receiving the same product again.</li>
            <li>it says made by Coty who makes other low end stuff.. and not sure if this is a authentic Nautica but smell goes away in 1-2 min most or it&#x27;s truly not a good product if everything else is authentic..</li>
            <li>oh well, like most of the other people here have said - it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin for too long.</li>
            <li>however I also picked up NAUTICA VOYAGE with the same order and while searching to compare the two on the net, I found everyone strongly suggested NAUTICA VOYAGE over BLUE and after getting these two and comparing for myself, I very highly suggest going with Voyage over Blue.</li>
            <li>It smells a little cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not familiar enough with the product to know for sure</li>
            <li>It feels (and smells) like a giant step down when I compare to my other fragrances that I wear regularly - like 212 Sexy, Live Jazz, Issey Miyake, Cool Water, Acqua di Gio, Emporio and Weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this Nautica item wrapped in clear cellophane, as the departments stores sell it.</li>
            <li>Ok, they want me to use at least 20 words...</li>
            <li>I was really surprised that Amazon is selling this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft scented for daytime use.  </li>
            <li>Deciding this was just too much for tiny bottles of cologne, I landed upon this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is soft, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I was nervous the scent may be off but compared to the old bottle he had, they smelled identical.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;ll still get a whiff of this classy scent for hours after application.  </li>
            <li>I always prefer this perfume nearly it&#x27;s been 3 yrs</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy directly from manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few weeks and really enjoy the compliments I have been getting.</li>
            <li>far as the scent goes?  </li>
            <li>IT IS OLD SCHOOL.</li>
            <li>there is something about that gentle sky blue color.</li>
            <li>then the smell is completely gone.</li>
            <li>This smells great.....clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my 12 year old son.</li>
            <li>I get compliments frequently when I wear it.</li>
            <li>I have gotten my product so early</li>
            <li>this product help for complete anything.</li>
            <li>Is soft and dont disturb, but dont surprise anyone.</li>
            <li>I gave five stares because it was a gift for my 12 year old nephew and lord</li>
            <li>how ever it is a Young Mans smell, I would not wear it to work or anything, just my thoughts</li>
            <li>Smells a bit heavy, overwhelming &amp; regular drugstore quality men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>I would definitely wear it at a nice dinner date that ends with a slow dance.</li>
            <li>da item was good but the invoice said a price that was totally wrong-</li>
            <li>It lasts a good amount of time -- still faint after ~8 hours.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last the whole day, but decent enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for casual wear, too!</li>
            <li>At first I was disappointed, but then realized just looking at the design of the box and bottle that this cologne was meant recreate the crisp, clean, and fresh scent coming from the ocean.</li>
            <li>This stuff reminds me of a more subtle Chrome by Azzaro.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle scent, it give a sense of maturity and the ladies like</li>
            <li>Nautica Blue (this product) is not to be mistakened with Nautica Classic (teal in color).  </li>
            <li>All of the scents I had smelled in the past were incredibly potent and all smelled too similar to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why I expected it to be as nice as the $50 a bottle stuff, it just isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;you can try blue voyage or classic..</li>
            <li>I wish it lasted a little longer though, but not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Bought based on reviews but struggle to see why reviews are so high outside of the price.</li>
            <li>I found this for super cheap on Amazon and decided to make this a blind buy after reading some reviews about it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It is good for casual, everyday use, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>so may some one please send me a new invoice with the proper price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very citrus like and dry just like the women&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>The Nautica Blue smelled like someone had emptied the real product and substituted blue mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Last pretty long because you don&#x27;t need a lot.  </li>
            <li>They say you get what you pay for, however in comparison with prices of other colognes that I have used, This was completely worth the price, the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long, its a plain, fresh, crisp smell,  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just like the other regulars out there until people started asking me what I had on.</li>
            <li>I ordered it due to price tag which beats its essence, won&#x27;t recommend if you really want to out-stand the crowd!</li>
            <li>From the outside, the baby blue color is vibrant and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you do not know it, it is a fresh, clean smelling, casual sport fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I looked at this same product at a local Big Box store and as you all know, the prices at retail locations are very high.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing particularly bad about the product but nothing great too - Just the usual sweet smell which lingers away in a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy the smell and only need it on for a small amount of time I would reccommend.</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for apparently.</li>
            <li>think next time I might get old spice because it reminds me of my dad.</li>
            <li>far then the smaller store bought bottles I purchase.</li>
            <li>I am surprised something fulfilled by Amazon can be of such inferior quality.</li>
            <li>This one would barely hold up for an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I am 24 years old and this is the only product I used for over 2 years</li>
            <li>I have purchased expensive colognes for a long time and this one has no where near the lasting qualities of good colognes.  </li>
            <li>Listen to me, i would rather go buy the brand new item with a scent that lasts long and can be smelt farther than one inch away from where aplied.</li>
            <li>all of that the smell or the fragrance is absolutely nothing, I don&#x27;t know what it smells like other than maybe&lt;</li>
            <li>dont waste your money,,, very weak high karate smells better ,,,my first and last cologne buy online save your money,,</li>
            <li>Three direct sprays to the skin will only last ~10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>As an adult, I was given the gift of Nautica Blue, which brought me back to childhood memories.  </li>
            <li>great for everyday, weekends and casual use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong nor weak.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, not to weak.</li>
            <li>It is very weak, and its a fragrance that reminds me of my days when I didn&#x27;t have much cash and bought cheap knock-offs you would find only in variety stores.  </li>
            <li>Its cheap and smells good but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyday use as it may start to feel annoying with time.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Bod Man costs about half as much for twice the quantity.</li>
            <li>It is mild enough to not appear like you are trying to hard</li>
            <li>The bottle packaging everything is what I would expect, however the scent is not long lasting disappears in a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Similar scent to Nautica blue, but not as sweet, not as delicate.</li>
            <li>Some higher quality scents will easily last throughout the day, even if just a very slight lingering scent.  </li>
            <li>but this perfume doesn&#x27;t smell anything @ all or very cheap fake perfume ..</li>
            <li>The scent is different than the same brand in the past and does not linger for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>He compared the little bit of cologne he had left in his old bottle to the cologne in this new bottle and they are VERY different.</li>
            <li>This is a pure waste of money.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it is my new \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, early I might add, I tore open the box and pumped out just a little and like WOW this stuff is just yummy</li>

            <li> Its a nice one for people like me who on some days dont want a very strong fragrance but want something light</li>
            <li> VERY quick delivery! &amp; packaged safely.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Amazon and it is very cheap, before i made my order</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very light and that&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
            <li> Fresh and light, somewhat more like an aftershave than a cologne in complexity, but perfectly acceptable as a daytime spring fragrance if applied lightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very smooth smelling spice.</li>
            <li> the cologne is very light but still playful and gives of a feeling or relaxation to both the wearer and the person smelling them</li>
            <li> Very good masculine scent!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overwhelming and has a light, yet very enjoyable aroma.  </li>
            <li> nice clean smell, good for a cheap price.  </li>
            <li> the fragance is ok... not bad... but not that good...</li>
            <li> This fragrance is super cheap, yet smells great.</li>
            <li> Good perfume for reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s an ok cologne.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li> The bottle is lovely for a gift for a man.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> but I love using a spray or two before I go wherever I&#x27;m headed.  </li>
            <li> was damn cheap!</li>
            <li> It has a fresh,clean smell that I love on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Love, love, loooove this scent.</li>
            <li> I took a sip of egg nog and heard a woman whisper in my ear, \\&quot;What a stunning sense of intrigue</li>
            <li> I have had the Nautica \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; before and it is a much better product.</li>
            <li> Love this for my husband.  </li>
            <li> Much better price for it here at Amazon than in the department store.</li>
            <li> Some of my friends love it, some of them abhor it.</li>
            <li> it is ok.</li>
            <li> So I figure for sure we can get this straightened out with Amazon,</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes it though :)</li>
            <li> think I love myself :)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK cologne, you get what you pay for I suppose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> it is really refreshing</li>
            <li> , he loved it and the price was fantastic, plus s&amp;h free........</li>
            <li> its somewhat refreshing too.</li>
            <li> Ok, I thought it&#x27;s just 16 bucks for a 3.4Oz bottle, let&#x27;s give it a try.</li>
            <li> This was at the top of the list.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and we both really love the scent.  </li>
            <li> BUT FIND IT IS PRICEY IN MOST OF THE DEPARTMENT STORES</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend because it&#x27;s his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> However, I think Nautica Voyage smells better</li>
            <li> Glad I came across this.</li>
            <li> I do believe it to be better suited for daytime use though, as opposed to an evening scent.</li>
            <li> The light, refreshing scent of this cologne is quite nice.  </li>
            <li> and I encourage winning women with charm, not drugs)</li>

            <li> I think it smells pretty good</li>
            <li> Amazon yet again you have delivered a product as promised and it is exactly what I wanted and needed and got it for a fair price well way below market price and what I would have paid in Macy&#x27;s or Lord and Taylor....</li>
            <li> I really loved this perfume when i first sampled it in a target store.</li>
            <li> pretty good smell.</li>
            <li> Nice cool looking bottle as well.</li>

            <li> i want to keep using this cologne for a very very long time it is awesome</li>
            <li> although you need to spray a bit more of it if you like your cologne/perfume to be strong.</li>
            <li> I got the package quickly and it was nice to find them in front of the house.</li>
            <li> I love it, is not too strong, but it feels.</li>
            <li> Everyone has his own preferences when it comes to products such as this, so trying it out before you buy it would be of great benefit to you and your wallet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price for an old favorite.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s light and sexy.  </li>

            <li> Fresh and fierce good for extremely hot day</li>
            <li> I sure this has a fresh clean smell he will love.</li>
            <li> I first bought this at a local store after smelling about 15-20 colognes and I thought it was one of the best and cost me about $40-50.</li>
            <li> This has quickly become one of my favorite fragrances.</li>

            <li> is important have this product</li>
            <li> I love it so much :) .</li>
            <li> They are either too strong, or too mild, or have a strong smell but not as fragrant.</li>
            <li> It does smell good, however it does not last for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Good smell for young men, not too pricey, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It is not to strong and the price was just right!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because is a product cheaper than other products, and is very good brand in the market</li>

            <li> It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li> After he sprayed this on,the scent was very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Present for my husband - he loved it and it came very quickly.</li>
            <li> It totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the original fragrance, not a copy.  </li>
            <li> Chrome is way better for a hot date.</li>
            <li> But the product is worth the wait!</li>
            <li> excelente producto original funciona sin problemas gracias recomiendo para este vendedor el producto fue despachado dentro de la estimacion propuesta</li>
            <li> excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li> I read some of the comments people saying its not the original</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would see it as duplicate/not original perfume</li>
            <li> and yes it was in original box ect.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It is a soft yet appealing smell that the women love</li>
            <li> Wow, such a clean, wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> if you like clean smells</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and clean and not too over strong.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that Blue was going to be so pleasant.  </li>
            <li> so we are not the only ones who find it pleasant.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it&#x27;s a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> One time it would have aquatic tones and smell pleasant and the next use it would smell like rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this based on the many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> But the fragrance is not staying long, nor it&#x27;s strong, which may be good for some.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but when I first tried it this morning, the one thing I easily distinguished is that its cheap, and I am yet to identify the fragance with something of grandeur.  </li>
            <li> It is large and creative.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great clean smell, not too stout or overly sweet or bitter.</li>
            <li> It is a very fresh and clean scent that is not too powerful.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great, reached sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Does not stay on for long, or it would have received 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Great perfume... for 3-4 hours :p</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit sweet and weak.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I dont have much thing to say about this, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, so I do not have much to compare it to since I do not wear Nautica, but I do not think you can find a better price for this cologne.  </li>
            <li> For the amount you pay, you receive quite a bit, so... good enough.</li>
            <li> Do not expect any romantic or erotic character.</li>
            <li> A good price for such a useable cologne.</li>
            <li> i bought this perfume for my husband and i love the smell and the price really recomend it  </li>
            <li> We did have a problem with one bottle, the whole glass top came off with the lid.  </li>
            <li> Good value for the low  price - my son loves it !</li>
            <li> and I thought that it was going to be a mild clean scent</li>
            <li> , this is my personal opinion and my rewiew have a good day</li>
            <li> NIce fragrance, masculine, not flowery.  </li>
            <li> and I just fell out of love with this haha.</li>
            <li> I love the sellers price and the fast delivery on this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly potent but it&#x27;s very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Good as gifts or for personal use.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and it was an okay scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing, but not by much.  </li>
            <li> Way too sweet smelling for me.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a substance to spray on my body that made me smell better but not worse.</li>
            <li> not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> For the price, not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful cologne, and for $14, it certainly beats Kohls selling it for $35 for a bottle half the size.</li>
            <li> Wanted something not too strong, but classy and elegant.</li>
            <li> Nautica Blue is by far one of the best smelling colognes the deep sandalwood smell with the sweet peach and pinapple notes is amazing.</li>
            <li> It has a strong hit when you first spray it on, but it mellows out throughout the day and you get a lot of whiffs of</li>
            <li> The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> GENUINE AND HONEST SELLER, SUPER FAST SHIPPING, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, AAA+++</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance, ordered for my husband, the only thing that actually is not very durable, and in relation to the service of amazon, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slightly sweet smelling, and has a very crisp , clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of mild scents, this is for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and not over-powering.</li>
            <li> the smell wears off too quickly.  </li>
            <li> It arrived so quick.</li>
            <li> This scent has really mild smell.</li>
            <li> I like mild scents and I prefer using cK</li>
            <li> This item is so worthy for under $20.</li>
            <li> but this has a mild smell</li>
            <li> Its really worth the money you spend for a cool mild scent.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very pleasant to work daily sports and beach but within 2 hours of having applied fades into the body, it is also true that the cost is quite low.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people of all ages, the scent isnt too mature or too young, its a good cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> Natica Blue has a nice clean scent for men.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this for a dear cousin of mine but he ended up buying himself a fresh bottle right before my purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from my family, it smells very fresh and crisp and reminds me of the ocean.</li>
            <li> I bought it very cheap but the fragrance is not that great and does not last long.</li>
            <li> but i could care less because either way it smells great</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that the product was ready and shipped very quickly via usps.</li>
            <li> For the time it shipped, the scent itself and the overall cost, its a pretty damn good deal.</li>
            <li> This seemed pretty good by the reviews, but everyones different</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never too strong, and wears reasonably well.</li>
            <li> LONG LASTING FOR A GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li> This price is out the door hot!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know whether the product is original or not because this is the first time am trying out Nautical Blue.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I suppose, but I&#x27;ve gotten much better results (and ultimately, comments from girls :P) with other cheap colognes (for example, adidas moves comes to mind).</li>
            <li> be aware, it doesn&#x27;t keep the smell for more than between 5-7 hours&lt;br /&gt;any way, comparing to the price, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Ladies, This fresh, crisp, clean scent might just be the right one for your man too.</li>
            <li> its not often that you get a premium brand for such an amazing price..</li>
            <li> Just get the real thing and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> He likes the fragrance, a light musky and fruity smell, very mellow.</li>
            <li> Great price but not primary cologne I use.</li>
            <li> great product for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Nautica Blue is a great light scent that can be worn daily.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, aquatic, and has a hint of blueberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not even worth 16 bucks.</li>
            <li> Got from american fragrance, nice packaging</li>
            <li> I liked it instantly.</li>
            <li> I guess its a distinct smell.</li>
            <li> but yes a gud one...makes u feel fresh.</li>
            <li> For all you men out there (and women) starting your own fragrance collection, please purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Honestly though, I could still smell the scent the next when I pick up my clothes to wash.</li>
            <li> the glass has some defects, ok assuming that maybe they are selling this cheap because of this, when i tried the EDT sprayed on my body it doesnt last an hour</li>
            <li> For the price, it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I arrive at the expected time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> This particular cologne does not have a strong scent</li>
            <li> For the price, I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Smells like it should be worth twice the price.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> what it&#x27;s worth, it was a generous 3.4 Oz bottle.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell fresh to my husband or to me, nor is it what I would classify as a \\&quot; light\\&quot; fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nautica Blue also comes in a nice glass bottle and chrome cap.</li>
            <li> and it does have a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I wear it every day, and it makes me feel fresh all day.</li>
            <li> worth the money , just over $ 10.  </li>
            <li> It smells pretty cool</li>
            <li> It smells so fresh and manly.</li>
            <li> Nautica Blue has a light, refreshing, non-overpowering smell to it.</li>
            <li> Your money is worth every penny on this item..</li>
            <li> The original might be good but this is not original ...</li>
            <li> according to the proper use, recomendado al 100% for other persons, besides excellent</li>
            <li> The smell goes away pretty quickly, so you&#x27;re going to have to reapply it quite a bit if you want to keep the scent.  </li>
            <li> It tails off pretty quickly, so if you&#x27;re the type that likes smelling like you just put on cologne instead of</li>
            <li> Clean fragrance not overpowering, good for everyday</li>
            <li> As soon as I apply it to my skin, it smells like mild vodka and in few seconds, it gives out a pleasant aquatic fragrance.</li>
            <li> None of my other perfumes are as good.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> Buy one for sell and it sold right away.</li>
            <li> Price is right</li>
            <li> It is just the right size.</li>
            <li> It was just the right price too.</li>
            <li> And the price was just right.</li>
            <li> the reviews were right...</li>
            <li> The reviews from other sites mentioned it was a more sophisticated version of Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water, but it really isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> some reviewers said that this is a knock off/fake, and some are positive reviews, so i give a try, when my order arrive surprise!</li>
            <li> wow and what a great price, my husband has used this for a long time</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the fresh clean shower smell after I used an a particular shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, and it isn&#x27;t so strong that people get annoyed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe the scent with a nice light, oceanic &amp; slightly citrus</li>
            <li> The colonel is not that strong ( at least not to me)Smells good and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HAVE NO REGRETS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER MORE</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing and lasts long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice crisp clean sharp smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably pay a little more and buy a better cologne.</li>
            <li> Will spend a little more and get something that lasts a bit more.  </li>
            <li> I recommend spending a little more and get a better result.</li>
            <li> Awesome everyday use without sacrificing big bucks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last for many days but it is definitely worth the money. . . .</li>
            <li> Overall though I can not complain too much because it still was an amazing price, with the correct smell.</li>
            <li> This smells OK - light and fresh, but it reminds me of the Bod Man body sprays available at the Big Blue Box stores.  </li>
            <li> I spent 50 dollars on Drakkar Noire and this cologne smells a billion times better!</li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and my brother stated he enjoys it very much.  </li>
            <li> I like this fragrance very much.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Cheap but effective stuff, not long lasting but does grab attention when you walk into a room.</li>
            <li> Its a nice subtle tone and this amazon price online makes it even better.</li>
            <li> As expected, the shipping was on spot and amazing as always.</li>
            <li> I purchased one from Amazon at the same price with Marshall, except that it&#x27;s even better with 3.4 fl.</li>
            <li> think it is better to buy at local perfumania</li>
            <li> it smells great but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> , \\&quot;why did they buy this in the first place?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I wanted to test this one, and let&#x27;s just say, I&#x27;m glad it was only 15 dollars for it</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not buying this, and trying chrome legend for the first time instead.</li>
            <li> I think first of all I should get paid for taking my time to review products I buy.</li>
            <li> but it will not get you that hot date.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my hubby as a Christmas gift &amp; he wears it, he&#x27;s just too old school &amp; likes the cheap stuff....</li>
            <li> It do not last more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> His first fragrance, and will buy again, plus it&#x27;s name brand.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to any one who wants to feel a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> but mine is pretty long lasting and smells great</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> man do i love it, its not overpowering and it lasts quite awhile, i showered and can definitely still smell this.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this scent and cringed when I said I got another scent to try, she just loves this one so much!</li>
            <li> I have purchased several bottles of this before in stores, and love the scent.</li>
            <li> pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love this product, i wore it the next day i receive it</li>
            <li> I have been searching for many perfumes in the market and finally I choose this one which is recommended by my friend</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product.i mainly purchased it because of the name and price.it was delivered in quick time,and from the time I used it</li>
            <li> I was impressed.my father got interested</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll give it that much!</li>
            <li> Not too overpowering but it will last most of the day.</li>
            <li> So Much!</li>
            <li> I have never purchased cologne or perfume before without smelling it first until now.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this perfume since last 10 years, just love</li>
            <li> the first day, I anticipated any of my friends would be asking me about the perfume.</li>
            <li> This is OK for daily use.</li>
            <li> , I really liked the lotion, what I expected.</li>
            <li> opinion on this scent is that it smells fresh, cool, and it feels like you&#x27;re near the ocean.  </li>
            <li> Its a good everyday cologne.</li>
            <li> For $15 you get a nice, clean and fresh cologne that last long</li>
            <li> Smells very nice, but doesn&#x27;t last too terribly long.</li>
            <li> The smell of this cologne is very nice, however it does not last long.</li>
            <li> The smell of this cologne is very nice, however it does not last long</li>
            <li> I surprised her fragrance, is very soft, elegant and combines humor with my skin.</li>
            <li> its clean and simple and masculine what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> It doesnt have a strong scent at all, the scent barely lasts.</li>
            <li> smell is rather pleasant, and not overwhelming, although it does take a bit of time to settle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the time I liked the scent a lot, but I was a little hesitant about buying it again because I thought it was a bit higher priced than it was worth.</li>
            <li> However, for such a large bottle at this price, I don&#x27;t mind spritzing myself more than once a day.</li>
            <li> really liked it due to the benefits</li>
            <li> and while it only lasts couple hours those hours youre just smellin fresh!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean, masculine smell that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Actually, if you wanna buy a cologne with a low price and good scent, I do recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Nautica Blue before, from a retail store, but this was such a good deal</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am usually very picky when it comes to cologne because most actually give me a headache, but this cologne does not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for the first time and don&#x27;t like it too much.</li>
            <li> This cologne is pretty much meant for any occasion, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I pretty much collect colognes.</li>
            <li> i like its cause its not overpowering and its pretty much something that everybody would like.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of Nautica Blue and have used it before I would recommend purchasing a bottle from a local reputable retailer and let Amazon keep their cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li> Not only did I get a great deal but this company also sent me samples of other fragrances and a pocket mirror.</li>
            <li> The scent is very crisp and clean, my only problem with the product is that the scent does not have much staying power.  </li>
            <li> It smells fresh and fun, not too strong or dark.</li>
            <li> Not too strong and enough to be noticed.</li>
            <li> This spray feels and smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Very soft yet powerful.</li>
            <li> As others have said it is purely an aqua.</li>
            <li> You can get overwhelmed at counter and sales people seem to push certain items.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be ordering again.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review.</li>
            <li> You know how a scent makes you identify with certain things?  </li>
            <li> personally love this product, and would recommend it to any guy looking for a mild everyday scent.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described, 3.4oz Nautica Blue in the original wrapping.</li>
            <li> the bottle is very stylish in comparison to some other colognes I have, but I use this when I go work out, not something I would wear to a professional event.</li>
            <li> Any man should want to have this as one if not the main cologne in his arsenal!</li>
            <li> Hard to say -- I&#x27;ve had good reports of this from others, but i can&#x27;t quite tell myself --</li>
            <li> the cap / spray top could have been little better since i always tend to rotate if you dont hold it properly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the real thing for so cheap, but this is just blue water in a bottle.</li>
            <li> : if you do wear a white shirt and decide to have some on your shirt you could see a light stain.. but you need to be looking very closely to see it</li>
            <li> I found this huge bottle of Nautica Blue for 12.00.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a complex character to it that isn&#x27;t like any cheap fragrance but is not overbearing like those that are required for more formal settings.</li>
            <li> you want something that will knock your socks off, buy Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana</li>
            <li> I checked Nautica Blue for Men at the mall, they are over $50 dollars with free gift purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves this cologne.</li>
            <li> To me, it didn&#x27;t soothe much and</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> My Deodorant lasts much longer than this..</li>
            <li> As I waited at a traffic light, a naked woman on a horse curled her finger, motioning me to follow her.  </li>
            <li> and whenever we get together he thanks me for it-</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much or it is too overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s the whole point</li>
            <li> Plus for that price, I cant really complain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased for myself prior and agree it&#x27;s a smooth not over powering smelling scent.</li>
            <li> I came home and picked up a bottle from Amazon since it was so much cheaper</li>
            <li> I ENJOY THE NAUTICA BLUE</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> not really a big loss for me because it was cheap, but I am not planning on buying again.  </li>
            <li> ALL NAUTICA COLOGNES AND THE PRICES ARE SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING THEM IN THE MALL.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> However, the scent does wear off rather quickly, so be ready to apply it again if need be.  </li>
            <li> for me the smell is very ggod</li>
            <li> He uses it so much</li>
            <li> The product came very well packaged and fast.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and no delays.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I really like about it.</li>
            <li> This just smells really chill.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t remember much about this.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product came very well packaged and fast.</li>
            <li> thinking it&#x27;s cheap enough for a try...</li>
            <li> but it turned out really well.</li>
            <li> I tested this one out at a Kohls and returned home for the online money search and found it here for really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I expected better</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very affordable here on amazon</li>
            <li> Obviously others really enjoy it</li>
            <li> and I didnt want it to be too much.</li>
            <li> But for a real man in the real world, this won&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> I think it will be appreciated.  </li>
            <li> This is the real size and a legit product.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE NAUTICA</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really like their scent</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY.LOOKING</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> also i feel it wears out very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i recommend only if you want to run the risk and because of the cheap price</li>
            <li> gift for my son&#x27;s 47th Birthday, and yes I might purchase it again, the cost was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> knows he wants to put on a gallon of it in the mornings</li>
            <li> I really</li>
            <li> Smells better than the cheap $3.00 crap, and just as good as the $50 bottles.</li>
            <li> He is not a huge fan of colognes but he liked this one.</li>
            <li> After letting the initial burst dissipate for a few minutes, my nose was met by a refreshing scent that smells clean and fresh, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Then again it&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li> I actually just wanted to point out that although this cologne smells good when you initially put it on, it barely lasts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sporty perfume....stays for a long time..not very different or unusual smell</li>
            <li> The spray I received may not be original, I could smell it for only for an hour or so..</li>
            <li> I HAVE ORDERED MANY OTHER COLOGNES HERE</li>
            <li> i wouldnt tell her, but all the other ladies love it too.</li>
            <li> And a better price than in other places.</li>
            <li> it is look like original perfume selling at different department store like Macy, target,sears.</li>
            <li> he actually wanted the original brand</li>
            <li> not to strong but not soft!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this particular spray by Nautica.</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty big, it&#x27;s the worth the price.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that depends how active the wearer is.</li>
            <li> This product is most definitely a knock off and not the real thing, the smell is strong on the alcohol and it does not last that long.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more in future, but will choose a different cologne that he will enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not for special occasions, keep a bottle of John Varvatos or BVLGari or something that fits your skin.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 year old son for his first cologne.  </li>
            <li> Its not too strong and just right to wear it to work everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would make a good present for a teenage boy in middle or high school.</li>
            <li> Everyone should buy at least one, specially for the Holidays, you never know if your gonna be missing one present; and this one will be an excellent option!</li>
            <li> It was in new condition packed very well.</li>
            <li> I previously bought this scent at a Nautica outlet store and paid quite a bit more than what I paid at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for less than $15 with free shipping!  </li>
            <li> More than half off what it costed in a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> If a person(more specifically a female companion) got close to you after a day of wearing the cologne such as after a date, she would be able to smell the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells similar, but quickly diminishes within an hour.</li>
            <li> I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews about this perfume online on different websites and thought of ordering it when I saw this super bargain.</li>
            <li> The classic Nautica scent is still enjoyable, but the Nautica Blue is on a completely different level.  </li>
            <li> My 5 stars is mainly for the product value.</li>
            <li> the cologne smells really nice, it is like smelling clear blue water; as far as i have noticed it lasts pretty long.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend to any wives or girlfriends to purchase for their men.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews i finally  bought this item, it smells really great but only lasts for a short while.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Highly recomended</li>
            <li> other reviewers have said, this is a great everyday scent that is affordable and won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> I have smelled this in a store prior and liked it - it&#x27;s going to be a Christmas-gift like the other colognes.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little better product from Nautica but for the price (~ $15)</li>
            <li> So it takes  a little more time.  </li>
            <li> I was worried due to the price, but it is long lasting and smells great.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> It is reminiscent of the cheap cologne peddled by street vendors carried in a backpack full of other knockoffs.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a while, noticed that the smell isn&#x27;t as strong as my other NauticaBlue bottle.</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to wrap it up, I had to use a couple more times first.</li>
            <li> great buy and ill do it again</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it&#x27;s absolutely sweet and soft smelling with just enough musk.</li>
            <li> I put this on everyday, and I plan on making more purchases.</li>
            <li> am going to buy few more of these.</li>
            <li> I wish the scent last longer, but worth the price</li>
            <li> &quot; is one of my favorite daytime colognes for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> that sometimes I had to back away from men who wearing such strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very nice, but faint fragrance.</li>
            <li> Nautica Blue has a very different smell but totally mor suitable for my age</li>
            <li> Anyways, this is a nice spray if you want to try out the fragrance and require it for short duration, but wouldn&#x27;t bet on it to last long.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been exploring new scents but, this is a go to fave.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try something new</li>
            <li> This cologne has a nice subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> This scent fades significantly in the first few hours, and is completely gone by the end of a work day.</li>
            <li> Very masculine scent.</li>
            <li> The cologne has a very classy smell to it, but it doesn&#x27;t overpower anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Classic before and smells a lot more subtle, fresh, and does not attack the nose, unlike the Blue.  </li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have always had a sensitivity to perfumes, colognes, and chemical scents (such as those you&#x27;d find in soap, shampoo, cleaners, etc), which in turn has prevented me from ever being interested in cologne.</li>
            <li> but he used his own words to describe the smell... not good.</li>
            <li> the price is pretty low online</li>
            <li> I ordered Nautica Blue for my husband since he like it a lot more than the much more expensive colognes I got for him.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Nautica Blue, so this is a knock off.</li>
            <li> The price here is much better than usual.</li>
            <li> I love it as an everyday daytime cologne!</li>
            <li> I got tired of walking into local department stores and paying over 40$ for cologne this was priced right and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This cologne is the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; but as soon as i opened i could tell this wasnt the same high quality item you could buy in a department store.</li>
            <li> im so unhappy with this, when you use it smells good and smells like the original ones that i been had, but left 1 hout the smell gone</li>
            <li> I am so unhappy with this, when you use it smells good and smells like the original ones that i been had, but left 1 hour the smell gone.</li>
            <li> This smells fine for my 13 year old son, but I would recommend for my husband because the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> and it is more long lasting than Nautica Blue.</li>
            <li> Cool water is my other choice</li>
            <li> I am half tempted to go out to a department store and get a bottle of this and compare the 2 just to be sure that they are the same.</li>
            <li> I had previously read reviews of fakes being sold on Amazon so when I needed more I searched my purchase history with the hope of receiving the same product again.</li>
            <li> it says made by Coty who makes other low end stuff.. and not sure if this is a authentic Nautica but smell goes away in 1-2 min most or it&#x27;s truly not a good product if everything else is authentic..</li>
            <li> oh well, like most of the other people here have said - it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin for too long.</li>
            <li> however I also picked up NAUTICA VOYAGE with the same order and while searching to compare the two on the net, I found everyone strongly suggested NAUTICA VOYAGE over BLUE and after getting these two and comparing for myself, I very highly suggest going with Voyage over Blue.</li>
            <li> It smells a little cheap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not familiar enough with the product to know for sure</li>
            <li> It feels (and smells) like a giant step down when I compare to my other fragrances that I wear regularly - like 212 Sexy, Live Jazz, Issey Miyake, Cool Water, Acqua di Gio, Emporio and Weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this Nautica item wrapped in clear cellophane, as the departments stores sell it.</li>
            <li> Ok, they want me to use at least 20 words...</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that Amazon is selling this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft scented for daytime use.  </li>
            <li> Deciding this was just too much for tiny bottles of cologne, I landed upon this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is soft, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I was nervous the scent may be off but compared to the old bottle he had, they smelled identical.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;ll still get a whiff of this classy scent for hours after application.  </li>
            <li> I always prefer this perfume nearly it&#x27;s been 3 yrs</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy directly from manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and really enjoy the compliments I have been getting.</li>
            <li> far as the scent goes?  </li>
            <li> IT IS OLD SCHOOL.</li>
            <li> there is something about that gentle sky blue color.</li>
            <li> then the smell is completely gone.</li>
            <li> This smells great.....clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 year old son.</li>
            <li> I get compliments frequently when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I have gotten my product so early</li>
            <li> this product help for complete anything.</li>
            <li> Is soft and dont disturb, but dont surprise anyone.</li>
            <li> I gave five stares because it was a gift for my 12 year old nephew and lord</li>
            <li> how ever it is a Young Mans smell, I would not wear it to work or anything, just my thoughts</li>
            <li> Smells a bit heavy, overwhelming &amp; regular drugstore quality men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> I would definitely wear it at a nice dinner date that ends with a slow dance.</li>
            <li> da item was good but the invoice said a price that was totally wrong-</li>
            <li> It lasts a good amount of time -- still faint after ~8 hours.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last the whole day, but decent enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for casual wear, too!</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed, but then realized just looking at the design of the box and bottle that this cologne was meant recreate the crisp, clean, and fresh scent coming from the ocean.</li>
            <li> This stuff reminds me of a more subtle Chrome by Azzaro.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle scent, it give a sense of maturity and the ladies like</li>
            <li> Nautica Blue (this product) is not to be mistakened with Nautica Classic (teal in color).  </li>
            <li> All of the scents I had smelled in the past were incredibly potent and all smelled too similar to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I expected it to be as nice as the $50 a bottle stuff, it just isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you can try blue voyage or classic..</li>
            <li> I wish it lasted a little longer though, but not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought based on reviews but struggle to see why reviews are so high outside of the price.</li>
            <li> I found this for super cheap on Amazon and decided to make this a blind buy after reading some reviews about it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is good for casual, everyday use, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> so may some one please send me a new invoice with the proper price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very citrus like and dry just like the women&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> The Nautica Blue smelled like someone had emptied the real product and substituted blue mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> Last pretty long because you don&#x27;t need a lot.  </li>
            <li> They say you get what you pay for, however in comparison with prices of other colognes that I have used, This was completely worth the price, the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long, its a plain, fresh, crisp smell,  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just like the other regulars out there until people started asking me what I had on.</li>
            <li> I ordered it due to price tag which beats its essence, won&#x27;t recommend if you really want to out-stand the crowd!</li>
            <li> From the outside, the baby blue color is vibrant and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do not know it, it is a fresh, clean smelling, casual sport fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I looked at this same product at a local Big Box store and as you all know, the prices at retail locations are very high.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing particularly bad about the product but nothing great too - Just the usual sweet smell which lingers away in a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy the smell and only need it on for a small amount of time I would reccommend.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for apparently.</li>
            <li> think next time I might get old spice because it reminds me of my dad.</li>
            <li> far then the smaller store bought bottles I purchase.</li>
            <li> I am surprised something fulfilled by Amazon can be of such inferior quality.</li>
            <li> This one would barely hold up for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old and this is the only product I used for over 2 years</li>
            <li> I have purchased expensive colognes for a long time and this one has no where near the lasting qualities of good colognes.  </li>
            <li> Listen to me, i would rather go buy the brand new item with a scent that lasts long and can be smelt farther than one inch away from where aplied.</li>
            <li> all of that the smell or the fragrance is absolutely nothing, I don&#x27;t know what it smells like other than maybe&lt;</li>
            <li> dont waste your money,,, very weak high karate smells better ,,,my first and last cologne buy online save your money,,</li>
            <li> Three direct sprays to the skin will only last ~10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> As an adult, I was given the gift of Nautica Blue, which brought me back to childhood memories.  </li>
            <li> great for everyday, weekends and casual use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong nor weak.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, not to weak.</li>
            <li> It is very weak, and its a fragrance that reminds me of my days when I didn&#x27;t have much cash and bought cheap knock-offs you would find only in variety stores.  </li>
            <li> Its cheap and smells good but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyday use as it may start to feel annoying with time.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Bod Man costs about half as much for twice the quantity.</li>
            <li> It is mild enough to not appear like you are trying to hard</li>
            <li> The bottle packaging everything is what I would expect, however the scent is not long lasting disappears in a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Similar scent to Nautica blue, but not as sweet, not as delicate.</li>
            <li> Some higher quality scents will easily last throughout the day, even if just a very slight lingering scent.  </li>
            <li> but this perfume doesn&#x27;t smell anything @ all or very cheap fake perfume ..</li>
            <li> The scent is different than the same brand in the past and does not linger for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> He compared the little bit of cologne he had left in his old bottle to the cologne in this new bottle and they are VERY different.</li>
            <li> This is a pure waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it is my new \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, early I might add, I tore open the box and pumped out just a little and like WOW this stuff is just yummy</li>
            <li> A good casual and everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li> OK for casual use.</li>
            <li> I have actually tried it for the first time this morning, and 4 hours later, I can hardly detect a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve tried the classic Nautica fragrance a few years back and don&#x27;t remember being &#x27;too&#x27; blown away by it</li>
            <li> However, I must say it does stain the skin quite well and lasts for a long time; only it is such a shame that it stains with such offense.  </li>
            <li> Does not last as long as say Aramis, but only a 3rd of the price.</li>
            <li> only downscale is that its quite weak and will wear off too quickly.</li>
            <li> its only 17 bucks.. but not sure if it the Real thing..</li>
            <li> Nautica \\&quot;Voyage\\&quot; has the subtle smell of melons and fresh cotton canvas.  </li>
            <li> the only thing i don&#x27;t like about the cologne is that&lt;br /&gt;the scent doesn&#x27;t last long when you spray some on.</li>
            <li> It smells different, and this one from Amazon does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> For the price though, it&#x27;s a decent everyday scent.</li>
            <li> After a long day of work, I can still smell it on my husband and mixed with his scent...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last long ..</li>
            <li> Does not really last long on skin, but all day on shirt.</li>
            <li> But this one, the scent did not last a long time.</li>
            <li> lasts long enough.</li>
            <li> this will last for long time....</li>
            <li> but my issue with this is the scent doesn&#x27;t last long IMO.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance does not last long</li>
            <li> Good, really disappointed about my purchase, because my perfume arrived the destination party and make complaints about it</li>
            <li> Albeit I am a little picky when it comes to men&#x27;s cologne, that being said this smells like any old run of the mill cologne in my opinion!</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> Plus when I received this the box was half torn off, so the sender just didn&#x27;t care to look professional.</li>
            <li> The only thing that sucks is that it wears off fast, but it&#x27;s an EDT</li>
            <li> You had negative and positive thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Since I cannot prove it, I can only say that I&#x27;m with the other reviewers that suspect that this cologne may not be a legit Nautica Blue.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I noticed is that, it does not last as long as other sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> The only problem that I noticed is that, it does not last as long as other sprays he has.</li>
            <li> It is relitively high quality, but not good for bussiness, better for casual.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay long, but you&#x27;ll forget bout that when you remember its price</li>
            <li> The scent does not stick on skin too long and therefore must be reapplied.</li>
            <li> Although, I have observed that the fragrance on the skin (hand/neck) does not hold all day long</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t lasts that long.</li>
            <li> It was rather strange...</li>
            <li> I saw this while looking for a gift for my middle aged Dad.</li>
            <li> However, doesn&#x27;t long too-long, but not an issue.</li>
            <li> lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell for a long time</li>
            <li> There is a slight fragrance when I put it on, but ten minutes or so later there is no smell at all.  </li>
            <li> A few of them noted that the scent is not long lasting at all.</li>
            <li> Alas, I will go back to the Classic and use the Blue for perhaps a desk ornament.</li>
            <li> He suggested I re-gifted it to my husband, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to as I am very sensitive to scents and was afraid it was going to be too strong and just flat out crap.</li>
            <li> Nautica scent stays on all day long, even on his clothing when he gets home from work, I can still smell it!</li>
            <li> My other bottle was from Nautica and the smell would last all day.</li>
            <li> I had tried other Nautica products in the past, but not this particular one.</li>
            <li> I have owned several other more expensive cologns in the past that couldn&#x27;t compare to this.</li>
            <li> Bought this from Amazon, had no problems as usual and was the real thing, expected nothing less.  </li>
            <li> Not very strong but definitely not Cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but Nautica Blue is way too sweet and artificial for me.</li>
            <li> The cologne smells like weak candy and smells nothing like the real thing.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great but the product is very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is complete waste of money and it seems that they have filled the blue color water in the bottle and then shipped.completely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the price makes up for it a little, it would have gotten 5 stars if it were longer lasting.</li>
            <li> but we just put the cologne in a regular little spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would smell like cheap dollar store man.</li>
            <li> be carefull you could fall in love with a ugly man if he wears this perfume....</li>
            <li> be carefull you could fall in love with a ugly man if he wears this perfume....</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m currently trying to finish up my sporty fragrances, before making this my everyday cologne.</li>
            <li> So - why not just send an empty box and stop the tomfoolery.  </li>
            <li> Cologne has never really agreed with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> initially it lasted for few mins..</li>
            <li> I keep this cologne in my car in the center console just in case</li>
            <li> the product was exactly as i expected.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints</li>
            <li> I am not much of a cologne guy</li>
            <li> and I am not ready to change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled some men&#x27;s colognes and sprays that made me gag because they were so heavy and musky - this is definitely not one of those.</li>
            <li> But I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Nautica has never really been for me</li>
            <li> Worse comes to worse, I end up with 2 bottles of one of my favorite scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cologne is as I described in two words: strong and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> The cologne got everywhere and unfortunately due to biohazard (no really) restrictions</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the subtle spell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> I agree with some other reviews.</li>
            <li> I would go for other brands when they go on sale.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaper than Rohypnol!</li>
            <li> This product is not ok and it wont last..........................</li>
            <li> The other 2 I bought have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not authentic Nautica Blue.</li>
            <li> This is a cologne that brings back my past.</li>
            <li> Sprayed it on my chest, used my wrist to spread the excess around on neck and other wrist.  </li>
            <li> My shirt on the other hand held onto it</li>
            <li> and it is cheaper than any other store....</li>
            <li> This cologne has a top that is dangerous, you cant hardly find out where he product is dispensed which could hit you in the eye.  </li>
            <li> After an hour or so, you just have this pale, bland finish, and itâ€™s such a let down.</li>
            <li> I believe this cologne I purchased is an imitation liquid.</li>
            <li> The smell of this fragrance is difficult for me to compare to real world smells.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not powerful nor musky, doesn&#x27;t make people run away, but rather draw them in a bit.</li>
            <li> A down side is the scent will die down quicker.</li>
            <li> I was not let down in that aspect.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon, but this seems like a watered down  perfume.</li>
            <li> , I donâ€™t like the way it dries down.</li>
            <li> This cologne was not watered down or tampered with in any way.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these when the pricing was down to $11 or so.</li>
            <li> I bought this product previously and when it arrives i tried it on</li>
            <li> I put it on, but less  than an hour there is no smell at all.</li>
            <li> to be slightly stronger.should put that in description.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have typical men cologne.</li>
            <li> Plus I use it for all occasions both classic and casual.</li>
            <li> all wrong is that the smell does not last long</li>
            <li> Got it for a little under 13 USD.  </li>
            <li> I found it a little cheaper on Amazon than it was at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I want something like this that wears off a little</li>
            <li> You should not have to filled this stupid box out.  </li>
            <li> The bottle itself, although an interesting shape, I find difficult to maneuver and awkward to hold, but thankfully that doesn&#x27;t detract from the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I was at a dinner party a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> My hubbie wears this scent for everyday application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one fragrance you can consider for a young boy who&#x27;s never owned one before, and at the price of $15, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Could not smell it a few minutes after spraying.</li>
            <li> I use this for everyday application.</li>
            <li> The smell is gone in few seconds.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smells harsh.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it for everyday use and would consider gifting to a friend or family.</li>
            <li> Works for everyday</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t run the risk of hitting someone with a heavy wave of perfume.</li>
            <li> , I will not use this, just a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this seller.</li>
            <li> Brought couple of these perfumes, Its a piece of junk , Please don&#x27;t buy and waste your money&lt;</li>
            <li> You should probably keep it in your car and spray it immediately before you step out, that way other people can at least get a whiff of you before the smell all goes where, i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> My ex girlfriend used to say she loves it, because, is not a strong that you can feel it at distance, but, yes when get close to me, so is discrete.</li>
            <li> but usually it is expensive but from here you get to pay less for the same thing.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya!  </li>
            <li> this one had no musk and very little flowery additive.</li>
            <li> I usually use nautica spray.</li>
            <li> Works well for those &#x27;too late to shower&#x27; mornings and the smell lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> but it was only faint.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually a 1-3 sprays type of guy.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased with the smell.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve worn this scent and it just doesn&#x27;t stay with me.</li>
            <li> And I use it daily for casual use.</li>
            <li> so I use it daily for office and casual evening use just to smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> it was hard to pass up.</li>
            <li> The container, even though eleganly shaped, is a bit hard to hold for use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but I don&#x27;t like the smell when it changes.  </li>
            <li> not last long&lt;br /&gt;-Weird bottle design that makes it hard to spray (awkward holding position)</li>
            <li> That is the only disappointing thing about it.</li>
            <li> it is such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have like at least 20 sitting in my room.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for my hubby for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s only $15, yo can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Yes I really mean seconds.  </li>
            <li> I mean I read the description</li>
            <li> I still use this every once in a while when I get tired of the usual frags I use.</li>
            <li> I seriously leave it in my truck and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, there is no scent at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s not good for it</li>
            <li> This is just plain fake.</li>
            <li> at least i do!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a little disappointed in it, because the scent wears off within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the 3.4Oz bottle and for the price, it&#x27;s tough to beat.</li>
            <li> Thanks in advance for removing this stupid and senseless requirements!</li>
            <li> it has poor craftmanship</li>
            <li> smell lasted for approximately a whopping 10min.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t cracked or broken or leaking</li>
            <li> he got tired of me going into his things</li>
            <li> Who knows, maybe my nose is broken.  </li>
            <li> Not a great buy from a brand like Nautica.</li>
            <li> Seriously try this!</li>
            <li> i am not a strict person about perfume and i purchased this and the classic one of this brand, both of them are just horrible!</li>
            <li> but when I smell it, it leaves a little bit of a bad aftersmell in my nose</li>
            <li> This fragrance is completely mad, cloying, potentially disastrous, monstrously projective, disturbingly edible, and a general masterpiece.</li>
            <li> Bought this product yesterday and was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne about two weeks ago and it is very weak.  </li>
            <li> lasts all day long but the bottle shape might be a bit awkward to handle!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought it but after using it</li>
            <li> so of course I was skeptical to order it online</li>
            <li> Others noted that they may have gotten a fake bottle.</li>
            <li> , still have a lot of the product in container &amp; since the spray mechanism no longer works, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> It came just as described and it was in a sealed box and package, no signs of anything wrong.</li>
            <li> This is fake it does not smell like cologne whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> think this cologne gives me a weird aura of uncharacteristic confidence, whereby all women, imagined and otherwise, want me.  </li>
            <li> and i found it was a fake product sold by amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I felt its a Fake one.</li>
            <li> fake fake Fake</li>
            <li> it almost makes me think i received a fake bottle</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> My friend is obsessed with this scent-</li>
            <li> Fake ... Please do not buy...</li>
            <li> When I woke up this morning I could just faintly smell it on my wrist.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product either dropped substantially in quality, the seller now has the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; cologne, or one of my purchases was a fluke.</li>
            <li> I think its fake.</li>
            <li> the price is well, thought it&#x27;s not a perfect product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake one and does&#x27;nt smell at all.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I think you know how expensive cologne and perfume is</li>
            <li> This bottle is a weird shape which makes it difficult to place on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Past</li>
            <li> I rate this product is very poor, looks like product is not geniune,Recommend not to buy any perfume from this vendor</li>
            <li> The worst characteristic is that the smell starts to change as it fades away.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other fragrances in this price range ($15-30) but very disappointed by their flowery smell.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product and extremely embarrassed since this was a gift.</li>
            <li> (but seriously, date rape is a serious, awful thing</li>
            <li> and i can not even return it because it is restrictive product (containing chemicals that are flammable or dangerous).</li>
            <li> He loves this cologne and unfortunately when he received this one, he was well disappointed.</li>
            <li> Turns out I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the bad reviews here</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so bad anyway.</li>
            <li> The bad thing is shipping, it&#x27;s considered as HAZMAT and is shipped that way.  </li>
            <li> NOTHING BAD TO DECLARE.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Feel like I am wearing a real expensive perfume..</li>
            <li> But was disappointed. :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My family removed themselves from the room I sprayed it in when I opened the Amazon box. :-(</li>
            <li> except i hate theses rating surveys</li>
            <li> Horrible fake, do not buy!</li>
            <li> Was not whether the seller or those carrying my product to the address provided, but the fact is that no one on Amazon responded to my complaints, very, very bad.</li>
            <li> The perfume is ok.&lt;br /&gt;However the packaging was very bad and the box was damaged on arrival, so even that could broke the perfume</li>
            <li> really disappointed!</li>
            <li> Try it; you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the product.  </li>
            <li> Terrible sprayer, broke after a 3-4 months of usage</li>
            <li> Plus, spending upwards of $80 for a bottle of cologne seemed outrageous to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can say, this is the worst purchase that i&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> The box had terrible packaging and the two bottles I ordered were brokenupon arrival.  </li>

            <li> Does not stay on for long, or it would have received 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Great perfume... for 3-4 hours :p</li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 year old son for his first cologne.  It has a nice smell and would be great for any man</li>
            <li> the product arrived safely&lt;br /&gt;excellent quality&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s an ok cologne. I bought it for my son but I wouldn&#x27;t get it for a man if I was buying a gift to impress. It&#x27;s a bit sweet and weak.&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that will knock your socks off, buy Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana It&#x27;s not cheap but well worth it. It&#x27;s very citrus like and dry just like the women&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> Got it for a little under 13 USD.  It smells fantastic!  The scent lasts for 10 minutes at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?  No.</li>
            <li> The bottle is lovely for a gift for a man. It is large and creative. Smells very good for the price and the amount is wonderfuly. Beautiful box.</li>
            <li> I checked Nautica Blue for Men at the mall, they are over $50 dollars with free gift purchase. I do not need free gift and have no used for it. I did price check at at Marshall, they had 1.7 fl. oz bottle for $14. I purchased one from Amazon at the same price with Marshall, except that it&#x27;s even better with 3.4 fl. oz. This is a remarkable deal.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend to any wives or girlfriends to purchase for their men. It&#x27;s not too strong like Banana Republic cologne that sometimes I had to back away from men who wearing such strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> oh well, like most of the other people here have said - it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin for too long. but on the shirt its fine.</li>
            <li> My hubby really likes this one, its cheap and smells good.  He wears it to work all the time and he says that they always ask him what he is wearing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that is perfect for a mature gent.  It doesn&#x27;t have a flowery or fruity scent.  I previously bought this scent at a Nautica outlet store and paid quite a bit more than what I paid at Amazon.  I think I prefer the non spray version of the cologne.</li>
            <li> It totally worth it! nice fragrance. not to strong but not soft! You can use this EDT for almost all situations..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable. What more can I say? Ok, they want me to use at least 20 words... It&#x27;s affordable! Not the best cologne out there by any stretch of one&#x27;s imagination, but does represent a good bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I would not buy perfume again from amz. I doubt the authenticity of the product I received.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is better to buy at local perfumania</li>
            <li> Actually, if you wanna buy a cologne with a low price and good scent, I do recommend this one. It doesn&#x27;t stay long, but you&#x27;ll forget bout that when you remember its price</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother and he was really happy with this. it has a great smell and a good amount.</li>
            <li> i guess what do you expect for cologne that is only around 15 dollars? it smells great but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I gave this perfume as a gift to my husband and he loves it. Amazon shipping was fast. Thank You amazon.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve tried the classic Nautica fragrance a few years back and don&#x27;t remember being &#x27;too&#x27; blown away by it but this stuff is just awesome.  It isn&#x27;t overwhelming and has a light, yet very enjoyable aroma.  I seriously leave it in my truck and use it all the time.  Maybe that&#x27;s not good for it but I love using a spray or two before I go wherever I&#x27;m headed.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the bad reviews here and how they describe the scent and began to ask myself, \\&quot;why did they buy this in the first place?\\&quot; I found this for super cheap on Amazon and decided to make this a blind buy after reading some reviews about it. The reviews from other sites mentioned it was a more sophisticated version of Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water, but it really isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this home and decided to try it on, thinking it might have notes of citrus, but this cologne is nothing but an aquatic. At first I was disappointed, but then realized just looking at the design of the box and bottle that this cologne was meant recreate the crisp, clean, and fresh scent coming from the ocean. It&#x27;s fresh, aquatic, and has a hint of blueberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently trying to finish up my sporty fragrances, before making this my everyday cologne. I still use this every once in a while when I get tired of the usual frags I use. It&#x27;s great, and for the price - who can complain?</li>
            <li> It was a good buy for the price. The colonel is not that strong ( at least not to me)Smells good and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a smaller 1oz bottle at rite aid for $30 and I bought a 3.4 oz from here for $16 was damn cheap!</li>
            <li> Good price. The cologne is the same that you would purchase at regular stores.</li>
            <li> A great buy on Amazon for such a peculiar fragrance. Very fresh! I strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a very good scent. It has a fresh,clean smell that I love on my boyfriend. He absolutely loves this cologne.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought it but after using it I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone in my office liked it and I gonna replace Euphoria by this for daily use.</li>
            <li> After reading lot reviews about Nautica Blue for Men, I tried my luck. But the fragrance is not staying long, nor it&#x27;s strong, which may be good for some. To me, it didn&#x27;t soothe much and I will not order/buy from anywhere again. I&#x27;ll finish off the 3.4 Oz bottle. I&#x27;ll go back to Perry Ellis red.</li>
            <li> Love, love, loooove this scent. The amazon price is to die for. Everyone should buy at least one, specially for the Holidays, you never know if your gonna be missing one present; and this one will be an excellent option!</li>
            <li> This product is most definitely a knock off and not the real thing, the smell is strong on the alcohol and it does not last that long.</li>
            <li> Bought this from Amazon, had no problems as usual and was the real thing, expected nothing less.  Great deal for the price, good long-lasting fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this cologne. I have had it before and I&#x27;ve never seen it so inexpensive. so of course I was skeptical to order it online but I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely based on the reviews from Amazon. A few of them noted that the scent is not long lasting at all. Others noted that they may have gotten a fake bottle. Since this is my first experience with this, I cannot be sure that the bottle I got was real or fake because I have nothing to compare it to. I can say that it came perfectly sealed with no damage to the box at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that the smell only lasts about 2 hours. That is the only disappointing thing about it. Other than that, it is my new \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; scent. I really like the smell of it. I am half tempted to go out to a department store and get a bottle of this and compare the 2 just to be sure that they are the same. Worse comes to worse, I end up with 2 bottles of one of my favorite scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the price makes up for it a little, it would have gotten 5 stars if it were longer lasting.</li>
            <li> Terrible sprayer, broke after a 3-4 months of usage, still have a lot of the product in container &amp; since the spray mechanism no longer works, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> This cologne is as I described in two words: strong and unpleasant.  Nautica Blue (this product) is not to be mistakened with Nautica Classic (teal in color).  I&#x27;ve used the Classic before and smells a lot more subtle, fresh, and does not attack the nose, unlike the Blue.  I wanted to test this one, and let&#x27;s just say, I&#x27;m glad it was only 15 dollars for it is not possible to return flammable liquids.  However, I must say it does stain the skin quite well and lasts for a long time; only it is such a shame that it stains with such offense.  Alas, I will go back to the Classic and use the Blue for perhaps a desk ornament.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great, I&#x27;m happy I bought it for the low price Amazon was selling it for! Will buy again when I run out</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the heck of it, just to try it out. This cologne is the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; but as soon as i opened i could tell this wasnt the same high quality item you could buy in a department store. It doesnt have a strong scent at all, the scent barely lasts. This must be an expired tester scent that they couldnt sell in stores anymore. Listen to me, i would rather go buy the brand new item with a scent that lasts long and can be smelt farther than one inch away from where aplied. Dont waste your money. Not even worth 16 bucks.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this particular spray by Nautica. It reminds me of the fresh clean shower smell after I used an a particular shampoo/conditioner. The only problem that I noticed is that, it does not last as long as other sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Smells great&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t have to be thrifty when spraying&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Does not last long&lt;br /&gt;-Weird bottle design that makes it hard to spray (awkward holding position)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cologne for the price. I dont have much thing to say about this, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I arrived in perfect condition, is at a great price and is a traditional perfume takes years and is good</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that Blue was going to be so pleasant.  I am always getting great compliments about it.</li>
            <li> Great value product. It came just as described and it was in a sealed box and package, no signs of anything wrong. Would buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> The scent is different than the same brand in the past and does not linger for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Me gusta mucho esta fragancia, muy economica y muy buena, es suave y no me da alergia. El producto llego en buenas condiciones. La recomiendo</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon. I actually just wanted to point out that although this cologne smells good when you initially put it on, it barely lasts. I would have to spray 4-5 sprays on before class, and felt like it was gone an hour or two later. It&#x27;s cheap, so you can afford to do it I suppose, but I&#x27;ve gotten much better results (and ultimately, comments from girls :P) with other cheap colognes (for example, adidas moves comes to mind). Not buying this, and trying chrome legend for the first time instead.</li>
            <li> entrega al d&amp;iacute;a mercanc&amp;iacute;a en buen estado responsables los productos que uno compra son los que env&amp;iacute;an tal cual como se hace el pedido</li>
            <li> This is fake it does not smell like cologne whatsoever.  There is no possible way I could wear this it also gave me a headache.  No wonder it is so cheap.  Last time I buy cologne off the internet, Im off to the dept store now.</li>
            <li> This is just plain fake. I didn&#x27;t expect the real thing for so cheap, but this is just blue water in a bottle. Seriously, there is no scent at all. All I smell is the seller laughing at the people buying fancy bottles of water. Horrible fake, do not buy!</li>
            <li> I know it is cheap I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so bad anyway. I cannot stand it at all.</li>
            <li> This parfum is just great, and it makes us remember the ocean&#x27;s fragrance (I don&#x27;t know why, but it does)!</li>
            <li> Sexy fragrance, for a man !!!</li>
            <li> Got from american fragrance, nice packaging and it&#x27;s smell could&#x27;nt be nicer..nice smell,nice packaging,delivery as it is,delvery as planned,value for money..so 5 star..another great seller from Amazon..</li>
            <li> I purchased this for everyday use. Figured that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to purchase a $14 Spray because even if I don&#x27;t like it, wouldn&#x27;t pinch me. As expected, the shipping was on spot and amazing as always. The spray itself smells really nice and fresh. I liked it instantly. The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last longer than an two hour or two. My Deodorant lasts much longer than this.. heh.. can&#x27;t compare but still. Anyways, this is a nice spray if you want to try out the fragrance and require it for short duration, but wouldn&#x27;t bet on it to last long.</li>
            <li> To everyone, please do not buy this product. I am sure this is fake. I was really surprised that Amazon is selling this. I have used the same spray before, but this one will last for about 15 minutes. I do not understand how it gets a four star ratting. I guess you get what u have paid for. Really disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was at a dinner party a few weeks ago.  I took a sip of egg nog and heard a woman whisper in my ear, \\&quot;What a stunning sense of intrigue you have.\\&quot;  I turned around and no one was there aside from my mother and her geriatric friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later that night I made my way home in a station wagon rental.  As I waited at a traffic light, a naked woman on a horse curled her finger, motioning me to follow her.  I ended up at a 7-Eleven and bought some salty snacks.  She wasn&#x27;t inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this cologne gives me a weird aura of uncharacteristic confidence, whereby all women, imagined and otherwise, want me.  It smells good too.</li>
            <li> I agree with some other reviews. The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long. I have had the Nautica \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; before and it is a much better product. Even for how cheap this bottle of \\&quot;Blue\\&quot; is, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow what a great deal! Smells good, wife is happy, i am happy, the whole block seems to be happy, and this is well worth the money paid! It was like walking into the store that had this product on sale for 75% off!</li>
            <li> i bought this as a present for a man I know- I thought- why not it&#x27;s 10 dollars- and whenever we get together he thanks me for it- but never wears it- I guess its a distinct smell.</li>
            <li> Love this for my husband.  It&#x27;s light and sexy.  This is the second year that I have given him this for Christmas. Much better price for it here at Amazon than in the department store.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001CT0AGC Nautica Blue By Nautica For Men Edt Spray 3.4 Oz]]I really liked this fragrance was a gift that the person who gave it likes, and that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is completely mad, cloying, potentially disastrous, monstrously projective, disturbingly edible, and a general masterpiece. Some of my friends love it, some of them abhor it. My mother can smell it from 30 feet away, and after she runs away, she can still smell it 60ft away. This thing is not a joke, but if it suits you, then it shouldn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Bought this product yesterday and was a little disappointed. I was expecting a little better product from Nautica but for the price (~ $15) it is ok. There is nothing particularly bad about the product but nothing great too - Just the usual sweet smell which lingers away in a couple of hours. Alright for daily use.</li>
            <li> We ordered two fragrances from Amazon.  The Nautica Blue smelled like someone had emptied the real product and substituted blue mouthwash.  The Charlie Blue sprayer stopped working after about four sprays.  So I figure for sure we can get this straightened out with Amazon, never had any problems before.  I&#x27;m a Prime member for 2 years.  But - the catch is they can send them out but they can&#x27;t be returned.  So - why not just send an empty box and stop the tomfoolery.  This is the last Health and Beauty item we&#x27;ll purchase on-line from anybody.  Why not state the no-return policy up front.</li>
            <li> The smell of this fragrance is difficult for me to compare to real world smells. It&#x27;s a clean, masculine smell that is not overpowering. It is great for an every day fragrance. A fragrance that I would associate with a guy from age 20-35. Bright, clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li> I always buy my husband this for his BD. This is the cheapest I have found it! Awesome!</li>
            <li> USING THIS WEEK I HAVE A PERFUME, THE SMELL IS VERY GOOD CAN NOT DENY, BUT APART FROM THE IDEA IS THAT SMELL FEEL Aunq NO TIME IS THE ONE?&lt;br /&gt;WHAT YOU ADD THIS PERFUME AND 10 MINUTES, AND DOES NOT FEEL ANYTHING, IF YOUR CLOTHES IN PUTTING THE NOSE.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON TOTAL PURCHASED BY DECEPTION $ 15 we can not ask a lot &#x3D; s</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for the first time and don&#x27;t like it too much. I will not buy it again and instead will buy Diesel or Oscar de la Renta. You can try it and see if you like it.</li>
            <li> its not often that you get a premium brand for such an amazing price.. i got mine for around 10$ and have never regretted it since.. smells great lasts long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: if you do wear a white shirt and decide to have some on your shirt you could see a light stain.. but you need to be looking very closely to see it</li>
            <li> Very nice, but faint fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sporty perfume....stays for a long time..not very different or unusual smell but yes a gud one...makes u feel fresh.</li>
            <li> REALMENTE, EL PRODUCTO NO PUEDO CALIFICARLO ,PORQUE NO ME LLEGO,ME ENVIARON EL PRODUCTO EQUIVOCADO ( SPLASH DE VICTORIA SECRET)POR EL PERFUME ,EN ESTE CASO EL VENDEDOR NO SE ASEGURO DE ENVIAR EL PEDIDO DESEADO.</li>
            <li> GENUINE AND HONEST SELLER, SUPER FAST SHIPPING, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, AAA+++</li>
            <li> I bought this product previously and when it arrives i tried it on and i found it was a fake product sold by amazon. its scent gone after a minute you spray.</li>
            <li> The spray I received may not be original, I could smell it for only for an hour or so..I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting this here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The smell goes away pretty quickly, so you&#x27;re going to have to reapply it quite a bit if you want to keep the scent.  My girlfriend likes it though :)</li>
            <li> This cologne just smells too damn good!! For all you men out there (and women) starting your own fragrance collection, please purchase this product. You will not be disappointed. It smells so delicious ðŸ˜‹.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for a dear cousin of mine but he ended up buying himself a fresh bottle right before my purchase. He suggested I re-gifted it to my husband, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to as I am very sensitive to scents and was afraid it was going to be too strong and just flat out crap. To my surprise, it&#x27;s absolutely sweet and soft smelling with just enough musk. After a long day of work, I can still smell it on my husband and mixed with his scent... yum! Don&#x27;t miss out on this one!</li>
            <li> Thx for expediting the shipment...Wondering if the gift message that I had written for this message is in the box ..I dont; want to open &amp; tear the wrapper .&lt;br /&gt;Let me know&lt;br /&gt;Thx</li>
            <li> When I orderd this I thought it would be smaller but it was 8oz. Just right. When I run out 8oz is the way to go. Thanks. Joe.</li>
            <li> I like it alot, It smells great and the price just beckoned me so there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I love myself :)</li>
            <li> wow! Nautica Blue sells for 65 bucks! Not on Amazon! It&#x27;s just 15 bucks! What a savings! This price is out the door hot! My hubbie is so happy. It&#x27;s soft scented for daytime use.  After he sprayed this on,the scent was very fresh and clean. My hubbie wears this scent for everyday application.I received this Nautica item wrapped in clear cellophane, as the departments stores sell it. Nautica scent stays on all day long, even on his clothing when he gets home from work, I can still smell it! You gotta get this and try it!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne after reading all the reviews from others.  Of course, not everyone had the same opinion.  You had negative and positive thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;Well i took chances and ordered the item.&lt;br /&gt;My opinion on this scent is that it smells fresh, cool, and it feels like you&#x27;re near the ocean.  Very nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;But the only thing i don&#x27;t like about the cologne is that&lt;br /&gt;the scent doesn&#x27;t last long when you spray some on.</li>
            <li> The price is great and you get a lot for what you pay for. This is a product that I use on a daily bases. It smells great!</li>
            <li> I got this for my Father and he just got it today, He loves it and says my Mom loves it on him.</li>
            <li> I got this online for my dad and my husband has already tried and liked it. Its a nice subtle tone and this amazon price online makes it even better.</li>
            <li> This is for my boy friend. He said that it was good . He like it . He was very happy for getting it .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong it smells awesome. But this stuff does not last at all. I wear all different kinds of cologne and this one smells great.  Yet it does not last longer than 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for less than $15 with free shipping!  I bought this as a gift, so I do not have much to compare it to since I do not wear Nautica, but I do not think you can find a better price for this cologne.  I was happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I searched for the best deal and this is it!!  The order even came in two days!!  Got to love that!</li>
            <li> This bottle was huge and for really cheap price. I was so happy to get for a low price, and it smells great too</li>
            <li> Nice price and my hubby likes it.  Don&#x27;t need much or it is too overpowering.  A little dab will do ya!  Last pretty long because you don&#x27;t need a lot.  The scent stays and stays!</li>
            <li> Awesome everyday use without sacrificing big bucks.</li>
            <li> Item bought as a gift for someone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nothing but All-of-Bests. All the way from Kanya-Kuwari to Kashmir, and from Kuttcha to Assam, Sikkim, Nagaland, and Burma.</li>
            <li> I usually use nautica spray. I like the smell of this one (blue).  I love it so much :) .</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this cologne. As others have said it is purely an aqua. It is a very nice scent for the summer, but is not too strong. I actually like this. The scent does not stick on skin too long and therefore must be reapplied. At under $15 it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> a great spray for a real good fragrent u will love this this product I order this spary a lot</li>
            <li> Have worn this for several days now, and I wonder if my bottle is a knock off or if this just doesn&#x27;t have a smell. There is a slight fragrance when I put it on, but ten minutes or so later there is no smell at all.  Anyone else experience this?</li>
            <li> dont waste your money,,, very weak high karate smells better ,,,my first and last cologne buy online save your money,,</li>
            <li> Like many others have posted, this was a blind buy for me, because of the size and the price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I am used to spending 20$ on 1.7 oz bottles from Aerpostale, American Eagle, and Hollister. Deciding this was just too much for tiny bottles of cologne, I landed upon this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great. It&#x27;s a great clean smell, not too stout or overly sweet or bitter. I will be using this every day, and recommend this to anyone wanting a very great prized cologne.</li>
            <li> It smells a little cheap but it&#x27;s ok for the price. I would go for other brands when they go on sale.</li>
            <li> I like the scent a lot. So does my girlfriend....and my mom (hah im 16). I would recommend it to people of all ages, the scent isnt too mature or too young, its a good cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> For $15 you get a nice, clean and fresh cologne that last long and I say it again, it&#x27;s only $15, yo can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Buying my second one today. Bought it off amazon after it was the best selling item in Amazon and for the price, why not? At first I thought it was just like the other regulars out there until people started asking me what I had on. Was told it smelled really good. Honestly I couldn&#x27;t smell it myself(maybe i got used to the stuffs) but that&#x27;s the whole point i think, to smell good for others. Honestly though, I could still smell the scent the next when I pick up my clothes to wash. Plus for that price, I cant really complain.</li>
            <li> like i said. its only 17 bucks.. but not sure if it the Real thing.. but oh well... i checkd out the retail stores..same one runs for about $30</li>
            <li> I saw this on Amazon and it is very cheap, before i made my order i read some reviews some reviewers said that this is a knock off/fake, and some are positive reviews, so i give a try, when my order arrive surprise! its a knock off!before i smell the content looking at the bottle you can say that this is a knock off it has poor craftmanship the glass has some defects, ok assuming that maybe they are selling this cheap because of this, when i tried the EDT sprayed on my body it doesnt last an hour and i sprayed alot, oh well what do you expect buying this cheap?I like to buy on Amazon but will and never buy again perfumes on them.</li>
            <li> I like the smell. And I use it daily for casual use. Its cheap and really good and i have got compliments too. Finally a good one for medium price.</li>
            <li> The scent is very crisp and clean, my only problem with the product is that the scent does not have much staying power.  Some higher quality scents will easily last throughout the day, even if just a very slight lingering scent.  This scent fades significantly in the first few hours, and is completely gone by the end of a work day.</li>
            <li> Hard to say -- I&#x27;ve had good reports of this from others, but i can&#x27;t quite tell myself -- it&#x27;s one of those fragrances that, the&lt;br /&gt;moment you put it on, it disappears.  For the amount you pay, you receive quite a bit, so... good enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK cologne, you get what you pay for I suppose. It smells good, nothing special. I&#x27;d probably pay a little more and buy a better cologne.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and my brother stated he enjoys it very much.  I&#x27;ve purchased for myself prior and agree it&#x27;s a smooth not over powering smelling scent.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cologne to anyone,it&#x27;s gr8, flirty, wonderfully priced &amp; designed for the young or young at heart</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells very nice, but doesn&#x27;t last too terribly long. 4 star rating for the price! More than half off what it costed in a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> I tried this cologne based on its popularity here on Amazon and some of the raving reviews I have read.  I have actually tried it for the first time this morning, and 4 hours later, I can hardly detect a fragrance.  It is very weak, and its a fragrance that reminds me of my days when I didn&#x27;t have much cash and bought cheap knock-offs you would find only in variety stores.  It&#x27;s not bad, but when I first tried it this morning, the one thing I easily distinguished is that its cheap, and I am yet to identify the fragance with something of grandeur.  It feels (and smells) like a giant step down when I compare to my other fragrances that I wear regularly - like 212 Sexy, Live Jazz, Issey Miyake, Cool Water, Acqua di Gio, Emporio and Weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one fragrance you can consider for a young boy who&#x27;s never owned one before, and at the price of $15, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> IS VERY GOOD ORIGINAL FRAGANCE</li>
            <li> This is a good gift that&#x27;s not expensive. I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I recommend it. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> it is really refreshing i saw the ad on facebook so i bought it for my husband, he loved it and the price was fantastic, plus s&amp;h free........</li>
            <li> Shipping was great, reached sooner than expected. If you are a fan of mild scents, this is for you. Not a fan myself. Could not smell it a few minutes after spraying. Not my style, my preference is for a strong scent that lingers. Will not be getting again.</li>
            <li> Cologne has never really agreed with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a sensitivity to perfumes, colognes, and chemical scents (such as those you&#x27;d find in soap, shampoo, cleaners, etc), which in turn has prevented me from ever being interested in cologne. All of the scents I had smelled in the past were incredibly potent and all smelled too similar to me. Nothing was ever distinguishable. Plus, spending upwards of $80 for a bottle of cologne seemed outrageous to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this scent while shopping at a local Target store. I know that packaging is a big selling point for colognes and perfumes, and the shape and color of this one fascinated me. +1 for the marketing team of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a spray of this. After letting the initial burst dissipate for a few minutes, my nose was met by a refreshing scent that smells clean and fresh, but not overbearing. I came home and picked up a bottle from Amazon since it was so much cheaper here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have said, this is a great everyday scent that is affordable and won&#x27;t break the bank. I love being able to finally have a scent that I can call my own and feel confident about wearing it. The bottle itself, although an interesting shape, I find difficult to maneuver and awkward to hold, but thankfully that doesn&#x27;t detract from the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage you to try this product out at a local department store before purchasing. Everyone has his own preferences when it comes to products such as this, so trying it out before you buy it would be of great benefit to you and your wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally love this product, and would recommend it to any guy looking for a mild everyday scent. Blessings!</li>
            <li> loved it.not too strong.just perfect.it was my V&#x27;Day gift.vry happy that I gt it:-) i would recommend this to anyone...who does nt like those--almost killing..strong men&#x27;s perfumes!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. He is not a huge fan of colognes but he liked this one. It&#x27;s not too strong nor weak. The only problem that I noticed is that, it does not last as long as other sprays he has.</li>
            <li> absolutely great fresh scent and a very good value price. its somewhat refreshing too. only downscale is that its quite weak and will wear off too quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the original fragrance, not a copy.  If you already know it, go for it!  If you do not know it, it is a fresh, clean smelling, casual sport fragrance.  Do not expect any romantic or erotic character.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance for men. Good price.</li>
            <li> Ok, I thought it&#x27;s just 16 bucks for a 3.4Oz bottle, let&#x27;s give it a try. I am happy with my decision. It&#x27;s mild and not over-powering. As soon as I apply it to my skin, it smells like mild vodka and in few seconds, it gives out a pleasant aquatic fragrance. Although, I have observed that the fragrance on the skin (hand/neck) does not hold all day long but it does keep the fragrance on the shirt. I have tried other fragrances in this price range ($15-30) but very disappointed by their flowery smell. This one does not disappoint. I use this for everyday application. This is definitely not for special occasions, keep a bottle of John Varvatos or BVLGari or something that fits your skin. Goodluck shopping and try it, you might like it as well.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very quick to my house at NY. The product was packed well.&lt;br /&gt;The EDT is one of the best. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I tried to find the no. 1 selling cologne for my husband.  This was at the top of the list.  The price .....CHEAP.  Shipping and arrival...perfect.  Scent....doesn&#x27;t last.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> great smelling cologne although you need to spray a bit more of it if you like your cologne/perfume to be strong.</li>
            <li> I think first of all I should get paid for taking my time to review products I buy. This was a good deal on thi cologhne. Great price and smell good.</li>
            <li> I had looked at a lot of different fragrance. You can get overwhelmed at counter and sales people seem to push certain items. On a card this smelled great but when I have it on it dose not seem to last</li>
            <li> this is a good every day, on the go sparay. Chrome is way better for a hot date. Nautica is great for going for walk or shopping with friends/family. good quality, great for the price. but it will not get you that hot date.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and we both really love the scent.  He&#x27;s a little disappointed in it, because the scent wears off within a few hours.  But for the price, it smells great.</li>
            <li> smell lasted for approximately a whopping 10min. you get what you pay for apparently. never skimp on quality cologne otherwise you&#x27;d might as well throw your money away</li>
            <li> I gave it for a gift. Great price.</li>
            <li> like the scent but does not have any duration to it</li>
            <li> Beautiful aquatic fragrance. Mild, gentle, serene, beautiful. None of my other perfumes are as good. They are either too strong, or too mild, or have a strong smell but not as fragrant.</li>
            <li> I like this eau de toilette a lot. It is soft, not too overpowering. I don&#x27;t like to leave a trail after wearing a cologne and I don&#x27;t like a too strong scent. This Nautica cologne is just perfect. The scent has a hint of softness, relaxed confidence. I would definitely wear it at a nice dinner date that ends with a slow dance.</li>
            <li> I ENJOY THE NAUTICA BLUE BUT FIND IT IS PRICEY IN MOST OF THE DEPARTMENT STORES THAT I SHOP IN.BUYING IT HERE HAS LET ME ENJOY WHAT I LIKE AT A GREAT PRICE! THANKS</li>
            <li> I love it, this is the perfect gift and good price. I will recommend to my family and my friends about it.</li>
            <li> This is a good fragrance. It is similar to Polo Blue, but a lot cheaper. For the price, it is definitely worth it. Its a very fresh scent, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend because it&#x27;s his favorite cologne. I was nervous the scent may be off but compared to the old bottle he had, they smelled identical. He&#x27;s been using it ever since. The price was great and the quality was great!</li>
            <li> I like this. However, I think Nautica Voyage smells better and it is more long lasting than Nautica Blue. Perhaps, that&#x27;s the reason Nautica Blue is cheaper than Nautica Voyage</li>
            <li> I was alittle unsure how this would smell. I was afraid it would smell like cheap dollar store man. Boy was I wrong. It&#x27;s a nice crisp clean sharp smell. Very soft yet powerful. Glad I came across this.</li>
            <li> im so unhappy with this, when you use it smells good and smells like the original ones that i been had, but left 1 hout the smell gone</li>
            <li> Me gusta este perfume para el uso diario, y tiene un muy buen precio, esta es la segunda ves que lo compro</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE Nautica for men! I ordered this for my hubby as a Christmas gift &amp; he wears it, he&#x27;s just too old school &amp; likes the cheap stuff....ugh!!....lol.&lt;br /&gt;Price is GREAT! VERY quick delivery! &amp; packaged safely. I will definitely order more in future, but will choose a different cologne that he will enjoy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell. It smelled musty. My boyfriend didn&#x27;t like it either but he used his own words to describe the smell... not good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because is a product cheaper than other products, and is very good brand in the market</li>
            <li> The smell of this cologne is very nice, however it does not last long. Then again it&#x27;s not very expensive. They continue to get cheaper on Amazon. If you enjoy the smell and only need it on for a small amount of time I would reccommend.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, clean scent, that I find pleasing, and is not overpowering, yet has good staying power throughout the day. I do believe it to be better suited for daytime use though, as opposed to an evening scent.</li>
            <li> bought this cologne couple of weeks ago. it is such a disappointment. It does smell good, however it does not last for more than 10 minutes. I do not recommend it for any one.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but it does not last on you.  the smell wears off too quickly.  not really a big loss for me because it was cheap, but I am not planning on buying again.  Will spend a little more and get something that lasts a bit more.  if you are looking for something inexpensive, then you might like this.</li>
            <li> A good price for such a useable cologne. The light, refreshing scent of this cologne is quite nice.  Yes, it does wear off after a while, but bring your best girl in for a hug after your date and she&#x27;ll still get a whiff of this classy scent for hours after application.  Definitely buy- it&#x27;s cheaper than Rohypnol! (but seriously, date rape is a serious, awful thing and I encourage winning women with charm, not drugs)</li>
            <li> It was on sale so I grabbed it. Not overpowering, nice but I&#x27;m not getting any compliments so I use it daily for office and casual evening use just to smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Sells great and nice price!</li>
            <li> this item is very good and cheap</li>
            <li> Good fragrance, its duration time is good. Buy one for sell and it sold right away. The customer is at ease and I also. It is economical and delicious aroma. I arrive at the expected time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Saw this product being advertised at a very low price and thought it would be a knock off. I will start by saying that the product was ready and shipped very quickly via usps. It was exactly as described, 3.4oz Nautica Blue in the original wrapping. Will definitely use them again for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. The fragrance is very light and that&#x27;s what I needed. Can be a very good gift too!</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW IT SMELLS ON MY FIANCE.  I HAVE ORDERED MANY OTHER COLOGNES HERE ON AMAZON AND I LOVE THEM ALL AND SO DOES MY FIANCE.  I HAVE NO REGRETS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER MORE, THIS IS THE 3rd NAUTICA COLOGNE OF COURSE DIFFERENT ONES AND THEY ARE ALL GREAT.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALL NAUTICA COLOGNES AND THE PRICES ARE SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING THEM IN THE MALL.</li>
            <li> the title says it all.  smells like Aqua Velvet to me.  used it a bit - now its in my sons&#x27; bathroom medicine cabinet - maybe they&#x27;ll use it when they get to be teens.  i couldn&#x27;t stand it!  even at around $20 - it is overpriced!</li>
            <li> Issue with this bottle. I had to ask for refund but did mistake. It do not last more than 15 minutes. You have to go and smell from almost 3 inches closer.</li>
            <li> One of the clasical fragances, i love it !</li>
            <li> I sellect this product for a San Valentine gift and was delivered on time, is a Aromatic Aquatic fragrance for men, my bpyfriend love this and i too.</li>
            <li> This has. Great not overbearing scent. It does not take over the room. The price is great if you compare it to any Brock and morder store. I have had women ask e what it was</li>
            <li> This fragrance is super cheap, yet smells great. My son loved it and so do I.  His first fragrance, and will buy again, plus it&#x27;s name brand. If you haven&#x27;t smelled, do give it a try. I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> overall very good buy, if you like, if you recommend this product is a good product, if it works, happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Very modern and nice, good product the one that offers of excellent quality I overcome my expectations... D T B</li>
            <li> What a great deal. This cologne smells wonderful on my husband. I will certainly be ordering again. It arrived so quick. I can&#x27;t wait to give it to him for christmas!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last long ..my Axe body spray last longer then this one ..</li>
            <li> Its cheap and smells good but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyday use as it may start to feel annoying with time.&lt;br /&gt;Also it doesn&#x27;t lasts that long.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance, ordered for my husband, the only thing that actually is not very durable, and in relation to the service of amazon, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the product.  It is 100% duplicate.  The smell is gone in few seconds. Yes I really mean seconds.  This is a pure waste of money.  Do not buy.  I got duped.  Do not  buy from perfumeland megastore.  I want my money back.</li>
            <li> This product is not ok and it wont last.......................... test it before you buy. Shipping was great but the product is very disappointed. I put it on, but less  than an hour there is no smell at all.Waste of money. Didn&#x27;t expect like this.Not happy.I felt its a Fake one.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Nautica for years.  I would strongly recommend it.  This particular cologne does not have a strong scent so it is not over powering.</li>
            <li> Its a nice perfume. It doesn&#x27;t last for many days but it is definitely worth the money. . . .</li>
            <li> very good product, I recommend it, I&#x27;ll keep trying and more before I comment if I&#x27;m still satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> i bought this perfume for my husband and i love the smell and the price really recomend it  and he loved it to</li>
            <li> My husband has loved this cologne for years! For the size of this bottle we got an awesome deal! Very Satisfied</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance very much.  I have been buying this since a lot of years ago.  Would recommend it to any one who wants to feel a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Great value! Huge bottle. Bought these for my sons for Christmas and they loved it. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Muy buenas cumplen con todo lo ofrecido por el proveedor, manejan buen tiempo de entrega, muy buen servicio y calidad.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Stays even after a day. Very masculine scent. Not too strong, not to weak. My clothes smell so good even days after I have used this product. I got good compliments at work whenever I used it. Good buy. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> fake fake Fake..Dont go by lot of +ve reviews...initially it lasted for few mins..After 4 months its just blue water for showcase..dont buy it.</li>
            <li> It does its job. Makes you smell great and looks pretty nice in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift and had it shipped to my nephew in Texas. He loves this cologne and unfortunately when he received this one, he was well disappointed. It DOES NOT smell like the original authentic cologne and if anybody would know it would be him. He compared the little bit of cologne he had left in his old bottle to the cologne in this new bottle and they are VERY different. I believe this cologne I purchased is an imitation liquid. I am very disappointed in this product and extremely embarrassed since this was a gift. I had to go out of my way and purchase the authentic version from a department store and ship it to my nephew myself. Thanks Amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li> da item was good but the invoice said a price that was totally wrong- it said $55 when online my invoice says about $15- i do not want to be charged extra for it so may some one please send me a new invoice with the proper price</li>
            <li> i love love love love this perfume i keep buying it....the smell of this perfume its a really good smell that you keep putting it on over and over and you cant stop smelling this perfume its like the perfume take over you that you have to have this perfume so i think yall should try it and you wont reget it thanks for this great perfume and god bless yall and alot of blessings i love this perfume the best there is nothing to say but its the best and i am going to buy 3 more of this perfume i love it and i always will love this perfume so buy it for anybody they would love it alot like me....</li>
            <li> Smells very sweet.  Good for daytime.</li>
            <li> This is a cologne i used to wear 15 years ago. I didn&#x27;t even know that they still made it. Very inexpensive and it smells awesome.</li>
            <li> I like Nautica, the price is good and  the wife likes it. will have to get more. Good gift also</li>
            <li> I havent got the item yet and they keep updating the shipping date.If I would have known this in advance I wouldnt have ordered from this seller.</li>
            <li> The smell of this cologne is very nice, however it does not last long AT ALL! it almost makes me think i received a fake bottle</li>
            <li> I always prefer this perfume nearly it&#x27;s been 3 yrs I have been using this brand.</li>
            <li> Great car cologne.  I keep this cologne in my car in the center console just in case I forget to put some on before I leave the house</li>
            <li> This was a good price and I got several as stocking stuffers. We did have a problem with one bottle, the whole glass top came off with the lid.  It wasn&#x27;t cracked or broken or leaking, it just popped off when we pulled up on the lid.  It was rather strange...but we just put the cologne in a regular little spray bottle.  The other 2 I bought have had no problems.  They all really enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> I found this huge bottle of Nautica Blue for 12.00. This bottle retails for 40.00 and over. I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Price.  Nautica is where its at.  The bad thing is shipping, it&#x27;s considered as HAZMAT and is shipped that way.  So it takes  a little more time.  But the product is worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I saw this while looking for a gift for my middle aged Dad. I had tried other Nautica products in the past, but not this particular one. For the price, I thought it was worth a try. It arrived very quickly and I thought I would try it for myself before wrapping. I have owned several other more expensive cologns in the past that couldn&#x27;t compare to this. It was hard for me to wrap it up, I had to use a couple more times first. Wish I would have ordered two bottles. Very happy with this quality, brand name product for great price.--- Matt P.</li>
            <li> This stuff reminds me of a more subtle Chrome by Azzaro. I found it a little cheaper on Amazon than it was at Wal-Mart. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> At first, I was hesitant to buy this, assuming that nothing this cheap could ever smell good.  Boy was I wrong.  This product smells great, and it isn&#x27;t so strong that people get annoyed.  However, the scent does wear off rather quickly, so be ready to apply it again if need be.  However, for such a large bottle at this price, I don&#x27;t mind spritzing myself more than once a day.</li>
            <li> this perfume is amazing. for me the smell is very ggod, i feel very good with it. buy it. no regreats!!</li>
            <li> I have had this scent in my collection for several years.  I highly recommend it.  great for everyday, weekends and casual use.</li>
            <li> My friend is obsessed with this scent- he&#x27;s known and loved it for years. The price on Amazon was so low I just couldn&#x27;t pass it up. The packaging was great and it made a great add-on gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Good perfume for reasonable price!! lasts all day long but the bottle shape might be a bit awkward to handle!!</li>
            <li> Great price and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I could not believe this was available for the price I paid for this.&lt;br /&gt;Its smells great and clean. It was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> You should not have to filled this stupid box out.  Thanks in advance for removing this stupid and senseless requirements!</li>
            <li> I think it was cheaper then in the store too...but the bottle arrived intact and I&#x27;m using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think next time I might get old spice because it reminds me of my dad.</li>
            <li> seems Legit. Used it all and always smelled good for the ladies.</li>
            <li> I thought I would buy this for my husband because of the great price. I&#x27;m glad I did. He loves it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for the price you get it on amazon. Just research the vendor before purchasing. This stuff is great because it lasts eight hours for me and isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Good, really disappointed about my purchase, because my perfume arrived the destination party and make complaints about it and nobody says nothing at all. Was not whether the seller or those carrying my product to the address provided, but the fact is that no one on Amazon responded to my complaints, very, very bad.</li>
            <li> My husband always need cologne. He uses it so much but usually it is expensive but from here you get to pay less for the same thing. I got the package quickly and it was nice to find them in front of the house.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my brother and he loved it....IT is too damn delicious....be carefull you could fall in love with a ugly man if he wears this perfume....just kidding!.....I love it!!!!!. The product came very well packaged and fast.</li>
            <li> bought this for a Christmas gift for my father and he was content with it:) has a great scent. would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Nautica Blue before, from a retail store, but this was such a good deal it was hard to pass up.</li>
            <li> the cologne smells really nice, it is like smelling clear blue water; as far as i have noticed it lasts pretty long.  I have gotten complements.  It is relitively high quality, but not good for bussiness, better for casual.</li>
            <li> Fake ... Please do not buy... The original might be good but this is not original ...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about everybody else but mine is pretty long lasting and smells great</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance, I recommend it, my wife likes me too, I could not enjoy it much because it was stolen.</li>
            <li> I got tired of walking into local department stores and paying over 40$ for cologne this was priced right and smells nice. Cool water is my other choice and I get that huge bottle on Amazon for under 30$. God bless America and God bless Amazon.</li>
            <li> Cheap but effective stuff, not long lasting but does grab attention when you walk into a room. Fresh and fierce good for extremely hot day, what more can I say but go out and buy it.</li>
            <li> the price is pretty low online but it is a very good quality and has a great smell.  the product came very quickly and was well packed.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I use it in daily basis. The shipping was fast, and no delays. The packaging was perfect and very well done. I don&#x27;t have any complaints, only compliments about this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this spray and the fragrance is excellent.</li>
            <li> Excellent article, met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not authentic Nautica Blue. Smells harsh. Similar scent to Nautica blue, but not as sweet, not as delicate. Definitely not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy directly from manufacturer. This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Men : besides your charming personalities or good looks, this is why women will go home with you haha&lt;br /&gt;smells great !</li>
            <li> I was using Quorum. Nautica Blue has a very different smell but totally mor suitable for my age I guess(28).</li>
            <li> This is a cologne that brings back my past. To find it so cheap on amazon made my day. No damage and timely arrival. A must buy!!!</li>
            <li> Good smell for young men, not too pricey, not overpowering.  Has a pleasant odor that is not too musky.  Have been complimented several times with this cologne.  You only need two sprays.  Works well for those &#x27;too late to shower&#x27; mornings and the smell lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this order.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I love it, is not too strong, but it feels. My ex girlfriend used to say she loves it, because, is not a strong that you can feel it at distance, but, yes when get close to me, so is discrete.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li> This is very light and a cool fragrance. Doesn&#x27;t last the whole day, but decent enough. Very good value for money!</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, and you really can&#x27;t beat the price. I use it for every day use and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Item shipped fast, just as advertised, great scent! Probably going to order another one. Wanted something not too strong, but classy and elegant. The Nautica Blue fits the bill, without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Good value for the low  price - my son loves it !</li>
            <li> I bought the same Nautica blue from a store at the mall. This is not the same cologne. It smells different, and this one from Amazon does not last long at all. Since I cannot prove it, I can only say that I&#x27;m with the other reviewers that suspect that this cologne may not be a legit Nautica Blue. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fresh and light, somewhat more like an aftershave than a cologne in complexity, but perfectly acceptable as a daytime spring fragrance if applied lightly.</li>
            <li> Prior to buying this I use to just use my fathers ck escape or his polo cologne. he got tired of me going into his things so i saw this and i remembered trying the scent at kohls so i bought it. man do i love it, its not overpowering and it lasts quite awhile, i showered and can definitely still smell this. I recommend this product, and the shipping only took 2 days, no serial code was tampered with, and the box was in great condition. Do yourself a favor and stop reading this review and buy this product. for the price, ITS A ROB!!!</li>
            <li> After a lot of searching and sniffing, this product seemed just perfect.  I have been using it for a few weeks and really enjoy the compliments I have been getting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone else is talking about, saying this cologne doesn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;ll put this cologne on (only two squirts) before I go to work at 8AM every morning. By the time I shower for work the next day, the cologne is still noticeable on my neck. It&#x27;s a wonderful cologne, and for $14, it certainly beats Kohls selling it for $35 for a bottle half the size. The cologne has a very classy smell to it, but it doesn&#x27;t overpower anything. It&#x27;s an excellent, well-balanced cologne that works wonderfully. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was not putting high expectations, but it was so good. It is added to my top list of perfumes/EDTs</li>
            <li> Smells like it should be worth twice the price.  Bought it for my son as he uses all my &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; cologne.</li>
            <li> VERY GREAT PRODUCT INDEED. NOTHING BAD TO DECLARE. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> A good economy scent. I&#x27;m not sure why I expected it to be as nice as the $50 a bottle stuff, it just isn&#x27;t. For the price though, it&#x27;s a decent everyday scent.</li>
            <li> This spray is very good. be aware, it doesn&#x27;t keep the smell for more than between 5-7 hours&lt;br /&gt;any way, comparing to the price, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The smell is good but you probably will be the only one that smells it because by the time you get to your destination, the smell is all gone. Where, I have no idea. You should probably keep it in your car and spray it immediately before you step out, that way other people can at least get a whiff of you before the smell all goes where, i don&#x27;t know. But you get what you pay for. I made this my inside the car spray for when i forget to use the ones at home. .</li>
            <li> where are the products that zoom miami q told me I communicate with you to where they left the order</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again. it was exactly what i was looking for. except i hate theses rating surveys</li>
            <li> coulda been better. just adding more words to this list because they want me to keep talking and I dont.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered for my dad.  He enjoyed his gift and I am satisfied with the gift I ordered.</li>
            <li> This is complete waste of money and it seems that they have filled the blue color water in the bottle and then shipped.completely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I like to wear this daily. It smells fresh and fun, not too strong or dark. My girlfriend loves this scent and cringed when I said I got another scent to try, she just loves this one so much! As do I!</li>
            <li> el producto es excelente para el uso diario lo uso para ir a trabajar y perdura durante todo el d&amp;iacute;a..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe the scent with a nice light, oceanic &amp; slightly citrus accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not an overpowering scent. That&#x27;s what I really like about it. A down side is the scent will die down quicker. If a person(more specifically a female companion) got close to you after a day of wearing the cologne such as after a date, she would be able to smell the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price aswell.</li>
            <li> I got this for a gift..... he loved it, and I loved the price! Smells great, and the size of the bottle makes this a great value.</li>
            <li> I use it to deodorize the bathroom as I would not want to be caught wearing it!&lt;br /&gt;Not all \\&quot;blue\\&quot; colognes are coolwater by Davidoff. Just get the real thing and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This just smells really chill. It has a strong hit when you first spray it on, but it mellows out throughout the day and you get a lot of whiffs of it&#x27;s breezy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price this cologne is awesome. I spent 50 dollars on Drakkar Noire and this cologne smells a billion times better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for the price, is very fresh and like to the girls. It&#x27;s similar to all the line of Nautica.</li>
            <li> i ordered this perfume for my dad... didnt find it lasting..&lt;br /&gt;you can try blue voyage or classic.. but this nautica is not that&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> Great perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Good for its cost. Perfect for everyday perfume. Not very strong but definitely not Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is excellent and worth trying</li>
            <li> A great fragrance, unique and pleasing. Mildly strong, but is longstanding, superb value for its price. Good quality too. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought for son for his birthday. He likes the fragrance, a light musky and fruity smell, very mellow. Does not really last long on skin, but all day on shirt. I tried it a couple of times for something different and have received complements on it so we are not the only ones who find it pleasant. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I thought that it was going to be a mild clean scent but Nautica Blue is way too sweet and artificial for me. I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not knowing what aquatic means. Next time I&#x27;ll be looking for citrusy scent as that&#x27;s what I think I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, it was a generous 3.4 Oz bottle. I&#x27;ll be giving mine to a friend who might appreciate it.</li>
            <li> This scent is awesome. It does not have any  noticeable alcohol smell. I was worried due to the price, but it is long lasting and smells great.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance and brand. This just takes the fragrance of the classic and advances on a already perfect creation. I totally recommend this for any mans collection.</li>
            <li> the product was exactly as i expected. Plus it arrived on time. I have absolutely no complaints and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> very good, I recommend good price, smells good. I find excellent buy.i recomender. is cheap and good .very nice i an happy.</li>
            <li> excelente producto original funciona sin problemas gracias recomiendo para este vendedor el producto fue despachado dentro de la estimacion propuesta</li>
            <li> buen aroma se puede usar a diario es de agradable percepcion comprenla muy buena la colonia se fija bien la recomiendo</li>
            <li> recomended 100% thank you, the product its excelent, this is my personal opinion and my rewiew have a good day</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto bello y hermoso lo recomiendo 100% es de muy buen material mucho listo sin novedades dloii cur</li>
            <li> I have purchased several bottles of this before in stores, and love the scent. I was not let down in that aspect. It was the same scent. What did upset me was the scent lasts shorter by far then the smaller store bought bottles I purchase. I have purchased some designer imposters that have lasted longer. Overall though I can not complain too much because it still was an amazing price, with the correct smell. Maybe I just got a shelf bottle that sat and lost potency.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from my family, it smells very fresh and crisp and reminds me of the ocean. Definitely ranks up there with some of the more expensive fragrances.</li>
            <li> I honestly feel the cologne stays on your skin longer than people give it credit.  I sprayed some on yesterday around 9Am.  Sprayed it on my chest, used my wrist to spread the excess around on neck and other wrist.  I smelled it up untill about 7 that night.  I could still smell it but it was only faint.  When I woke up this morning I could just faintly smell it on my wrist.  My shirt on the other hand held onto it pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I have worn cologne that I have smelled still on me a day and a shower later, and I personally dont like that stuff.  I want something like this that wears off a little quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the scent goes?  It is \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; like its supposed to be.  I think it smells pretty good but when I smell it, it leaves a little bit of a bad aftersmell in my nose, nothing repulsive I just dont feel it smells the greatest.</li>
            <li> Amazon yet again you have delivered a product as promised and it is exactly what I wanted and needed and got it for a fair price well way below market price and what I would have paid in Macy&#x27;s or Lord and Taylor....thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a nice cologne and should have cost 3x more but got a wonderful cologne at a steal, going into my fave five top colognes....its clean and simple and masculine what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Came nicely packaged and on time.  NIce fragrance, masculine, not flowery.  The container, even though eleganly shaped, is a bit hard to hold for use.  Made more to look at.</li>
            <li> This has a great smell, can&#x27;t really put my finger on what makes it smell so great but it&#x27;s totally worth the $14 I paid for it. Seriously try this!</li>
            <li> Turns out I was wrong! THis great cologne was a godsend! I wanted a new one and this is amazing!</li>
            <li> Descent for a cheap Cologne. This is just my opinion and I&#x27;m writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review. Really!!!  AYFKM. Jusy Saying.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, smelled good, and came in a vary large bottle.  That&#x27;s all i have to say.  Words to finish review.</li>
            <li> Good product, arrived on the date indicated. Recommended 100%. excellent product. . . . . . . . . . 100%</li>
            <li> VERY good size, color chosen. Adjustable exceed expectations. according to the proper use, recomendado al 100% for other persons, besides excellent</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY BOYFRIEND. I LOVE THE SMELL OF IT. IT IS OLD SCHOOL. I REMEMBER THIS SCENT FROM HIGHSCHOOL. HE LIKES IT AND BETTER YET, I LIKE IT ON HIM</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok fragrance. I thought I liked it more but I had been alternating between this and an adidas cologne and I just fell out of love with this haha. I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
            <li> It did not take anything to get and excellent buy and will gladly recommend for purchase, came as out in photography.</li>
            <li> Two sprays does it every morning.  It lasts a good amount of time -- still faint after ~8 hours.  It&#x27;s a non-offensive smell, and my wife likes it.  It tails off pretty quickly, so if you&#x27;re the type that likes smelling like you just put on cologne instead of it being a background scent, you may need to reapply mid-day.  For me, it works.</li>
            <li> Not too pungent, not too floral.&lt;br /&gt;Shape of the bottle is inspirtational :)&lt;br /&gt;And there is something about that gentle sky blue color.</li>
            <li> Buen perfume para nosotros, aunque lo importante es que el producto si llega a tiempo y huele bien, vale la pena esperarlo.</li>
            <li> Shipping was good.Don&#x27;t remember much about this.Someone Stoled it out of a car in the driveway.It was a gift.Don&#x27;t even remember the smell.But was satified with when i got it.Price was good.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday wear. I love the subtle scent, it give a sense of maturity and the ladies like so why not!! Price is right and I can abuse it every time I shower.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for a Christmas present and I know the party will be very excited.  Also a good price. Yay</li>
            <li> My husband loves this perfume. I bought it for a birthday gift and i was&#x27;t very sure if I did a good selection until my husband told me that he wanted another one for christmas.  My husband&#x27;s birthday is on november.  I really recommend this product. Great Presentation and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I can say, this is the worst purchase that i&#x27;ve ever made!&lt;br /&gt;The spray was spilled, and I smelled it before i open the door for the delivery guy!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy perfumes ONLINE!f</li>
            <li> muy buena compra, es el producto deseado, todo bien&lt;br /&gt;esta fue la fragancia que compre y me lleg&amp;oacute;&lt;br /&gt;Francelys G</li>
            <li> los felicitos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;me llego&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;en poco tiempo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;los felicitos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amigo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jose coronado&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;desde&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;venezuela&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mas fino&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok ...&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I picked this up being it had good reviews on Amazon however I also picked up NAUTICA VOYAGE with the same order and while searching to compare the two on the net, I found everyone strongly suggested NAUTICA VOYAGE over BLUE and after getting these two and comparing for myself, I very highly suggest going with Voyage over Blue.</li>
            <li> Great price but not primary cologne I use. Bought based on reviews but struggle to see why reviews are so high outside of the price.</li>
            <li> Buenos dias, el dia de hoy me tome la molestia para calificar esta compra, la cual cumplio con los parametros que esperabamos. Quedamos conforme con la compra, gracias.</li>
            <li> I surprised her fragrance, is very soft, elegant and combines humor with my skin.</li>
            <li> Nautica Blue is by far one of the best smelling colognes the deep sandalwood smell with the sweet peach and pinapple notes is amazing. I would reccomend this to anyone buying a gift or even for them self</li>
            <li> Clean fragrance not overpowering, good for everyday</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my brother and he loved it....IT is too damn delicious....be carefull you could fall in love with a ugly man if he wears this perfume....just kidding!.....I love it!!!!!. The product came very well packaged and fast.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. It has very nice smell and stays on your clothes for a while. The price is just too good.</li>
            <li> i want to keep using this cologne for a very very long time it is awesome i spay it 6 times 4 times a day its awesome i also have voyage it is the most amazing smelling cologne ever it kinda smells like avatar and kinda like cucumbers.</li>
            <li> They say you get what you pay for, however in comparison with prices of other colognes that I have used, This was completely worth the price, the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long, its a plain, fresh, crisp smell,  the bottle is very stylish in comparison to some other colognes I have, but I use this when I go work out, not something I would wear to a professional event.</li>
            <li> I got this at only $13 or so thinking it&#x27;s cheap enough for a try... but it turned out really well. It&#x27;s got a complex character to it that isn&#x27;t like any cheap fragrance but is not overbearing like those that are required for more formal settings. A good casual and everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great price and pretty good smell! Ordered this item like 3 times!</li>
            <li> This cologne is pretty much meant for any occasion, in my opinion. It&#x27;s not powerful nor musky, doesn&#x27;t make people run away, but rather draw them in a bit. Simply put, it&#x27;s a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Excelente la entrega. Recomendado y Seguro!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfecho con la informaci&amp;oacute;n suministrada del traslado del producto. Hace una compra segura sin inconvenientes.</li>
            <li> I really loved this perfume when i first sampled it in a target store. I ordered this from Amazon, but this seems like a watered down  perfume. It never lasts more than a couple of hours. I was trying to save some money on this but ended up losing it. I bought one from Target and that one is perfect. I am surprised something fulfilled by Amazon can be of such inferior quality.</li>
            <li> WOW!! Just AMAZING...I fell in love with this from the first spray!!</li>
            <li> I am not much of a cologne guy but I found myself wanting a scent for just occasionally. I tested this one out at a Kohls and returned home for the online money search and found it here for really inexpensive. For the time it shipped, the scent itself and the overall cost, its a pretty damn good deal. Try it, you might dig it.</li>
            <li> The perfume is ok.&lt;br /&gt;However the packaging was very bad and the box was damaged on arrival, so even that could broke the perfume</li>
            <li> This scent has really mild smell. the cap / spray top could have been little better since i always tend to rotate if you dont hold it properly.</li>
            <li> I like mild scents and I prefer using cK Be. This was for a descent rate. So grabbed one..Its really worth the money you spend for a cool mild scent.</li>
            <li> i love this product, i wore it the next day i receive it and everybody ask me what cologn is that and where did i get it from</li>
            <li> What can I say? I&#x27;ve been able to purchase this cologne several times for a very cheap price, and it smells good. My wife enjoys it and it didn&#x27;t cost me a ton of money in a department store. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Very Good. Excelente colonia la recomiendo 100%. Olor suave y deportivo, el envio fue satisfactorio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Good Good Good Good&amp;iexcl;</li>
            <li> I ordered Nautica Blue for my husband since he like it a lot more than the much more expensive colognes I got for him. I love the sellers price and the fast delivery on this item. For sure, will buy again from him.</li>
            <li> I have smelled this in a store prior and liked it - it&#x27;s going to be a Christmas-gift like the other colognes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect smell im looking in a perfume, it doesn&#x27;t smell too much so It doesn&#x27;t itches in your nose. it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> got it for my hubby for christmas, it has a really light scent. i like it, he doesn&#x27;t.  Go figure.</li>
            <li> I bought it very cheap but the fragrance is not that great and does not last long. So I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> A great men&#x27;s cologne. I pretty much collect colognes. I have like at least 20 sitting in my room. This is one of my favorites now. Not too strong and enough to be noticed. It&#x27;s great for casual wear, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gonna buy perfume over the internet unless I&#x27;ve used it before.  This seemed pretty good by the reviews, but everyones different and this isnt the one for me.  Smells like dryer sheets and chlorine from pools</li>
            <li> I use them every day. Good price-product deal! Definitely would by it again. Nice nice nice nice nice nice nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this cologne before from a retail store and loved it because people would compliment the scent after 5-10 hours after I sprayed it on. But this one, the scent did not last a long time. It seems as if it is diluted smell or something. Smells great first 30mins then the smell is completely gone.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and a lot of good comments. I use it for everyday use and would consider gifting to a friend or family. Nice size and inexpensive when I bought it. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but it just doesn&#x27;t last through a work day.  I would estimate 2-3 hours with light application.  The worst characteristic is that the smell starts to change as it fades away.  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but I don&#x27;t like the smell when it changes.  Who knows, maybe my nose is broken.  For the price, I&#x27;ll say meh and let it go.  Won&#x27;t be buying it again though.</li>
            <li> Feel like I am wearing a real expensive perfume.. Its fragrance is very pleasant. I wish I knew of this before</li>
            <li> for the price i got it in, its great. smells good. lasts long enough. the bottle looks nice. great product for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I do not like at all the aroma of this colony. I expected better</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this cologne&lt;br /&gt;It is a soft yet appealing smell that the women love&lt;br /&gt;I am usually very picky when it comes to cologne because most actually give me a headache, but this cologne does not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very affordable here on amazon and i recommend for everyone to have one of these in there collection</li>
            <li> The smell is  very mild .  i prefer mine to be slightly stronger.should put that in description. oh well it was low price</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite spray. The price was EXCELLENT?  He loves it, me too. We liked it so much, we ordered a bottle for a friend&#x27;s husband, so he too could smell good.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews i finally  bought this item, it smells really great but only lasts for a short while.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne before and was very pleased. I had a great scent and lasted all day while never being over powering. I had previously read reviews of fakes being sold on Amazon so when I needed more I searched my purchase history with the hope of receiving the same product again. Unfortunately, this product either dropped substantially in quality, the seller now has the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; cologne, or one of my purchases was a fluke. It smells similar, but quickly diminishes within an hour. Since I have received different products from this same seller I don&#x27;t know which one you will receive if you order here.</li>
            <li> I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong Amazon has always made me free and better; acquires another company uses Amazon are excellent, Amazon is always an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance, for example, I love the way all I can even give gende and love and is also author of Through Amazon, as well as any product I buy, is truly exquisite.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for many perfumes in the market and finally I choose this one which is recommended by my friend and I really liked it!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for my hubby for at least 5 years. It is his signature scent and I love it on him. You know how a scent makes you identify with certain things?  Ladies, This fresh, crisp, clean scent might just be the right one for your man too.</li>
            <li> I love to smell of Nautica. I always have. It&#x27;s a very smooth smelling spice. It&#x27;s not overly potent but it&#x27;s very noticeable.</li>
            <li> We dednt resive irems</li>
            <li> Good scent and a good price. However, doesn&#x27;t long too-long, but not an issue. It smells nice !</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product.i mainly purchased it because of the name and price.it was delivered in quick time,and from the time I used it I was impressed.my father got interested and I bought one for him also.</li>
            <li> I rate this product is very poor, looks like product is not geniune,Recommend not to buy any perfume from this vendor</li>
            <li> the nautica blue for men is an excellent fragance at an excellent price, here in Colombia where i Live this costs much more!</li>
            <li> The GF picked this stuff out for me and loves the smell. i wouldnt tell her, but all the other ladies love it too. i get compliments at work, i get complements from randoms on the elevators. i like its cause its not overpowering and its pretty much something that everybody would like.</li>
            <li> Great price,  fast delivery, and smells good.</li>
            <li> I looked at this same product at a local Big Box store and as you all know, the prices at retail locations are very high.  This is an Authentic product at a great price.  Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to be this good, but it turned out way better. And a better price than in other places.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good and its cheap however it barley lasts an hour and projection is very low. Even with like 20 sprays on clothing/skin it does not last. I dont think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume for by boyfriend without knowing the smell, but I sincerely loved it when I received it. Its a touch of fresh air and handsome man smell &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its cheap and smells good!</li>
            <li> Got it for 11 $ and its a deal... The perfume smells great and stays throughout the day --- At this price I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews about this perfume online on different websites and thought of ordering it when I saw this super bargain. I got 4 of these for 11 bucks for each. Good as gifts or for personal use. Nice pleasant perfume.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I love the smell of this.  It is not to strong and the price was just right!</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and it was an okay scent.  Works for everyday but I would not call it a date night cologne.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this on price. Chose this one because I got a sample. Wow, such a clean, wonderful smell. Any man should want to have this as one if not the main cologne in his arsenal!</li>
            <li> As much I love the start, I donâ€™t like the way it dries down. After an hour or so, you just have this pale, bland finish, and itâ€™s such a let down.</li>
            <li> Very good masculine scent! I wish it lasted a little longer though, but not bad for the price. I would recommend this for personal use and gifts.</li>
            <li> pretty good smell. lasted a long time. finally ran out. had a great price. need to order another bottle or two.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and the packaging was excellent also. This perfume for guys smells so good! I bought 2 for my husband and father for fathers day and they love it as much as I love the smell. The bottle is pretty big, it&#x27;s the worth the price. I would even wear it even if it&#x27;s a guys perfume. Recommened this to anyone that is trying to find the perfect smell.</li>
            <li> This smells good but it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Nautica Blue, so this is a knock off. Plus when I received this the box was half torn off, so the sender just didn&#x27;t care to look professional.</li>
            <li> Is a perfect gift for my dad... He remain fascinated with the lotion and liked much.. Thnks For all And Happy Holidays &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s never too strong, and wears reasonably well. You don&#x27;t run the risk of hitting someone with a heavy wave of perfume. Enjoyable in the morning. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Got this on a deal and I just love it. Love the sweet smell. Its not too strong and just right to wear it to work everyday. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked it due to the benefits are incredible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the price is too low. Perfect !</li>
            <li> nice clean smell, good for a cheap price.  if you like clean smells this is for you. good size for the price.</li>
            <li> Ordered this based on the many positive reviews. Guess I&#x27;m in the minority here! Albeit I am a little picky when it comes to men&#x27;s cologne, that being said this smells like any old run of the mill cologne in my opinion! Nothing that classifies as different in my mind.....doesn&#x27;t smell fresh to my husband or to me, nor is it what I would classify as a \\&quot; light\\&quot; fragrance. Smells a bit heavy, overwhelming &amp; regular drugstore quality men&#x27;s fragrance. Sorry! Didn&#x27;t enjoy at all but the price is great, I&#x27;ll give it that much! Obviously others really enjoy it we just didn&#x27;t !</li>
            <li> After using it for a while, noticed that the smell isn&#x27;t as strong as my other NauticaBlue bottle. Checked the back and it was made by COTY or something like that. My other bottle was from Nautica and the smell would last all day. This one would barely hold up for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing, but not by much.  I have no idea how this was rated as #1 cologne during Christmas 2012.  It smells ok, I will not use this, just a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy! It smells absolutely wonderful. It is just the right size. It was just the right price too.</li>
            <li> $50 in men&#x27;s warehouse...$12 on Amazon! It is a great smelling cologne. But you have to spray a minimum of 6x to get anyone to notice your wearing anything. Could be stronger but I like it</li>
            <li> This has quickly become one of my favorite fragrances. Not too overpowering but it will last most of the day.</li>
            <li> I read some of the comments people saying its not the original but i could care less because either way it smells great and while it only lasts couple hours those hours youre just smellin fresh!! great buy and ill do it again</li>
            <li> It was in new condition packed very well. I purchased this for one of my grandsons 15. He loves  fragrance and the beach . When he was a baby I called him blue for his eye color. I sure this has a fresh clean smell he will love. Sincerly Victoria</li>
            <li> receivied shipment very quickly, scent is nice but nothing special . over all i am satisfied with the product. .</li>
            <li> I first bought this at a local store after smelling about 15-20 colognes and I thought it was one of the best and cost me about $40-50. At the time I liked the scent a lot, but I was a little hesitant about buying it again because I thought it was a bit higher priced than it was worth. After finding it on Amazon for $15 I was really happy because it is absolutely worth that price. It is a very fresh and clean scent that is not too powerful.</li>
            <li> Great deal for a big bottle!!</li>
            <li> Women love me even more at work, Nautica has a great smell,and the product is worth the cost. I put this on everyday, and I plan on making more purchases.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne about two weeks ago and it is very weak.  I think it must be a knock-off.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I were you.  If you&#x27;ve ever bought cologne at a dollar store this stuff may be a couple of times stronger.  I have purchased expensive colognes for a long time and this one has no where near the lasting qualities of good colognes.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this seller.</li>
            <li> Excelente Producto y vendedor Muy atento lo recomiendo al 100% era Justo Lo Que estÃƒ&amp;iexcl;ba Buscando saludos desde venezuela Erick Lopez</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the subtle spell of this cologne. It is neither overpowering nor too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nautica Blue also comes in a nice glass bottle and chrome cap. From the outside, the baby blue color is vibrant and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My partner likes this cologne on me. That&#x27;s all I could really ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself to this great value and quality cologne!</li>
            <li> the cologne is very light but still playful and gives of a feeling or relaxation to both the wearer and the person smelling them</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT SEXY SCENT FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES TO LEAVE AN IMPRESSION!  LONG LASTING FOR A GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend after reading many reviews because of course shopping online I could not smell it. I wanted something that wouldnt be overpowering in an environment like a classroom because my bf is an instructor and around trainees all day and I didnt want it to be too much. I gave it to him and he is delighted. The scent is lite and refreshing and not too strong but lasts most of the day for him. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Three direct sprays to the skin will only last ~10 minutes.  I&#x27;m not familiar enough with the product to know for sure but I&#x27;m guessing I received a fake like many others.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> excellent care and products at the expected time as well as the just boxes to package size</li>
            <li> IT smells good, but the bottle takes up quite a bit of space on our dresser top.  It is a great gift also.  My sons are picky about their cologne, but this is not overpowering and it does have a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> May because of seller (Tuccini) but this perfume doesn&#x27;t smell anything @ all or very cheap fake perfume .. it says made by Coty who makes other low end stuff.. and not sure if this is a authentic Nautica but smell goes away in 1-2 min most or it&#x27;s truly not a good product if everything else is authentic.. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this @ $14 and somehow they charge $6 for shipping.. this is a 99cent store junk ..</li>
            <li> Natica Blue has a nice clean scent for men.  Its a good everyday cologne. And the price was just right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just the bottle I received, but the Nautica Blue I received had the production quality of parking lot cologne.  It is reminiscent of the cheap cologne peddled by street vendors carried in a backpack full of other knockoffs.  The scent was so light that 5 to 10 sprays had to be used just to get a hint of the aroma and I&#x27;m usually a 1-3 sprays type of guy.  On top of that the scent seemed to change between uses.  One time it would have aquatic tones and smell pleasant and the next use it would smell like rubbing alcohol.  If you are a fan of Nautica Blue and have used it before I would recommend purchasing a bottle from a local reputable retailer and let Amazon keep their cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li> Good price for a nice perfume</li>
            <li> pretty ncie fragrance my husband liked it .. he didnt LOVE it...</li>
            <li> For the size and price, this Nautica Blue can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is rather pleasant, and not overwhelming, although it does take a bit of time to settle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, unlike a lot of cheaper colognes this one lasts rather well.  Overall I would recommend it, and will likely order it again.</li>
            <li> ES UN EXCELENTE PRODUCTO C O N CALIDAD GARANTIZADA LO RECOMIENDO CON LOS OJOS CERRADOS 100 % DESDE VALENCIA, VENEZUELA</li>
            <li> Nice light scent! Love how this smells when my hubby put it on.</li>
            <li> this product have good fragrance and excellent price. it is look like original perfume selling at different department store like Macy, target,sears.</li>
            <li> el producto llego a tiempo, son de muy buena calidad, igual a las fotos, lo recomiendo a toda la comunidad</li>
            <li> This is my favourite cologne by nautical probably and I got a big bottle for about 10 bucks. Awesome deal</li>
            <li> I bought this since read good reviews about it but did not find it&#x27;s fragrance that great. But the fragrance do last go</li>
            <li> The cologne smells like weak candy and smells nothing like the real thing. i gave it to my son who uses it.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY GRAND CHILDREN AND THEY ARE TEENAGER&#x27;S SO I THINK THEY WILL LIKE IT AND I LIKED THE PRICE!</li>
            <li> My Brother Loved The Christmas Gift I Got Him!! 5/5. I Will Be Sure To Buy More! Thank You So Much!</li>
            <li> I am so unhappy with this, when you use it smells good and smells like the original ones that i been had, but left 1 hour the smell gone. I think its fake.</li>
            <li> Product came promptly and as described via UPS. This was definitely a price you could not beat in a store. I will be purchasing from here again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a friend as a gift. I know it is a good product and would recommend it to all men friends.</li>
            <li> This is a nice fresh cologne. It is mild enough to not appear like you are trying to hard but at the same time will still get you lots of compliments. Nice cool looking bottle as well.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my nephew who was very happy receiving it. Product was as described and made a great gift.</li>
            <li> i am not a strict person about perfume and i purchased this and the classic one of this brand, both of them are just horrible! they  smell like cheap combination of chemicals but not fragrance , i promise you will regret your money! at least i do! and i can not even return it because it is restrictive product (containing chemicals that are flammable or dangerous). really disappointed! will never purchased or even consider this again! trash products!</li>
            <li> The box had terrible packaging and the two bottles I ordered were brokenupon arrival.  The cologne got everywhere and unfortunately due to biohazard (no really) restrictions you can&#x27;t return this item.  The good news is that now my garbage can smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on my deodorant or bodywash than this. Only bought it because it was on sale. I used it for a week and now it sits in my closet collecting dust and longing for days of glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would make a good present for a teenage boy in middle or high school. But for a real man in the real world, this won&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> The bottle packaging everything is what I would expect, however the scent is not long lasting disappears in a couple of hours. I do not know if it normal or should there me a more pronounce fragrance for a good number of hours. I bought four of these to gift to my friends, I am regretting my decision now.</li>
            <li> This spray feels and smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. OK for casual use. Not a great buy from a brand like Nautica.</li>
            <li> Great price for an old favorite.</li>
            <li> What a great buy, and the Nautica Blue is great!  I wear it every day, and it makes me feel fresh all day.</li>
            <li> This smells OK - light and fresh, but it reminds me of the Bod Man body sprays available at the Big Blue Box stores.  Bod Man costs about half as much for twice the quantity.</li>
            <li> this will last for long time.... worth the money , just over $ 10.  Not the best perfume but it&#x27;s lot better for $ 11</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift.  I think it will be appreciated.  I will know for sure when it is opened on Christmas.</li>
            <li> Too good for the given price!!! Husband also loved it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy few more of these. Good to be given as gift to men!!!</li>
            <li> the price is well, thought it&#x27;s not a perfect product. It smells pretty cool but it doesn&#x27;t smell for a long time</li>
            <li> I loved this in the mall but not for the price. This is the real size and a legit product. I love this cologne.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE NAUTICA, IT&#x27;S A  REFRESHING FRAGRANCE THAT IS NOT OVERPOWERING.</li>
            <li> nautica blue very good</li>
            <li> not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Great quality, 100% recommended! I love it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This smells great.....clean and soft.  Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and him and i both love it. I was nervous because i had never smelt it and decided to buy it from the sounds of the reviews! Thank goodness the reviews were right... it smells great!!</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this.It&#x27;s a fake one and does&#x27;nt smell at all.I would suggest try buying this product from store where you can try it and then go for it.</li>
            <li> excelente el producto muy eficaz la rapidez del envi&amp;oacute; del producto y los obsequios que fueron enviados, lass ofertas muy buenas.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, the brand is excellent, I recommend it. Would you purchase this item. good price and quality</li>
            <li> love using this product.  It works very good.  I use it all the time.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Brought couple of these perfumes, Its a piece of junk , Please don&#x27;t buy and waste your money&lt;br /&gt;i would see it as duplicate/not original perfume</li>
            <li> This cologne has a nice subtle scent.  It is good for casual, everyday use, and the price is right.  I bought the 3.4 oz bottle for about $12.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother and I loved it more than he does! It smells so fresh and manly. It&#x27;s a must have typical men cologne. It smells amazing. And it&#x27;s cheap! So get it for a friend, a boyfriend, a brother, a father, etc. Suits them all!</li>
            <li> Its a nice one for people like me who on some days dont want a very strong fragrance but want something light</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. This cologne was not watered down or tampered with in any way. Smell is fantastic. Great price to.</li>
            <li> I really like their scent all wrong is that the smell does not last long I wish the scent last longer, but worth the price</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old and this is the only product I used for over 2 years and I am not ready to change. Plus I use it for all occasions both classic and casual. I this really great and I highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> you get what you paid for --- for 10 buck, this is best you gonna get. I used it on my day to day routine-- wouldn&#x27;t recommended it for going out.. etc...</li>
            <li> Not only did I get a great deal but this company also sent me samples of other fragrances and a pocket mirror. I will definately use this company again for purchasing fragrances.</li>
            <li> wow and what a great price, my husband has used this for a long time and I really love getting it at such a great price</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. Nautica Blue has a light, refreshing, non-overpowering smell to it. The only thing that sucks is that it wears off fast, but it&#x27;s an EDT so what do you expect?</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been exploring new scents but, this is a go to fave. Cant go wrong with this one. Great anytime.</li>
            <li> This is what I ordered and liked the smell of it.It was a gift for my husband and he liked the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong colonge,I was looking for Nautica Aqua Rush but accidently ordered Nautica Blue \\&quot;didn&#x27;t look at the picture close enough\\&quot;, ...but it turns out that I actually like this one better.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, it seems like a genuine product but my issue with this is the scent doesn&#x27;t last long IMO.  I put it on before work, and can&#x27;t smell it by lunch time(3-4 hours)</li>
            <li> Excellent. i have no complains what so ever about the product. The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased cologne or perfume before without smelling it first until now.  It was such a great deal I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  Both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised.  It smells great and is a great all around cologne for everyday wear!  I would definitely recommend this scent to anyone!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 year old son. It smells fresh and clean and not too over strong. I would get it again</li>
            <li> For the price, not bad. Does not last as long as say Aramis, but only a 3rd of the price.</li>
            <li> Not too sure how to review cologne, but I like this one a lot. I get compliments frequently when I wear it. Don&#x27;t know what to say. Its a nice product that smells good.</li>
            <li> Has a good  fragrance and doesn&#x27;t bothers people around, because the odor is nice and soft. And best of all is the price, a lot of liquid at a low cost.</li>
            <li> It was perfect. Present for my husband - he loved it and it came very quickly.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this perfume since last 10 years, just love it,&lt;br /&gt;very happy to see the drastic reduction in price over the years,&lt;br /&gt;i used to buy one pack for around 50 bucks, but now i can get  5 for the same price,&lt;br /&gt;just love it&lt;br /&gt;great deal, great product</li>
            <li> he actually wanted the original brand but that was my mistake&lt;br /&gt; i do love the smell and yes it was in original box ect.</li>
            <li> This smells fine for my 13 year old son, but I would recommend for my husband because the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I have gotten my product so early and it is cheaper than any other store....thx a lot. I really like it.</li>
            <li> GOT THIS NAUTICA BLUE 4 MEN ...SMELLS GREAT LOVE IT ...MY MOM ALSO LOVES THE SMELL ...WILL BE BUYING MORE ..THANKS AMAZON...</li>
            <li> Good Choise to this kind of product. I recommended it 100% . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> FOR THE PRICE AND THE SIZE I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY.LOOKING NOW FOR SOME MORE DEALS ON SUM SMELL GOOD.WISH ME LUCK.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite smells, It was an excellent deal for this size bottle and it arrived verry quick.</li>
            <li> This has always been a good cologne with a very nice fragrance. The price here is much better than usual.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, light and oceany scent. Normally I&#x27;m not a fan of the more oceany scents, but this one is great. It&#x27;s very slightly sweet smelling, and has a very crisp , clean and fresh scent. I&#x27;ve smelled some men&#x27;s colognes and sprays that made me gag because they were so heavy and musky - this is definitely not one of those. Very appropriate for any time of the year. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. Smell is amazing and lasts long. Couldnt be better. Highly recomended</li>
            <li> great price loved it bought it for my sons birthday it is one of his favorite colognes to wear yay</li>
            <li> Way too sweet smelling for me.  I&#x27;d almost rather spray Axe or some teenager stuff on myself than this.  Keeping in my truck toolbox as an air freshener at this point.</li>
            <li> The perfume doesn&#x27;t last longer.&lt;br /&gt;On the first day, I anticipated any of my friends would be asking me about the perfume. But was disappointed. :(&lt;br /&gt;I thought of recommending this to my friend initially then I changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether the product is original or not because this is the first time am trying out Nautical Blue.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t look for cheaper product. Better buy the perfumes from the Nautica site.</li>
            <li> This is OK for daily use. I ordered it due to price tag which beats its essence, won&#x27;t recommend if you really want to out-stand the crowd!</li>
            <li> courteous service, I really liked the lotion, what I expected. gladly recommend it. 100% satisfied. the seller was always responsive to my questions. This lotion is sold at a good price with very good quality in the material production.</li>
            <li> Great deal !! I got his one for $10. I liked the smell once when I visited nearer Mall , it was priced $39.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome scent</li>
            <li> I bought this without having a clue what it smelled like, I mean I read the description so I was able to weed out scents I knew I didn&#x27;t like this one had no musk and very little flowery additive. What it did have was a touch of fruit but not too citrusy some sandlewood and cayanne pepper I think.  Anyway if you are reading this I think you know how expensive cologne and perfume is and this one was totally a bargain.  When it arrived, early I might add, I tore open the box and pumped out just a little and like WOW this stuff is just yummy I don&#x27;t know how else to explain it.  Not like it smells like food or anything, but I did want a nibble when hubby put it on. It&#x27;s. Not overpowering or obvious but it does linger wonderfully in the air as well as lasting a good couple of hours without much fade but I&#x27;m sure that depends how active the wearer is. Anyway my point is DEFINITELY GIVE THIS A TRY!  I&#x27;m. Happy I did.....oh and hubby loves it too!</li>
            <li> Took a chance and order this Nautica cologne while it was on sale at Amazon.  Not pleased with the smell.  It has no complexity and doesn&#x27;t have an aroma that I find pleasant.  It has a \\&quot;synthetic\\&quot; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nautica \\&quot;Voyage\\&quot; is one of my favorite daytime colognes for everyday use.  I&#x27;ll pass on Nautica \\&quot;Blue\\&quot; and stick with Nautica \\&quot;Voyage\\&quot; from now on.  Nautica \\&quot;Voyage\\&quot; has the subtle smell of melons and fresh cotton canvas.  I love it as an everyday daytime cologne!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a descent cologne and your budget is low, I recommend this one. This item is so worthy for under $20. Your money is worth every penny on this item..</li>
            <li> This cologne has a top that is dangerous, you cant hardly find out where he product is dispensed which could hit you in the eye.  This bottle is a weird shape which makes it difficult to place on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Past all of that the smell or the fragrance is absolutely nothing, I don&#x27;t know what it smells like other than maybe&lt;br /&gt;alcohol with a hint of something I can&#x27;t quite make out.  I wouldnt recomment it to anybody... by the way it&#x27;s made by Coty they should have put out a better product.</li>
            <li> Adidas Dynamic Pulse By Adidas For Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 3.4-Ounce Bottle&lt;br /&gt;Adidas Dynamic Pulse By Adidas For Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 3.4-Ounce Bottle&lt;br /&gt;Adidas Dynamic Pulse By Adidas For Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 3.4-Ounce Bottle</li>
            <li> Smells better than the cheap $3.00 crap, and just as good as the $50 bottles. Happy with purchase. Not too fruity; a tad musky.</li>
            <li> Bought this for uncle and he called me his friend and wore it, i was glad I could make everyone happy for their holiday.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try something new and I really enjoy the smell. It&#x27;s light so I wear it to work a lot.</li>
            <li> i never buy my fragances without trying them but i took the risk since the price was so cheap... the fragance is ok... not bad... but not that good... also i feel it wears out very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend only if you want to run the risk and because of the cheap price</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these when the pricing was down to $11 or so. The fragrance does not last long but that is what I would expect. The best part for me was that the perfume is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I choose this one for my grandpa because he wanted a perfume but he didn&#x27;t know wich one choose so I did for him</li>
            <li> Nautica Blue is a great light scent that can be worn daily.  I purchased the 3.4Oz bottle and for the price, it&#x27;s tough to beat.</li>
            <li> this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product</li>
            <li> I not surprise with the smell of this perfume. Is soft and dont disturb, but dont surprise anyone. but, if you want to the morning its the perfume. And its exellent for price.</li>
            <li> It arrived VERY quickly and my fiance loved it!! And I&#x27;m glad he did.  I would definitely reccomend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I got this as christmas gift for my brother and he loved it!  I was so concerned since I&#x27;d never smelled it before.  But I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> gift for my son&#x27;s 47th Birthday, and yes I might purchase it again, the cost was reasonable.  Thank you very much</li>
            <li> that parfum for men its very softly and very good for use in a day, its very very nice, and i like it</li>
            <li> Cheep and smells good for the price! I gave five stares because it was a gift for my 12 year old nephew and lord knows he wants to put on a gallon of it in the mornings but this has a mild smell so it&#x27;s not over bearing, how ever it is a Young Mans smell, I would not wear it to work or anything, just my thoughts</li>
            <li> muchas gracias amigo estoy muy contento y satifecho con el producto era mejor de lo q esperba se lo recomiendo a ojos cerrado</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell of this cologne. My family removed themselves from the room I sprayed it in when I opened the Amazon box. :-(</li>
            <li> me gusta el producto porque es suave y tiene un buen aroma el precio  es perfecto se puede comprar hasta ahora</li>
            <li> Brazil - Gramado - Rio Grande do Sul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;does not smell the perfume but for the price is ok I really</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and smell good. Great price for the amount. Will shop again in the future. Perfect gift in the future.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very pleasant to work daily sports and beach but within 2 hours of having applied fades into the body, it is also true that the cost is quite low. I recommend spending a little more and get a better result.</li>
            <li> Growing up, I used to sneak in my brother&#x27;s room and take a couple of sprays of his Nautica cologne.  As an adult, I was given the gift of Nautica Blue, which brought me back to childhood memories.  The classic Nautica scent is still enjoyable, but the Nautica Blue is on a completely different level.  Try it; you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My 5 stars is mainly for the product value. This is a mild perfume and is a great value at this price. I wear it regularly to work and in the evenings if I am going out.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a substance to spray on my body that made me smell better but not worse. This did that for me.</li>
            <li> Excelente vendedor, el pedido llego a tiempo, bien y no hubo problemas de ning&amp;uacute;n tipo durante la entrega.- Lo recomiendo 100 %.-</li>
            <li> My wife likes the smell of Nautica Blue.  What else can I say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy wife, happy life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Nautica for making our marriage even stronger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soar</li>
            <li> Nautica has never really been for me but my boys love it. In the past I&#x27;ve worn this scent and it just doesn&#x27;t stay with me. I guess I&#x27;m too manly or something but I digress; bout these for the kids and no complaints..</li>
