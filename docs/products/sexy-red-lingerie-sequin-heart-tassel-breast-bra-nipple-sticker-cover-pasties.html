            <li> Unfortunately my nipple and areolas are too big for these. They did not cover completely and did not stay on well. I think they would work better for someone with small to average nipples. Absolutely would not work if you had piercings. If the were a little more sticky I think I could&#x27;ve made them work. Too bad because I really liked how they looked.</li>
