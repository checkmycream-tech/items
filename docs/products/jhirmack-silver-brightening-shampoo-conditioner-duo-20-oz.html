            <li>Love Jhirmack Silver Brightening shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so glad Amazon has it</li>
            <li>I like it but don&#x27;t love it, and prefer Clairol.</li>
            <li>Need more volume product.</li>
            <li>A great product, really does make hair beautiful and soft.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, so fresh.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo and conditioner for my 91-year-old mom who has a beautiful head of grey hair.  </li>
            <li>Jhirmack has a unique consistency and fragrance.</li>
            <li>THANKS!!  </li>
            <li>WAS NOT AS GOOD AS PREVIOUS JHIRMACK SILVER SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER PRODUCT I USED.  </li>
            <li>I have one hundred percent white hair, &amp; this product enhances the colour to a lovely moonlight glow, my husband also uses it .I</li>
            <li>Was delivered quickly and was more than I expected.</li>
            <li>It did not improve the volume of my extra fine hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my gray color either.  </li>
            <li>It was most of what I expected.</li>
            <li>going back to salon brands which are twice the price, but I only use them once per week, as they are a much higher quality and are therefore  the more budget savvy choice</li>
            <li>Reduces yellow tint to grey hair and provides nice shine.</li>
            <li>This seems like a watered down version of the Jhirmack in the silver bottles for gray hair, that I really love.</li>
            <li>About 6 months ago she decided to try another product but quickly went back to Jhirmack.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend...</li>
            <li>A new hairdresser asked me who colored my hair, and could not believe I was doing it myself at home from a box.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t want to smell like old lady and that&#x27;s what this smells like...</li>
            <li>Brings out the beauty of natural hair color.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li>This shampoo keeps my hair clean without any harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li>DIDN&#x27;[T GIVE MY GREY HAIR MUCH SHINE APPEAL.  </li>

            <li> DIDN&#x27;[T GIVE MY GREY HAIR MUCH SHINE APPEAL.  </li>
            <li> It still works,  my hair is soft, manageable and shiny and unlike some of the other products in the beauty stores, it does not turn my hair blue.</li>
            <li> It helps keep the color from yellowing and softens the sometimes coarse grey hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried Clairols version and Didnt like it at all, left my hair to dry feeling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grey...</li>
            <li> All the younger folks in the house are blondish...and we ran out of other shampoo..</li>
            <li> One of the few grey hair shampoos that does not turn your hair blue!</li>
            <li> It seemed to do the job just as well as other brands.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat thick and a bit gritty, but the results are noticeable.</li>
            <li> Consistency of products appears to be thinner and less dense than previous bottles we have had.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding it in this area, so Amazon ...&amp;#34;two thumbs up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it dried out my hair and made it frizzy.</li>
            <li> Mom has been using this product for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few brands of purple shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> a hard to find product ,  was always on store shelves.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find this product in stores.  </li>
            <li> This time, at age 60, I decided to stop dying my hair again, and had a hard time finding  this product in the stores.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is so thin</li>
            <li> wrong...</li>
            <li> I AM DISAPPOINTED.  </li>

            <li> This shampoo is so thin it&#x27;s like water and it doesn&#x27;t suds up good at all. I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my gray color either.  it dried out my hair and made it frizzy.I would not  recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner has kept my silver hair shiny, soft and beautiful! One of the few grey hair shampoos that does not turn your hair blue! I will use this always!</li>
            <li> Love Jhirmack Silver Brightening shampoo.  Takes about a month of use befor you get the brightness, but it works and leaves my hair very nice.  I love the way it smells, so fresh.  I tried Clairols version and Didnt like it at all, left my hair to dry feeling.  Highly recommend...so glad Amazon has it I can&#x27;t find this in stores.</li>
            <li> I color my blonde hair myself. A new hairdresser asked me who colored my hair, and could not believe I was doing it myself at home from a box. It is somewhat thick and a bit gritty, but the results are noticeable.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner for my 91-year-old mom who has a beautiful head of grey hair.  She loves the way this product keeps her hair looking shiny.

            <li> Makes my hair shiny and soft</li>

            <li> It was most of what I expected. It did not improve the volume of my extra fine hair. Need more volume product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been gray since I was in my 20s, but I&#x27;ve colored it for years.  I decided once to allow to gray to come through, but I changed my mind and colored it again.  I used this product once before and my hair was beautiful and silvery.  This time, at age 60, I decided to stop dying my hair again, and had a hard time finding  this product in the stores.  It still works,  my hair is soft, manageable and shiny and unlike some of the other products in the beauty stores, it does not turn my hair blue.</li>
