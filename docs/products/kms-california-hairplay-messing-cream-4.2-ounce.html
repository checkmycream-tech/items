            <li>Great stuff,</li>
            <li>These products smell great, but make my layered, chin-length hair look and feel like straw.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all shiney like gels do.  </li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant scent.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>This is a great hair product if you want your hair to have some texture, look natural and feel like hair instead of plastic.</li>
            <li>I find using on my hair when wet before drying works best, then I use a smidge after drying to touch up.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled and I am also thrilled that it costs less here on amazon and amazons service has always been good.</li>
            <li>Works great on short hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for my new short haircut!</li>
            <li>I will say my beautician is the one who recommended this hair play and usually most times what they recommend is only as good as right after getting the haircut and her styling it.</li>
            <li>but yet you have  clean head of hair.</li>
            <li>it will immediately look full and piecey and within two hours i am walking around with my hair stuck to my head…</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great tool for adding texture and body to limp hair.</li>
            <li>another fun product from KMS.</li>
            <li>KMS products are worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I do wish it added a little shine, but overall the product is great!</li>
            <li>Just a little pea size and you are good to go for men&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>This has been a lifesaver to wash my hair, dry it, rub some product in my hands and run hands through hair upward on sides and top.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both use this product and we really like it.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than $19-$30 you pay at salons or Ulta.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this messing creme does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have no complaint of either.</li>
            <li>Whether I&#x27;m styling with wet or dry hair, this product gives me a great hold all day long, without the look of having used product.  </li>
            <li>Provides just the right hold/body and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>A very versatile product for men&#x27;s short hair styles or women&#x27;s longer, curly hair style.</li>
            <li>Use the hairplay spray wax frequently.</li>
            <li>It works just as well on my husband&#x27;s short hair as it does on my chin-length, naturally curly hair.</li>

            <li> This size product will probably last me over a year - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, especially if one adds a drop of water to their palms &amp; spreads that through their hair after applying this product.</li>

            <li> Have tried other hair cremes</li>
            <li> and I just throw it on my wish list and wait for it to drop down in the sub $13 range before I buy it.  </li>
            <li> I mean a really long way and your hair has the day after having been washed texture</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use this everyday</li>
            <li> This is my go-to for a perfectly messy pixie.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product under the sun througout the years and with my thick hair not much would work the way I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> i used to use a product called dirty works 10 years ago…it was discontinued and I have been on a search for a product like it since…I have short layered shoulder length hair…it will lie flat leaving the cut looking boring…</li>
            <li> Usually I would put a product in my hair (and I have hundreds)  </li>
            <li> I personally like a dirty funky messy look</li>

            <li> My hairdresser turned me onto this.  I have short hair and use this to add texture and style.  This size product will probably last me over a year - a little goes a long way.  It also has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Great for adding texture...another fun product from KMS. I won&#x27;t use this everyday but I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> i used to use a product called dirty works 10 years ago…it was discontinued and I have been on a search for a product like it since…I have short layered shoulder length hair…it will lie flat leaving the cut looking boring…I personally like a dirty funky messy look…this product does it all…you will not wake up the next day with greasy hair…i am so sold on this…it has been forever since I have truly been satisfied with a product.  Usually I would put a product in my hair (and I have hundreds)  it will immediately look full and piecey and within two hours i am walking around with my hair stuck to my head…I say…go for it…give it a try….</li>
            <li> I love this product and order it often.  Have tried other hair cremes but this one&#x27;s hold is good...</li>
            <li> Works great on short hair.</li>
            <li> Awsome for rainy locations resets when your hair drys again. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> KMS products are worth the investment. I have very fine hair and this messing creme does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Just a little pea size and you are good to go for men&#x27;s hair.  Provides just the right hold/body and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Alittle goes along way. I mean a really long way and your hair has the day after having been washed texture but yet you have  clean head of hair. Before I tried this hair play I was always having troubles finding something to do what I needed it to do and spending a lot of money in the process. Not anymore. I am thrilled and I am also thrilled that it costs less here on amazon and amazons service has always been good. I have no complaint of either. I will say my beautician is the one who recommended this hair play and usually most times what they recommend is only as good as right after getting the haircut and her styling it. Well, as I said this is one product you would not be disasatisfied with. I do have short hair by the way.</li>
            <li> A very versatile product for men&#x27;s short hair styles or women&#x27;s longer, curly hair style. My husband and I both use this product and we really like it. It works just as well on my husband&#x27;s short hair as it does on my chin-length, naturally curly hair. A little goes a long way, especially if one adds a drop of water to their palms &amp; spreads that through their hair after applying this product. We&#x27;re very pleased with this product and would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> This has been a lifesaver to wash my hair, dry it, rub some product in my hands and run hands through hair upward on sides and top.  Otherwise I spend an hour with a curling iron to get some body and lift, though I use product then also.  This is good stuff for styling my hair in a jiffy.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes me feel like I&#x27;ve got someone else&#x27;s hair!  It&#x27;s a great tool for adding texture and body to limp hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Say goodbye to your gels and mousses.. you won&#x27;t be needing those anymore. This is my go-to for a perfectly messy pixie.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product if you want your hair to have some texture, look natural and feel like hair instead of plastic.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have used for my short hair! It&#x27;s lightweight and non-greasy. I do wish it added a little shine, but overall the product is great! I find using on my hair when wet before drying works best, then I use a smidge after drying to touch up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 6 months and I can&#x27;t see myself using anything else.  Whether I&#x27;m styling with wet or dry hair, this product gives me a great hold all day long, without the look of having used product.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives my hair the look I want, sassy and short. I can leave my hair the same day 2 also. Great stuff,</li>
            <li> Bought this and KMS Hairplay molding paste.  These products smell great, but make my layered, chin-length hair look and feel like straw.  Not for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all shiney like gels do.  I have tried every product under the sun througout the years and with my thick hair not much would work the way I wanted it to.  My buddy owns his own salon and he uses this and recommended it when he was cutting my hair for my wedding.  I have been using it for over a year now and I just throw it on my wish list and wait for it to drop down in the sub $13 range before I buy it.  Much cheaper than $19-$30 you pay at salons or Ulta.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my new short haircut! Buying it from Amazon rather than my local salon saved me a fai amount of money!</li>
            <li> I love this KMS line of styling products. Use the hairplay spray wax frequently.</li>
