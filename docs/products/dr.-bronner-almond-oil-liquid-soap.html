            <li>But if you use it to dish wash or cloths wash manually it works excellent., but it will leave your hair a bit sticky feeling because of the oils.</li>

            <li>The smell is pleasantly minty, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant and can be used as soap or shampoo or as bath bubbles.</li>
            <li>It is great soap, I love it!</li>
            <li>I also admire the way this company operates and all of the good they do in the world.</li>
            <li>This was in April somewhere in Colorado and we came to a gorgeous stream.</li>
            <li>It works as a good cleaning detergent for household purposes, but a NO NO for the body.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it to wash my brushes, and my clients rave about how good the lavender scent smells.</li>
            <li>Good product at a good price one line.</li>
            <li>Still good stuff</li>
            <li>Smells good?</li>
            <li>Good as body soap as well and even for laundry.</li>
            <li>it is good stuff</li>
            <li>Olive oil mayo is a good choice and will help distribute some of the oil throughout the hair.</li>
            <li>The bottle mentions that it&#x27;s good for a massage, too, but I haven&#x27;t tried that.  </li>
            <li>If you clean with this, you won&#x27;t need air freshener because it leaves a wonderful peppermint smell.</li>
            <li>Great for the Summer to cool your skin!!</li>
            <li>soap is okay, the lather is alright, but the smell is awesome, i love it.</li>
            <li>I love this soap,It is great as a shampoo, but you have to find a balance that works for you.</li>
            <li>Great product for many uses.</li>
            <li>It smells great, my favorite smell is Peppermint.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, feelings amazing, cleans amazing, and seemingly lasts forever!</li>
            <li>This product must have a great marketing team because so many people rant and rave about it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and cleans up nicely - the smell is good too...</li>
            <li>soap works into a very rich lather and smells very nice.</li>
            <li>skin is happy and soft without any itching or burning, and it turns out this soap is even great for shaving my legs!</li>
            <li>the scent is refreshing &amp; not over powering my family loves it!</li>
            <li>and it is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li>This peppermint soap is TOTALLY refreshing !</li>
            <li>but my favorite use for it is as a Shampoo!</li>
            <li>but if you want it to feel more like \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo this will do the trick! ]</li>
            <li>There is nothing better!</li>
            <li>Refreshing peppermint!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this peppermint soap!   </li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Love the soap!</li>
            <li>What more could you want?!</li>
            <li>I love this brand!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the peppermint smell!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>But I use it (and love it!)</li>
            <li>This soap is safe to go in the mouth and is even somewhat pleasant</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves this stuff  and it does a great job cleaning his body without leaving a strong scent afterwards.</li>
            <li>Great soap - does not leave residue like body washes do - easy to rinse off, and cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and how fresh it makes me feel!!!!</li>
            <li>This soap has an amazing scent.  </li>
            <li>I said it was amazing with a headache.</li>
            <li>Seriously Amazing.</li>
            <li>i use it on everything that i can think of and the peppermint smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>tried Bronner&#x27;s for cleaning anything else beyond my own body</li>
            <li>It is a surprisingly effective face wash.</li>
            <li>I use this soap in my liquid soap dispensers, but it&#x27;s handy for a number of uses.</li>
            <li>works!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been making my own homemade household cleaner with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this to make my own peppermint sugar foot scrubs.</li>
            <li>Everybody should try this and have their own experience with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice knowing</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing like a burst of refreshment after you put it on in the shower or a warm bath.</li>
            <li>also nice and a 5 star produdct.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really nice.</li>
            <li>Cuts grease like a boss and has a nice aroma.</li>
            <li>When all is said and done, I have no idea how this soap has become so popular.  </li>
            <li>have a real jerk of a cat that seems to think the best way to express his displeasure is to pee in the kitchen.</li>
            <li>I have tried the almond soap but not as thrilled as I was with the peppermint.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m not just filling the air with chemical fragrances than can linger in my home for days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought them for years and this one smells nice, too.</li>
            <li>Plus its covered with some kind of hokey new-age junk.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice tingling sensation when used as a bath soap.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful sweet peppermint smell, and the tingle isn&#x27;t too strong for me.</li>
            <li>the scents offered, I imagine there are a multitude of great scents you could combine - Eucalyptus/Peppermint/Citrus would be a great flu time soap, Lavender/TeaTree make a great herbal combo, Citrus/Almond would make a good winter mix... and those tiny bottles make for fun mixing on a budget!</li>
            <li>Favorite summer soap, very refreshing</li>
            <li>Love this soap but the Peppermint is probably not the best for washing your body...and certain areas.  </li>
            <li>I love it, good for so many things.  </li>
            <li>Luckily Dr. Bronner&#x27;s work great.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to dilute as it is quite potent!</li>
            <li>i love peppermint and nice</li>
            <li>Refreshing, invigorating and leaves my skin looking amazing.</li>
            <li>The rose also is lovely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you want a soap that is both healthy and effective, you can&#x27;t do better than this.</li>
            <li>But Jammer and I felt so clean and refreshed from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, and I know from the peppermint aroma, we had to smell good to.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;ll also be good for emergencies, when I don&#x27;t have body wash, shampoo, tooth paste, or if I need it to clean something</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bronner&#x27;s carries two of my all-time favorite scents - peppermint and lavender, both of which were reported to be *very* strong.</li>
            <li>Smells great and is pretty tingle-y</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great in a hot steamy shower because the peppermint gives off those refreshing vapors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this works best when used as a pre-wash on my hair followed by a second wash with my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Enjoying this soap.</li>
            <li>this is my go-to stress relief magic bottle</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps for many years now and love his products.</li>
            <li>Nutrients are richest in the skin of many fruits and vegetables.</li>
            <li>cannot recommend this soap more.</li>
            <li>But I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I will in time.</li>
            <li>I find it refreshing.</li>
            <li>I still take meds for the pain but not as many.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>My favorite soap for hand washing.</li>
            <li>Only the best.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li>The peppermint smell is delicious, and I swear it actually makes me feel more awake in the morning</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The smells is great, just like peppermint, and it lathers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in bar form requires more lye to chemically alter a greater percentage of the fats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
            <li>It lathers much better than most natural/organic liquid soaps I have used.</li>
            <li>It lathers much better than most natural/organic liquid soaps I have used.</li>
            <li>Not only is its smell is wonderful</li>
            <li>I love all of Dr. Bronner soap.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I remembered it from many years ago</li>
            <li>I grabbed a wash cloth, a towel, my bottle of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap (which was safe to use in streams) and jumped into the stream at which point I thought my heart would stop.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it again.</li>
            <li>The peppermint is my personal favorite, but all the scents are wonderful.</li>
            <li>BUT it works much better when diluted.</li>
            <li>Below is a great shampoo recipe - it also functions as an amazingly moisturizing body wash AND is my all time favorite NATURAL pet shampoo.</li>
            <li>liquid Castile Soap - your favorite scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner Soap for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is refreshing and it does not leave any soapy residue on your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still love this brand because they are cruelty free!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff for 20 years; hope to use it for many many more.</li>
            <li>Here is where I added 2 ounces of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soap Peppermint.  </li>
            <li>This soap has SUCH a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I understand the majority of it but its something to read :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love all these scents, but the peppermint is my favorite.</li>
            <li>, it would be that I&#x27;d love to have more scents to play with - maybe some spicy scents like cinnamon, clove, or ginger, and soothing scents like sandalwood, vanilla, and chamomile, and maybe even some rosemary and patchouli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it would be that I&#x27;d love to have more scents to play with - maybe some spicy scents like cinnamon, clove, or ginger, and soothing scents like sandalwood, vanilla, and chamomile, and maybe even some rosemary and patchouli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>idea of single-scent natural soaps that I could buy off the shelf and mix to my liking makes me far more happy than it should :D</li>
            <li>Natural, great minty smell and effective cleaner.  </li>
            <li>It opens up your pores for that refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>This works very well and smells great.</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s also has lavender, almond, and eucalyptus versions, but the peppermint is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say than that.</li>
            <li>I use this soap to wash my body and I love the way I feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>Many many uses for this soap.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>Use it for my dreadlocks but it is really just an all around great bio-friendly soap to use.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just as pleased with this one as I was before.</li>
            <li>Liquid castile soap (like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) has a pH around 8.9, which is much more alkaline and can cause itchy/dry scalp and skin.</li>
            <li>You can find many shampoo recipes online, many of which incorporate Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, but look for those that are PH-balanced for your scalp and skin.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus.</li>
            <li>Has sooo many uses.</li>
            <li>over all its an ok product i might buy again</li>
            <li>Love this liquid soap.</li>
            <li>Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products &amp; you</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has always been one of my favorite soaps.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the liquid soap way better.  </li>
            <li>but that was a more bluish in color soap.</li>
            <li>in the shower, it&#x27;s top notch</li>
            <li>I have eczema and many soaps irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love 4 ever Thank You</li>
            <li>This product wasn&#x27;t necessarily the best for my skin, it was somewhat drying and it didn&#x27;t help nor harm my acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit watery when diluted, but it still works fantastic!</li>
            <li>Just go to Target and get one there than you think is cute, use all that soap and begin to use it.</li>
            <li>fill a spray bottle mostly with water and add some peppermint Castile soap and tea tree oil for antibacterial.</li>
            <li>I love my Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint bar soap, so I thought I would try the liquid for my kitchen and bathroom use, and it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Something</li>
            <li>Citrus is just ok...and Eucalyptus is just ok...</li>
            <li>I might try another bottle, but I feel it&#x27;s overly priced, and more of a novelty than anything.</li>
            <li>It sure made things easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the results.</li>
            <li>&quot; that is most noticeable on metallic items...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s organic and safe...</li>
            <li>and if you just run your sponge over it real quick and rinse, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>I love this soap...</li>
            <li>I see many people who say this dries their hair when using it as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>The more I used it (took about 3-4 shampoos), the better my hair looked and felt.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 16 oz bottle of this nifty gifty as part of my research for when I&#x27;m out and about traveling. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more of a \\&quot;function over fashion\\</li>
            <li>I love the soap but wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I use it for everything.</li>
            <li>but wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After reading many reviews</li>
            <li>I was determined to use Dr Bronners Magic soap (diluted) as a shampoo</li>
            <li>I had hoped that I could use this as a rinse after the magic soap as I had read</li>
            <li>I love the peppermint tingle too.</li>
            <li>IT IS DEFINITELY REFRESHING AND TINGLING FOR SURE.</li>
            <li>I wish I was not since I am trying to be organic more and this would have really been great.</li>
            <li>This is soooo refreshing.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel so clean and gives a nice cooling effect.</li>
            <li>Love this pure gentle soap and the wonderful peppermint scent.</li>
            <li>It leaves you feeling very clean and</li>
            <li>When diluted with enough water the tingle you feel on your face is very pleasant and not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let’s just say I was happy my trail partners brought along normal toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>And remember, if any of the Bronner&#x27;s soap is ever too strong, just mix it with some Baby Unscented to mellow it out :)</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff so much, and it&#x27;s so good for the environment and for people.</li>
            <li>Good scent, cleans very well, quite satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Use it as a face wash as well and it feels so tingly and leaves my face feeling &amp; looking clean!</li>
            <li>Makes you smell great, and doesn&#x27;t clean things very well.</li>
            <li>It is great as a body wash and shampoo, and will rinse off completely.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle to try, and am really not all that impressed.</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is a great product for natural cleaning.</li>
            <li>It does work to create a nice foamy potion, so that was a success.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for a whole bunch of things that I have not tried yet but</li>
            <li>It does not take much to develop a good lather</li>
            <li>I loved this stuff so much, I purchased the lavender as well.</li>
            <li>In fact, today I actually used it on a scrubbing sponge to give the shower a quick once over &amp; it cleaned the shower perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The soap is outstanding, a great value, very gentle, really an affordable luxury.  </li>
            <li>There are other fragrances, but we think peppermint is the best.  </li>
            <li>You actually feel good using this stuff!</li>
            <li>I also wanted to reduce my footprint in the wilderness using a more environmentally friendly product.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the peppermint scent is wonderful, invigorating, and tingly!</li>
            <li>In the hot weather or after working out, I use this as a body wash in the shower, it is so refreshing and exhilirating!</li>
            <li>It leaves your body tingling and cool when you get out of the shower which is awesome when you live somewhere hot and humid.</li>
            <li>The peppermint feels the best (if you also like that tingly clean feeling of goodness), the tea tree oil really helps keep my skin clear, and the lavender is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It smells like peppermint candy and rinses off cleanly, without a filmy, slippery feeling many liquid soaps leave.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel super clean, and minty tingle is amazing.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday in the gym and it is so refreshing and the best part is it is both body soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this product and its at such a great price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can&#x27;t use it as dishwasher liquid or laundry detergent because it lathers too easily.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use it as dishwasher liquid or laundry detergent because it lathers too easily.</li>
            <li>I hike with this soap because it&#x27;s easily biodegradable and multi-purpose.</li>
            <li>It takes hair wax well and is easy to style.</li>
            <li>This is found everywhere so easy to come by as well.</li>
            <li>When I bought Dr. Bronners, I did the same thing and the smell was gone, replaced with the peppermint scent of the soap, which is a welcome addition. :)</li>
            <li>It is a strong acid that chemically binds to fat and permanently alters it&#x27;s chemical composition, creating nitro glycerine etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
            <li>but the smell was strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda like the feeling you get when you breathe thru your nose after you just ate a strong peppermint.</li>
            <li>It is strong and wakes me up in the morning</li>
            <li>The peppermint is strong but delicious smelling and if you are sick or congested, this is a wonderful way to temporarily relieve your congestion in the shower.</li>
            <li>Happy Shopping :O)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s runnier than most liquid soaps, so keep that in mind when pouring it out.</li>
            <li>Cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Getting in the shower and feeling that cool tingle is just refreshing.</li>
            <li>Hands down best tasting soap I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>I especially love it in the summer when it hot outside.</li>
            <li>and you can feel good about supporting a company that believes in doing right by the world.</li>
            <li>aside from that, it&#x27;s just a fantastic soap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply fantastic.</li>
            <li>sound almost like I work for the company, but I swear I</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic soap.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great soap.</li>
            <li>It works as a house cleaner, a personal cleaner, and a it is a great biodegradable backpacking soap.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the coolness that the peppermint leaves on my skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever purchase the bar when the liquid is available.</li>
            <li>do not make the same mistake, lol.</li>
            <li>Dr Bronners (I use peppermint for everything because you get it dirt cheap at Trader Joe&#x27;s: $9.99 for 32oz--YES, $9.99)&lt;br /&gt;1/8c</li>
            <li>lightly...</li>
            <li>If you care about what you put on your skin and hair, then THIS is for you as it comes &#x27;chemical free&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I augment it with some baking soda which is really cheap.</li>
            <li>I augment it with some baking soda which is really cheap.</li>
            <li>I try to get different scented ones because the soaps lasts quite a while and has a great lather.</li>
            <li>But hey, it cleans the mouth/teeth, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>so a bottle of this size is great value and will last a while.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily, it did not leak and I enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% natural, biodegradable, not tested on animals, supports Fair Trade, ingredients are certified organic, and the bottle is made from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic.</li>
            <li>Peppermint is really refreshing with a mild, sweet lingering scent.</li>
            <li>Interesting right?</li>
            <li>Cleans better than any other body wash, feels and smells great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and the peppermint is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love this soap very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on my skin which is kind of sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Soap itself is just barely more viscous than water, easy to use too much (if trying to ration)  </li>
            <li>I am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this soap because I wanted an environmentally friendly body wash, and it has blown me away.</li>
            <li>idea of single-scent natural soaps that I could buy off the shelf and mix to my liking makes me far more happy than it should :</li>
            <li>If you are around fresh water, nothing beats Dr. Brommer!  </li>
            <li>Take a clean wash cloth and soak it and then apply to face.</li>
            <li>Works for cleaning anything you need to clean, including my, dishes, laundry, etc...</li>
            <li>You feel so clean and refreshed after use.</li>
            <li>(literally) clean  </li>
            <li>Me, I like my soap scented just enough to be pleasant and leave a lingering clean smell - if someone can point out what I specifically smell like</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll use it to clean up my kitties.</li>
            <li>Just recently, I thoroughly cleaned my trash can with this fantastic product, with superior results.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean makeup brushes and my sons hair.</li>
            <li>I feel so clean and refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean now.</li>
            <li>I used it to clean my person, wash dishes and even to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now using it to clean all my jewelry.   </li>
            <li>squirt peppermint Castile soap and clean out.</li>
            <li>I use it to bathe, clean my makeup brushes and to scrub the bathtub.  </li>
            <li>Just chew some gum or clean your palette with something else if it&#x27;s unbearable.</li>
            <li>excellent product, fast delivery, works as expected.</li>
            <li>really makes you feel good after taking a shower or bath with it makes your whole body feel rejuvenated</li>
            <li>Pleasant shopping experience, I will definitely be a repeat costumer of this seller.</li>
            <li>In fact it is soft and shiny and I love it!</li>
            <li>Pleasant in scent, soft, and tough on dirt and stains, it&#x27;s the perfect combination of &#x27;clean.&#x27;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp the way most shampoos do.</li>
            <li>I lifted the stain right out of my pants!</li>
            <li>Love the fresh smell of the peppermint and the pure quality of the soap!</li>
            <li>As I mentioned, I have fine hair, and therefore I don&#x27;t need much product and it&#x27;s easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>After showing you feel so cool</li>
            <li>The smell is awsome, once out the shower I felt super clean and relaxed.</li>
            <li>using this as a shampoo, regular conditioner will not do one bit of good.</li>
            <li>There is a fascinating documentary about his life.  </li>
            <li>Everything in here is organic and natural, a nice change of pace compared to a lot of bar soaps.  </li>
            <li>I did feel super clean after using it, but it wasn&#x27;t a miracle product in that respect.</li>
            <li>The peppermint SMELLS just like peppermint, the Eucalyptus does NOT smell that much of&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus...NOT sure why???&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner was a cool dude, no doubt ahead of his time.</li>
            <li>With just the three drops, it foams up quickly and feels and tastes clean.</li>
            <li>With just the three drops, it foams up quickly and feels and tastes clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fed up with all of these beauty products which claim to be natural or even organic, yet have nice list of chemicals on their ingredient</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap washes away your old oils, and leaves its pure plant based oils and a pleasant scent depending on which one you choose.</li>
            <li>it is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great as a natural deodorant and not much is needed, it is just as good as tom&#x27;s of main and burts</li>
            <li>It is great as a natural deodorant and not much is needed, it is just as good as tom&#x27;s of main and burts bees.  </li>
            <li>leaves everything clean and fresh smelling with no residue.  </li>
            <li>My house smells naturally fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, and for the price, well worth it to go for the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see myself not being a loyal customer of this item.</li>
            <li>The day after, I spilled some coffee on a pair of white sweatpants, yes - WHITE sweatpants, and this worked wonderfully, too!</li>
            <li>B0029XNTEU Church &amp; Dwight Co 03020 Arm &amp; Hammer Super Washing Soda]].</li>
            <li>body related *more flashbacks to shower incident*.etely eliminates odors, better than anything I used before I discovered Castile</li>
            <li>Many uses, so highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The very first day after shampooing with this (no conditioner), I took a brush to my hair expecting tangles.</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing especially after a swim at the beach.  </li>
            <li>But when a person is able to bring as many 3 oz bottles that can fit comfortably in a zip lock bag, there&#x27;s really no point in JUST bringing Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, which is what I was interested in.</li>
            <li>the reviews I&#x27;d read, however, a large number of people commented on the extremely strong smell of the soaps.</li>
            <li>Since reading the label and the teachings of Dr. Bronner (&amp;#34;Each swallow works hard to be perfect pilot-provider-builder-trainer-teacher-lover-mate, no half-true hate!&amp;#34;) I have decided to start a cult.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it organic, it is fair trade, and it is higher quality than those &#x27;fancy&#x27; body washes you find in beauty stores.</li>
            <li>I use full strength PEPPERMINT Castile soap and it completely eliminates odors, better than anything I used before I discovered Castile soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The peppermint is mild and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>Pretty much more of what has been said, it really does cool you down in hot climate and engages your sense of smell as well, great stuff.  </li>
            <li>, so trying new soaps doesn&#x27;t work all that well for me, but I got a free sample and the person that recommended it was very adamant about how much she loved it</li>
            <li>It has multiple uses and smells &amp; feels refreshing!  </li>
            <li>After spending soooo much money on Natures Miracle, I accidentally used this on my kitchen tile and voila!!</li>
            <li>It took very little to wash in the sink and my clothes got clean and smelled great</li>
            <li>Next, when using a loofah it builds an amazing lather.</li>
            <li>I eventually got to a lightly minty herbal scent that was absolutely perfect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap washes off completely and I feel safe doing this (whereas before, I was using Palmolive).</li>
            <li>I would have to say that all the research I completed before buying this product was worth it</li>
            <li>I finally purchased this soap after reading all of the good reviews, and watching the documentary based on Dr. Bronner (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap Box).</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it</li>
            <li>Better than what I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier on the skin than sodium tallowate, the #1 ingredient in nearly all bar soaps, which is nothing more than animal fat that has had lye added to it to saponify</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronners castille peppermint soap provides a nice tingle in the shower for regular bathing.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>and the bottles fun to read....</li>
            <li>, the bottle is very interesting reading if you take long showers/baths.</li>
            <li>the soap is good, a few drops are enough and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>Also useful for cleaning counters, tub/shower, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have tried these soaps in peppermint, tea tree oil, and lavender, I love them all so far.</li>
            <li>fresh scent and a powerful cleaner.</li>
            <li>However, it wasn&#x27;t until 3 months ago that I actually bought my own.</li>
            <li>Then she states that the natural oils will then be able to penetrate the hair.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Cleans well - clothes and full body, tons of soapy suds, leaves you smelling fresh and gives you an amazing tingle (must be the menthol) but be careful...</li>
            <li>This is right on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will wake you right up and cruelty-free</li>
            <li>I have noticed that since my family has been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap in the shower, that I don&#x27;t have to clean the shower grout very often.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, the label creeps me out a little bit, but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating.</li>
            <li>and if I wanted more foam and a stronger scent I can just add more soap and less</li>
            <li>and since I work near a Trader Joe&#x27;s with super cheap peppermint Castile, my cleaning routine is 95% peppermint, except when it comes to anything</li>
            <li>and since I work near a Trader Joe&#x27;s with super cheap peppermint Castile, my cleaning routine is 95% peppermint, except when it comes to anything</li>
            <li>Great stuff, but use in small quantities.  </li>
            <li>I dumped out that batch and put about 2t soap to a small 8 oz foam dispenser and my hands are happy now.</li>
            <li>The peppermint wakes you right up in the morning and gets you ready to go!</li>
            <li>I had my hopes high for this soap, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It is mild leaving my face clean but not dried out.  </li>
            <li>I fill a spray bottle with water, a few squirts of castile soap, and tea tree and lavender essential oils, which makes a great kitchen counter cleaner!</li>
            <li>The soap is very strong by it self, so if you have a long day and you were stinky</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully fragrant, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>However, if it&#x27;s a sticky, humid,rainy, hot day, I wouldnt recommend it because it can make it seem sticky.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased it for camping as it is non polluting.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed when opening the box up</li>
            <li>I do notice that Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap is quite a bit thinner than I remember it being when I first tried it.  </li>
            <li>, I will be purchasing more of it in the future.</li>
            <li>That is more likely to occur in bar soap.</li>
            <li>make sure u put on enough lotion, or you will become ashy...</li>
            <li>I washed her first</li>
            <li>You barely need more than a drop for much of anything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2 cups of hot water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix</li>
            <li>I made my first batch of diy laundry detergent this morning.  </li>
            <li>smells refreshing especially if you use it with the SOAPY SOLES foot scrubber!&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>On to try the other many uses!</li>
            <li>(;-)</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll really wake you up!</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore the scent of peppermint - think aromatherapy!  </li>
            <li>was this is the first time I&#x27;ve been bam boozo!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fill bottle 1/3 way with water first, then add Dr Bronners (I use Almond--</li>
            <li>body related *more flashbacks to shower incident*.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I decided to replace my chemical-laden hygiene products with safer ones - relying on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database to guide me to a better place.</li>
            <li>you probably need more if you don&#x27;t have short guy hair like me.</li>
            <li>I love this peppermint soap and find that it can be used for various things.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was mainly interested in how well it cleans the body, how well it acts as shampoo, soap, tooth paste, and cleaning laundry.</li>
            <li>;D</li>
            <li>:) It&#x27;s definitely not something to knock points off of this product.</li>
            <li>I keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>This can get very sudsy, so use sparingly!</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t actually pay for this product!!</li>
            <li>What else is good is that when using it, it tingles the body after a few seconds AND it smells just like candy canes.</li>
            <li>Like many soaps, it does get a little gunked up around the spout, but it&#x27;s an easy fix (you just have to wipe the spout from time to time).</li>
            <li>If you wanna live that minty fresh life, Dr. B&#x27;S peppermint will have you tingling in all the right places.</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s can be great added to a DIY recipe for personal care products, but it has an incorrect PH balance for your scalp/hair and skin by itself, so most recipes for personal care products that include Dr. Bronner&#x27;s also include other ingredients.</li>
            <li>You only need a TINY bit to get a good</li>
            <li>As a guy, I am disappointed that many environmentally friendly hygiene products are oriented towards women, so I&#x27;m also really happy that I&#x27;ve found something that both men and women can use.</li>
            <li>Well, today, I pretty much use it for everything but in my dishwasher Here</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling cleaning, and the refreshing tingle lasts long after the bath or shower.  </li>
            <li>been toned down just a bit, but you still get that nice &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; to your scalp and skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for children or for people who have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(if you are struggling with breakouts I strongly suggest giving this a try), and it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to keep my seborrheic dermatitis at bay</li>
            <li>I had a worn down, not so great smelling pair of shorts that I washed with vinegar, but the stench was still present.</li>
            <li>I broke out a large glass pitcher and started mixing.</li>
            <li>Since it is pure soap I used it as a shampoo plus a body wash.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this natural soap!</li>
            <li>The standard dilution here of about 20% soap to 80% water works fine.</li>
            <li>This does contain coconut oil which can be somewhat drying (as compared to a pure olive oil Castile soap), but it certainly is more gentle than the synthetic detergents in traditional shampoos (including ones which claim to be natural).</li>
            <li>Especially having found out that they can create HUGE amounts of sulphur in the body which leads to malabsorption.</li>
            <li>Cleans really well without that soapy residue afterwards.</li>
            <li>I draped the wrung out cloth over my daughter&#x27;s face and gave her a gentle temple rub.  </li>
            <li>The tingle on my face was also very invigorating.</li>
            <li>Lye is very acidic.</li>
            <li>Have to dilute with water, its concentrated, and doesnt take much to get job done.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much (I&#x27;m not kidding,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a multipurpose cleaner</li>
            <li>It can be used straight out of the bottle</li>
            <li>Lye aka Sodium Hydroxide can be very damaging.</li>
            <li>It can really heat up non exposed areas.</li>
            <li>it gets rid of the stench really well.</li>
            <li>I like it, my husband doesn&#x27;t for that very reason.</li>
            <li>It really did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>Still smells the same, and still has fantastic organic ingredients, but its watery.</li>
            <li>The peppermint really does leave your skin tingly.  </li>
            <li>About 4 or 5 months ago I decided to go simple with my cleansers and had always been perplexed by Dr Bronners...</li>
            <li>Too much soap</li>
            <li>but really dries my skin out.</li>
            <li>As much as I&#x27;d like to, I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love this soap for cleaning the shower tub sinks.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend&#x27;s hair did not appreciate this method as much as mine did</li>
            <li>My girlfriend&#x27;s hair did not appreciate this method as much as mine did</li>
            <li>I am used to the Whole Foods brand of castile soap, which is a lot thicker than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s works just as well.</li>
            <li>Has a very soapy quality to it, as one would expect.</li>
            <li>It really cuts through a lot of grease, cigar and cigarette smoke, etc.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying it out!</li>
            <li>I had never used this before, but I really like</li>
            <li>I also used the suggestion on the bottle to soak a towel (facecloth) in some warm water and a few drops of the soap.  </li>
            <li>I am an African-American woman who wears her hair  natural and  I tried many different types of shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely organic and creualty free so you can use it with a clear conscience.  </li>
            <li>[I prefer jojoba - it&#x27;s most similar to natural scalp</li>
            <li>(Not enough SMELL on that one for my own personal liking.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer said to mix 1/3 product with 2/3 water to a foam dispenser, but wow!!!  </li>
            <li>This soap has actually made me excited to get out of bed and take showers in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Used it on a long road trip and liked it so much I use it as my regular shower soap.</li>
            <li>Get the bigger bottle - it&#x27;&#x27;s worth the savings!</li>
            <li>In short, if you’re looking to use this to get anything clean, I wouldn’t recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Yes I like all Dr. Bronners products and this is a classic; you can use for anything really from shower to dishes, clothes etc</li>
            <li>The brush went right through my hair with no pulling, and when it dried, it felt clean and lacked it&#x27;s usual overly-frizzy appearance (which was a good thing).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for it as a shampoo, it left my hair feeling kind of dry.</li>
            <li>I have used Rose, Almond and Eucalyptus in the past.</li>
            <li>However, this is my new stain remover!</li>
            <li>love it, if you mix half of this with water and put it in a foam soap pump you have foam soap for pennies.</li>
            <li>I mix it with some water (more or less 2oz soap to 12oz water) in a spray bottle and shake it up a bit before each use.</li>
            <li>use Dr. Bronners mainly as a body and face wash, but I also use it as a shampoo when my hair is feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>The tea tree sent works particularly well on ache</li>
            <li>This product also provides tremendous cleaning for internal enema uses as well.</li>
            <li>and I use it as my main shower soap and shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The mint feels super tingly (some people might not like that), but I personally do.</li>
            <li>Will definitely get more and buy as a gift in the future!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is what the high pH does.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I like that the product is all natural and has many other uses - which are stated on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Like many of you , I read the reviews and was a little leery about using this product for shampoo</li>
            <li>If you want more, just up the strength (reduce dilution) a little bit.</li>
            <li>When you start seeing the bubbles/lather reduce, squirt a little more and keep going.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it on my car upholstery and it completely gets rid of odors!!</li>
            <li>And the best part is, a little bit goes a long way, so even though it might seem a little pricey, you really get a lot of mileage out of it because you&#x27;re not using a bunch of it every time.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and natural.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came in a pump dispenser, so that I won&#x27;t waste any of this precious soap.</li>
            <li>Brush as normal but one warning: don&#x27;t take forever.</li>
            <li>Brush as normal but one warning: don&#x27;t take forever.</li>
            <li>I even washed my face with it, and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out which is amazing because I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>in liquid form uses less lye and leaves more oil in a natural state.</li>
            <li>cool is odd at first but after soothing after you get used to it.</li>
            <li>Lowering the pH will make these cuticles lay down nice and flat.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh mint smell and how a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li>It also makes my diamond jewelry shine like new.  </li>
            <li>In particular, I like the fact that this soap is environmentally conscious; it&#x27;s 100% vegetarian, and uses no synthetic oils.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use a lot of it as it does dry the hair quickly.</li>
            <li>please don&#x27;t use directly in water sources though!</li>
            <li>I tried Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap for the first time last week.</li>
            <li>it was the first time I could ever read through the entire list and determine that there was no way I was allergic to any of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>As a woman it&#x27;s a funny feeling when you wash you private areas.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s your natural hair!</li>
            <li>Will be trying some of the other scents and for sure the solid bars</li>
            <li>A little bit too strong on the peppermint.</li>
            <li>But as a body wash, it was a little strong.</li>
            <li>When using any other soap products now, you never feel as &#x27;clean&#x27; until you use this product.</li>
            <li>I never felt clean after using this soap and had to use twice as much as other “camp” soaps.  </li>
            <li>The other thing to get used to is that you won&#x27;t have that slimy feeling on your skin that we&#x27;ve probably learned to associate with being clean.</li>
            <li>I used it on my fine, straight hair and it was left very greasy and not easy to comb out.</li>
            <li>Lather is thick and rich, the scent is awesome and your skin feels way cleaner and less dried out when using this as opposed to traditional soap.  </li>
            <li>Only a small amount needed as it froths up amazingly.  </li>
            <li>This is why your skin can dry out, or why absorbing certain chemicals through the skin can be fatal.</li>
            <li>Peppermint oil, especially at full strength, can burn your skin a little if left on too long.</li>
            <li>Peppermint oil, especially at full strength, can burn your skin a little if left on too long.</li>
            <li>I used some with a sponge to clean my ceramic glossy black stove top and it left much less residue than normal dish soap does.</li>
            <li>I must say... washing hair with this and COLD water on a very hot day with a headache is amazing.     </li>
            <li>My fine, wavy hair always felt heavy and looked lifeless after using these shampoos and their needed conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These individuals might need a little more product, or they are not working it through their hair enough.</li>
            <li>As a straight (just mixed with water) shampoo I didn&#x27;t care for how my hair felt and missed some foaming action.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is awesome-just be sure to dilute it on your washcloth cloth and use caution around eyes and delicate areas-</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t go as far since it&#x27;s not as concentrated as it once was.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sodium tallowate strips your skin of its natural oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to try to use this as a natural cleanser for kitchen, bathroom, etc.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Masculine too.</li>
            <li>Discovered I need to use with caution in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All natural?  </li>
            <li>and I have a 2 yr old).</li>
            <li>You just my be surprised at the results .</li>
            <li>far I like the ALMOND &amp; Peppermint</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised how well it cleans.</li>
            <li>I give the naturally occurring glycerine credit for taming the frizz</li>
            <li>For the latter, it does very well cleaning laundry.</li>
            <li>this is a natural product which makes your skin tingle, and a bottle this size lasts two people three months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I was pleasently surprised at how well it works even on my allergy dogs.</li>
            <li>ok but a bit runny not as thick as I remembered</li>
            <li>All natural doesn&#x27;t always mean that it is safe.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and it is one soap that makes me feel clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this soap and it lasts because you only need a small amount</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the lavender scent but the peppermint had a better price, not sure why.</li>
            <li>about an hour later I noticed that my skin was more oily than usual</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shampoo: I keep some in a bottle at full strength and pour about a teaspoon in my hand, rub together a little, then put it in my hair and clean as usual...</li>
            <li>I see so many people saying its gritty, and its because you used hard water.</li>
            <li>One bottle seems to last about 2 months or more with at least 1 shower a day.  </li>
            <li>This stuff lathers thick and velvety, but rinses easily with no residue.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback was, even though I only used 1/8 a cup soap to half a gallon of water, it still had a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I may try the other scents as well, but peppermint will always be first.</li>
            <li>no other soap even compares.  </li>
            <li>Also, because the soap is in liquid form, there is virtually no mess and no waste, which can happen with the last bits of bar soap.</li>
            <li>Finally, something really natural!</li>
            <li>but that was a major &amp;#34;FAIL&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>We use this soap for many things - such as supplementing shampoo (feels terrific as a scalp massage!), cleaning my mom&#x27;s bathroom (all old tile) and it removed all kinds soap scum and grout stains, I could go on</li>
            <li>No t oily or slick, but clean.  </li>
            <li>After about 5 days (I was in the wilderness for 12 days) of using this soap to clean dishes, I reverted back to my old standby…river sand and small stones.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a price I could afford, high reviews, and low scores on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep.</li>
            <li>So we&#x27;ve begun with hand soap - using directions available on the net, we turned an ordinary bar of soap into a gallon of hand soap with which we&#x27;ll refill our pump bottles.</li>
            <li>The product I received was more of a yellowish color and not nearly as good; didn&#x27;t have the same strength;</li>
            <li>I was so surprised that it works considering it only takes 1 tsp of this cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;The recipe</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the different ways it could be used .</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used the peppermint and lavender scents, but they work so well</li>
            <li>This is the only soap/shampoo that actually seems make thin, flyaway, static, winter hair full, heavy and soft like a day in May.</li>
            <li>and I put a few drops of this peppermint soap into my baby&#x27;s laundry to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>It does last a long time, but my bottle didn&#x27;t clean as well as some other soaps.</li>
            <li>When used as a personal body wash, it doesn’t rinse off easily which can lead to dry skin and chaffing in sensitive areas when pulling down long day hikes.  </li>
            <li>Strong smell, but not a good feeling after using.</li>
            <li>Many people know this brand from the eccentric writing that covers the entire surface of the bottle, espousing the late rabbi-chemist&#x27;s philosophy and spiritual views (on the unity of mankind: \\&quot;We&#x27;re All-One, or none\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>but once you factor in that you don&#x27;t really need (or I don&#x27;t, at least) fabric softener, the price difference is not as large.</li>

            <li>I had last purchased this product nearly 30 years ago when my wife and I were regular backpackers.  </li>
            <li>Only a few drops will build enough lather to form a beard worthy of Santa himself.</li>
            <li>and my hair is not dry at all.</li>
            <li>I keep a gallon in my laundry room and put about 1/3 cup for an average large load.</li>

            <li>leave it on your sensitive areas too long</li>
            <li>Fill a basin with hot water and a few drops of this.</li>
            <li>Regular conditioner is formulated to work with conventional shampoos, which have a much lower pH than this soap.</li>
            <li>My dogs fur has never been so soft and white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For dry hair, try this recipe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is sold in health food stores, Trader Joes, and Whole foods at half the price as it is sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is also very invigorating, like some other more expensive \\&quot;men&#x27;s facial</li>
            <li>The peppermint leaves skin tingly clean, and i have noticed less and less pimples on my arms.</li>
            <li>: this is the only other time I use the product at full strength - and I may well dilute it a little soon.</li>
            <li>: this is the only other time I use the product at full strength - and I may well dilute it a little soon.</li>
            <li>I even tried super diluting the magic soap and dumping a whole bottle on vinegar on my head, still came out nasty.</li>

            <li> I LOVE Dr Bonner&#x27;s Soaps !!</li>
            <li> Amazing at cleansing, just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!</li>

            <li> I love the scent and the wonderful tingle it leaves on your skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you for keeping me safe and beautiful!</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasantly minty, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant and can be used as soap or shampoo or as bath bubbles.</li>
            <li> It is great soap, I love it!</li>
            <li> I also admire the way this company operates and all of the good they do in the world.</li>
            <li> This was in April somewhere in Colorado and we came to a gorgeous stream.</li>
            <li> It works as a good cleaning detergent for household purposes, but a NO NO for the body.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it to wash my brushes, and my clients rave about how good the lavender scent smells.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price one line.</li>
            <li> Still good stuff</li>
            <li> Smells good?</li>
            <li> Good as body soap as well and even for laundry.</li>
            <li> it is good stuff</li>
            <li> Olive oil mayo is a good choice and will help distribute some of the oil throughout the hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle mentions that it&#x27;s good for a massage, too, but I haven&#x27;t tried that.  </li>
            <li> If you clean with this, you won&#x27;t need air freshener because it leaves a wonderful peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> Great for the Summer to cool your skin!!</li>
            <li> soap is okay, the lather is alright, but the smell is awesome, i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap,It is great as a shampoo, but you have to find a balance that works for you.</li>
            <li> Great product for many uses.</li>
            <li> It smells great, my favorite smell is Peppermint.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, feelings amazing, cleans amazing, and seemingly lasts forever!</li>
            <li> This product must have a great marketing team because so many people rant and rave about it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and cleans up nicely - the smell is good too...</li>
            <li> soap works into a very rich lather and smells very nice.</li>
            <li> skin is happy and soft without any itching or burning, and it turns out this soap is even great for shaving my legs!</li>
            <li> the scent is refreshing &amp; not over powering my family loves it!</li>
            <li> and it is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> This peppermint soap is TOTALLY refreshing !</li>
            <li> but my favorite use for it is as a Shampoo!</li>
            <li> but if you want it to feel more like \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo this will do the trick! ]</li>
            <li> There is nothing better!</li>
            <li> Refreshing peppermint!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this peppermint soap!   </li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> Love the soap!</li>
            <li> What more could you want?!</li>
            <li> I love this brand!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the peppermint smell!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> But I use it (and love it!)</li>
            <li> This soap is safe to go in the mouth and is even somewhat pleasant</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff  and it does a great job cleaning his body without leaving a strong scent afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great soap - does not leave residue like body washes do - easy to rinse off, and cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how fresh it makes me feel!!!!</li>
            <li> This soap has an amazing scent.  </li>
            <li> I said it was amazing with a headache.</li>
            <li> Seriously Amazing.</li>
            <li> i use it on everything that i can think of and the peppermint smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> tried Bronner&#x27;s for cleaning anything else beyond my own body</li>
            <li> It is a surprisingly effective face wash.</li>
            <li> I use this soap in my liquid soap dispensers, but it&#x27;s handy for a number of uses.</li>
            <li> works!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been making my own homemade household cleaner with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this to make my own peppermint sugar foot scrubs.</li>
            <li> Everybody should try this and have their own experience with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice knowing</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like a burst of refreshment after you put it on in the shower or a warm bath.</li>
            <li> also nice and a 5 star produdct.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really nice.</li>
            <li> Cuts grease like a boss and has a nice aroma.</li>
            <li> When all is said and done, I have no idea how this soap has become so popular.  </li>
            <li> have a real jerk of a cat that seems to think the best way to express his displeasure is to pee in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> I have tried the almond soap but not as thrilled as I was with the peppermint.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m not just filling the air with chemical fragrances than can linger in my home for days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought them for years and this one smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> Plus its covered with some kind of hokey new-age junk.</li>
            <li> It provides a nice tingling sensation when used as a bath soap.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful sweet peppermint smell, and the tingle isn&#x27;t too strong for me.</li>
            <li> the scents offered, I imagine there are a multitude of great scents you could combine - Eucalyptus/Peppermint/Citrus would be a great flu time soap, Lavender/TeaTree make a great herbal combo, Citrus/Almond would make a good winter mix... and those tiny bottles make for fun mixing on a budget!</li>
            <li> Favorite summer soap, very refreshing</li>
            <li> Love this soap but the Peppermint is probably not the best for washing your body...and certain areas.  </li>
            <li> I love it, good for so many things.  </li>
            <li> Luckily Dr. Bronner&#x27;s work great.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to dilute as it is quite potent!</li>
            <li> i love peppermint and nice</li>
            <li> Refreshing, invigorating and leaves my skin looking amazing.</li>
            <li> The rose also is lovely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you want a soap that is both healthy and effective, you can&#x27;t do better than this.</li>
            <li> But Jammer and I felt so clean and refreshed from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, and I know from the peppermint aroma, we had to smell good to.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;ll also be good for emergencies, when I don&#x27;t have body wash, shampoo, tooth paste, or if I need it to clean something</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bronner&#x27;s carries two of my all-time favorite scents - peppermint and lavender, both of which were reported to be *very* strong.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is pretty tingle-y</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great in a hot steamy shower because the peppermint gives off those refreshing vapors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this works best when used as a pre-wash on my hair followed by a second wash with my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Enjoying this soap.</li>
            <li> this is my go-to stress relief magic bottle</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps for many years now and love his products.</li>
            <li> Nutrients are richest in the skin of many fruits and vegetables.</li>
            <li> cannot recommend this soap more.</li>
            <li> But I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I will in time.</li>
            <li> I find it refreshing.</li>
            <li> I still take meds for the pain but not as many.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap for hand washing.</li>
            <li> Only the best.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> The peppermint smell is delicious, and I swear it actually makes me feel more awake in the morning</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The smells is great, just like peppermint, and it lathers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in bar form requires more lye to chemically alter a greater percentage of the fats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
            <li> It lathers much better than most natural/organic liquid soaps I have used.</li>
            <li> It lathers much better than most natural/organic liquid soaps I have used.</li>
            <li> Not only is its smell is wonderful</li>
            <li> I love all of Dr. Bronner soap.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I remembered it from many years ago</li>
            <li> I grabbed a wash cloth, a towel, my bottle of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap (which was safe to use in streams) and jumped into the stream at which point I thought my heart would stop.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it again.</li>
            <li> The peppermint is my personal favorite, but all the scents are wonderful.</li>
            <li> BUT it works much better when diluted.</li>
            <li> Below is a great shampoo recipe - it also functions as an amazingly moisturizing body wash AND is my all time favorite NATURAL pet shampoo.</li>
            <li> liquid Castile Soap - your favorite scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner Soap for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is refreshing and it does not leave any soapy residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still love this brand because they are cruelty free!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff for 20 years; hope to use it for many many more.</li>
            <li> Here is where I added 2 ounces of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soap Peppermint.  </li>
            <li> This soap has SUCH a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I understand the majority of it but its something to read :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love all these scents, but the peppermint is my favorite.</li>
            <li> , it would be that I&#x27;d love to have more scents to play with - maybe some spicy scents like cinnamon, clove, or ginger, and soothing scents like sandalwood, vanilla, and chamomile, and maybe even some rosemary and patchouli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it would be that I&#x27;d love to have more scents to play with - maybe some spicy scents like cinnamon, clove, or ginger, and soothing scents like sandalwood, vanilla, and chamomile, and maybe even some rosemary and patchouli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> idea of single-scent natural soaps that I could buy off the shelf and mix to my liking makes me far more happy than it should :D</li>
            <li> Natural, great minty smell and effective cleaner.  </li>
            <li> It opens up your pores for that refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> This works very well and smells great.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s also has lavender, almond, and eucalyptus versions, but the peppermint is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Nothing more to say than that.</li>
            <li> I use this soap to wash my body and I love the way I feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> Many many uses for this soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> Use it for my dreadlocks but it is really just an all around great bio-friendly soap to use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just as pleased with this one as I was before.</li>
            <li> Liquid castile soap (like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) has a pH around 8.9, which is much more alkaline and can cause itchy/dry scalp and skin.</li>
            <li> You can find many shampoo recipes online, many of which incorporate Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, but look for those that are PH-balanced for your scalp and skin.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus.</li>
            <li> Has sooo many uses.</li>
            <li> over all its an ok product i might buy again</li>
            <li> Love this liquid soap.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products &amp; you</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has always been one of my favorite soaps.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the liquid soap way better.  </li>
            <li> but that was a more bluish in color soap.</li>
            <li> in the shower, it&#x27;s top notch</li>
            <li> I have eczema and many soaps irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love 4 ever Thank You</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t necessarily the best for my skin, it was somewhat drying and it didn&#x27;t help nor harm my acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit watery when diluted, but it still works fantastic!</li>
            <li> Just go to Target and get one there than you think is cute, use all that soap and begin to use it.</li>
            <li> fill a spray bottle mostly with water and add some peppermint Castile soap and tea tree oil for antibacterial.</li>
            <li> I love my Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint bar soap, so I thought I would try the liquid for my kitchen and bathroom use, and it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Something</li>
            <li> Citrus is just ok...and Eucalyptus is just ok...</li>
            <li> I might try another bottle, but I feel it&#x27;s overly priced, and more of a novelty than anything.</li>
            <li> It sure made things easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the results.</li>
            <li> &quot; that is most noticeable on metallic items...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s organic and safe...</li>
            <li> and if you just run your sponge over it real quick and rinse, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I love this soap...</li>
            <li> I see many people who say this dries their hair when using it as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> The more I used it (took about 3-4 shampoos), the better my hair looked and felt.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 16 oz bottle of this nifty gifty as part of my research for when I&#x27;m out and about traveling. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more of a \\&quot;function over fashion\\</li>
            <li> I love the soap but wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I use it for everything.</li>
            <li> but wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After reading many reviews</li>
            <li> I was determined to use Dr Bronners Magic soap (diluted) as a shampoo</li>
            <li> I had hoped that I could use this as a rinse after the magic soap as I had read</li>
            <li> I love the peppermint tingle too.</li>
            <li> IT IS DEFINITELY REFRESHING AND TINGLING FOR SURE.</li>
            <li> I wish I was not since I am trying to be organic more and this would have really been great.</li>
            <li> This is soooo refreshing.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel so clean and gives a nice cooling effect.</li>
            <li> Love this pure gentle soap and the wonderful peppermint scent.</li>
            <li> It leaves you feeling very clean and</li>
            <li> When diluted with enough water the tingle you feel on your face is very pleasant and not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let’s just say I was happy my trail partners brought along normal toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> And remember, if any of the Bronner&#x27;s soap is ever too strong, just mix it with some Baby Unscented to mellow it out :)</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff so much, and it&#x27;s so good for the environment and for people.</li>
            <li> Good scent, cleans very well, quite satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Use it as a face wash as well and it feels so tingly and leaves my face feeling &amp; looking clean!</li>
            <li> Makes you smell great, and doesn&#x27;t clean things very well.</li>
            <li> It is great as a body wash and shampoo, and will rinse off completely.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle to try, and am really not all that impressed.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is a great product for natural cleaning.</li>
            <li> It does work to create a nice foamy potion, so that was a success.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for a whole bunch of things that I have not tried yet but</li>
            <li> It does not take much to develop a good lather</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff so much, I purchased the lavender as well.</li>
            <li> In fact, today I actually used it on a scrubbing sponge to give the shower a quick once over &amp; it cleaned the shower perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The soap is outstanding, a great value, very gentle, really an affordable luxury.  </li>
            <li> There are other fragrances, but we think peppermint is the best.  </li>
            <li> You actually feel good using this stuff!</li>
            <li> I also wanted to reduce my footprint in the wilderness using a more environmentally friendly product.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, the peppermint scent is wonderful, invigorating, and tingly!</li>
            <li> In the hot weather or after working out, I use this as a body wash in the shower, it is so refreshing and exhilirating!</li>
            <li> It leaves your body tingling and cool when you get out of the shower which is awesome when you live somewhere hot and humid.</li>
            <li> The peppermint feels the best (if you also like that tingly clean feeling of goodness), the tea tree oil really helps keep my skin clear, and the lavender is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> It smells like peppermint candy and rinses off cleanly, without a filmy, slippery feeling many liquid soaps leave.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel super clean, and minty tingle is amazing.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday in the gym and it is so refreshing and the best part is it is both body soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this product and its at such a great price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t use it as dishwasher liquid or laundry detergent because it lathers too easily.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it as dishwasher liquid or laundry detergent because it lathers too easily.</li>
            <li> I hike with this soap because it&#x27;s easily biodegradable and multi-purpose.</li>
            <li> It takes hair wax well and is easy to style.</li>
            <li> This is found everywhere so easy to come by as well.</li>
            <li> When I bought Dr. Bronners, I did the same thing and the smell was gone, replaced with the peppermint scent of the soap, which is a welcome addition. :)</li>
            <li> It is a strong acid that chemically binds to fat and permanently alters it&#x27;s chemical composition, creating nitro glycerine etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
            <li> but the smell was strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda like the feeling you get when you breathe thru your nose after you just ate a strong peppermint.</li>
            <li> It is strong and wakes me up in the morning</li>
            <li> The peppermint is strong but delicious smelling and if you are sick or congested, this is a wonderful way to temporarily relieve your congestion in the shower.</li>
            <li> Happy Shopping :O)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s runnier than most liquid soaps, so keep that in mind when pouring it out.</li>
            <li> Cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Getting in the shower and feeling that cool tingle is just refreshing.</li>
            <li> Hands down best tasting soap I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I especially love it in the summer when it hot outside.</li>
            <li> and you can feel good about supporting a company that believes in doing right by the world.</li>
            <li> aside from that, it&#x27;s just a fantastic soap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply fantastic.</li>
            <li> sound almost like I work for the company, but I swear I</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic soap.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great soap.</li>
            <li> It works as a house cleaner, a personal cleaner, and a it is a great biodegradable backpacking soap.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the coolness that the peppermint leaves on my skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever purchase the bar when the liquid is available.</li>
            <li> do not make the same mistake, lol.</li>
            <li> Dr Bronners (I use peppermint for everything because you get it dirt cheap at Trader Joe&#x27;s: $9.99 for 32oz--YES, $9.99)&lt;br /&gt;1/8c</li>
            <li> lightly...</li>
            <li> If you care about what you put on your skin and hair, then THIS is for you as it comes &#x27;chemical free&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I augment it with some baking soda which is really cheap.</li>
            <li> I augment it with some baking soda which is really cheap.</li>
            <li> I try to get different scented ones because the soaps lasts quite a while and has a great lather.</li>
            <li> But hey, it cleans the mouth/teeth, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> so a bottle of this size is great value and will last a while.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily, it did not leak and I enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% natural, biodegradable, not tested on animals, supports Fair Trade, ingredients are certified organic, and the bottle is made from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic.</li>
            <li> Peppermint is really refreshing with a mild, sweet lingering scent.</li>
            <li> Interesting right?</li>
            <li> Cleans better than any other body wash, feels and smells great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and the peppermint is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this soap very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on my skin which is kind of sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Soap itself is just barely more viscous than water, easy to use too much (if trying to ration)  </li>
            <li> I am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this soap because I wanted an environmentally friendly body wash, and it has blown me away.</li>
            <li> idea of single-scent natural soaps that I could buy off the shelf and mix to my liking makes me far more happy than it should :</li>
            <li> If you are around fresh water, nothing beats Dr. Brommer!  </li>
            <li> Take a clean wash cloth and soak it and then apply to face.</li>
            <li> Works for cleaning anything you need to clean, including my, dishes, laundry, etc...</li>
            <li> You feel so clean and refreshed after use.</li>
            <li> (literally) clean  </li>
            <li> Me, I like my soap scented just enough to be pleasant and leave a lingering clean smell - if someone can point out what I specifically smell like</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll use it to clean up my kitties.</li>
            <li> Just recently, I thoroughly cleaned my trash can with this fantastic product, with superior results.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean makeup brushes and my sons hair.</li>
            <li> I feel so clean and refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean now.</li>
            <li> I used it to clean my person, wash dishes and even to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using it to clean all my jewelry.   </li>
            <li> squirt peppermint Castile soap and clean out.</li>
            <li> I use it to bathe, clean my makeup brushes and to scrub the bathtub.  </li>
            <li> Just chew some gum or clean your palette with something else if it&#x27;s unbearable.</li>
            <li> excellent product, fast delivery, works as expected.</li>
            <li> really makes you feel good after taking a shower or bath with it makes your whole body feel rejuvenated</li>
            <li> Pleasant shopping experience, I will definitely be a repeat costumer of this seller.</li>
            <li> In fact it is soft and shiny and I love it!</li>
            <li> Pleasant in scent, soft, and tough on dirt and stains, it&#x27;s the perfect combination of &#x27;clean.&#x27;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp the way most shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I lifted the stain right out of my pants!</li>
            <li> Love the fresh smell of the peppermint and the pure quality of the soap!</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, I have fine hair, and therefore I don&#x27;t need much product and it&#x27;s easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> After showing you feel so cool</li>
            <li> The smell is awsome, once out the shower I felt super clean and relaxed.</li>
            <li> using this as a shampoo, regular conditioner will not do one bit of good.</li>
            <li> There is a fascinating documentary about his life.  </li>
            <li> Everything in here is organic and natural, a nice change of pace compared to a lot of bar soaps.  </li>
            <li> I did feel super clean after using it, but it wasn&#x27;t a miracle product in that respect.</li>
            <li> The peppermint SMELLS just like peppermint, the Eucalyptus does NOT smell that much of&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus...NOT sure why???&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner was a cool dude, no doubt ahead of his time.</li>
            <li> With just the three drops, it foams up quickly and feels and tastes clean.</li>
            <li> With just the three drops, it foams up quickly and feels and tastes clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fed up with all of these beauty products which claim to be natural or even organic, yet have nice list of chemicals on their ingredient</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap washes away your old oils, and leaves its pure plant based oils and a pleasant scent depending on which one you choose.</li>
            <li> it is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great as a natural deodorant and not much is needed, it is just as good as tom&#x27;s of main and burts</li>
            <li> It is great as a natural deodorant and not much is needed, it is just as good as tom&#x27;s of main and burts bees.  </li>
            <li> leaves everything clean and fresh smelling with no residue.  </li>
            <li> My house smells naturally fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, and for the price, well worth it to go for the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself not being a loyal customer of this item.</li>
            <li> The day after, I spilled some coffee on a pair of white sweatpants, yes - WHITE sweatpants, and this worked wonderfully, too!</li>
            <li> B0029XNTEU Church &amp; Dwight Co 03020 Arm &amp; Hammer Super Washing Soda]].</li>
            <li> body related *more flashbacks to shower incident*.etely eliminates odors, better than anything I used before I discovered Castile</li>
            <li> Many uses, so highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The very first day after shampooing with this (no conditioner), I took a brush to my hair expecting tangles.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing especially after a swim at the beach.  </li>
            <li> But when a person is able to bring as many 3 oz bottles that can fit comfortably in a zip lock bag, there&#x27;s really no point in JUST bringing Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, which is what I was interested in.</li>
            <li> the reviews I&#x27;d read, however, a large number of people commented on the extremely strong smell of the soaps.</li>
            <li> Since reading the label and the teachings of Dr. Bronner (&amp;#34;Each swallow works hard to be perfect pilot-provider-builder-trainer-teacher-lover-mate, no half-true hate!&amp;#34;) I have decided to start a cult.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it organic, it is fair trade, and it is higher quality than those &#x27;fancy&#x27; body washes you find in beauty stores.</li>
            <li> I use full strength PEPPERMINT Castile soap and it completely eliminates odors, better than anything I used before I discovered Castile soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The peppermint is mild and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> Pretty much more of what has been said, it really does cool you down in hot climate and engages your sense of smell as well, great stuff.  </li>
            <li> , so trying new soaps doesn&#x27;t work all that well for me, but I got a free sample and the person that recommended it was very adamant about how much she loved it</li>
            <li> It has multiple uses and smells &amp; feels refreshing!  </li>
            <li> After spending soooo much money on Natures Miracle, I accidentally used this on my kitchen tile and voila!!</li>
            <li> It took very little to wash in the sink and my clothes got clean and smelled great</li>
            <li> Next, when using a loofah it builds an amazing lather.</li>
            <li> I eventually got to a lightly minty herbal scent that was absolutely perfect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap washes off completely and I feel safe doing this (whereas before, I was using Palmolive).</li>
            <li> I would have to say that all the research I completed before buying this product was worth it</li>
            <li> I finally purchased this soap after reading all of the good reviews, and watching the documentary based on Dr. Bronner (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap Box).</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it</li>
            <li> Better than what I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier on the skin than sodium tallowate, the #1 ingredient in nearly all bar soaps, which is nothing more than animal fat that has had lye added to it to saponify</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronners castille peppermint soap provides a nice tingle in the shower for regular bathing.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> and the bottles fun to read....</li>
            <li> , the bottle is very interesting reading if you take long showers/baths.</li>
            <li> the soap is good, a few drops are enough and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Also useful for cleaning counters, tub/shower, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have tried these soaps in peppermint, tea tree oil, and lavender, I love them all so far.</li>
            <li> fresh scent and a powerful cleaner.</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t until 3 months ago that I actually bought my own.</li>
            <li> Then she states that the natural oils will then be able to penetrate the hair.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Cleans well - clothes and full body, tons of soapy suds, leaves you smelling fresh and gives you an amazing tingle (must be the menthol) but be careful...</li>
            <li> This is right on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will wake you right up and cruelty-free</li>
            <li> I have noticed that since my family has been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap in the shower, that I don&#x27;t have to clean the shower grout very often.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, the label creeps me out a little bit, but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating.</li>
            <li> and if I wanted more foam and a stronger scent I can just add more soap and less</li>
            <li> and since I work near a Trader Joe&#x27;s with super cheap peppermint Castile, my cleaning routine is 95% peppermint, except when it comes to anything</li>
            <li> and since I work near a Trader Joe&#x27;s with super cheap peppermint Castile, my cleaning routine is 95% peppermint, except when it comes to anything</li>
            <li> Great stuff, but use in small quantities.  </li>
            <li> I dumped out that batch and put about 2t soap to a small 8 oz foam dispenser and my hands are happy now.</li>
            <li> The peppermint wakes you right up in the morning and gets you ready to go!</li>
            <li> I had my hopes high for this soap, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is mild leaving my face clean but not dried out.  </li>
            <li> I fill a spray bottle with water, a few squirts of castile soap, and tea tree and lavender essential oils, which makes a great kitchen counter cleaner!</li>
            <li> The soap is very strong by it self, so if you have a long day and you were stinky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderfully fragrant, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> However, if it&#x27;s a sticky, humid,rainy, hot day, I wouldnt recommend it because it can make it seem sticky.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased it for camping as it is non polluting.  </li>
            <li> First thing I noticed when opening the box up</li>
            <li> I do notice that Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap is quite a bit thinner than I remember it being when I first tried it.  </li>
            <li> , I will be purchasing more of it in the future.</li>
            <li> That is more likely to occur in bar soap.</li>
            <li> make sure u put on enough lotion, or you will become ashy...</li>
            <li> I washed her first</li>
            <li> You barely need more than a drop for much of anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 cups of hot water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix</li>
            <li> I made my first batch of diy laundry detergent this morning.  </li>
            <li> smells refreshing especially if you use it with the SOAPY SOLES foot scrubber!&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> On to try the other many uses!</li>
            <li> (;-)</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll really wake you up!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore the scent of peppermint - think aromatherapy!  </li>
            <li> was this is the first time I&#x27;ve been bam boozo!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fill bottle 1/3 way with water first, then add Dr Bronners (I use Almond--</li>
            <li> body related *more flashbacks to shower incident*.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I decided to replace my chemical-laden hygiene products with safer ones - relying on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database to guide me to a better place.</li>
            <li> you probably need more if you don&#x27;t have short guy hair like me.</li>
            <li> I love this peppermint soap and find that it can be used for various things.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was mainly interested in how well it cleans the body, how well it acts as shampoo, soap, tooth paste, and cleaning laundry.</li>
            <li> ;D</li>
            <li> :) It&#x27;s definitely not something to knock points off of this product.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> This can get very sudsy, so use sparingly!</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t actually pay for this product!!</li>
            <li> What else is good is that when using it, it tingles the body after a few seconds AND it smells just like candy canes.</li>
            <li> Like many soaps, it does get a little gunked up around the spout, but it&#x27;s an easy fix (you just have to wipe the spout from time to time).</li>
            <li> If you wanna live that minty fresh life, Dr. B&#x27;S peppermint will have you tingling in all the right places.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s can be great added to a DIY recipe for personal care products, but it has an incorrect PH balance for your scalp/hair and skin by itself, so most recipes for personal care products that include Dr. Bronner&#x27;s also include other ingredients.</li>
            <li> You only need a TINY bit to get a good</li>
            <li> As a guy, I am disappointed that many environmentally friendly hygiene products are oriented towards women, so I&#x27;m also really happy that I&#x27;ve found something that both men and women can use.</li>
            <li> Well, today, I pretty much use it for everything but in my dishwasher Here</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling cleaning, and the refreshing tingle lasts long after the bath or shower.  </li>
            <li> been toned down just a bit, but you still get that nice &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; to your scalp and skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for children or for people who have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (if you are struggling with breakouts I strongly suggest giving this a try), and it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to keep my seborrheic dermatitis at bay</li>
            <li> I had a worn down, not so great smelling pair of shorts that I washed with vinegar, but the stench was still present.</li>
            <li> I broke out a large glass pitcher and started mixing.</li>
            <li> Since it is pure soap I used it as a shampoo plus a body wash.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this natural soap!</li>
            <li> The standard dilution here of about 20% soap to 80% water works fine.</li>
            <li> This does contain coconut oil which can be somewhat drying (as compared to a pure olive oil Castile soap), but it certainly is more gentle than the synthetic detergents in traditional shampoos (including ones which claim to be natural).</li>
            <li> Especially having found out that they can create HUGE amounts of sulphur in the body which leads to malabsorption.</li>
            <li> Cleans really well without that soapy residue afterwards.</li>
            <li> I draped the wrung out cloth over my daughter&#x27;s face and gave her a gentle temple rub.  </li>
            <li> The tingle on my face was also very invigorating.</li>
            <li> Lye is very acidic.</li>
            <li> Have to dilute with water, its concentrated, and doesnt take much to get job done.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much (I&#x27;m not kidding,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a multipurpose cleaner</li>
            <li> It can be used straight out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Lye aka Sodium Hydroxide can be very damaging.</li>
            <li> It can really heat up non exposed areas.</li>
            <li> it gets rid of the stench really well.</li>
            <li> I like it, my husband doesn&#x27;t for that very reason.</li>
            <li> It really did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Still smells the same, and still has fantastic organic ingredients, but its watery.</li>
            <li> The peppermint really does leave your skin tingly.  </li>
            <li> About 4 or 5 months ago I decided to go simple with my cleansers and had always been perplexed by Dr Bronners...</li>
            <li> Too much soap</li>
            <li> but really dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> As much as I&#x27;d like to, I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this soap for cleaning the shower tub sinks.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend&#x27;s hair did not appreciate this method as much as mine did</li>
            <li> My girlfriend&#x27;s hair did not appreciate this method as much as mine did</li>
            <li> I am used to the Whole Foods brand of castile soap, which is a lot thicker than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s works just as well.</li>
            <li> Has a very soapy quality to it, as one would expect.</li>
            <li> It really cuts through a lot of grease, cigar and cigarette smoke, etc.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying it out!</li>
            <li> I had never used this before, but I really like</li>
            <li> I also used the suggestion on the bottle to soak a towel (facecloth) in some warm water and a few drops of the soap.  </li>
            <li> I am an African-American woman who wears her hair  natural and  I tried many different types of shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely organic and creualty free so you can use it with a clear conscience.  </li>
            <li> [I prefer jojoba - it&#x27;s most similar to natural scalp</li>
            <li> (Not enough SMELL on that one for my own personal liking.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said to mix 1/3 product with 2/3 water to a foam dispenser, but wow!!!  </li>
            <li> This soap has actually made me excited to get out of bed and take showers in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Used it on a long road trip and liked it so much I use it as my regular shower soap.</li>
            <li> Get the bigger bottle - it&#x27;&#x27;s worth the savings!</li>
            <li> In short, if you’re looking to use this to get anything clean, I wouldn’t recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Yes I like all Dr. Bronners products and this is a classic; you can use for anything really from shower to dishes, clothes etc</li>
            <li> The brush went right through my hair with no pulling, and when it dried, it felt clean and lacked it&#x27;s usual overly-frizzy appearance (which was a good thing).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for it as a shampoo, it left my hair feeling kind of dry.</li>
            <li> I have used Rose, Almond and Eucalyptus in the past.</li>
            <li> However, this is my new stain remover!</li>
            <li> love it, if you mix half of this with water and put it in a foam soap pump you have foam soap for pennies.</li>
            <li> I mix it with some water (more or less 2oz soap to 12oz water) in a spray bottle and shake it up a bit before each use.</li>
            <li> use Dr. Bronners mainly as a body and face wash, but I also use it as a shampoo when my hair is feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> The tea tree sent works particularly well on ache</li>
            <li> This product also provides tremendous cleaning for internal enema uses as well.</li>
            <li> and I use it as my main shower soap and shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The mint feels super tingly (some people might not like that), but I personally do.</li>
            <li> Will definitely get more and buy as a gift in the future!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is what the high pH does.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like that the product is all natural and has many other uses - which are stated on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Like many of you , I read the reviews and was a little leery about using this product for shampoo</li>
            <li> If you want more, just up the strength (reduce dilution) a little bit.</li>
            <li> When you start seeing the bubbles/lather reduce, squirt a little more and keep going.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it on my car upholstery and it completely gets rid of odors!!</li>
            <li> And the best part is, a little bit goes a long way, so even though it might seem a little pricey, you really get a lot of mileage out of it because you&#x27;re not using a bunch of it every time.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and natural.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came in a pump dispenser, so that I won&#x27;t waste any of this precious soap.</li>
            <li> Brush as normal but one warning: don&#x27;t take forever.</li>
            <li> Brush as normal but one warning: don&#x27;t take forever.</li>
            <li> I even washed my face with it, and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out which is amazing because I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> in liquid form uses less lye and leaves more oil in a natural state.</li>
            <li> cool is odd at first but after soothing after you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Lowering the pH will make these cuticles lay down nice and flat.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh mint smell and how a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It also makes my diamond jewelry shine like new.  </li>
            <li> In particular, I like the fact that this soap is environmentally conscious; it&#x27;s 100% vegetarian, and uses no synthetic oils.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use a lot of it as it does dry the hair quickly.</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t use directly in water sources though!</li>
            <li> I tried Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap for the first time last week.</li>
            <li> it was the first time I could ever read through the entire list and determine that there was no way I was allergic to any of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> As a woman it&#x27;s a funny feeling when you wash you private areas.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s your natural hair!</li>
            <li> Will be trying some of the other scents and for sure the solid bars</li>
            <li> A little bit too strong on the peppermint.</li>
            <li> But as a body wash, it was a little strong.</li>
            <li> When using any other soap products now, you never feel as &#x27;clean&#x27; until you use this product.</li>
            <li> I never felt clean after using this soap and had to use twice as much as other “camp” soaps.  </li>
            <li> The other thing to get used to is that you won&#x27;t have that slimy feeling on your skin that we&#x27;ve probably learned to associate with being clean.</li>
            <li> I used it on my fine, straight hair and it was left very greasy and not easy to comb out.</li>
            <li> Lather is thick and rich, the scent is awesome and your skin feels way cleaner and less dried out when using this as opposed to traditional soap.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount needed as it froths up amazingly.  </li>
            <li> This is why your skin can dry out, or why absorbing certain chemicals through the skin can be fatal.</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil, especially at full strength, can burn your skin a little if left on too long.</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil, especially at full strength, can burn your skin a little if left on too long.</li>
            <li> I used some with a sponge to clean my ceramic glossy black stove top and it left much less residue than normal dish soap does.</li>
            <li> I must say... washing hair with this and COLD water on a very hot day with a headache is amazing.     </li>
            <li> My fine, wavy hair always felt heavy and looked lifeless after using these shampoos and their needed conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These individuals might need a little more product, or they are not working it through their hair enough.</li>
            <li> As a straight (just mixed with water) shampoo I didn&#x27;t care for how my hair felt and missed some foaming action.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome-just be sure to dilute it on your washcloth cloth and use caution around eyes and delicate areas-</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t go as far since it&#x27;s not as concentrated as it once was.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sodium tallowate strips your skin of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try to use this as a natural cleanser for kitchen, bathroom, etc.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Masculine too.</li>
            <li> Discovered I need to use with caution in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All natural?  </li>
            <li> and I have a 2 yr old).</li>
            <li> You just my be surprised at the results .</li>
            <li> far I like the ALMOND &amp; Peppermint</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised how well it cleans.</li>
            <li> I give the naturally occurring glycerine credit for taming the frizz</li>
            <li> For the latter, it does very well cleaning laundry.</li>
            <li> this is a natural product which makes your skin tingle, and a bottle this size lasts two people three months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I was pleasently surprised at how well it works even on my allergy dogs.</li>
            <li> ok but a bit runny not as thick as I remembered</li>
            <li> All natural doesn&#x27;t always mean that it is safe.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it is one soap that makes me feel clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this soap and it lasts because you only need a small amount</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the lavender scent but the peppermint had a better price, not sure why.</li>
            <li> about an hour later I noticed that my skin was more oily than usual</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shampoo: I keep some in a bottle at full strength and pour about a teaspoon in my hand, rub together a little, then put it in my hair and clean as usual...</li>
            <li> I see so many people saying its gritty, and its because you used hard water.</li>
            <li> One bottle seems to last about 2 months or more with at least 1 shower a day.  </li>
            <li> This stuff lathers thick and velvety, but rinses easily with no residue.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback was, even though I only used 1/8 a cup soap to half a gallon of water, it still had a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I may try the other scents as well, but peppermint will always be first.</li>
            <li> no other soap even compares.  </li>
            <li> Also, because the soap is in liquid form, there is virtually no mess and no waste, which can happen with the last bits of bar soap.</li>
            <li> Finally, something really natural!</li>
            <li> but that was a major &amp;#34;FAIL&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> We use this soap for many things - such as supplementing shampoo (feels terrific as a scalp massage!), cleaning my mom&#x27;s bathroom (all old tile) and it removed all kinds soap scum and grout stains, I could go on</li>
            <li> No t oily or slick, but clean.  </li>
            <li> After about 5 days (I was in the wilderness for 12 days) of using this soap to clean dishes, I reverted back to my old standby…river sand and small stones.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a price I could afford, high reviews, and low scores on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep.</li>
            <li> So we&#x27;ve begun with hand soap - using directions available on the net, we turned an ordinary bar of soap into a gallon of hand soap with which we&#x27;ll refill our pump bottles.</li>
            <li> The product I received was more of a yellowish color and not nearly as good; didn&#x27;t have the same strength;</li>
            <li> I was so surprised that it works considering it only takes 1 tsp of this cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;The recipe</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the different ways it could be used .</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the peppermint and lavender scents, but they work so well</li>
            <li> This is the only soap/shampoo that actually seems make thin, flyaway, static, winter hair full, heavy and soft like a day in May.</li>
            <li> and I put a few drops of this peppermint soap into my baby&#x27;s laundry to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> It does last a long time, but my bottle didn&#x27;t clean as well as some other soaps.</li>
            <li> When used as a personal body wash, it doesn’t rinse off easily which can lead to dry skin and chaffing in sensitive areas when pulling down long day hikes.  </li>
            <li> Strong smell, but not a good feeling after using.</li>
            <li> Many people know this brand from the eccentric writing that covers the entire surface of the bottle, espousing the late rabbi-chemist&#x27;s philosophy and spiritual views (on the unity of mankind: \\&quot;We&#x27;re All-One, or none\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> but once you factor in that you don&#x27;t really need (or I don&#x27;t, at least) fabric softener, the price difference is not as large.</li>
            <li> but once you factor in that you don&#x27;t really need (or I don&#x27;t, at least) fabric softener, the price difference is not as large.</li>
            <li> I had last purchased this product nearly 30 years ago when my wife and I were regular backpackers.  </li>
            <li> Only a few drops will build enough lather to form a beard worthy of Santa himself.</li>
            <li> and my hair is not dry at all.</li>
            <li> I keep a gallon in my laundry room and put about 1/3 cup for an average large load.</li>
            <li> I keep a gallon in my laundry room and put about 1/3 cup for an average large load.</li>
            <li> leave it on your sensitive areas too long</li>
            <li> Fill a basin with hot water and a few drops of this.</li>
            <li> Regular conditioner is formulated to work with conventional shampoos, which have a much lower pH than this soap.</li>
            <li> My dogs fur has never been so soft and white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For dry hair, try this recipe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is sold in health food stores, Trader Joes, and Whole foods at half the price as it is sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is also very invigorating, like some other more expensive \\&quot;men&#x27;s facial</li>
            <li> The peppermint leaves skin tingly clean, and i have noticed less and less pimples on my arms.</li>
            <li> : this is the only other time I use the product at full strength - and I may well dilute it a little soon.</li>
            <li> : this is the only other time I use the product at full strength - and I may well dilute it a little soon.</li>
            <li> I even tried super diluting the magic soap and dumping a whole bottle on vinegar on my head, still came out nasty.</li>
            <li> I might try to dilute this to 50% only because at full strength it likes to clog the little opening ofthe bottle with dried soap.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy it from Amazon, but with Fall allergies in full swing and my soap sensitivity worse than ever, I picked some up at my local Target.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I have short, thick hair and it has natural body now and is very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Price is higher than other body-wash  Candy cane smell does not last long, and is not powerful once dry</li>
            <li> I had tried Dr. B&#x27;s liquid castile soap at least 20 years ago and got interested in it again.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the crazy religious rantings on the side of the bottle, but even that can be entertaining reading in the shower.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner is the 9th in a long line of German soap makers.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from keratosis pilaris, which is virtually impossible to get rid of completely, and after using this stuff consistently in addition to my usual lotion, I have seen a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Toilet cleaner:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You may find this leaves a little \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; in certain spots that will be extra-noticeable with cold water/air - you may enjoy this or not...</li>
            <li> Very concentrated so it can be watered down a little to extend it&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s concentrated, it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> A LONG, LONG WAYS!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> it took me so long to discover this Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Hemp Liquid Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you wash with the chemicals you have them on your skin all day long...</li>
            <li> If you wash with the chemicals you have them on your skin all day long...</li>
            <li> I returned this item because I was sent something with hemp in it, which is clearly not mentioned in the add.</li>
            <li> At ~$50 per gallon this is more expensive than your typical Tide chemical gallon</li>
            <li> At ~$50 per gallon this is more expensive than your typical Tide chemical gallon</li>
            <li> However, all that wouldn&#x27;t mean much if the soap didn&#x27;t do what soap is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> So I started taking this with me on other trips and now use it in the shower daily.</li>
            <li> The reason your hair is thicker and heavy after using DR Bronners is because all the little cuticles on each strand of hair are standing straight out.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to any other brand of liquid soap.  </li>
            <li> A little drop or two of jojoba or extra virgin olive oil worked through might be helpful if one wishes to avoid traditional bottle conditioners.</li>
            <li> This soap does not have a high lather, and it is sometimes hard to know where it is going.</li>
            <li> Save for winter and dry weather.</li>
            <li> tends to dry the skin a bit.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry me out or anything</li>
            <li> I was always an ivory soap user until my skin got dry</li>
            <li> Dry Feeling</li>
            <li> and it still feels dry</li>
            <li> But lately, we&#x27;ve decided to get rid of the plastic jars in our life, as far as possible.</li>
            <li> I only use it as a shower gel, but it is a concentrated product and a bottle should last a few months if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> A few months back I watched the documentary on Dr. Bronner (phew!) and immediately ordered some.  </li>
            <li> I also used this on my two year old as a body wash (he suffers from the same skin condition) and his skin was so much softer after his bath.</li>
            <li> we used it when we went on our long distance rough camping trips across the country.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it is overpriced on amazon.</li>
            <li> I think peppermint is my new secondary scent for Bronner&#x27;s soaps.</li>
            <li> I was only getting half the amount at approx.</li>
            <li> I do find that if I wash something and don&#x27;t rinse it off fairly quickly it leaves behind a little \\&quot;oil slick\\</li>
            <li> is a little guidance from me and my daily life:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, which means it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> A few times and my migraine subdued enough that I could sleep through the rest of the night.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different combinations before this one</li>
            <li> its one of the nugget in beauty product.i dont think i can ever have an empty bottle of it at home</li>
            <li> I only had to stir it a few times until it was all blended.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not much to say here and people compliment me on the smell of my soap...</li>
            <li> I like about 3 drops on my wet toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like about 3 drops on my wet toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this residue when partially washed out is causing an undesirable effect on some who complain about their hair being unmanageable afterwards, and they give up too soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> When dry, it won&#x27;t tangle or be weighted down.</li>
            <li> but it does seem to be a little watered down from the last time I bought it.</li>
            <li> - a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way, so you can dilute with water in a container, preferrably one without a pump attachment.</li>
            <li> Remember you&#x27;re never going to get that insane never-ending foam/lather without the harsh chemicals, but you&#x27;ll be surprised with how well it does on its own.</li>
            <li> Other than that this will be my soap for life.</li>
            <li> As well as other uses.     </li>
            <li> Bronners uses saponified coconut and other plant sourced oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lye is used in all soap making.</li>
            <li> but it was pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used other scents before</li>
            <li> Other shampoo recipes that are PH balanced consist of aloe and oils.</li>
            <li> This stuff can be used as shampoo, body wash, laudry detergent...and plenty of other things.</li>
            <li> Well, after receiving and reading the bottle -- I decided to make use the &amp;#34;18&amp;#34; other uses.  </li>
            <li> ... thought I was buying dish soap, but once I read through the novel on the label, realized it had other uses.  </li>
            <li> I have use this since the 1980&#x27;s when I learned about it from other Boy Scout leaders.  </li>
            <li> Since the bathroom is connected to my room, and peppermint wakes you up, I slept in the other room that night</li>
            <li> This is for the peppermint soap, I have not used the other Dr. Bronners varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It almost made me feel cold in the hot shower!</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight residue when compared to other natural/organic shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight residue when compared to other natural/organic shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I would say if your skeptical about trying Dr. Bronner&#x27;s buy the Small Bottle and try it out, it&#x27;s worth it .</li>
            <li> It is not worth buying online until the prices match the store prices.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like their naughty bits to tingle with minty freshness???</li>
            <li> How ever you will have to dilute the product down some</li>
            <li> : Here I dilute it down to like 5% soap, 95% water.</li>
            <li> I adjust up or down depending on the size.</li>
            <li> I adjust up or down depending on the size.</li>
            <li> (I could sit and sniff it all day), it also cleans extremely well!</li>
            <li> My scalp has been itchy and dry before using this and now after using, it is all healed and no more scratching my scalp.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last after you&#x27;ve washed your hair and dried it, but the hair will be hard to manage during the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is some serious bathroom-reading material, has stuff on there not even related to the soap.</li>
            <li> But that is a separate subject.  </li>
            <li> Have used Dr. Bronners off and on for over half my life.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product a number of years ago from a doctors office and it was a little thicker than this, it was as if it had been watered down.</li>
            <li> A little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> took a little bottle to work with me</li>
            <li> A 16-ounce bottle of this stuff is a little pricey</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES</li>
            <li> , it moves liquidy (is this even a word) but I needed just a little liquid soap and just added water to make my solution for my foaming pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> The mint scent leaves after a little while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been such a clutz lately!</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m not sure how the other scents would work but with peppermint, I had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> Two minutes and my mouth is a little burnt - but it&#x27;s not the end of the world and heals overnight.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m not sure how the other scents would work but with peppermint, I had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> Two minutes and my mouth is a little burnt - but it&#x27;s not the end of the world and heals overnight.</li>
            <li> I also put a little bit in with the pet laundry to get rid of odors if they vomit on their bedding etc.</li>
            <li> I completely agree with the other reviewer who mentions that the crap left by other shampoos/conditioners needs to be purged from the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not very sure if I&#x27;ll be exclusively bringing this along with my traveling.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;d never have bothered but it seems that the cosmetic industry is very slow to respond to this crucial issue.</li>
            <li> like using Bronner&#x27;s as a body wash and a few drops on each appendage is all I need in the shower.  </li>
            <li> When you use a harsh chemical like sodium tallowate, your skin absorbs some of that.</li>
            <li> After a few heart-stopping minutes, I realized my dog, Jammer, had jumped in with me</li>
            <li> A 16oz lasts me about 2.5 months of everyday use.</li>
            <li> Made my hair heavy as well.</li>
            <li> Stopped using it a few years ago,just because I ran out and then just wandered from soap-to-soap.  </li>
            <li> I bought a clothes plunger from Amazon and decided I would also go Green with my laundry soap.  </li>
            <li> you just have to drink a few bottles</li>
            <li> Everyday household cleaner:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There were quite a few items that needed to be investigated...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working well!the bottle with dried soap.</li>
            <li> Mix with half water and put into a foam soap container....and voila....!  </li>
            <li> Or have they been slowly watering it down over the years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I read a bazillion reviews on a bazillion different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; soaps, and I was shocked at what I found - most of them were loaded with chemicals and artificial fragrances!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t go overboard</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would purchase again though.  </li>
            <li> Your hair won&#x27;t feel slick because it leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> Rinse thoroughly afterward as usual.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the recommendation of a girl friend to mix in with my usual soap and &amp;#34;freshen&amp;#34; up.  </li>
            <li> This leads me to believe that traditional shampoos leave behind some of their ingredient, coating the hair and causing a nasty build-up (most likely the crap they add to hide the drying effects of the shampoo).</li>
            <li> so well it&#x27;s really hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so well it&#x27;s really hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s idiosyncratic to say the least and gives me something to read while I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
            <li> It burns your skin on contact actually and is extremely dangerous to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had any complaint</li>
            <li> I had any complaint</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a bit...odd to say the least.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin but it suds like no other, even in cold water.  </li>
            <li> Tangled, greasy, chalky, messy hair!!</li>
            <li> you realize how ridiculous our culture has become with no oversight</li>
            <li> Seriously, distilled water is like $1 a gallon.</li>
            <li> Also, it may seem a little expensive, but 16 ounces of this soap is a LOT</li>
            <li> Hard water has minerals that calcify and leave a salt like texture behind.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;d be necessary for washing my clothes, so I will have a couple travel sized bottle of this bad boy with me.</li>
            <li> If you buy the peppermint, be warned - it makes you extra cold in the shower during winter!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the “lore” behind this product.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this soap makes my showers!</li>
            <li> Just mixed a batch to spray on the veg plants as an insect repellent.</li>
            <li> We had gone three days once unable to take a bath because there was nowhere to take one.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Dr.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not rubbing a bunch of random chemicals all over me.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers mentioned the creepy label - and yes it is!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> You may feel a burning that doesn&#x27;t hurt but just a weird sensation.</li>
            <li> Being tired of the laundromat with their pricey, dirty washers</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this soap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap.</li>
            <li> And some people just have really difficult hair/skin and may need to purchase organic, PH-balanced products that are ready-made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy fake deodorized soap anymore.</li>
            <li> Nothing stinks worse than cat pee.</li>
            <li> Weird label</li>
            <li> If you have a cold</li>
            <li> For the price and the quality you&#x27;d be crazy to use anything else.</li>
            <li> the bombardment of toxic chemicals is crazy and once you start thinking about it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s took bad</li>
            <li> I had a Bad case of Ants Everywhere in my house .</li>
            <li> And, if you have hard water, BUY DISTILLED!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a devout user of Johnson&#x27;s Softwash for years, but they kept changing the formula and even it started bothering my skin :(&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the ingredients of the Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps and</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for shampoo, not so great for body wash.</li>
            <li> Great tingling sensation when used as a hair shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Great for using after a trip to the gym and a sweaty workout.  I&#x27;ve found this works best when used as a pre-wash on my hair followed by a second wash with my favorite shampoo.  The pre-wash gets all the oil and sweat out but will not condition the hair.  The second wash with my fave shampoo will leave the hair moist and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after watching the Dr. Bronner documentary. Enjoying this soap. It makes me feel great all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All One!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, but use in small quantities.  Another reviewer said to mix 1/3 product with 2/3 water to a foam dispenser, but wow!!!  I came close to burning the skin off my hands!!!  I dumped out that batch and put about 2t soap to a small 8 oz foam dispenser and my hands are happy now.</li>
            <li> this is my go-to stress relief magic bottle</li>
            <li> I use it as shampoo. It&#x27;s very refreshing and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp the way most shampoos do.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect ingredient for my homemade laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> This review is for the 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint 16 oz soap. The dropdown for all the different scents and sizes is quite a nightmare, but the hemp peppermint one is 5th from the bottom of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps for many years now and love his products. Many people know this brand from the eccentric writing that covers the entire surface of the bottle, espousing the late rabbi-chemist&#x27;s philosophy and spiritual views (on the unity of mankind: \\&quot;We&#x27;re All-One, or none\\&quot;). It wraps around the label, some of it&#x27;s written vertically, some in very tiny print. It&#x27;s idiosyncratic to say the least and gives me something to read while I&#x27;m in the shower. He wasn&#x27;t officially an ordained rabbi, M.D., or PhD, but I like his products all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But aside from that, it&#x27;s just a fantastic soap and you can feel good about supporting a company that believes in doing right by the world. It&#x27;s 100% natural, biodegradable, not tested on animals, supports Fair Trade, ingredients are certified organic, and the bottle is made from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic. It is type 1 PETE plastic, so it is accepted by municipal recycling collection. The bottle even encourages you to conserve by refilling from gallon jugs or drums at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap works into a very rich lather and smells very nice. It smells like peppermint candy and rinses off cleanly, without a filmy, slippery feeling many liquid soaps leave. I keep a bottle of it in my gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to wash fruits and vegetables because I don&#x27;t like to peel them before eating in order to retain all the nutrition and fiber. Nutrients are richest in the skin of many fruits and vegetables. The soap washes off completely and I feel safe doing this (whereas before, I was using Palmolive). This soap is safe to go in the mouth and is even somewhat pleasant tasting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this soap more. It&#x27;s simply fantastic.</li>
            <li> Cleans really well without that soapy residue afterwards. Nice smell, and for the price, well worth it to go for the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you wanna live that minty fresh life, Dr. B&#x27;S peppermint will have you tingling in all the right places. Just don&#x27;t put it anywhere &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;...made that mistake already...</li>
            <li> My soap for years now. I have yet to find a soap that makes me feel cleaner. The peppermint oils help awaken the senses.</li>
            <li> This soap has an amazing scent.  I use it as part of my organic cleaning products and it smells heavenly.  I also used the suggestion on the bottle to soak a towel (facecloth) in some warm water and a few drops of the soap.  I draped the wrung out cloth over my daughter&#x27;s face and gave her a gentle temple rub.  She LOVED the experience!.  After I bought the peppermint, I also bought the citrus orange.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome. After showing you feel so cool the scent is refreshing &amp; not over powering my family loves it!</li>
            <li> This is the only soap/shampoo that actually seems make thin, flyaway, static, winter hair full, heavy and soft like a day in May. Especially if you use Mane and Tail conditioner afterwards. However, if it&#x27;s a sticky, humid,rainy, hot day, I wouldnt recommend it because it can make it seem sticky.  Save for winter and dry weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I first purchased it for camping as it is non polluting.  But I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s easy on my skin which is kind of sensitive.  I hear you can us it as shaving cream but have not tried that yet.</li>
            <li> I had my hopes high for this soap, and I was not disappointed. I did not try the bar version of this, only the liquid and it is pretty impressive. First thing I noticed when opening the box up is that there are A LOT of words on the bottle. It is some serious bathroom-reading material, has stuff on there not even related to the soap. Forget smartphone poops, it&#x27;s going to be peppermint poops from now on. Next, when using a loofah it builds an amazing lather. Only a few drops will build enough lather to form a beard worthy of Santa himself. What else is good is that when using it, it tingles the body after a few seconds AND it smells just like candy canes. So while you&#x27;re tingly and refreshed, you&#x27;ll be smelling candy canes for the duration of the shower. So let me summarize all this up in simple pro and con form.  Pros:  Builds great lather  Smells like candy canes  Lots of reading material on bottle  Tingles  Cons:  Soap itself is just barely more viscous than water, easy to use too much (if trying to ration)  Price is higher than other body-wash  Candy cane smell does not last long, and is not powerful once dry</li>
            <li> i love peppermint and nice soap- this stuff is awesome-just be sure to dilute it on your washcloth cloth and use caution around eyes and delicate areas- its tingly and the smell is invigorating but not overpowering-really good for lingerie and a splash in the washing machine adds a peppy boost to laundry too!</li>
            <li> I would have to say that all the research I completed before buying this product was worth it an it did a great job cleaning my skin . The smell is awsome, once out the shower I felt super clean and relaxed. How ever you will have to dilute the product down some it is pretty strong. You also may want to put on lotion for it tends to dry the skin a bit. Other than that this will be my soap for life.</li>
            <li> I had tried Dr. B&#x27;s liquid castile soap at least 20 years ago and got interested in it again.  I purchased an 8 oz bottle of Peppermint and an 8 oz bottle of almond.  I like both scents.  I do notice that Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap is quite a bit thinner than I remember it being when I first tried it.  I know it isn&#x27;t my imagination on that.  So it doesn&#x27;t go as far since it&#x27;s not as concentrated as it once was.  When did they alter their formula?  Or have they been slowly watering it down over the years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started experimenting for its different uses.  As a straight (just mixed with water) shampoo I didn&#x27;t care for how my hair felt and missed some foaming action.  I read one tip to add a tsp or 2 of coconut milk with a tsp of Bronner&#x27;s liquid, and use that.  It does work to create a nice foamy potion, so that was a success.  I also mixed 1 tbsp of Bragg&#x27;s ACV in about 2 or 3 cups of water and used that as a hair rinse and my hair and scalp feel nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using Bronner&#x27;s as a body wash and a few drops on each appendage is all I need in the shower.  I tolerate the tingle of the peppermint quite well and have no issues with it.  Some people report they can smell the scent on their skin for hours afterwards, but I don&#x27;t detect it (wish I did, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried Bronner&#x27;s for cleaning anything else beyond my own body but I&#x27;m sure I will in time.</li>
            <li> I finally purchased this soap after reading all of the good reviews, and watching the documentary based on Dr. Bronner (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap Box). I am not disappointed at all.  It has a wonderful sweet peppermint smell, and the tingle isn&#x27;t too strong for me. I even washed my face with it, and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out which is amazing because I have very dry skin. The tingle on my face was also very invigorating. I also admire the way this company operates and all of the good they do in the world. I will continue to buy products from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s since the 70s and can&#x27;t imagine life without it. But lately, we&#x27;ve decided to get rid of the plastic jars in our life, as far as possible. So we&#x27;ve begun with hand soap - using directions available on the net, we turned an ordinary bar of soap into a gallon of hand soap with which we&#x27;ll refill our pump bottles. We&#x27;d never have bothered but it seems that the cosmetic industry is very slow to respond to this crucial issue. Even Dr. Bronner&#x27;s! So, from now on, I will buy Dr. Bronner&#x27;s BAR soap and convert it to a liquid soap. Please, Dr. Bronner, take your philosophy to the next level and eliminate the plastic. Your planet will thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this!!!! Makes me feel super clean, and minty tingle is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for years. I find it refreshing. It&#x27;s also a great utility soap -- I&#x27;ve even used it to rid my garden of an infestation of caterpillars! &lt;br /&gt;One warning -- do not use Dr. Bronner soaps on babies. It stings.</li>
            <li> Great product. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I go camping at an organic soap only campgrounds and so I found Castile soap to take with me. I found just a one ounce bottle and followed the directions for duluting...only after the camping trip. I must say... washing hair with this and COLD water on a very hot day with a headache is amazing.     So I started taking this with me on other trips and now use it in the shower daily. As well as other uses.     I said it was amazing with a headache. Fill a basin with hot water and a few drops of this. Take a clean wash cloth and soak it and then apply to face. OMG this works. A few times and my migraine subdued enough that I could sleep through the rest of the night. I also have neighbors who smoke so I soak my washable filter for my air purifier in water and pepperment castile and it makes all the difference when trying to sleep.     I now swear by this stuff, as well as a product by another company that I just found out was taken off the market, for my migraine treatments. I still take meds for the pain but not as many.</li>
            <li> I love this soap,It is great as a shampoo, but you have to find a balance that works for you. I am an African-American woman who wears her hair  natural and  I tried many different types of shampoo for my hair. Like many of you , I read the reviews and was a little leery about using this product for shampoo but I tried it anyway and I am so glad I did. It is wonderful and my hair has never looked better, I use 1/2 a cup of the Dr. Bonner&#x27;s, 1/2 cup of distilled water, 1 tsp of grape seed oil( you can use whatever oil you like) , 1sp of coconut oil and a 1sp of she butter melted and my hair is not dry at all. In fact it is soft and shiny and I love it! I&#x27;m not saying this combo will work for everyone. I tried a few different combinations before this one so you may have to channel your inner chemist but it was worth it and now I only use this in my hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap for hand washing. Dilute, dilute, dilute. Works wonderfully in the foaming pumps.</li>
            <li> Only the best. I use this as my go-to backpacking soap, and refill smaller containers. Works for cleaning anything you need to clean, including my, dishes, laundry, etc...please don&#x27;t use directly in water sources though!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product. You feel so clean and refreshed after use. When using any other soap products now, you never feel as &#x27;clean&#x27; until you use this product. Everything feels like it leaves a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently converted to a greener lifestyle. This product beats all the commercial companies that load their products up with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Better than what I&#x27;ve found so far but I&#x27;m going to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I use this soap as a face wash.  It is mild leaving my face clean but not dried out.  It is also very invigorating, like some other more expensive \\&quot;men&#x27;s facial scrubs\\&quot;.  I tried this stuff as an experiment and I&#x27;m glad I did, I will be purchasing more of it in the future.</li>
            <li> I just started using this soap because I wanted an environmentally friendly body wash, and it has blown me away. As a guy, I am disappointed that many environmentally friendly hygiene products are oriented towards women, so I&#x27;m also really happy that I&#x27;ve found something that both men and women can use. The peppermint smell is delicious, and I swear it actually makes me feel more awake in the morning after I shower (I looked up if this is a possibility, and studies actually show that smelling peppermint can improve your memory). This stuff is actually perfect- 100% organic, 100% post-consumer recycled bottle, and fair trade ingredients. The only downside is the crazy religious rantings on the side of the bottle, but even that can be entertaining reading in the shower. Also, it may seem a little expensive, but 16 ounces of this soap is a LOT and it should last you for months. This soap has actually made me excited to get out of bed and take showers in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I sound almost like I work for the company, but I swear I don&#x27;t- I just love this stuff so much, and it&#x27;s so good for the environment and for people. Everyone should use it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it everyday in the gym and it is so refreshing and the best part is it is both body soap and shampoo. I only use this soap. Rick Blue, PhD Psychologist</li>
            <li> Amazing at cleansing, just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!</li>
            <li> its one of the nugget in beauty product.i dont think i can ever have an empty bottle of it at home</li>
            <li> This is the only soap you will ever need. Not only is it organic, it is fair trade, and it is higher quality than those &#x27;fancy&#x27; body washes you find in beauty stores. It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s runnier than most liquid soaps, so keep that in mind when pouring it out. Like many soaps, it does get a little gunked up around the spout, but it&#x27;s an easy fix (you just have to wipe the spout from time to time). The smells is great, just like peppermint, and it lathers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Dr. Bronners mainly as a body and face wash, but I also use it as a shampoo when my hair is feeling greasy. It is a surprisingly effective face wash. The tea tree sent works particularly well on ache (if you are struggling with breakouts I strongly suggest giving this a try), and it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to keep my seborrheic dermatitis at bay (I get mine around my chin and nose)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you want a soap that is both healthy and effective, you can&#x27;t do better than this.</li>
            <li> I returned this item because I was sent something with hemp in it, which is clearly not mentioned in the add. I was contacted by someone apologizing and assisted me to return and get a refund, and they said as consideration they would send me a different peppermint body wash to try, only that was three months ago and I still haven&#x27;t seen it, so I am reposting my review of it.  Don&#x27;t order, you don&#x27;t get what is listed, they send you the peppermint that has hemp in it and it feels extra oily.</li>
            <li> I love this product and its at such a great price. I was introduced to it last year and will never look back.</li>
            <li> I make soap sometimes, so part of my review will be explaining how a soap like this would be made in comparison to bar soap and why liquid soap is almost always easier on the skin. The last part of the review will cover soap as it relates to health and some non-traditional uses of liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 16oz bottle of this stuff lasts me, my wife, and daughter 4months, maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all natural. It&#x27;s all organic. It&#x27;s easier on the skin than sodium tallowate, the #1 ingredient in nearly all bar soaps, which is nothing more than animal fat that has had lye added to it to saponify it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bronners uses saponified coconut and other plant sourced oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lye is used in all soap making. It is a strong acid that chemically binds to fat and permanently alters it&#x27;s chemical composition, creating nitro glycerine etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap in bar form requires more lye to chemically alter a greater percentage of the fats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap in liquid form uses less lye and leaves more oil in a natural state. Bio-diesel fuel is also made that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is no fat left for the lye to bind to, the lye remains in the soap. That is more likely to occur in bar soap. Lye is very acidic. It burns your skin on contact actually and is extremely dangerous to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium tallowate strips your skin of its natural oils. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap washes away your old oils, and leaves its pure plant based oils and a pleasant scent depending on which one you choose. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s does still use lye of course, but 100% of the lye is used in saponification and the soap remains in liquid form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have heard that your skin is your largest organ. You may also know that your skin is porous. This is why your skin can dry out, or why absorbing certain chemicals through the skin can be fatal. It is why you can get skin cancer etc. Your skin is a living part of your body. When you use a harsh chemical like sodium tallowate, your skin absorbs some of that. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap can be used as mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it as shampoo, but it will leave your hair a bit sticky feeling because of the oils. It leaves a slight residue when compared to other natural/organic shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great as a natural deodorant and not much is needed, it is just as good as tom&#x27;s of main and burts bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t use it as dishwasher liquid or laundry detergent because it lathers too easily. It lathers much better than most natural/organic liquid soaps I have used. But if you use it to dish wash or cloths wash manually it works excellent., but it will leave your hair a bit sticky feeling because of the oils.

            <li> I LOVE Dr Bonner&#x27;s Soaps !! No chemicals !! Plain and simple. This peppermint soap is TOTALLY refreshing ! HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and smells great</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this natural soap! Not only is its smell is wonderful (I could sit and sniff it all day), it also cleans extremely well! Perfect for washing bottles and breast pump parts.</li>
            <li> Great product for many uses. Have to dilute with water, its concentrated, and doesnt take much to get job done.</li>
            <li> I love all of Dr. Bronner soap. I use the organic lavender for my son&#x27;s evening bath. I use the citrus one for my shower and I put a few drops of this peppermint soap into my baby&#x27;s laundry to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronners castille peppermint soap provides a nice tingle in the shower for regular bathing.  This product also provides tremendous cleaning for internal enema uses as well.</li>
            <li> Meets all my showering needs as a balding guy without a requirement for a dedicated fancy shampoo. The peppermint smells great.</li>
            <li> its a great product to buy! it doesnt give that after soap slime on your body like commercial soap does, leaves u squeaky (literally) clean  make sure u put on enough lotion, or you will become ashy...great peppermint smell...greatly recommend.</li>
            <li> Marvelous stuff. A little on the pricey side but well worth it. When it arrived I remembered it from many years ago we used it when we went on our long distance rough camping trips across the country. We had gone three days once unable to take a bath because there was nowhere to take one. This was in April somewhere in Colorado and we came to a gorgeous stream. I told my husband to stop, I was going to take a bath....I had to take a bath. I grabbed a wash cloth, a towel, my bottle of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap (which was safe to use in streams) and jumped into the stream at which point I thought my heart would stop. It was like jumping into ice water. After a few heart-stopping minutes, I realized my dog, Jammer, had jumped in with me so I figured if she was in too, I&#x27;d stay. I washed her first and then me (I kept my clothes on, just washed thru them). When I got out of the stream, I was drying off, every pore in my body just vibrating, I watched Jammer shake, wondering if her pores were also vibrating. My husband never would go into the water; said he&#x27;d wait until we found a hotel (two days later). But Jammer and I felt so clean and refreshed from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, and I know from the peppermint aroma, we had to smell good to. All that came back to me in a flash when I opened the lid. At that time my group used this soap for everything and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it again.</li>
            <li> Heaven in a bottle. Seriously, this soap makes my showers! It doesn&#x27;t take much (I&#x27;m not kidding, don&#x27;t go overboard - a little goes a long way). It leaves you feeling very clean and the smell is so invigorating. I like that the product is all natural and has many other uses - which are stated on the bottle. I can&#x27;t see myself not being a loyal customer of this item. I may try the other scents as well, but peppermint will always be first. I do wish it came in a pump dispenser, so that I won&#x27;t waste any of this precious soap.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Dr.Bronners great soap for allot of things,</li>
            <li> This is the best soap around.  I&#x27;ve been using doc bronners&#x27; for about 20 years and no other soap even compares.  It&#x27;s thin but it suds like no other, even in cold water.  It&#x27;s completely organic and creualty free so you can use it with a clear conscience.  The peppermint is my personal favorite, but all the scents are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Cool and refreshing.  Not sure if I would purchase again though.  A little bit too strong on the peppermint.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! I use it at home and while camping...  and the bottles fun to read....</li>
            <li> Awesome! I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Doc Bronner&#x27;s castile soap for a while. It&#x27;s really a multipurpose cleaner but my favorite use for it is as a Shampoo! It can be used straight out of the bottle BUT it works much better when diluted. Below is a great shampoo recipe - it also functions as an amazingly moisturizing body wash AND is my all time favorite NATURAL pet shampoo. My dogs fur has never been so soft and white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For dry hair, try this recipe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup distilled/R.O/filtered water&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup liquid Castile Soap - your favorite scent&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup aloe vera gel&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon vegetable glycerin&lt;br /&gt;1/4 teaspoon avocado oil or jojoba oil [I prefer jojoba - it&#x27;s most similar to natural scalp sebum]&lt;br /&gt;1/4 teaspoon CASTOR OIL&lt;br /&gt;Flip Cap Bottles or Foaming Bottles to dispense&lt;br /&gt;**OPTIONAL: xanthan gum for thickening [I don&#x27;t mind the \\&quot;liquidy\\&quot; texture but if you want it to feel more like \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo this will do the trick! ]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Mix together all the ingredients. Store in a bottle and always shake well before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: When using the Peppermint and Tea Tree variety of this soap as a body wash, it may tingle when applied to cuts OR  your nether regions[Sorry TMI!].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;When using this as a shampoo, regular conditioner will not do one bit of good. Regular conditioner is formulated to work with conventional shampoos, which have a much lower pH than this soap. The pH is the key here. You need to be using something acidic that will balance the 8.9 pH of the soap. I like using an Apple Cider Vinegar RINSE the best. The reason your hair is thicker and heavy after using DR Bronners is because all the little cuticles on each strand of hair are standing straight out. This is what the high pH does. Lowering the pH will make these cuticles lay down nice and flat. I use 1/2Cup ACV TO 1/2Cup Water</li>
            <li> I use this soap in my liquid soap dispensers, but it&#x27;s handy for a number of uses. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> It works as a good cleaning detergent for household purposes, but a NO NO for the body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner Soap for years and love it.  I cannot go travel without this soap.  This soap takes care of all -- I can use for shampoo, for face, and of course for body wash.  It smells great, my favorite smell is Peppermint.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect body wash. The smell is refreshing and it does not leave any soapy residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent! I sometimes use it to wash my brushes, and my clients rave about how good the lavender scent smells. Use it as a face wash as well and it feels so tingly and leaves my face feeling &amp; looking clean!</li>
            <li> I hike with this soap because it&#x27;s easily biodegradable and multi-purpose. You barely need more than a drop for much of anything. But, it lathers A LOT so be weary of brushing your teeth with it. It made me choke.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. I&#x27;d like to try to use this as a natural cleanser for kitchen, bathroom, etc. But as a body wash, it was a little strong. Didn&#x27;t dry me out or anything but the smell was strong. Maybe another scent would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still love this brand because they are cruelty free!</li>
            <li> Hands down best tasting soap I&#x27;ve ever had! Used it on a long road trip and liked it so much I use it as my regular shower soap.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  This stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been making my own homemade household cleaner with it.  I was so surprised that it works considering it only takes 1 tsp of this cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;The recipe is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp of castile liquid soap&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp of washing soda&lt;br /&gt;3 TBSP of vinegar&lt;br /&gt;2 cups of hot water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix all ingredients in a spray bottle.  It will foam up.  Then just shake to dissolve washing soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff cleaned my toughest cleaning jobs and after the additional start up costs, it only costs pennies to make each batch.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this to make my own peppermint sugar foot scrubs.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It&#x27;s wonderfully fragrant, and a little goes a long way.  Dr. Bronner is the 9th in a long line of German soap makers.  He brought the soap recipe when he immigrated from Germany.  There is a fascinating documentary about his life.  But that is a separate subject.  The soap is outstanding, a great value, very gentle, really an affordable luxury.  Everybody should try this and have their own experience with it.  There are other fragrances, but we think peppermint is the best.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> No. No there is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff for 20 years; hope to use it for many many more.</li>
            <li> I made my first batch of diy laundry detergent this morning.  I used one cup of sodium carbonate (aka soda ash) along with one cup of borax powder then I grated a bar of fels-Naptha soap.  I combined all of these ingredients into a giant pot of \\&quot;near\\&quot; boiling water (5 quarts). Here is where I added 2 ounces of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soap Peppermint.  I just let it all melt with the burner turned off.  I only had to stir it a few times until it was all blended.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this peppermint soap for shaving, showering and shampooing.  I do not have sensitive skin.  I like to wash my hands with it as well.  It only takes about one or two drops to wash my hands.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I took a little bottle to work with me so I could use it all day.&lt;br /&gt;You will like it too.</li>
            <li> This soap has SUCH a wonderful scent. The peppermint wakes you right up in the morning and gets you ready to go! I love the scent and the wonderful tingle it leaves on your skin. I especially love it in the summer when it hot outside. Getting in the shower and feeling that cool tingle is just refreshing. It will probably be the only soap I will ever buy again. A 16-ounce bottle of this stuff is a little pricey but it lasts months longer than any of the commercial soaps out there. You only need a TINY bit to get a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bottle is very interesting reading if you take long showers/baths. I can&#x27;t say I understand the majority of it but its something to read :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It makes you feel so clean and gives a nice cooling effect. It&#x27;s also nice knowing I&#x27;m not rubbing a bunch of random chemicals all over me.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and I use it as my main shower soap and shampoo.  A little goes a long way, which means it lasts a long time. A 16oz lasts me about 2.5 months of everyday use. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product. There&#x27;s nothing like a burst of refreshment after you put it on in the shower or a warm bath. I use it daily....</li>
            <li> Nothing to say except it&#x27;s fantastic soap.  A little bit goes a long way.  Used on hands, hair, clothing, and cookware.  Works great.</li>
            <li> What to say about Dr. Bronners?  I have been using this soap for about 30 years.  I love it, good for so many things.  I love all these scents, but the peppermint is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I tried Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap for the first time last week. I was going to buy it from Amazon, but with Fall allergies in full swing and my soap sensitivity worse than ever, I picked some up at my local Target.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I read a bazillion reviews on a bazillion different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; soaps, and I was shocked at what I found - most of them were loaded with chemicals and artificial fragrances! I&#x27;ve been a devout user of Johnson&#x27;s Softwash for years, but they kept changing the formula and even it started bothering my skin :(&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the ingredients of the Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps and it was the first time I could ever read through the entire list and determine that there was no way I was allergic to any of the ingredients. I decided I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;From the reviews I&#x27;d read, however, a large number of people commented on the extremely strong smell of the soaps. Me, I like my soap scented just enough to be pleasant and leave a lingering clean smell - if someone can point out what I specifically smell like, it&#x27;s too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to mix it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bronner&#x27;s carries two of my all-time favorite scents - peppermint and lavender, both of which were reported to be *very* strong. I ended up buying a bottle of peppermint, a bottle of lavender, and a bottle of baby unscented. I broke out a large glass pitcher and started mixing. I eventually got to a lightly minty herbal scent that was absolutely perfect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 part Lavender&lt;br /&gt;2 parts Peppermint&lt;br /&gt;2 parts Baby Unscented&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the scents offered, I imagine there are a multitude of great scents you could combine - Eucalyptus/Peppermint/Citrus would be a great flu time soap, Lavender/TeaTree make a great herbal combo, Citrus/Almond would make a good winter mix... and those tiny bottles make for fun mixing on a budget! And remember, if any of the Bronner&#x27;s soap is ever too strong, just mix it with some Baby Unscented to mellow it out :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is happy and soft without any itching or burning, and it turns out this soap is even great for shaving my legs! It lathers so well it&#x27;s really hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had any complaint, it would be that I&#x27;d love to have more scents to play with - maybe some spicy scents like cinnamon, clove, or ginger, and soothing scents like sandalwood, vanilla, and chamomile, and maybe even some rosemary and patchouli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of single-scent natural soaps that I could buy off the shelf and mix to my liking makes me far more happy than it should :Dny itching or burning, and it turns out this soap is even great for shaving my legs! It lathers so well it&#x27;s really hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had any complaint, it would be that I&#x27;d love to have more scents to play with - maybe some spicy scents like cinnamon, clove, or ginger, and soothing scents like sandalwood, vanilla, and chamomile, and maybe even some rosemary and patchouli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of single-scent natural soaps that I could buy off the shelf and mix to my liking makes me far more happy than it should :D</li>
            <li> There is nothing better!</li>
            <li> I think peppermint is my new secondary scent for Bronner&#x27;s soaps. I always have tea tree because it&#x27;s great to shave with and I&#x27;ll use it to clean up my kitties. I have used Rose, Almond and Eucalyptus in the past. Peppermint is really refreshing with a mild, sweet lingering scent. Great for waking up!</li>
            <li> Great soap for all types of uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone who asked for it for Christmas. She loves this product and was very happy with her gift.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price one line.</li>
            <li> Great product. Refreshing peppermint!</li>
            <li> Some reviewers mentioned the creepy label - and yes it is!&lt;br /&gt;But the soap is good, a few drops are enough and it smells good. I only use it as a shower gel, but it is a concentrated product and a bottle should last a few months if you use it sparingly. smells refreshing especially if you use it with the SOAPY SOLES foot scrubber!&lt;br /&gt;also got the lavender smell. also nice and a 5 star produdct.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really nice. Cuts grease like a boss and has a nice aroma. I used some with a sponge to clean my ceramic glossy black stove top and it left much less residue than normal dish soap does. Impressive.. On to try the other many uses!</li>
            <li> Favorite summer soap, very refreshing</li>
            <li> Refreshing, invigorating and leaves my skin looking amazing. Absolutely love this soap and it lasts because you only need a small amount</li>
            <li> Only a small amount needed as it froths up amazingly.  Works well as hand soap and as shampoo, and smells great.</li>
            <li> I got this when a friend told me to try it out, and I was amazed at all the different uses for it, even as toothpaste. And the best part is, a little bit goes a long way, so even though it might seem a little pricey, you really get a lot of mileage out of it because you&#x27;re not using a bunch of it every time. This is a great product and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Makes you smell great, and doesn&#x27;t clean things very well. Do your research on this product and know what you are getting.</li>
            <li> Natural, great minty smell and effective cleaner.  leaves everything clean and fresh smelling with no residue.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> ..........you will find that this soap simply works, as it serves a multitude of purposes. In particular, I like the fact that this soap is environmentally conscious; it&#x27;s 100% vegetarian, and uses no synthetic oils. Pleasant in scent, soft, and tough on dirt and stains, it&#x27;s the perfect combination of &#x27;clean.&#x27; Just a little bit goes a long way. Just recently, I thoroughly cleaned my trash can with this fantastic product, with superior results. I recommend Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. I would buy again. I use it to clean makeup brushes and my sons hair. Great body wash too. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best soap for the summer. I feel so clean and refreshed after using it. It opens up your pores for that refreshing feeling. If you have a cold it&#x27;s great in a hot steamy shower because the peppermint gives off those refreshing vapors. As a woman it&#x27;s a funny feeling when you wash you private areas. You may feel a burning that doesn&#x27;t hurt but just a weird sensation. Overall it&#x27;s a great soap.</li>
            <li> Seriously Amazing. Fresh smell. Masculine too. Great for boaters trying to protect the water and have fewer issues with the shower pumping system.</li>
            <li> It smells great. I used it on my fine, straight hair and it was left very greasy and not easy to comb out. It felt like I had product in my hair all day and took 3-4 washed to get out. Made my hair heavy as well. I use it to clean now.</li>
            <li> Have used Dr. Bronners off and on for over half my life.  Stopped using it a few years ago,just because I ran out and then just wandered from soap-to-soap.  A few months back I watched the documentary on Dr. Bronner (phew!) and immediately ordered some.  I won&#x27;t be without it again.  It&#x27;s incredible stuff and I use it for everything, bathing, hand soap, shampoo, shaving.  It has (as noted) been toned down just a bit, but you still get that nice &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; to your scalp and skin. You actually feel good using this stuff!</li>
            <li> Being tired of the laundromat with their pricey, dirty washers I bought a clothes plunger from Amazon and decided I would also go Green with my laundry soap.  This works very well and smells great. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the job done. Next time I think I will try the lemon scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 30 years. Of course, that was before they added hemp to it. It makes your entire house smell minty after you take a shower. It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and the peppermint is quite refreshing. Because it&#x27;s concentrated, it lasts a really long time. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s also has lavender, almond, and eucalyptus versions, but the peppermint is my favorite. Also, because the soap is in liquid form, there is virtually no mess and no waste, which can happen with the last bits of bar soap.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a bit...odd to say the least.  The bottle reads like the recruitment pamphlet for a soap based cult, but don&#x27;t let that deter you.  Everything in here is organic and natural, a nice change of pace compared to a lot of bar soaps.  They also don&#x27;t test on animals which is awesome.  However, all that wouldn&#x27;t mean much if the soap didn&#x27;t do what soap is supposed to.  Luckily Dr. Bronner&#x27;s work great.  Lather is thick and rich, the scent is awesome and your skin feels way cleaner and less dried out when using this as opposed to traditional soap.  One bottle seems to last about 2 months or more with at least 1 shower a day.  For the price and the quality you&#x27;d be crazy to use anything else.</li>
            <li> Nothing more to say than that. I use this stuff all the time, for lots of different purposes.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this soap.</li>
            <li> It was a birthday present and a repeat request. The person I bought it for loves it&#x27;s fragrance, texture and cleaning power.</li>
            <li> I use this soap to wash my body and I love the way I feel afterwards. It&#x27;s kinda like the feeling you get when you breathe thru your nose after you just ate a strong peppermint. It&#x27;s an awesome buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the “lore” behind this product.  I even read a short blurb about it in Backpacker magazine.  I also wanted to reduce my footprint in the wilderness using a more environmentally friendly product.  In my opinion, the lore on this product is all hogwash.  In short, if you’re looking to use this to get anything clean, I wouldn’t recommend it.  I used this on an 85-mile backpack trip in the Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana.  I used it to clean my person, wash dishes and even to brush my teeth.  When used as a personal body wash, it doesn’t rinse off easily which can lead to dry skin and chaffing in sensitive areas when pulling down long day hikes.  I never felt clean after using this soap and had to use twice as much as other “camp” soaps.  After about 5 days (I was in the wilderness for 12 days) of using this soap to clean dishes, I reverted back to my old standby…river sand and small stones.  Even though I purchased the peppermint soap, it tasted like soap when used as toothpaste.  Let’s just say I was happy my trail partners brought along normal toothpaste.  When all is said and done, I have no idea how this soap has become so popular.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap.</li>
            <li> Sodium Hydroxide is an ingredient!!! Beware!!! All natural doesn&#x27;t always mean that it is safe. Lye aka Sodium Hydroxide can be very damaging. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Best soap. I was always an ivory soap user until my skin got dry I switched to Dove but it was pretty expensive. Then I was getting heat rashes and I got a sample from my local store and I lived the way the peppermint felt o I order it from Amazon. I imagine this size will ,sat a while.</li>
            <li> Dr Bonner&#x27;s soap is great the price here is high--try Joe the Trader (;-)</li>
            <li> I had last purchased this product nearly 30 years ago when my wife and I were regular backpackers.  We are now sailors and purchased the product for use when offshore cruising.  Oops.  Dr. Bronner does&#x27;t do well in salt water. It will not rinse off and leaves a film on your body.  If you are around fresh water, nothing beats Dr. Brommer!  If you are in salt water, try Sea Savon instead.  It is great as a body wash and shampoo, and will rinse off completely.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THE PEPPERMINT &amp;I USE THIS SOAP FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING!!! A LITTLE GOES A LONG, LONG WAYS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> Many many uses for this soap. Just mixed a batch to spray on the veg plants as an insect repellent. Love this soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I use it for cleaning everything! It works as a house cleaner, a personal cleaner, and a it is a great biodegradable backpacking soap. Just be sure to dilute as it is quite potent!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It has multiple uses and smells &amp; feels refreshing!  I Would definitely recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Awesome soap. Use it for my dreadlocks but it is really just an all around great bio-friendly soap to use. Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Castile soap is the best.  A couple of drops of this on one of those pouf things and you&#x27;ll have plenty of lather.  Also useful for cleaning counters, tub/shower, etc.  The smell is pleasantly minty, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the transaction! Love the fresh smell of the peppermint and the pure quality of the soap! Many uses, so highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It almost made me feel cold in the hot shower! Interesting right? Definitely will wake you up. Love it. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Discovered I need to use with caution in sensitive areas.  It can really heat up non exposed areas.</li>
            <li> Good scent, cleans very well, quite satisfied with this product. I have used other scents before and I&#x27;m just as pleased with this one as I was before.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s can be great added to a DIY recipe for personal care products, but it has an incorrect PH balance for your scalp/hair and skin by itself, so most recipes for personal care products that include Dr. Bronner&#x27;s also include other ingredients. Your scalp, like your skin, ranges in pH between a 4 and 7. Liquid castile soap (like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) has a pH around 8.9, which is much more alkaline and can cause itchy/dry scalp and skin. You can find many shampoo recipes online, many of which incorporate Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, but look for those that are PH-balanced for your scalp and skin. Also, since everyone&#x27;s hair/skin varies in needs, try different recipes. Other shampoo recipes that are PH balanced consist of aloe and oils. And some people just have really difficult hair/skin and may need to purchase organic, PH-balanced products that are ready-made.</li>
            <li> The soap is very strong by it self, so if you have a long day and you were stinky it gets rid of the stench really well.</li>
            <li> If you are used to a sudsy soap, this is not for you.  I like it, my husband doesn&#x27;t for that very reason.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Ever. I have never felt cleaner. I watched a documentary about this product and the family history and had to try it. I am glad I did. Honestly, the label creeps me out a little bit, but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating. This stuff can be used as shampoo, body wash, laudry detergent...and plenty of other things. The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus. Try it.</li>
            <li> love it, if you mix half of this with water and put it in a foam soap pump you have foam soap for pennies.</li>
            <li> I got this for my everything-soap to use while in the Peace Corps.  Cleans well - clothes and full body, tons of soapy suds, leaves you smelling fresh and gives you an amazing tingle (must be the menthol) but be careful...leave it on your sensitive areas too long and it&#x27;ll really wake you up!</li>
            <li> I really hated this as a shampoo. Tangled, greasy, chalky, messy hair!! The worst smell too.</li>
            <li> Since reading the label and the teachings of Dr. Bronner (&amp;#34;Each swallow works hard to be perfect pilot-provider-builder-trainer-teacher-lover-mate, no half-true hate!&amp;#34;) I have decided to start a cult.  Contact me to join- you just have to drink a few bottles and you&#x27;re in!</li>
            <li> Used it to take the gasoline smell out of a pair of pants.  Worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> Love this pure gentle soap and the wonderful peppermint scent.</li>
            <li> It really did not meet my expectations. I purchased this product a number of years ago from a doctors office and it was a little thicker than this, it was as if it had been watered down. Just saying.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years.  Has sooo many uses. Only the smallest amont needed.</li>
            <li> soap is okay, the lather is alright, but the smell is awesome, i love it. i wished it lasted longer and i dont get a the tingle that everyone talks about. over all its an ok product i might buy again</li>
            <li> Love this liquid soap. Very concentrated so it can be watered down a little to extend it&#x27;s life. Can be used for a multitude of things. I use it as hand soap, face wash, and body wash. My brother uses it to make home made shampoo. A great way to save on clutter and money! Get the bigger bottle - it&#x27;&#x27;s worth the savings!</li>
            <li> My dad always had this stuff in the house growing up! Great for the Summer to cool your skin!! Best one in my opinion! I want a life supply of this product!!</li>
            <li> Cleans better than any other body wash, feels and smells great. Can be used on severely sunburned skin to ease itch (peppermint oil). I&#x27;ll never buy fake deodorized soap anymore.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that since my family has been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap in the shower, that I don&#x27;t have to clean the shower grout very often.  In fact, today I actually used it on a scrubbing sponge to give the shower a quick once over &amp; it cleaned the shower perfectly.  Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products &amp; you will too.  Go ahead and buy the gallon - you will need it.</li>
            <li> I love this peppermint soap!   I enjoy the coolness that the peppermint leaves on my skin after a shower.  It also makes my diamond jewelry shine like new.  I&#x27;m now using it to clean all my jewelry.   I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for children or for people who have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Still good stuff but it does seem to be a little watered down from the last time I bought it. The thickness of the stuff is definately lighter than before. Still smells the same, and still has fantastic organic ingredients, but its watery.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. makes you feel tingly and smells great.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has always been one of my favorite soaps. You basically use it for everything around the house including my locks.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how fresh it makes me feel!!!! I&#x27;ll buy it again, indeed!</li>
            <li> Smells good? check&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well as hand-soap?  check&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well as body soap? (haven&#x27;t tried yet but legions of Amazon and T.Joes reviewers can&#x27;t be wrong.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All natural?  check&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to you?  check</li>
            <li> I returned the 16 oz (cost $9.49 on Amazon) and bought the 32 oz at Trader Joe&#x27;s for $9.99.  Reason: I was only getting half the amount at approx. the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the reviews on the Peppermint Hemp before I decided to purchase.  There were concerns about the &#x27;thickness&#x27; of this liquid soap but I didn&#x27;t have this concern with mine, it moves liquidy (is this even a word) but I needed just a little liquid soap and just added water to make my solution for my foaming pump dispenser. The foam is very good and if I wanted more foam and a stronger scent I can just add more soap and less water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to any other brand of liquid soap.  I absolutely adore the scent of peppermint - think aromatherapy!  There are supposed benefits of using peppermint to wash with.  When diluted with enough water the tingle you feel on your face is very pleasant and not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s took bad it took me so long to discover this Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Hemp Liquid Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I also bought Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint soap bar, ($3.29 at Trader Joe&#x27;s)  but I prefer the liquid soap way better.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever purchase the bar when the liquid is available.</li>
            <li> I used this to wash my face at one point. . . do not make the same mistake, lol. Other than that, the peppermint scent is wonderful, invigorating, and tingly! I have tried these soaps in peppermint, tea tree oil, and lavender, I love them all so far. The peppermint feels the best (if you also like that tingly clean feeling of goodness), the tea tree oil really helps keep my skin clear, and the lavender is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks ago I used the same Dr Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap but that was a more bluish in color soap. The product I received was more of a yellowish color and not nearly as good; didn&#x27;t have the same strength; Thus I was/am very disappointed. I do a lot of shopping on Amazon was this is the first time I&#x27;ve been bam boozo!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed,&lt;br /&gt;Angry &amp; Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time, great product!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff  and it does a great job cleaning his body without leaving a strong scent afterwards.</li>
            <li> I do like this soap.  The peppermint really does leave your skin tingly.  No t oily or slick, but clean.  My hair feels great when I wash with this too.  The bottle states it&#x27;s good for a whole bunch of things that I have not tried yet but in the shower, it&#x27;s top notch</li>
            <li> I have eczema and many soaps irritate my skin.  Not Dr Bonner.  Great stuff. Have used it for 5years now.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Cleans beautifully with an amazing peppermint smell!</li>
            <li> Your hair won&#x27;t feel slick because it leaves no residue. Instead, you may think it left something else. That&#x27;s your natural hair! When dry, it won&#x27;t tangle or be weighted down. I have short, thick hair and it has natural body now and is very soft to the touch. It takes hair wax well and is easy to style. The mint scent leaves after a little while. Good as body soap as well and even for laundry. But others may not like a minty washing machine.</li>
            <li> Love 4 ever Thank You</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like their naughty bits to tingle with minty freshness??? Dr. Dronner&#x27;s to the rescue!</li>
            <li> This stuff is some of the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Maybe the best.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t necessarily the best for my skin, it was somewhat drying and it didn&#x27;t help nor harm my acne. I did feel super clean after using it, but it wasn&#x27;t a miracle product in that respect. However, this is my new stain remover! It worked wonderfully when I spilled some wine on my khaki pants! I didn&#x27;t have a stain-remover on hand, so I tried dawn dish-soap, baby wipes and literally everything in my bathroom cupboard, but the ONLY thing that worked was this soap! I lifted the stain right out of my pants! The day after, I spilled some coffee on a pair of white sweatpants, yes - WHITE sweatpants, and this worked wonderfully, too! I&#x27;ve been such a clutz lately!</li>
            <li> The best soap a vegan could ask for! I make dish soap with it. It&#x27;s a bit watery when diluted, but it still works fantastic!</li>
            <li> What can&#x27;t I say about Castille soap? About 4 or 5 months ago I decided to go simple with my cleansers and had always been perplexed by Dr Bronners...what in the world do you use it for? Well, today, I pretty much use it for everything but in my dishwasher Here is a little guidance from me and my daily life:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Laundry Detergent for ONE load:&lt;br /&gt;1/4c Dr Bronners (I use peppermint for everything because you get it dirt cheap at Trader Joe&#x27;s: $9.99 for 32oz--YES, $9.99)&lt;br /&gt;1/8c white vinegar. Got a great tip from a friend and put it in a downy ball[[ASIN:B000VA2VV0 Downy Automatic Dispenser]]--it will release at the rinse cycle.&lt;br /&gt;2 tbs Borax or Washing Soda[[ASIN:B0029XNTEU Church &amp; Dwight Co 03020 Arm &amp; Hammer Super Washing Soda]]. I prefer Borax because I feel like it gets things cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Hand Soap:&lt;br /&gt;Get a foaming soap dispenser. Just go to Target and get one there than you think is cute, use all that soap and begin to use it. Fill bottle 1/3 way with water first, then add Dr Bronners (I use Almond--peppermint is too tingly and I have a 2 yr old). I add some tea tree oil to make it anti bacterial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Foaming body soap:&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I ended up washing out one of my foaming mousse bottles and now I use that in the shower. I fill 1/3 water and 2/3 Dr Bronners (I use Almond...I made the mistake only once of using peppermint. Ouch--it burns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Toilet cleaner:&lt;br /&gt;I squirt peppermint Castile soap and clean out. It works fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Everyday household cleaner:&lt;br /&gt;I fill a spray bottle mostly with water and add some peppermint Castile soap and tea tree oil for antibacterial. Too much soap and you have a residue. Start with 3/4 water and 1/4 Castile and see where that gets you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Cats:&lt;br /&gt;I have a real jerk of a cat that seems to think the best way to express his displeasure is to pee in the kitchen. Nothing stinks worse than cat pee. I use full strength PEPPERMINT Castile soap and it completely eliminates odors, better than anything I used before I discovered Castile soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the flavor depends on what you like...and since I work near a Trader Joe&#x27;s with super cheap peppermint Castile, my cleaning routine is 95% peppermint, except when it comes to anything body related *more flashbacks to shower incident*.etely eliminates odors, better than anything I used before I discovered Castile soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the flavor depends on what you like...and since I work near a Trader Joe&#x27;s with super cheap peppermint Castile, my cleaning routine is 95% peppermint, except when it comes to anything body related *more flashbacks to shower incident*.</li>
            <li> I love my Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint bar soap, so I thought I would try the liquid for my kitchen and bathroom use, and it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Something to know;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, so you can dilute with water in a container, preferrably one without a pump attachment.</li>
            <li> So i was looking for something to reduce the pimples on my skin, and i saw a review for this product. I decided to give it a go... And how thankful i am that I did! The peppermint leaves skin tingly clean, and i have noticed less and less pimples on my arms. I&#x27;m quite a happy customer!</li>
            <li> Used it on vacation where I knew I wouldnt have a machine to wash my clothes. It took very little to wash in the sink and my clothes got clean and smelled great</li>
            <li> i use it on everything that i can think of and the peppermint smell is amazing. i got the 16oz and it lasts a</li>
            <li> Love the soap! the tingle/cool is odd at first but after soothing after you get used to it. I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I had never tried Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Liquid soap before but did so after reading the reviews . I was surprised at the different ways it could be used . Let me just say using it as a Shampoo is Invigorating for your scalp . It leaves your head tingly and feeling great . But I will say that if you Don&#x27;t like your hair to have that Dry Feeling You MUST (I can&#x27;t stress that enough ) Use a CONDITIONER after . If not you Girls will Not be Happy with your hair . Aside from using it as a Shampoo I read some reviewers who used it to Repeal Ants . I had a Bad case of Ants Everywhere in my house . So I decided to give Dr. Bronner&#x27;s a try . To my surprise it WORKED ! I sprayed Dr.Bronner&#x27;s all over where the Ants were and they disappeared . That was months ago and they have yet to reappear . I would say if your skeptical about trying Dr. Bronner&#x27;s buy the Small Bottle and try it out, it&#x27;s worth it . You just my be surprised at the results . Happy Shopping :O)</li>
            <li> I use with confidence this product. The peppermint SMELLS just like peppermint, the Eucalyptus does NOT smell that much of&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus...NOT sure why???&lt;br /&gt;All Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid Castile Soaps are CONCENTRATED, no matter what size-&lt;br /&gt;That means you need to DILUTE it or you may get itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like making this last in a FOAM soap dispenser 1-to-2-parts liquid soap to 4 or 5 parts water. Total APPROX ratio: 1/4-cup liquid soap TO 1-1/4 C - 1-1/2 Cup of water&lt;br /&gt;Also I dilute this liquid soap and put it on a scrubby for a BODY WASH in the shower for FACE too!&lt;br /&gt;So far I like the ALMOND &amp; Peppermint best.  Citrus is just ok...and Eucalyptus is just ok...Lavender smelled like lavender, but EVER&lt;br /&gt;so lightly...(Not enough SMELL on that one for my own personal liking. I like something to SMELL like what it says...but that&#x27;s me.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is pretty tingle-y but really dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> I find excuses to use this soap!! Smells amazing, feelings amazing, cleans amazing, and seemingly lasts forever! What more could you want?!</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner was a cool dude, no doubt ahead of his time. I bought a bottle to try, and am really not all that impressed. It does last a long time, but my bottle didn&#x27;t clean as well as some other soaps. I might try another bottle, but I feel it&#x27;s overly priced, and more of a novelty than anything. As much as I&#x27;d like to, I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> excellent product, fast delivery, works as expected.</li>
            <li> it is good stuff really makes you feel good after taking a shower or bath with it makes your whole body feel rejuvenated</li>
            <li> I love this soap for cleaning the shower tub sinks.  Great  fresh scent and a powerful cleaner. I will purchase again.  I have tried the almond soap but not as thrilled as I was with the peppermint.</li>
            <li> It is great soap, I love it! The mint feels super tingly (some people might not like that), but I personally do. The only down side is that it is overpriced on amazon. It is sold in health food stores, Trader Joes, and Whole foods at half the price as it is sold on Amazon. It is not worth buying online until the prices match the store prices.</li>
            <li> If you care about what you put on your skin and hair, then THIS is for you as it comes &#x27;chemical free&#x27;. It smells pleasant and can be used as soap or shampoo or as bath bubbles. The peppermint is mild and fresh smelling. The rose also is lovely. I would never go back to chemical soaps now. Especially having found out that they can create HUGE amounts of sulphur in the body which leads to malabsorption. This is found everywhere so easy to come by as well. 10 out of 10 Dr Bronner. Thank you for keeping me safe and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I remember this stuff from my childhood. I&#x27;ve heard it referred to as \\&quot;hippy soap\\&quot;. I remember the \\&quot;peppermint tingle\\&quot;. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 3 months ago that I actually bought my own. I decided to replace my chemical-laden hygiene products with safer ones - relying on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database to guide me to a better place. There were quite a few items that needed to be investigated...I was looking for a price I could afford, high reviews, and low scores on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep. So I found body wash, soap, shampoo, dish rinse, laundry detergent, toothpaste...and then I found Dr. Bronners...one product to handle all those tasks. It sure made things easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just think about how all of those products are going on your skin at some point...and then being absorbed...multiple times a day, every day, for years...the bombardment of toxic chemicals is crazy and once you start thinking about it you realize how ridiculous our culture has become with no oversight whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s carries \\&quot;Champion Status\\&quot; at the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website that ranks products based on their danger/toxicity. This means they have signed a pledge to use only the safest ingredients in all their products. On a scale of 0-10 (0 being the safest), this product scores a 1. I think if you averaged the scores of all the products I have replaced with it, you&#x27;d get about a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now buy it by the gallon and have just purchased my second one (3 months later). Do the math and I think my girlfriend and I will go through about 4 gallons a year with all the uses mentioned here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DILUTE DILUTE DILUTE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Wash: The standard dilution here of about 20% soap to 80% water works fine. You can adjust to your liking/lather preferences. I had been using a Dial foaming hand soap in all my rooms and I&#x27;ve emptied those, cleaned them real good, and converted them to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s foaming dispensers. I love the results. It foams up real good and the lather is good. If you want more, just up the strength (reduce dilution) a little bit. You may find this leaves a little \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; in certain spots that will be extra-noticeable with cold water/air - you may enjoy this or not...either way it&#x27;s certainly not a big deal and you do get used to it. The other thing to get used to is that you won&#x27;t have that slimy feeling on your skin that we&#x27;ve probably learned to associate with being clean. That&#x27;s just the chemicals on your body...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hand Soap: Using the same dilution (20/80) and re-purposed foaming bottles, I keep this in all bathrooms as hand soap. Not much to say here and people compliment me on the smell of my soap...even if they wonder what the heck it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dish Rinse: Once again I go with about 20/80 in a squirt bottle in my kitchen. You&#x27;ll be surprised how well it cleans. When you start seeing the bubbles/lather reduce, squirt a little more and keep going. Remember you&#x27;re never going to get that insane never-ending foam/lather without the harsh chemicals, but you&#x27;ll be surprised with how well it does on its own. I do find that if I wash something and don&#x27;t rinse it off fairly quickly it leaves behind a little \\&quot;oil slick\\&quot; that is most noticeable on metallic items...but it&#x27;s organic and safe...and if you just run your sponge over it real quick and rinse, it&#x27;s gone. Not a problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floor Cleaner: Here I dilute it down to like 5% soap, 95% water. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and cleans up nicely - the smell is good too...and it&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m not just filling the air with chemical fragrances than can linger in my home for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: I keep some in a bottle at full strength and pour about a teaspoon in my hand, rub together a little, then put it in my hair and clean as usual...you probably need more if you don&#x27;t have short guy hair like me. I might try to dilute this to 50% only because at full strength it likes to clog the little opening ofthe bottle with dried soap. It cleans my hair well and I follow it up with [[ASIN:B0017QT5UM Dr. Bronner - Organic Shikakai Conditioner Hair Rinse, 8 fl oz liquid]]. My girlfriend&#x27;s hair did not appreciate this method as much as mine did and so I&#x27;ve switcher her over to Yes to Cucumbers (or Yes to Carrots) shampoo and conditioner which is great as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laundry Detergent: I keep a gallon in my laundry room and put about 1/3 cup for an average large load. I adjust up or down depending on the size. I augment it with some baking soda which is really cheap. At ~$50 per gallon this is more expensive than your typical Tide chemical gallon but once you factor in that you don&#x27;t really need (or I don&#x27;t, at least) fabric softener, the price difference is not as large. If you wash with the chemicals you have them on your skin all day long...every time you sweat they&#x27;re soaking into your skin...no thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste: this is the only other time I use the product at full strength - and I may well dilute it a little soon. I like about 3 drops on my wet toothbrush. I know what you&#x27;re thinking \\&quot;eww, soap in my mouth?!\\&quot; I&#x27;m not sure how the other scents would work but with peppermint, I had no problem with it. With just the three drops, it foams up quickly and feels and tastes clean. Brush as normal but one warning: don&#x27;t take forever. Peppermint oil, especially at full strength, can burn your skin a little if left on too long. I find that if I brush for about 1 minute it&#x27;s not a problem at all. Two minutes and my mouth is a little burnt - but it&#x27;s not the end of the world and heals overnight. This is why I am considering going with a 1:1 ratio of soap to water and using like 6-10 drops. UPDATE: I have been combining equal parts extra virgin coconut oil and baking soda + Dr. Bronner&#x27;s (for the peppermint/cleaning) as a homemade toothpaste and it&#x27;s working well!the bottle with dried soap.

            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is a great product for natural cleaning. I am used to the Whole Foods brand of castile soap, which is a lot thicker than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s works just as well. I fill a spray bottle with water, a few squirts of castile soap, and tea tree and lavender essential oils, which makes a great kitchen counter cleaner!</li>
            <li> I love this soap...it is my body wash, shampoo, dish liquid, hand soap, etc. It is gentle and natural. Finally, something really natural! I&#x27;m fed up with all of these beauty products which claim to be natural or even organic, yet have nice list of chemicals on their ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This one bottle does it all, without the chemicals, and it works. I see many people who say this dries their hair when using it as a shampoo. I don&#x27;t get that, as this is the only soap I could wash my hair with and not need conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This does contain coconut oil which can be somewhat drying (as compared to a pure olive oil Castile soap), but it certainly is more gentle than the synthetic detergents in traditional shampoos (including ones which claim to be natural). I always needed conditioner after using a traditional shampoo. My fine, wavy hair always felt heavy and looked lifeless after using these shampoos and their needed conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I began using Castile soap and decided to try it as a shampoo. The very first day after shampooing with this (no conditioner), I took a brush to my hair expecting tangles. There were none. The brush went right through my hair with no pulling, and when it dried, it felt clean and lacked it&#x27;s usual overly-frizzy appearance (which was a good thing). I give the naturally occurring glycerine credit for taming the frizz and tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The more I used it (took about 3-4 shampoos), the better my hair looked and felt. This leads me to believe that traditional shampoos leave behind some of their ingredient, coating the hair and causing a nasty build-up (most likely the crap they add to hide the drying effects of the shampoo). Perhaps this residue when partially washed out is causing an undesirable effect on some who complain about their hair being unmanageable afterwards, and they give up too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I completely agree with the other reviewer who mentions that the crap left by other shampoos/conditioners needs to be purged from the hair. Then she states that the natural oils will then be able to penetrate the hair. This is right on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As I mentioned, I have fine hair, and therefore I don&#x27;t need much product and it&#x27;s easy to rinse out. It&#x27;s possible some of the people who are disliking this as a shampoo may possibly have thicker hair. These individuals might need a little more product, or they are not working it through their hair enough. This soap does not have a high lather, and it is sometimes hard to know where it is going. It also needs to be rinsed thoroughly, something else that would be more difficult with thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If someone is to find it doesn&#x27;t work for their hair anyway, and it still feels dry (perhaps damage from heat and chemical treatment like color?), a conditioner may be needed in addition. A little drop or two of jojoba or extra virgin olive oil worked through might be helpful if one wishes to avoid traditional bottle conditioners. Possibly even try mayonnaise as an in-shower conditioner. Olive oil mayo is a good choice and will help distribute some of the oil throughout the hair. Rinse thoroughly afterward as usual.</li>
            <li> This is heaven sent. I use this brand for EVERYTHING from washing my dishes to brushing my teeth. I love this brand!</li>
            <li> Worked very good for my husband and I. My scalp has been itchy and dry before using this and now after using, it is all healed and no more scratching my scalp. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this peppermint soap and find that it can be used for various things.  I use it to bathe, clean my makeup brushes and to scrub the bathtub.  It removes stains effortlessly.  I&#x27;ll always have a bottle of this soap on hand.</li>
            <li> Great price, scent and speedy delivery. I&#x27;m a big fan of the lavender scent but the peppermint had a better price, not sure why. Pleasant shopping experience, I will definitely be a repeat costumer of this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought them for years and this one smells nice, too. I try to get different scented ones because the soaps lasts quite a while and has a great lather. When it comes to all-natural this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff as both a body wash and shampoo in the shower.  I think it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Best to dilute it for shower use just because it will last longer that way.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 16 oz bottle of this nifty gifty as part of my research for when I&#x27;m out and about traveling. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was mainly interested in how well it cleans the body, how well it acts as shampoo, soap, tooth paste, and cleaning laundry. For the latter, it does very well cleaning laundry. I had a worn down, not so great smelling pair of shorts that I washed with vinegar, but the stench was still present. When I bought Dr. Bronners, I did the same thing and the smell was gone, replaced with the peppermint scent of the soap, which is a welcome addition. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a toothpaste? It&#x27;s definitely more of a \\&quot;function over fashion\\&quot; kinda thing. Has a very soapy quality to it, as one would expect. But hey, it cleans the mouth/teeth, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important. Just chew some gum or clean your palette with something else if it&#x27;s unbearable. For me, it was fine--didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For shampoo? Don&#x27;t use a lot of it as it does dry the hair quickly. It doesn&#x27;t last after you&#x27;ve washed your hair and dried it, but the hair will be hard to manage during the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not very sure if I&#x27;ll be exclusively bringing this along with my traveling. I think it&#x27;d be necessary for washing my clothes, so I will have a couple travel sized bottle of this bad boy with me. ;D And it&#x27;ll also be good for emergencies, when I don&#x27;t have body wash, shampoo, tooth paste, or if I need it to clean something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review has helped! Just reiterating, it&#x27;s a GREAT product. But when a person is able to bring as many 3 oz bottles that can fit comfortably in a zip lock bag, there&#x27;s really no point in JUST bringing Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, which is what I was interested in. :) It&#x27;s definitely not something to knock points off of this product.</li>
            <li> Love the peppermint smell! It is strong and wakes me up in the morning</li>
            <li> I love the soap but wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it for years.  It really cuts through a lot of grease, cigar and cigarette smoke, etc.  Great stuff</li>
            <li> Love this soap but the Peppermint is probably not the best for washing your body...and certain areas.  I prefer the orange oil for the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the recommendation of a girl friend to mix in with my usual soap and &amp;#34;freshen&amp;#34; up.  Well, after receiving and reading the bottle -- I decided to make use the &amp;#34;18&amp;#34; other uses.  We use this soap for many things - such as supplementing shampoo (feels terrific as a scalp massage!), cleaning my mom&#x27;s bathroom (all old tile) and it removed all kinds soap scum and grout stains, I could go on but you get this point.  This soap is the best!  Wish I knew about it years ago!</li>
            <li> If you buy the peppermint, be warned - it makes you extra cold in the shower during winter!</li>
            <li> I love this soap very much. Ever since my girlfriend introduced this to me I keep coming back for more. It leaves your body tingling and cool when you get out of the shower which is awesome when you live somewhere hot and humid.</li>
            <li> Mix with half water and put into a foam soap container....and voila....!  and it smells like peppermint to boot.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I use it for everything. I use it for cleaning my countertops and hardwood floors. My house smells naturally fresh and clean. In the hot weather or after working out, I use this as a body wash in the shower, it is so refreshing and exhilirating!</li>
            <li> JUST AS I THOUGHT GREAT</li>
            <li> Great soap - does not leave residue like body washes do - easy to rinse off, and cleans thoroughly. Using for 20 years now - almost exclusively for showering.</li>
            <li> Pretty much more of what has been said, it really does cool you down in hot climate and engages your sense of smell as well, great stuff.  It does not take much to develop a good lather so a bottle of this size is great value and will last a while.  Highly recommend trying it out!</li>
            <li> Love it! Haven&#x27;t found a soap that can stack up to this one yet. Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I can wash my clothes with it, my dishes and even brush my teeth with it.  Everything but wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After reading many reviews I was determined to use Dr Bronners Magic soap (diluted) as a shampoo but no matter what I tried it came out horrific. I had hoped that I could use this as a rinse after the magic soap as I had read but that was a major &amp;#34;FAIL&amp;#34;. I even tried super diluting the magic soap and dumping a whole bottle on vinegar on my head, still came out nasty. So needless to say, 18-in-1 magic soap is a 17-in-1 since I can wash anything but my hair with it. I&#x27;m set on this soap for life. I love the peppermint tingle too.</li>
            <li> Meh, not so great. Strong smell, but not a good feeling after using. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Plus its covered with some kind of hokey new-age junk.</li>
            <li> PEPPERMINT SOAP IS ALL WHAT IT CLAIMS TO BE. IT IS DEFINITELY REFRESHING AND TINGLING FOR SURE. WILL DEFINITELY BUY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I seem to be allergic to this.  I wish I was not since I am trying to be organic more and this would have really been great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it for house hold cleaning. I love the fresh mint smell and how a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is soooo refreshing.  It took me forever to figure out what it was... thought I was buying dish soap, but once I read through the novel on the label, realized it had other uses.  I now use it as shampoo and body wash.  It leaves me feeling cleaning, and the refreshing tingle lasts long after the bath or shower.  This stuff lathers thick and velvety, but rinses easily with no residue.  The bottle mentions that it&#x27;s good for a massage, too, but I haven&#x27;t tried that.  Will definitely get more and buy as a gift in the future!</li>
            <li> Will wake you right up and cruelty-free</li>
            <li> I have use this since the 1980&#x27;s when I learned about it from other Boy Scout leaders.  It is very refreshing especially after a swim at the beach.  Since it is pure soap I used it as a shampoo plus a body wash.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the peppermint and lavender scents, but they work so well and I love them!!! I used the peppermint one to scrub a spot on my bathroom carpet (house came like that and I rent, otherwise that stupid bit would be gone) and it worked great. The only drawback was, even though I only used 1/8 a cup soap to half a gallon of water, it still had a strong smell. Since the bathroom is connected to my room, and peppermint wakes you up, I slept in the other room that night lol. And, if you have hard water, BUY DISTILLED!!!! I see so many people saying its gritty, and its because you used hard water. Hard water has minerals that calcify and leave a salt like texture behind. Seriously, distilled water is like $1 a gallon.</li>
            <li> Weird label but it&#x27;s great product.</li>
            <li> I like all the Dr Bronner&#x27;s products I have tried.</li>
            <li> ok but a bit runny not as thick as I remembered</li>
            <li> This arrived in a plastic bag in order to prevent it from leaking.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, it did not leak and I enjoy the product. It provides a nice tingling sensation when used as a bath soap. However, I do not recommend using it as shampoo because it caused me to have dandruff and an oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to use it as a cleaner so I have no opinion on that job.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it is one soap that makes me feel clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I even use it on my face and I get compliments all the time on my glowing complexion.  LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Yes I like all Dr. Bronners products and this is a classic; you can use for anything really from shower to dishes, clothes etc... great smell</li>
            <li> This is for the peppermint soap, I have not used the other Dr. Bronners varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has countless uses! But I use it (and love it!) for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do rescue and have multiple cats/dogs at home, not a week goes by without pee/vomit or poo on my floor (gross, but what can you do?). After spending soooo much money on Natures Miracle, I accidentally used this on my kitchen tile and voila!! I now use it on tile, hardwood floors and the carpet in my bedroom. I&#x27;ve even used it on my car upholstery and it completely gets rid of odors!! I mix it with some water (more or less 2oz soap to 12oz water) in a spray bottle and shake it up a bit before each use. I also put a little bit in with the pet laundry to get rid of odors if they vomit on their bedding etc. This can get very sudsy, so use sparingly!</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff so much, I purchased the lavender as well. I suffer from keratosis pilaris, which is virtually impossible to get rid of completely, and after using this stuff consistently in addition to my usual lotion, I have seen a huge improvement. I think the oils must make my skin softer and thereby making is easier to exfoliate. I don&#x27;t care for it as a shampoo, it left my hair feeling kind of dry. I also used this on my two year old as a body wash (he suffers from the same skin condition) and his skin was so much softer after his bath. The peppermint is strong but delicious smelling and if you are sick or congested, this is a wonderful way to temporarily relieve your congestion in the shower.</li>
            <li> this is a natural product which makes your skin tingle, and a bottle this size lasts two people three months. we have been buying this for years.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it for cleaning and bathing. Will be trying some of the other scents and for sure the solid bars</li>
            <li> This is what i was using when i started my dreades, its a wonderful all around cleansing, disinfecting, product</li>
            <li> I had never used this before, but I really like and now I&#x27;m hooked. The smell is fantastic. I make body wash with this and use it as a cleaner for mopping. If you clean with this, you won&#x27;t need air freshener because it leaves a wonderful peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> This product must have a great marketing team because so many people rant and rave about it and I just don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive skin, so trying new soaps doesn&#x27;t work all that well for me, but I got a free sample and the person that recommended it was very adamant about how much she loved it, so I figured....it was all organic ingredients, might as well try.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I used the sample when I got home and about an hour later I noticed that my skin was more oily than usual and I can only assume its caused by the change in soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I will be giving my friend the rest of the sample because I don&#x27;t need to feel sticky an hour after I&#x27;ve taken a shower.  Glad I didn&#x27;t actually pay for this product!!</li>
            <li> I use this on myself and my dogs. A friend who rescues dogs recommended it for my furkids and I was pleasently surprised at how well it works even on my allergy dogs.</li>
