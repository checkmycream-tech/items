            <li>Awesome!  </li>
            <li>Best shampoo I have every used.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair beautiful</li>
            <li>The product was shipped in good condition</li>
            <li>Not as good as the ones that have the shampoo and conditioner separate but is recommended nonetheless.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s covered in dandruff also, told me she&#x27;d been using my Dove because it smelled so good.  </li>
            <li>and it does almost as equally good job</li>
            <li>As what I have written in title, this is what I think best one of the cheap choices.</li>
            <li>this shampoo/conditioner  is great for my hair  after using this shampoo  my hair feels clean  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and yet, a very effective cleanser for the hair and</li>
            <li>I am highly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Nobody else on the reviews is mentioning this, so I thought I&#x27;d better say something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>do still love my Dove Bar soap.  </li>
            <li>really enjoyed using this shampoo, though.</li>
            <li>I love that their shampoo + conditioner isn&#x27;t just another shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love all the Dove products.</li>
            <li>the smell is refreshing and not over powering like others...</li>
            <li>The 2-in-1 was AMAZING - to get my hair clean and 3/4 conditioned in one step?  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t over-condition fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Not the best shampoo - felt it was too heavy on the conditioning  part.</li>
            <li>The smell is always great, although sometimes different.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want spend much on shampoo, I think that is a nice choice.</li>
            <li>I have tried all sorts of brands, many require using a lot of shampoo, making them very uneconomical...</li>
            <li>Not bad if you&#x27;re looking for convenience in the shower.</li>
            <li>it works good, there&#x27;s better but this is good for the price, frieda products have a slight edge, pantene,  and sassoon, but its still a personal thing</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal user of Dove&#x27;s hair products for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and does not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dove for 5 years now and my hair is always soft, light, fragrant, and smooth.</li>
            <li>They were a revelation for my medium-ish texture, wavy, and tangle-prone hair when I first tried them.  </li>
            <li>I like what it does for my hair and will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>I have long very fine hair and this cleans well</li>
            <li>Getting it all done satisfactorily in one step is even more important now that I have two little kids.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s very particular about what she uses</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what they were thinking of with this formula change, but it will likely lose me as a loyal Dove hair care customer!</li>
            <li>Decent scent as well.</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick texture which refreshes the hair, cleans and conditions well.</li>
            <li>But worse, my hair gets greasier far more quickly than it used to - and given that that is an issue I already have generally, that is just unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Met my expectations completely.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to find a good shampoo to manage all the craziness.</li>
            <li>Not sure what This Seller Is Doing?&lt;br /&gt;It is a Good product as I have Used it in the past.</li>

            <li> Met my expectations completely. I am highly satisfied with this product.The product was shipped in good condition and I got it on time too.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the ones that have the shampoo and conditioner separate but is recommended nonetheless. This is an all in one solution for your hair care needs.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal user of Dove&#x27;s hair products for over 10 years.  They were a revelation for my medium-ish texture, wavy, and tangle-prone hair when I first tried them.  The 2-in-1 was AMAZING - to get my hair clean and 3/4 conditioned in one step?  Awesome!  Getting it all done satisfactorily in one step is even more important now that I have two little kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now - I am extremely unhappy with the formula change starting with the set I got last year.  My hair is definitely not as well conditioned with this formulation.  But worse, my hair gets greasier far more quickly than it used to - and given that that is an issue I already have generally, that is just unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking of with this formula change, but it will likely lose me as a loyal Dove hair care customer!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair beautiful</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of brands, many require using a lot of shampoo, making them very uneconomical... I have long very fine hair and this cleans well, I don&#x27;t have to use much, I use it almost everyday and it doesn&#x27;t over-condition fine hair.  I do use a shampoo without conditioner about once a week to avoid any buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If it had a milder scent, I would give it five stars.  For some reason this is hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this shampoo and we can not find it anywhere. So when I seen it here I ordered her 3 bottles. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Not bad if you&#x27;re looking for convenience in the shower. Not the best shampoo - felt it was too heavy on the conditioning  part.</li>
            <li> I do not usually have trouble with dandruff, but some shampoos make my head itch.  I used the Dove Shampoo for two months and slowly the itching began, and yesterday my wife looked at my head and told me I had bad dandruff.  I looked at hers today (black hair to her butt) and she&#x27;s covered in dandruff also, told me she&#x27;d been using my Dove because it smelled so good.  She&#x27;s never had dandruff before in her life.  Nobody else on the reviews is mentioning this, so I thought I&#x27;d better say something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still love my Dove Bar soap.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years and it&#x27;s the nicest soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My mom had me order this for her and she likes it... thats all i can say. and she&#x27;s very particular about what she uses</li>
            <li> it works good, there&#x27;s better but this is good for the price, frieda products have a slight edge, pantene,  and sassoon, but its still a personal thing</li>
            <li> I am used to using shampoo and conditioner separately due to having long hair.  Yet, I thought I would buy this since it was on sale and it does almost as equally good job and it takes less time to shampoo when using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had dandruff in my life, prior to using this shampoo for several months. I did not get a terrible case of it, but I definitely got it. Since I&#x27;ve stopped using this product, my dandruff has gone away with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed using this shampoo, though. It has a nice thick texture which refreshes the hair, cleans and conditions well. Decent scent as well.</li>
            <li> When I Purchased The Add said (Pack of 2) and the invoice and shipper says (Pack of 2) although now I see the add&lt;br /&gt;does not say (Pack of 2) Plus The Price has changed so it must have been changed after my purchase. This is the reason for only 2 Stars. Not sure what This Seller Is Doing?&lt;br /&gt;It is a Good product as I have Used it in the past.</li>
            <li> Dove has changed their formula 1000 times but it still works the same. The smell is always great, although sometimes different. I love that their shampoo + conditioner isn&#x27;t just another shampoo. It does make your hair feel conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, mixed (dry and oily) hair and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to find a good shampoo to manage all the craziness. With cheaper brands, there is a noticeable waxed feeling. I&#x27;ve been using Dove for 5 years now and my hair is always soft, light, fragrant, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have every used. I love all the Dove products.</li>
            <li> this shampoo/conditioner  is great for my hair  after using this shampoo  my hair feels clean  I have been looking and looking .well I have found it</li>
            <li> As what I have written in title, this is what I think best one of the cheap choices. If you don&#x27;t want spend much on shampoo, I think that is a nice choice. ruguo ni youqian  paul mitchell xifashui zhen de hen haoyong..</li>
