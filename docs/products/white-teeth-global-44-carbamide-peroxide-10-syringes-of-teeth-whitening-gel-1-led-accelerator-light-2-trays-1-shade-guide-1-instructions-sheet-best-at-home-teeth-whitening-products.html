            <li>Overall the gel works great!</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>My teeth were probably a very bright yellowish color when I started, so the results are definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s great for sensitive teeth.  </li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t use the whitening trays that came with them because they&#x27;re very bulky and since they&#x27;re not tight around your teeth I don&#x27;t feel they do the best job</li>
            <li>dental whitening is a lot more effective with just one treatment rather than the 6 tubes i have used so far.</li>
            <li>you get 10 syringes, 1 led light and 2 trays.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>I originally went and had them whitener in a Dental office but wanted to continue the process.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and with directions.  </li>
            <li>, it tastes exactly like cloves, not good, this whitening kit has ten syringes, it&#x27;s awesome, but since it takes longer, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s five to seven syringes, which is still good</li>
            <li>much more affordable than the dental kits and works just as good if not better</li>
            <li>It was as good as I expected.</li>

            <li>Absolutely luv!</li>
            <li>Ok, zoom white is much faster at whitening, but I can&#x27;t stand the taste of it</li>
            <li>i did burn my gums a bit the first time, but i just had too much product in the tray, no problems since.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for myself and it works very well.  </li>

            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, it says don&#x27;t get on your gums, seriously don&#x27;t, this stuff is very strong, burns gums very easily, also never lay down with trays in, you may fall asleep, I did this once, my gums had to heal up</li>
            <li>If your teeth are hurting you or if your gums are hurting, do not be alarmed, this is normally.</li>
            <li>In my opinion ot does the exact same job as the one I buy from my dentist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, the products works as advertised and is worth the money, but 44% H2O2 is incredibly high conc. and can do severe gum damage so be careful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several bleaching kits and they all do well, with this particular kit</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the light that comes with it</li>
            <li>, I recommend this to anyone, maybe not if your mouth is sensitive, I use gentle white pronamel toothpaste, it helps with enamel, if your not patient and want killer whitening in one or two days I recommend Phillips zoom day white</li>

            <li>The peroxide burned my gums but that was expected with a high concentration and ill fitting trays.</li>

            <li> Be careful and follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Leaves white stains on your teeth don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the problem with burning gums that other people have posted.</li>
            <li> The trays were hard to shape (I totally bent one and had to cut off a section in the back) and hard to hold in my mouth.</li>

            <li> In fact, if your gums aren&#x27;t hurting the first few times, you&#x27;re doing something wrong.</li>

            <li> No bubbling or slight burning of my gums.</li>
            <li> The gel burned my gym a little</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times and have seen a difference.  </li>
            <li> Obviously much less expensive the similar procedure at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I am unsure if this will eventually give me the results I am looking for, but it has worked as well as the whitening strips sold at stores, but much less expensive.</li>
            <li> however they are very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Messy, hard to use and did not work!!!</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this.</li>
            <li> Just be very careful because the injury to the gums can be painful!</li>
            <li> burned my gums so bad that I had to throw it away</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what, but this is a dud.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad and was gone by morning anyway.</li>
            <li> disappointed in results.</li>
            <li> They also burn your gums very badly.</li>

            <li> I was excited to try this product. However, it burned my gums so I couldn&#x27;t get any results..</li>
            <li> burned my gums so bad that I had to throw it away</li>
            <li> I agree with others that if you get it on your gums, watch out...it burns.  I use a cotton swab to apply to teeth rather than put a dot into the trays.  Product arrived quickly and with directions.  I have used it a few times and have seen a difference.  I am unsure if this will eventually give me the results I am looking for, but it has worked as well as the whitening strips sold at stores, but much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Messy, hard to use and did not work!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself and it works very well.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great and quick, have tried a lot of these products..this works great....much more affordable than the dental kits and works just as good if not better</li>
            <li> I was just replacing my previous purchase. Love this item. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the strongest whitening you can buy! Love white teeth! No complaints...at all! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this. I&#x27;ve used several teeth whiteners and this one burns yours gums,  if it come near them. Should of listen to the reviews</li>
            <li> Great product.  I could tell a difference after only one use.  And it&#x27;s great for sensitive teeth.  Didn&#x27;t irritate my teeth at all.</li>
            <li> I do think these helped whitten my teeth however they are very hard to use. They also burn your gums very badly.</li>
            <li> Love this bleaching system. I&#x27;ve tried several bleaching kits and they all do well, with this particular kit you get 10 syringes, 1 led light and 2 trays. In my opinion ot does the exact same job as the one I buy from my dentist. (More expensive with dentist though) soon as i put on the solution I can feel it work. Definitely noticeably results after 1 use. Only thing i would say is i wish they had different trays i dont like the ones they send&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy from the seller again.</li>
            <li> this product lives up to it&#x27;s claim</li>
            <li> THIS IS NICE, IT IS FOR MY GRAN-DAUGHTER.THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Mouth guards shriveled up to the point not usuable</li>
            <li> disappointed in results.</li>
            <li> I have purchased teeth whitening gel plenty of times. They have always worked well. I can feel the bubbling and the reaction with the carbamide peroxide. This is the strongest one I have bought. This gel did nothing. No bubbling or slight burning of my gums., No whitening at all. It just didn&#x27;t work whatsoever. Don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what, but this is a dud.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Over the years I&#x27;ve  tried many whiting products that costs much more than this product and they didn&#x27;t  work as well. 4 treatments and my teeth are VERY white. I tube gives several treatments. When I run low I will buy this again. Thank you so much for offering  this product at a great price. A++++</li>
            <li> Pleased with the whitening gel. The trays are bulky and don&#x27;t fit my small mouth, but I have a custom tray that works. I haven&#x27;t had the problem with burning gums that other people have posted. I bought the product because of the reviews and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> great product, each tube lasts me two uses. my only complaint is i don&#x27;t thinks its working as well as you think it would. dental whitening is a lot more effective with just one treatment rather than the 6 tubes i have used so far.</li>
            <li> The trays were hard to shape (I totally bent one and had to cut off a section in the back) and hard to hold in my mouth. The peroxide burned my gums but that was expected with a high concentration and ill fitting trays. I think this may be the best you can do with a home system. Obviously much less expensive the similar procedure at the dentist. Just be very careful because the injury to the gums can be painful!</li>
            <li> The whitening gel does work. I&#x27;ve always used nite white 22% products and I do think they work faster but this works too! I don&#x27;t use the whitening trays that came with them because they&#x27;re very bulky and since they&#x27;re not tight around your teeth I don&#x27;t feel they do the best job so I use my custom trays I had made. The gel burned my gym a little but it was my fault I didn&#x27;t wipe it off. It wasn&#x27;t bad and was gone by morning anyway. I&#x27;m not sure about the light that comes with it, I don&#x27;t notice any faster results with it. Overall the gel works great!</li>
            <li> Great product. If your teeth are hurting you or if your gums are hurting, do not be alarmed, this is normally. In fact, if your gums aren&#x27;t hurting the first few times, you&#x27;re doing something wrong. Your teeth and gums will get used to this. When I first started using these products, my gums and teeth would be very sore and sensitive. Now I can bleach my teeth for an hour with no problem at all and my teeth are very white! My teeth were probably a very bright yellowish color when I started, so the results are definitely noticeable. This is the best deal on Amazon, 10 syringes, 2 trays and a light for less than 20 dollars is phenomenal. I will definitely be purchasing my product from this seller/company from now on. I pair for over night shopping and received my item by 12pm the following day. Over night shipping was only $3.99, what a bargain! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Absolutely luv! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Whitener as expected. I originally went and had them whitener in a Dental office but wanted to continue the process. I opted to buy this kit versus the one offered in the clinic. Much lower cost than the dentist. Worked great</li>
            <li> Ok, zoom white is much faster at whitening, but I can&#x27;t stand the taste of it, it tastes exactly like cloves, not good, this whitening kit has ten syringes, it&#x27;s awesome, but since it takes longer, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s five to seven syringes, which is still good, I have ordered this twice now, so that says something, BE careful people, it says don&#x27;t get on your gums, seriously don&#x27;t, this stuff is very strong, burns gums very easily, also never lay down with trays in, you may fall asleep, I did this once, my gums had to heal up, they got stringy, I&#x27;ll never do that again, I recommend this to anyone, maybe not if your mouth is sensitive, I use gentle white pronamel toothpaste, it helps with enamel, if your not patient and want killer whitening in one or two days I recommend Phillips zoom day white, it&#x27;s not that much more expensive. (update) I got my order, have been using it, but I think it&#x27;s not the same as it was before, the syringes are much bigger and also so are the teeth trays,i use ones I already had, don&#x27;t like the new ones, anyways it works, just seems different</li>
            <li> I love this product my teeth are definitely noticeably whiter! The shipping was quick and the price was excellent</li>
            <li> So far so good. i did burn my gums a bit the first time, but i just had too much product in the tray, no problems since.</li>
            <li> Came on time.  Be careful and follow the directions. This stuff will burn your gums up.</li>
            <li> It was as good as I expected. I have bonding on my teeth and these bleaches do not work too well for me. I&#x27;m actually looking for someone to come up with I bleach that will lighten my bonding. all in all it&#x27;s as good as can be expected.</li>
            <li> Works well, high percentage of H2O2 yield high efficacy, however the LED light is useless. To initiate free radical reactions that catalyze the oxidation of your tooth, you need at least near UV or long-wave UV (~285nm) like they use in the dental office. The light they give you is just a blue LED and is not sufficient for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the products works as advertised and is worth the money, but 44% H2O2 is incredibly high conc. and can do severe gum damage so be careful. Also, as per the instructions, store the syringes in the refrigerator because peroxides decompose at room temp.</li>
            <li> Leaves white stains on your teeth don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
