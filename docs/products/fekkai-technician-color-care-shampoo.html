            <li>and so glad i bought this!</li>
            <li>I LOVED the smell of the product right off the bat, and I loved the way it made my hair feel (and smell!)</li>
            <li>These Fekkai products are amazing.</li>
            <li>When I do use it, it&#x27;s AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li>but since I have been using this one, I have not noticed any kind of itching.</li>
            <li>A nice product.</li>
            <li>The shampoo provides a nice even cleanse, without a lot of foam.</li>
            <li>so i need more than the sample provided to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this from Influenster in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a nice volume to my curls too, which I can&#x27;t say about all shampoos either.</li>
            <li>Thanks Fekkai for the great product!</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>This works just fine in my hair and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I wanted my hair to be more smoothe and heard so many good things about this line of products.  </li>
            <li>delicious scent, leaves my hair silky smooth and feeling clean and light weight!</li>
            <li>By far the best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It does have a pleasant smell and seems to clean my hair</li>
            <li>so I can share the amazing qualities of this product with those I love.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Fekkai Technician Color Care for years--my hair looks noticeably better (moisturized, easy to style, good volume) with Fekkai products than with others.</li>
            <li>I loved the fragrance of this shampoo and the rich lather.</li>
            <li>and I LOVED it; my hair had less frizz than before ; the fruity scent was great and the lather was great too.</li>
            <li>It takes good care of my color and leaves my hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice unlike so many shampoos that are cloying or overwhelmingly fragranced.</li>
            <li>first off, smells great.</li>
            <li>The texture is very creamy and it has a light, very pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, not too overwhelming at all.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am in love the this line of products.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it does seem to keep the color from fading</li>
            <li>but I need more than that from my shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have been able to go a couple of weeks without re-dying it-YAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shampoo has a nice light citrus ZING smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite things about this.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying using this shampoo for a change.  </li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t linger, which is something that most people prefer.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting more from this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is a quite a nice shampoo with a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>It could lather better, but it cleans well</li>
            <li>The citrus scent is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light citrusy scent.</li>
            <li>Buy it and enjoy!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this for think hair.</li>
            <li>It also has waaaay more body.</li>
            <li>; I just switched back to the world&#x27;s best shampoo and conditioner.&amp;#34; I keep buying this shampoo because nothing else makes my hair look as glorious.</li>
            <li>I would love to stock my guest bathrooms with this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s changed, and not for the better.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and suppleness of my hair after using this.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was getting a bit more value.</li>
            <li>I Love this product.  </li>
            <li>i love this shampoo it leaves</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo</li>
            <li>but this is for sure one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>The bottle is nice, easy to hold and easy to get the shampoo  out.</li>
            <li>A really nice rich shampoo that cleans-- not</li>
            <li>It is designed with the “5F Principle: Form, Feel, Function, Fragrance and Finish, decadent textures, lush scents and exquisite ingredients unite to deliver an extraordinary hair experience.”  </li>
            <li>Rinses very cleanly</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft and fairly manageable and doesn&#x27;t cling as it&#x27;s being rinsed, which I liked also.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is good for keeping color, but if you have hair that gets greasy and/or holds product very well, this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li>I was also sent the conditioner, I liked that and the smell of both products is great, The conditioner left my hair feeling soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair feel so clean.</li>
            <li>combed easily with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>That may be a bonus to those who don&#x27;t like to have a strong fragrance from their toiletries.  </li>
            <li>Great lather and rinses clean without stripping hair of natural oils.</li>
            <li>my fine colored treated hair&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>The shampoo according to her worked fine.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves my fine, shoulder-length hair feeling silky.</li>
            <li>Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo is a great light shampoo especially for the warmer months of the yr.  </li>
            <li>and that is rare for sure.</li>
            <li>The shampoo had a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Light scent, and</li>
            <li>The scent is a light grapefruit smell, which I like.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a vast assortment of shampoos for color-treated hair, this one is the absolute BEST.  </li>
            <li>far as I am concerned, this shampoo was a good choice.  </li>
            <li>great fruity smell - good pudding like thick consistency.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo gives a nice lather and really got my hair clean.</li>
            <li>Lather feels rich and creamy</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really enjoying this color care shampoo because it&#x27;s go gentle!</li>
            <li>and I love to use this at night if I was cleaning the house and sweating - specially in the hot summer</li>
            <li>Fekkai is great for dry hair and gives lots of volume.</li>
            <li>I mean--it&#x27;s clean, but NOT stripped.  </li>
            <li>that is so good to find for me because it does not dry my hair out or&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m consistently finding that I am allergic to more and more brands, so Fekkai is a mid-price shampoo/conditioner that I can use without stressing too much.  </li>
            <li>This whole line is amazing, i have fine long hair that tends to be greasy and this shampoo has worked amazing for me</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel nice and soft and protects the color quite well.</li>
            <li>I prefer the full blown volume shampoo/conditioner, but this works as well.</li>
            <li>I do feel like I have to use a lot of it to get a good lather in my hair and my hair is short.</li>
            <li>This shampoo goes hand in hand with the full blown conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely needs to be coupled with a good conditioner to get your hair back to a good condition.</li>
            <li>I color my hair on a regular basis and I am always looking for a good shampoo and conditioner that takes care of my color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Good hair days were back again!</li>
            <li>Smells nice, lathers nice, rinses out clean, what&#x27;s not to like except that it&#x27;s a little pricey.  </li>
            <li>Because shampoo is the first product that really goes onto your hair, I like having a light scent that won&#x27;t be overwhelming once I add conditioner, hair spray, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just discovered this brand and it&#x27;s my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo does exactly what I had hoped it would do!</li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s a first!)</li>
            <li>I suppose if I want my hair to look and feel nice, I have to pay a little more.</li>
            <li>wash my hair daily and my bright purple color hasn&#x27;t faded too much at all-</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It all works for me and is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Hair stylists always are surprised by how healthy my hair is.  </li>
            <li>Love how this leaves my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I received this shampoo as a complimentary package from Influenster</li>
            <li>I received fekkai technician color care shampoo as a complimentary sample</li>
            <li>Now that I am using it again, I can say that it is seriously worth the money.</li>
            <li>My color stays fresh between each salon visit.</li>
            <li>I love how soft this makes my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for people who wash it a lot, some days I wash my hair twice; when its hot and since my hair is long, I like to wash it before bed as well which is something I have never done before using Fekkai, and using this at night is no problem, really gentle.</li>
            <li>i received my fekkai technician color care sample complimentary from influenster for testing.  </li>
            <li>This line of products has so far been really great for my hair which is bleached, colored and curled to death on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I rarely even style it, because it&#x27;s too stressful on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well i decided i am worth it</li>
            <li>received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>This pleasant smelling shampoo creates a rich lather and left my hair fresh and clean, but because it left my scalp itcy I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s juuuust right.</li>
            <li>Not worth paying top dollar for any more, and I won&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, smells good, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling as good as the original formula did, and I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what it is that&#x27;s different about it, but it could only be the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Looking for a new shampoo that&#x27;s NOT from some huge faceless corporation that doesn&#x27;t  give a rip about my hair, or anyone&#x27;s hair, for that matter.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and the color looks good and the texture of my hair is vastly improved.</li>
            <li>I am a firm believer in using the same brand shampoo with the conditioner to get the best results for my hair.  </li>
            <li>smooth, manageable, and shiny (I sound like a commercial, but</li>
            <li>It smells so good and left my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>The Fekkai conditioner also has a light fragrance and leaves my hair feeling smooth and tangle free without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>hats).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it didn&#x27;t lather very much</li>
            <li>Very gentle on hair color</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li>My go to shampoo never fails me.  </li>
            <li>I used some at a friends, and could not believe how soft and smooth my hair felt.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and tangle free even on the days I don&#x27;t use the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t choose any more items for her since she doesn&#x27;t wish to review them, and my review is second hand.  </li>
            <li>It is so obvious, and so drastic, that I do not want a cut yet in fear more will fall out.  </li>
            <li>I ended up using the whole pouch of product (10mL) which was complimentary from influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first thing that sticks out to me about this shampoo is the scent.</li>
            <li>and I suppose I&#x27;m pretty picky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so more than likely I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li>This is a definite winning duo.  </li>
            <li>I first used this shampoo about 10 years ago now after receiving both the shampoo and conditioner as a gift.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for quite awhile not and have been very pleased with the fact that my color fades much less.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this shampoo and any other run-of-the-mill shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft and clean and my color did not appear to fade when I used this with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It was nice to get a free sample from Influenster because the weather suddenly changed and my hair has been very dry.  </li>
            <li>, this shampoo works up into a good lather with relatively small amount.</li>
            <li>Because the old review still holds true, I posted it below.</li>
            <li>Ordered some of my own, and I don&#x27;t know if I can ever use any other shampoo/conditioner!  </li>
            <li>My hair feels nice and light after using this shampoo, which is no small feat as my hair is coarse and straight Japanese hair.  </li>
            <li>Saves my color and sine and keeps my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is infused with the oil of pure grape seed.  </li>
            <li>it lathers really well.</li>
            <li>I told her that is because it is unusually humid in our area</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much, but</li>
            <li>but really, thumbs up</li>
            <li>I did enjoy the creaminess of it; it gives the feel of a shampoo/conditioner without actually being so designed.</li>
            <li>i really like this brand.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about  my haircare.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo didn&#x27;t lather up much.</li>
            <li>condition (sooooo nice), rinse (clean as a whistle), comb out (no issues, and my hair is 1/2 way down my back), and dry just my bangs (come on ladies, we all know how important the bangs are--if we dry them, the rest can work itself out on most days)--and</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and often find that color treated shampoos and conditioners leave my hair flat.  </li>
            <li>and I need to use a lot of it, more than with other conditioners, in order to de-tangle</li>
            <li>The entire product line I received smells like fresh squeezed grapefruit!</li>
            <li>, I only lather up my scalp and let the rest of the suds stream through my hair to clean the ends so the ends are not getting roughed up by friction.  </li>
            <li>but this is so delicate, and smells like cherries on ice with cream ( actually lovely, I promise) and the suds are super gentle</li>
            <li>Will keep buying as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that it necessarily holds my color any better than other brands, but it is good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact brand and type for years but the most recent one I got smelled really strange</li>
            <li>I did notice that the color looked so vibrant after using this shampoo, I have no doubt it will extend the life of my color.</li>
            <li>I always try to steer away from the cheap grocery store stuff, because I KNOW it&#x27;s not beneficial to my hair, but from my experience, a nice mid-priced shampoo tends to work just as well as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a lovely light fragrance and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product as well as the conditioner and hair masque treatment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>- i highly doubt it was the shampoo</li>
            <li>After finishing that other brand (it starts and ends with an &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; and is famous for its natural ingredients)</li>
            <li>I believe with daily use, this color care shampoo would probably do exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li>this made my hair so soft and manageable!!</li>
            <li>I think the greatest testament to the amazingness of this shampoo is that although I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and conditioners (both other brands and other formulas of Fekkai)</li>
            <li>It will last a bit longer and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the extra price.</li>
            <li>As soon as I quit using this new version, the hair loss stopped so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on the hunt for a new shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so Amazon has given it a whole new item number and page, apparently.)</li>
            <li>I have red long hair, and it breaks and falls out SO easily</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>I went back and looked at the review I originally wrote for the old packaging back in the day</li>
            <li>but I have long hair that I wash every other day and this bottle lasted me more than a month.  </li>
            <li>, it smells like grapefruit, my scalp feels clean and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>You only need to use a little of this at a time, so this one bottle is lasting a while, which is nice as well.</li>
            <li>If you are a new buyer you wouldn&#x27;t know this, but I had a stash of the older version, and it&#x27;s definitely been changed.  </li>
            <li>Takes rather A LOT of product to clean and hair feels slightly &#x27;stripped&#x27; after application.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li>Something marketed for color treated hair I would expect to be both gentle and moisturizing, since coloring your hair regularly does cause damage, but this product is neither.  </li>
            <li>I know that each head of hair is different, but i would highly recommend trying this shampoo!</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>RUN as far as you can from this product, or you too will have to wear your hair up in shame as well waiting for the ends to stop breaking off.</li>
            <li>but for my few washes, I did enjoy it.</li>
            <li>You will be surprised that&lt;br /&gt;it works so well.</li>
            <li>but I get busy and forget ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on floral shampoo scents - but I got used to it and ended up really liking it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>shampoo product has completely changed how I look at my hair.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep color from fading and leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I used to have the color fade considerable in between colorings but with this shampoo it holds well.</li>
            <li>This is def worth the $17 price tag, especially since I don&#x27;t was my hair daily!</li>
            <li>So far before using the Fekkai products, I have been able to manage my thick curly, bleached hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely and thick.</li>
            <li>color (red, natural, but amped up) is bright and (seriously) sparkly!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend and will buy again considering price is a little high but worth it.</li>
            <li>Just a half dollar size dollop, wet it down and it lathers up very nicely.</li>
            <li>Seemed to clean well without being too harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li>I cant really say if it protects color since I only had one  sample, but it definitely made my hair soft even before conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair so much.</li>
            <li>Keeps my blonde hair soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure that this shampoo has convinced me that more expensive shampoos work better.</li>
            <li>Instantly my hair looked less full and wasn&#x27;t quite as manageable</li>
            <li>I usually use cheaper stuff, but on special occasions, I use this.  </li>
            <li>Fekkai is generally a product that I trust.  </li>
            <li>Really helps my color to last a long time.</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t have to use much so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>This is a must, It totally gets rid of my frizz, and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>, it makes the hair baby soft and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it strips it off anything but topical oil and gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will have to get the conditioner because I&#x27;m curious if it&#x27;s as gentle and nourishing as the shampoo</li>
            <li>I wish I had an old bottle of it (pre-Industrial Giant takeover)</li>
            <li>I use it daily on my fine, straight, thin, short hair which I color every 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>Unlike some other color protective shampoos ive used this one really seems to prevent fading.</li>
            <li>The new shampoo&#x27;s color is a different pink, not as clear a formula.  </li>
            <li>usually hate paying more for hair care products, but this is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I have highlighted hair that I dry and curl often, this product has changed my hair to soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It has brought my hair back to the thick, full, shiny condition it was in before I began highlights and coloring.  </li>
            <li>I was sent a sample of this product, the sample wasnt enough to get a full lather, I have thick hair</li>
            <li>Since I have color on my hair, it tends to be quite dry and this shampoo leaves my hair soft plus gives it some extra volume.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and it gives it body and thickness.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say whether or not this makes my hair color last longer because my hair is very dark.  </li>

            <li> but since I have been using this one, I have not noticed any kind of itching.</li>
            <li> A nice product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo provides a nice even cleanse, without a lot of foam.</li>

            <li> I am in love the this line of products.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it does seem to keep the color from fading</li>
            <li> but I need more than that from my shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been able to go a couple of weeks without re-dying it-YAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shampoo has a nice light citrus ZING smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for many years</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite things about this.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using this shampoo for a change.  </li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t linger, which is something that most people prefer.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting more from this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a quite a nice shampoo with a smooth texture.</li>
            <li> It could lather better, but it cleans well</li>
            <li> The citrus scent is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light citrusy scent.</li>
            <li> Buy it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this for think hair.</li>
            <li> It also has waaaay more body.</li>
            <li> ; I just switched back to the world&#x27;s best shampoo and conditioner.&amp;#34; I keep buying this shampoo because nothing else makes my hair look as glorious.</li>
            <li> I would love to stock my guest bathrooms with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s changed, and not for the better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and suppleness of my hair after using this.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was getting a bit more value.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.  </li>
            <li> i love this shampoo it leaves</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo</li>
            <li> but this is for sure one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> The bottle is nice, easy to hold and easy to get the shampoo  out.</li>
            <li> A really nice rich shampoo that cleans-- not</li>
            <li> It is designed with the “5F Principle: Form, Feel, Function, Fragrance and Finish, decadent textures, lush scents and exquisite ingredients unite to deliver an extraordinary hair experience.”  </li>
            <li> Rinses very cleanly</li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft and fairly manageable and doesn&#x27;t cling as it&#x27;s being rinsed, which I liked also.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is good for keeping color, but if you have hair that gets greasy and/or holds product very well, this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> I was also sent the conditioner, I liked that and the smell of both products is great, The conditioner left my hair feeling soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair feel so clean.</li>
            <li> combed easily with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> That may be a bonus to those who don&#x27;t like to have a strong fragrance from their toiletries.  </li>
            <li> Great lather and rinses clean without stripping hair of natural oils.</li>
            <li> my fine colored treated hair&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> The shampoo according to her worked fine.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves my fine, shoulder-length hair feeling silky.</li>
            <li> Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo is a great light shampoo especially for the warmer months of the yr.  </li>
            <li> and that is rare for sure.</li>
            <li> The shampoo had a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Light scent, and</li>
            <li> The scent is a light grapefruit smell, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a vast assortment of shampoos for color-treated hair, this one is the absolute BEST.  </li>
            <li> far as I am concerned, this shampoo was a good choice.  </li>
            <li> great fruity smell - good pudding like thick consistency.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo gives a nice lather and really got my hair clean.</li>
            <li> Lather feels rich and creamy</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really enjoying this color care shampoo because it&#x27;s go gentle!</li>
            <li> and I love to use this at night if I was cleaning the house and sweating - specially in the hot summer</li>
            <li> Fekkai is great for dry hair and gives lots of volume.</li>
            <li> I mean--it&#x27;s clean, but NOT stripped.  </li>
            <li> that is so good to find for me because it does not dry my hair out or&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m consistently finding that I am allergic to more and more brands, so Fekkai is a mid-price shampoo/conditioner that I can use without stressing too much.  </li>
            <li> This whole line is amazing, i have fine long hair that tends to be greasy and this shampoo has worked amazing for me</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel nice and soft and protects the color quite well.</li>
            <li> I prefer the full blown volume shampoo/conditioner, but this works as well.</li>
            <li> I do feel like I have to use a lot of it to get a good lather in my hair and my hair is short.</li>
            <li> This shampoo goes hand in hand with the full blown conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely needs to be coupled with a good conditioner to get your hair back to a good condition.</li>
            <li> I color my hair on a regular basis and I am always looking for a good shampoo and conditioner that takes care of my color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Good hair days were back again!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, lathers nice, rinses out clean, what&#x27;s not to like except that it&#x27;s a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> Because shampoo is the first product that really goes onto your hair, I like having a light scent that won&#x27;t be overwhelming once I add conditioner, hair spray, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just discovered this brand and it&#x27;s my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo does exactly what I had hoped it would do!</li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s a first!)</li>
            <li> I suppose if I want my hair to look and feel nice, I have to pay a little more.</li>
            <li> wash my hair daily and my bright purple color hasn&#x27;t faded too much at all-</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It all works for me and is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Hair stylists always are surprised by how healthy my hair is.  </li>
            <li> Love how this leaves my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>

            <li> I received this shampoo as a complimentary package from Influenster</li>
            <li> I received fekkai technician color care shampoo as a complimentary sample</li>
            <li> Now that I am using it again, I can say that it is seriously worth the money.</li>
            <li> My color stays fresh between each salon visit.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this makes my hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for people who wash it a lot, some days I wash my hair twice; when its hot and since my hair is long, I like to wash it before bed as well which is something I have never done before using Fekkai, and using this at night is no problem, really gentle.</li>
            <li> i received my fekkai technician color care sample complimentary from influenster for testing.  </li>
            <li> This line of products has so far been really great for my hair which is bleached, colored and curled to death on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I rarely even style it, because it&#x27;s too stressful on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well i decided i am worth it</li>
            <li> received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> This pleasant smelling shampoo creates a rich lather and left my hair fresh and clean, but because it left my scalp itcy I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s juuuust right.</li>
            <li> Not worth paying top dollar for any more, and I won&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, smells good, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling as good as the original formula did, and I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what it is that&#x27;s different about it, but it could only be the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Looking for a new shampoo that&#x27;s NOT from some huge faceless corporation that doesn&#x27;t  give a rip about my hair, or anyone&#x27;s hair, for that matter.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and the color looks good and the texture of my hair is vastly improved.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in using the same brand shampoo with the conditioner to get the best results for my hair.  </li>
            <li> smooth, manageable, and shiny (I sound like a commercial, but</li>
            <li> It smells so good and left my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> The Fekkai conditioner also has a light fragrance and leaves my hair feeling smooth and tangle free without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> hats).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it didn&#x27;t lather very much</li>
            <li> Very gentle on hair color</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li> My go to shampoo never fails me.  </li>
            <li> I used some at a friends, and could not believe how soft and smooth my hair felt.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and tangle free even on the days I don&#x27;t use the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t choose any more items for her since she doesn&#x27;t wish to review them, and my review is second hand.  </li>
            <li> It is so obvious, and so drastic, that I do not want a cut yet in fear more will fall out.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using the whole pouch of product (10mL) which was complimentary from influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first thing that sticks out to me about this shampoo is the scent.</li>
            <li> and I suppose I&#x27;m pretty picky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so more than likely I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a definite winning duo.  </li>
            <li> I first used this shampoo about 10 years ago now after receiving both the shampoo and conditioner as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for quite awhile not and have been very pleased with the fact that my color fades much less.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this shampoo and any other run-of-the-mill shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and clean and my color did not appear to fade when I used this with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It was nice to get a free sample from Influenster because the weather suddenly changed and my hair has been very dry.  </li>
            <li> , this shampoo works up into a good lather with relatively small amount.</li>
            <li> Because the old review still holds true, I posted it below.</li>
            <li> Ordered some of my own, and I don&#x27;t know if I can ever use any other shampoo/conditioner!  </li>
            <li> My hair feels nice and light after using this shampoo, which is no small feat as my hair is coarse and straight Japanese hair.  </li>
            <li> Saves my color and sine and keeps my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is infused with the oil of pure grape seed.  </li>
            <li> it lathers really well.</li>
            <li> I told her that is because it is unusually humid in our area</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much, but</li>
            <li> but really, thumbs up</li>
            <li> I did enjoy the creaminess of it; it gives the feel of a shampoo/conditioner without actually being so designed.</li>
            <li> i really like this brand.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about  my haircare.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t lather up much.</li>
            <li> condition (sooooo nice), rinse (clean as a whistle), comb out (no issues, and my hair is 1/2 way down my back), and dry just my bangs (come on ladies, we all know how important the bangs are--if we dry them, the rest can work itself out on most days)--and</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and often find that color treated shampoos and conditioners leave my hair flat.  </li>
            <li> and I need to use a lot of it, more than with other conditioners, in order to de-tangle</li>
            <li> The entire product line I received smells like fresh squeezed grapefruit!</li>
            <li> , I only lather up my scalp and let the rest of the suds stream through my hair to clean the ends so the ends are not getting roughed up by friction.  </li>
            <li> but this is so delicate, and smells like cherries on ice with cream ( actually lovely, I promise) and the suds are super gentle</li>
            <li> Will keep buying as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it necessarily holds my color any better than other brands, but it is good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact brand and type for years but the most recent one I got smelled really strange</li>
            <li> I did notice that the color looked so vibrant after using this shampoo, I have no doubt it will extend the life of my color.</li>
            <li> I always try to steer away from the cheap grocery store stuff, because I KNOW it&#x27;s not beneficial to my hair, but from my experience, a nice mid-priced shampoo tends to work just as well as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a lovely light fragrance and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product as well as the conditioner and hair masque treatment.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> - i highly doubt it was the shampoo</li>
            <li> After finishing that other brand (it starts and ends with an &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; and is famous for its natural ingredients)</li>
            <li> I believe with daily use, this color care shampoo would probably do exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> this made my hair so soft and manageable!!</li>
            <li> I think the greatest testament to the amazingness of this shampoo is that although I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and conditioners (both other brands and other formulas of Fekkai)</li>
            <li> It will last a bit longer and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> As soon as I quit using this new version, the hair loss stopped so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on the hunt for a new shampoo.  </li>
            <li> so Amazon has given it a whole new item number and page, apparently.)</li>
            <li> I have red long hair, and it breaks and falls out SO easily</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> I went back and looked at the review I originally wrote for the old packaging back in the day</li>
            <li> but I have long hair that I wash every other day and this bottle lasted me more than a month.  </li>
            <li> , it smells like grapefruit, my scalp feels clean and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a little of this at a time, so this one bottle is lasting a while, which is nice as well.</li>
            <li> If you are a new buyer you wouldn&#x27;t know this, but I had a stash of the older version, and it&#x27;s definitely been changed.  </li>
            <li> Takes rather A LOT of product to clean and hair feels slightly &#x27;stripped&#x27; after application.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li> Something marketed for color treated hair I would expect to be both gentle and moisturizing, since coloring your hair regularly does cause damage, but this product is neither.  </li>
            <li> I know that each head of hair is different, but i would highly recommend trying this shampoo!</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> RUN as far as you can from this product, or you too will have to wear your hair up in shame as well waiting for the ends to stop breaking off.</li>
            <li> but for my few washes, I did enjoy it.</li>
            <li> You will be surprised that&lt;br /&gt;it works so well.</li>
            <li> but I get busy and forget ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on floral shampoo scents - but I got used to it and ended up really liking it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> shampoo product has completely changed how I look at my hair.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep color from fading and leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I used to have the color fade considerable in between colorings but with this shampoo it holds well.</li>
            <li> This is def worth the $17 price tag, especially since I don&#x27;t was my hair daily!</li>
            <li> So far before using the Fekkai products, I have been able to manage my thick curly, bleached hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely and thick.</li>
            <li> color (red, natural, but amped up) is bright and (seriously) sparkly!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend and will buy again considering price is a little high but worth it.</li>
            <li> Just a half dollar size dollop, wet it down and it lathers up very nicely.</li>
            <li> Seemed to clean well without being too harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> I cant really say if it protects color since I only had one  sample, but it definitely made my hair soft even before conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair so much.</li>
            <li> Keeps my blonde hair soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure that this shampoo has convinced me that more expensive shampoos work better.</li>
            <li> Instantly my hair looked less full and wasn&#x27;t quite as manageable</li>
            <li> I usually use cheaper stuff, but on special occasions, I use this.  </li>
            <li> Fekkai is generally a product that I trust.  </li>
            <li> Really helps my color to last a long time.</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t have to use much so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a must, It totally gets rid of my frizz, and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> , it makes the hair baby soft and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it strips it off anything but topical oil and gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will have to get the conditioner because I&#x27;m curious if it&#x27;s as gentle and nourishing as the shampoo</li>
            <li> I wish I had an old bottle of it (pre-Industrial Giant takeover)</li>
            <li> I use it daily on my fine, straight, thin, short hair which I color every 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other color protective shampoos ive used this one really seems to prevent fading.</li>
            <li> The new shampoo&#x27;s color is a different pink, not as clear a formula.  </li>
            <li> usually hate paying more for hair care products, but this is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair that I dry and curl often, this product has changed my hair to soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It has brought my hair back to the thick, full, shiny condition it was in before I began highlights and coloring.  </li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this product, the sample wasnt enough to get a full lather, I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Since I have color on my hair, it tends to be quite dry and this shampoo leaves my hair soft plus gives it some extra volume.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and it gives it body and thickness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say whether or not this makes my hair color last longer because my hair is very dark.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a non-lathering hair cleanser (no-poo) for curly hair, however I will be adding this into my routine because I could really see an improvement in my color.</li>
            <li> Not really worth using after spending money on professional color</li>
            <li> I do recommend using an additional leave on for hair ends if you use a flat iron or curling iron as I do.</li>
            <li> I alternate every other day with my regular shampoo, but I use the conditioner daily and the hair mask twice a week.</li>
            <li> My fine/thin hair has been bleached numerous times so is a bit on the dry side but not fried.  </li>
            <li> I can actually let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> I have long, thick curly hair, and usually have to use a ton of shampoo, but you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not have a lot of chemicals, it does contain grape seed oil, which might be the reason the hair feels so soft after it is dried.</li>
            <li> I have went through the shampoo and conditioner bottles before posting to see how it worked long term.</li>
            <li> Feels really sticky and thick .  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so concentrated that if you have short hair you only need about a quarter size (or less) to thoroughly wash your hair.</li>
            <li> This smells different from the other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My hair is left soft and silky without the need to use heavy conditioners that weigh my hair down and it helps prevent color loss.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair, though my hair tends to be oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead of helping out my dry brittle, and split ends, my hair started breaking off instead.  </li>
            <li> I am unfamiliar with the brand to know if that is a characteristic of it, but I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> For my average length men&#x27;s hair, even a pea size was enough to lather into all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and started ordering it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have a short, graduated bob and only need a small amount to lather my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Fekkai products daily for less than a year.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it fades quickly when your hair dries.</li>
            <li> Like all other color care shampoos I&#x27;ve used, my color has lasted a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather up because of how it&#x27;s made to clean your HAIR and not just strip it down to nothing (and then dry it out, rendering it unable to continue to grow).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I initially thought the scent was a little cloying -</li>
            <li> I recently colored my hair a little darker for fall and was afraid it would fade back to my blonde but using this system has really saved my color.</li>
            <li> I have tried to avoid this shampoo and conditioner line because it&#x27;s so expensive, but it is truly worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fekkai for a few years and it doesn&#x27;t seem to fade the color as quickly as regular shampoos.  </li>
            <li> That being said, when I squeeze the extra water out of my hair, before applying conditioner, my hair feels like dried out brittle straw.  </li>
            <li> I have hair as mentioned, and it makes my hair feel sticky and harder to brush through.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a creamy pink pearl formula that feels decadent</li>
            <li> it looks like I spent hours styling it.  </li>
            <li> but I have noticed that the grey around my face has been less noticeable since I started using the Fekkai products.</li>
            <li> It feels silky and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> With my other shampoo, I would have had to re-dye my hair by now, but not with this one.</li>
            <li> Some of the chemicals in the other shampoos make my scalp itch quite a bit</li>
            <li> not one I would use regularly due to the price and they tangles that I get.</li>
            <li> It did strip out some of the colors faster than other shampoos I&#x27;ve used and my hair felt drier and stringier after wash.</li>
            <li> Other people are noticing as well</li>
            <li> why other haircare companies do not do whatever it is that Fekkai does.  </li>
            <li> For those who care, it makes no claims about animal testing and is a little limited on information on the bottle, however, it does supply an 865 phone number (no website) you can call.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair a dark shade of blonde and my hair has lightened as it usually does during the summer (even though I wear</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner regularly and the masque at least once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> No lather, and is almost impossible to get throughout your hair without using a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned this with the paired conditioner, but I would really only recommend this to those who have very oily, thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought bottles of the Fekkai Technician Shampoo and Technician Conditioner.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, either.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy and heavy to use every other day on your hair.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday and this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t  dull my color.</li>
            <li> and I had my first bad hair day in a long while.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry and dull due to color treatments, this is for you!  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little savings over the stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the color in my hair has stayed around longer than usual too, which it doesn&#x27;t with other shampoos made for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I can wash (little lather),</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I decided to buy the little bottle to test out this brand.</li>
            <li> I believe this product was watered down!  </li>
            <li> I should use it everyday, but I sometimes shower twice a day (I work out a lot), and it is so luxurious it otherwise feels wasteful.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this is one of the few shampoos that Nordstrom stocks and sells...</li>
            <li> I at least expected it to lather but that didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the Goldilocks of shampoo and conditioners, i.e., not too drying to make my hair look fried but not too moisturizing to make my hair go limp.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo, along with the Technician Conditioner, a few years ago after receiving it as a gift; I always got lots of complimets on my hair then.</li>
            <li> I usually switch shampoos a few times a year</li>
            <li> I am not sure though that it helps with maintaining my color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll go out and purchase it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could smell this everyday!  </li>
            <li> usually use Chi or Nexxus products.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick curly and was barely past the shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Because of the price, I bought something less expensive, but not cheap, when I finished the bottle.</li>
            <li> but we have hard water, so that may have been a factor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint the cause.  </li>
            <li> , if you wash your hair and even if you don&#x27;t color it, this is so delicate and caring</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length thick hair and what I also notice is there are a ton of tangles after using this.  </li>
            <li> which is a small miracle as anyone with semi temporary dye will tell you!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m both surprised and disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is very small - wish</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Fekkai shampoo.  It makes my hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo! I use it daily on my fine, straight, thin, short hair which I color every 4-6 weeks. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, smells good, and isn&#x27;t greasy. It leaves my colored hair glossy and protected. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> By far the best shampoo I have ever used! I have been using both the shampoo and conditioner for well over six years. It&#x27;s not inexpensive, so I periodically try different products. I always go back to Fekkai!  I especially like the color care product.  It all works for me and is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner. I have highlighted hair that I dry and curl often, this product has changed my hair to soft and silky. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product goes along with the shampoo and is a nice conditioner</li>
            <li> This is a must, It totally gets rid of my frizz, and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does exactly what I had hoped it would do! My hair is healthy and shiny. Plus, the scent is wonderful without being over-powering.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It takes good care of my color and leaves my hair clean and shiny. I wash my hair everyday and this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t  dull my color.</li>
            <li> Does not strip hair color, love this shampoo</li>
            <li> I just discovered this brand and it&#x27;s my new favorite.  A dime size amount creates wonderful, luscious lather, and it smells pretty great too.</li>
            <li> Fekkai is great for dry hair and gives lots of volume. However, its pricey</li>
            <li> I have tried to avoid this shampoo and conditioner line because it&#x27;s so expensive, but it is truly worth it. I alternate every other day with my regular shampoo, but I use the conditioner daily and the hair mask twice a week. It makes all the difference in my hair. I finally broke down and started ordering it here on Amazon. There&#x27;s a little savings over the stores.  It just makes my hair look 100% better - it&#x27;s soft and the color looks good and the texture of my hair is vastly improved.</li>
            <li> My go to shampoo never fails me.  Hair stylists always are surprised by how healthy my hair is.  Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and it has been improved.  Best prices on Amazon as well! Will keep buying as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Love how this leaves my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the conditioner that goes along with it.  I used some at a friends, and could not believe how soft and smooth my hair felt.  Ordered some of my own, and I don&#x27;t know if I can ever use any other shampoo/conditioner!  I love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fade my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I am in love the this line of products.  If your hair is dry and dull due to color treatments, this is for you!  I use the shampoo and conditioner regularly and the masque at least once or twice a week.  It has brought my hair back to the thick, full, shiny condition it was in before I began highlights and coloring.  The masque is a Must Have, you will be stunned by the change in your hair after just once use!</li>
            <li> Great lather and rinses clean without stripping hair of natural oils.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fekkai for a few years and it doesn&#x27;t seem to fade the color as quickly as regular shampoos.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair so much.</li>
            <li> I have tried a vast assortment of shampoos for color-treated hair, this one is the absolute BEST.  The smell is like roses, it&#x27;s so luxurious!  I have very fine and thin hair and this works wonders!  It&#x27;s so concentrated that if you have short hair you only need about a quarter size (or less) to thoroughly wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Rinses very cleanly, it smells like grapefruit, my scalp feels clean and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> Fekkai has changed the formula for the Color Care shampoo and it now causes hair loss.  This is unfortunate because I&#x27;ve used this for years.  The new shampoo&#x27;s color is a different pink, not as clear a formula.  If you are a new buyer you wouldn&#x27;t know this, but I had a stash of the older version, and it&#x27;s definitely been changed.  As soon as I quit using this new version, the hair loss stopped so I know it&#x27;s this formula change.  I&#x27;m now on the hunt for a new shampoo.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo every day for over 2 weeks - since I got my hair cut and colored. There are a lot of things that I liked about this shampoo - my hair had a wonderful shine to it after using it. I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to use a conditioner, which I do with some shampoos.  I loved the scent (though it doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair after you rinse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color-wise, I don&#x27;t think this shampoo prevented my color from fading (notice that they advertise that it prevents the appearance of fading - not that it prevents fading). I dye my hair a dark shade of blonde and my hair has lightened as it usually does during the summer (even though I wear hats).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it didn&#x27;t lather very much but we have hard water, so that may have been a factor. It didn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair, though my hair tends to be oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it, though but it seems a tad expensive.</li>
            <li> I like the Fekkai Glossing shampoo and conditioner so I figured I&#x27;d like this one as well since it&#x27;s designed for color treated hair.  Well, it does help to keep my blonde hair from fading and the fragrance is alright (reminds me of artificial cherry flavoring) but it also seems to strip the moisture from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I only lather up my scalp and let the rest of the suds stream through my hair to clean the ends so the ends are not getting roughed up by friction.  That being said, when I squeeze the extra water out of my hair, before applying conditioner, my hair feels like dried out brittle straw.  (I apply conditioner, but that&#x27;s another review).  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair tends to tangle all the time a sign of cuticle damage, according to my stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m both surprised and disappointed with this product.  Something marketed for color treated hair I would expect to be both gentle and moisturizing, since coloring your hair regularly does cause damage, but this product is neither.  Sure, it does seem to keep the color from fading but I need more than that from my shampoo.  Not only would I not buy this again, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my friends either.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is good for keeping color, but if you have hair that gets greasy and/or holds product very well, this might not be the product for you. I have hair as mentioned, and it makes my hair feel sticky and harder to brush through. I have switched to Paul Mitchell color protecting shampoo, and it holds color the same but keeps my hair feeling silky.</li>
            <li> This is great shampoo and does not take out the body from my hair.  Leaves it shiny and silky.  Good price too.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. I color every month and this shampoo is a miracle worker.  Saves my color and sine and keeps my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> A really nice rich shampoo that cleans-- not strips-- my fine colored treated hair&lt;br /&gt;and that is so good to find for me because it does not dry my hair out or&lt;br /&gt;damage my color and that is rare for sure.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo. I can definitely tell a difference with my hair color, too. With my other shampoo, I would have had to re-dye my hair by now, but not with this one. It makes my hair feel nice and soft and protects the color quite well. You only need to use a little of this at a time, so this one bottle is lasting a while, which is nice as well.</li>
            <li> Fekkai is generally a product that I trust.  I&#x27;m consistently finding that I am allergic to more and more brands, so Fekkai is a mid-price shampoo/conditioner that I can use without stressing too much.  I don&#x27;t think that it necessarily holds my color any better than other brands, but it is good for everyday use.  I prefer the full blown volume shampoo/conditioner, but this works as well.</li>
            <li> Though the Amazon Vine program, I received both Fekkai Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner to review.  My fine/thin hair has been bleached numerous times so is a bit on the dry side but not fried.  Also it is currently an &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; color (purple at the moment),so I thought this would be a great chance to try the Color Care line to see how it does with bleach and colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair daily and my bright purple color hasn&#x27;t faded too much at all-which is a small miracle as anyone with semi temporary dye will tell you! There is some color loss as always when shampooing but it does not appear to be stripping color. Thankfully, I will not have to refresh my hair color every week while using this. I have been able to go a couple of weeks without re-dying it-YAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a nice light citrus ZING smell.  Unfortunately it fades quickly when your hair dries. That may be a bonus to those who don&#x27;t like to have a strong fragrance from their toiletries.  I have a short, graduated bob and only need a small amount to lather my hair.  It makes my hair soft and tangle free even on the days I don&#x27;t use the conditioner. It will last a bit longer and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a nice shampoo.  The texture is very creamy and it has a light, very pleasant scent.  After using it, it seemed like my hair was softer and bouncier even though that&#x27;s not the stated purpose of it.  I&#x27;ve tried another shampoo and the hairspray in the Fekkai Technician line, and I&#x27;m very impressed with all of them.  This is a great-quality product, and I&#x27;ll continue using it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! Since I have color on my hair, it tends to be quite dry and this shampoo leaves my hair soft plus gives it some extra volume. The color has not faded, and I have been using it for quite a qhile.  I am finding I do not need to use a conditioner with this shampoo either. This shampoo does not have a lot of chemicals, it does contain grape seed oil, which might be the reason the hair feels so soft after it is dried. Some of the chemicals in the other shampoos make my scalp itch quite a bit but since I have been using this one, I have not noticed any kind of itching. I know that each head of hair is different, but i would highly recommend trying this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I loved the fragrance of this shampoo and the rich lather. I did find that after using it a couple times my hair seemed drier and I thought the color had faded quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell and great texture.  It helps my color stay looking great between treatments and helps make my hair feel and smell awesome.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo, I thought there wasn&#x27;t a difference but there is, my Mom is a fan also and she is a retired hairdresser</li>
            <li> I believe this product was watered down!  I&#x27;ve used it for many years so I know what it should be like!</li>
            <li> Very nice Shampoo it lathers really well. It makes my hair feel great. I love the smell! It is one of my favorite things about this. I color my hair regularly and haven&#x27;t noticed if this helps extend the time threw coloring&#x27;s but I have noticed that the grey around my face has been less noticeable since I started using the Fekkai products. The bottle is nice, easy to hold and easy to get the shampoo  out.</li>
            <li> This is great shampoo.  I usually use cheaper stuff, but on special occasions, I use this.  I should use it everyday, but I sometimes shower twice a day (I work out a lot), and it is so luxurious it otherwise feels wasteful.  Maybe when I win the lottery I&#x27;ll use it more often.  However, this does make a difference.  There&#x27;s a reason this is one of the few shampoos that Nordstrom stocks and sells...</li>
            <li> I reviewed this on behalf of my wife since she didn&#x27;t review as I asked.  The shampoo according to her worked fine.  I thought her hair looked nice and smelled really good.  She said her hair frizzed afterward.  I told her that is because it is unusually humid in our area recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I am concerned, this shampoo was a good choice.  I won&#x27;t choose any more items for her since she doesn&#x27;t wish to review them, and my review is second hand.  Sorry!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo. Keeps my blonde hair soft!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using this shampoo for a change.  I am not sure though that it helps with maintaining my color.  It does have a pleasant smell and seems to clean my hair well  I have shoulder length thick hair and what I also notice is there are a ton of tangles after using this.  The accompanying conditioner goes well with it and I need to use a lot of it, more than with other conditioners, in order to de-tangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do need to change shampoos regularly as I seem to get immune to them.  This shampoo has been a good one while I am changing shampoos but not one I would use regularly due to the price and they tangles that I get.</li>
            <li> This works just fine in my hair and has a pleasant scent. The scent doesn&#x27;t linger, which is something that most people prefer. I do feel like I have to use a lot of it to get a good lather in my hair and my hair is short. As with the conditioner, I prefer my Moroccan Oil shampoo so I won&#x27;t be using this again after it is gone.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other color protective shampoos ive used this one really seems to prevent fading. It also makes my hair soft. A nice product.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is this product, or the mask.  But I  purchased the shampoo and the mask at another store.  My hair started breaking off after using the Fekkai products,  it started emediately breaking off in the shower, I saw globs of hair on the comb, and on the drain the next day.  My hair is thick curly and was barely past the shoulders.  My hair is also bleached.  So far before using the Fekkai products, I have been able to manage my thick curly, bleached hair.  I wanted my hair to be more smoothe and heard so many good things about this line of products.  Instead of helping out my dry brittle, and split ends, my hair started breaking off instead.  I now have to always wear my hair up in shame to hide the embarrasing parts where it broke off.  It is so obvious, and so drastic, that I do not want a cut yet in fear more will fall out.  With others with hair like mine in the same bleached out condition.  RUN as far as you can from this product, or you too will have to wear your hair up in shame as well waiting for the ends to stop breaking off.</li>
            <li> Lather feels rich and creamy</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! Seemed to clean well without being too harsh on my hair. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Great color protecting shampoo. I recently colored my hair a little darker for fall and was afraid it would fade back to my blonde but using this system has really saved my color. It smells great and my hair is so shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> **I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. -  and - I loved how this smelled and how it made my curly hair feel. I did notice that the color looked so vibrant after using this shampoo, I have no doubt it will extend the life of my color. I usually use a non-lathering hair cleanser (no-poo) for curly hair, however I will be adding this into my routine because I could really see an improvement in my color.</li>
            <li> great fruity smell - good pudding like thick consistency.  I wish it opened from the bottom though.</li>
            <li> Takes rather A LOT of product to clean and hair feels slightly &#x27;stripped&#x27; after application. Not really worth using after spending money on professional color - go with Aveda&#x27;s color shampoo</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I don&#x27;t know if the size is worth the price, but it&#x27;s been the best for my color treated hair, so I use always.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from this shampoo. I at least expected it to lather but that didn&#x27;t happen. I ended up using the whole pouch of product (10mL) which was complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. This product failed my test. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it or buy it.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this shampoo and any other run-of-the-mill shampoo. Like all other color care shampoos I&#x27;ve used, my color has lasted a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant. It&#x27;s very light, not too overwhelming at all. Because shampoo is the first product that really goes onto your hair, I like having a light scent that won&#x27;t be overwhelming once I add conditioner, hair spray, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure that this shampoo has convinced me that more expensive shampoos work better. I always try to steer away from the cheap grocery store stuff, because I KNOW it&#x27;s not beneficial to my hair, but from my experience, a nice mid-priced shampoo tends to work just as well as the expensive ones. I will not be purchasing this shampoo in the future, simply because of price alone.</li>
            <li> This is a quite a nice shampoo with a smooth texture. It could lather better, but it cleans well and it leaves my fine, shoulder-length hair feeling silky. My color does also seem to be staying longer than last time as well.</li>
            <li> The entire product line I received smells like fresh squeezed grapefruit! The shampoo provides a nice even cleanse, without a lot of foam. I will definitely be replacing my current shampoo with this one as soon as it runs out! This is def worth the $17 price tag, especially since I don&#x27;t was my hair daily!</li>
            <li> The shampoo had a light fragrance. It did not have sulfates but it did have parabens so if you are trying to avoid parabens in your products, this is not the shampoo for you. I received this shampoo as a complimentary package from Influenster and I don&#x27;t know how well this shampoo works overall but for my few washes, I did enjoy it. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll go out and purchase it.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. It smells really nice unlike so many shampoos that are cloying or overwhelmingly fragranced. It lathers well, rinses well and does not burn my eyes. My hair is left soft and silky without the need to use heavy conditioners that weigh my hair down and it helps prevent color loss. It&#x27;s definitely worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> I received fekkai technician color care shampoo as a complimentary sample and I LOVED it; my hair had less frizz than before ; the fruity scent was great and the lather was great too. I highly recommend the product as well as the conditioner and hair masque treatment.</li>
            <li> delicious scent, leaves my hair silky smooth and feeling clean and light weight! This whole line is amazing, i have fine long hair that tends to be greasy and this shampoo has worked amazing for me</li>
            <li> Always love Fekkai products!</li>
            <li> I used this before, but quit because of the cost. Now that I am using it again, I can say that it is seriously worth the money. Really helps my color to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this product, the sample wasnt enough to get a full lather, I have thick hair so i need more than the sample provided to get a good lather. I was also sent the conditioner, I liked that and the smell of both products is great, The conditioner left my hair feeling soft and smelling good. Next time I hope to receive a bigger supply to try out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo goes hand in hand with the full blown conditioner.  You will be surprised that&lt;br /&gt;it works so well.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample in exchange for my opinion . I cant really say if it protects color since I only had one  sample, but it definitely made my hair soft even before conditioner. Light scent, and I like it overall.</li>
            <li> Feels really sticky and thick .  My hair felt soft and clean and my color did not appear to fade when I used this with the conditioner.  It was nice to get a free sample from Influenster because the weather suddenly changed and my hair has been very dry.  I like that the shampoo is so moisturizing and it smells very pleasant and sweet.  I like the conditioner I got with my hair color though and I think I will stick with my regular brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and price on Amazon vs. CVS can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fekkai products daily for less than a year. I love how it makes my hair feel so clean. My color stays fresh between each salon visit.</li>
            <li> Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo is a great light shampoo especially for the warmer months of the yr.  Great for color treated hair and non-color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Influenster in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that sticks out to me about this shampoo is the scent. The citrus scent is overwhelming.  I wish I could smell this everyday!  I love how soft this makes my hair.  The conditioner is a perfect compliment to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo...the smell is wonderful. Not too greasy and heavy to use every other day on your hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and pleasant and it lathers beautifully. It feels silky and a little goes a long way. For my average length men&#x27;s hair, even a pea size was enough to lather into all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I had was when I washed it out. I have bleached hair with some Manic Panic colors. It did strip out some of the colors faster than other shampoos I&#x27;ve used and my hair felt drier and stringier after wash. This product definitely needs to be coupled with a good conditioner to get your hair back to a good condition.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s lovely and thick. It has a nice light citrusy scent. I have long, thick curly hair, and usually have to use a ton of shampoo, but you really don&#x27;t need much. Just a half dollar size dollop, wet it down and it lathers up very nicely. I&#x27;ve noticed the color in my hair has stayed around longer than usual too, which it doesn&#x27;t with other shampoos made for color treated hair. It gives a nice volume to my curls too, which I can&#x27;t say about all shampoos either. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands and I suppose I&#x27;m pretty picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much, but I suppose if I want my hair to look and feel nice, I have to pay a little more. I tell myself not to scrimp on my skin and my hair, so more than likely I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, lathers nice, rinses out clean, what&#x27;s not to like except that it&#x27;s a little pricey.  I can&#x27;t really say whether or not this makes my hair color last longer because my hair is very dark.  I think people with lighter hair would notice this quality.  All I notice with my hair color is that my hair is growing and I see white where my hair has grown!  My hair feels nice and light after using this shampoo, which is no small feat as my hair is coarse and straight Japanese hair.  The scent is a light grapefruit smell, which I like.  Buy it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Fekkai products, three of their shampoos have been a staple in my shower this summer and I&#x27;m really enjoying this color care shampoo because it&#x27;s go gentle! I don&#x27;t color my hair every month on the dot anymore, I used to but I get busy and forget ... but this is so delicate, and smells like cherries on ice with cream ( actually lovely, I promise) and the suds are super gentle, it&#x27;s a creamy pink pearl formula that feels decadent and I love to use this at night if I was cleaning the house and sweating - specially in the hot summer, it makes the hair baby soft and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it strips it off anything but topical oil and gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to get the conditioner because I&#x27;m curious if it&#x27;s as gentle and nourishing as the shampoo but really, thumbs up, if you wash your hair and even if you don&#x27;t color it, this is so delicate and caring it will make your hair happy no matter what. Great for people who wash it a lot, some days I wash my hair twice; when its hot and since my hair is long, I like to wash it before bed as well which is something I have never done before using Fekkai, and using this at night is no problem, really gentle.</li>
            <li> Terrific shampoo keeps my color from fading</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this shampoo. It is the best I have ever used. It is expensive but it is worth paying that much for it. And you don&#x27;t have to use much so it will last a long time. I have thin, fine hair and it gives it body and thickness. It also makes it shiny. I highly recommend this shampoo. I also bought the conditioner and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> and I almost don&#x27;t even need conditioner afterwards.  Pricey, but I have long hair that I wash every other day and this bottle lasted me more than a month.  Love Fekkai!</li>
            <li> I have never used a Fekkai Hair Care product.  I color my hair on a regular basis and I am always looking for a good shampoo and conditioner that takes care of my color treated hair.  It is designed with the “5F Principle: Form, Feel, Function, Fragrance and Finish, decadent textures, lush scents and exquisite ingredients unite to deliver an extraordinary hair experience.”  The shampoo has a lovely light fragrance and a little bit goes a long way.  I use a dime size amount and get a wonderful lather that rinses clean.  The shampoo is infused with the oil of pure grape seed.  I have fine hair and often find that color treated shampoos and conditioners leave my hair flat.  They tend to be too moisturizing.  The Fekkai conditioner also has a light fragrance and leaves my hair feeling smooth and tangle free without weighing it down.  There is a definite volume and shine to my hair.  I am a firm believer in using the same brand shampoo with the conditioner to get the best results for my hair.  This is a definite winning duo.  This is a product that I will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, great feel, this shampoo works up into a good lather with relatively small amount. I initially thought the scent was a little cloying - I&#x27;m not big on floral shampoo scents - but I got used to it and ended up really liking it. It leaves hair soft and fairly manageable and doesn&#x27;t cling as it&#x27;s being rinsed, which I liked also. For those who care, it makes no claims about animal testing and is a little limited on information on the bottle, however, it does supply an 865 phone number (no website) you can call. I did enjoy the creaminess of it; it gives the feel of a shampoo/conditioner without actually being so designed.</li>
            <li> 2 1/2 stars&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells lovely&lt;br /&gt;- Very gentle on hair color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- No lather, and is almost impossible to get throughout your hair without using a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned this with the paired conditioner, but I would really only recommend this to those who have very oily, thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for review purposes as part of my association with Influenster.  I LOVED the smell of the product right off the bat, and I loved the way it made my hair feel (and smell!) that day.  I believe with daily use, this color care shampoo would probably do exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to! It&#x27;s caused me to want to go buy a bottle to try out for a longer period of time! Thanks Fekkai for the great product!</li>
            <li> i received my fekkai technician color care sample complimentary from influenster for testing.  I really liked it. first off, smells great. felt good after washing! combed easily with the conditioner. i also received color masque which ive never used before. this made my hair so soft and manageable!! i really like this brand. id like to use it longterm to see how it works with color treated hair.</li>
            <li> This line of products has so far been really great for my hair which is bleached, colored and curled to death on a daily basis. It leaves my hair shiny, soft and manageable. I do recommend using an additional leave on for hair ends if you use a flat iron or curling iron as I do.</li>
            <li> Love this for think hair.</li>
            <li> This pleasant smelling shampoo creates a rich lather and left my hair fresh and clean, but because it left my scalp itcy I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I first used this shampoo about 10 years ago now after receiving both the shampoo and conditioner as a gift. I think the greatest testament to the amazingness of this shampoo is that although I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and conditioners (both other brands and other formulas of Fekkai) I keep coming back to this shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s like the Goldilocks of shampoo and conditioners, i.e., not too drying to make my hair look fried but not too moisturizing to make my hair go limp. It&#x27;s juuuust right. I went back and looked at the review I originally wrote for the old packaging back in the day (it&#x27;s had both a formula and a packaging update so Amazon has given it a whole new item number and page, apparently.) Because the old review still holds true, I posted it below. Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;My hair looks fuller, softer, and shinier when I use this shampoo. It also has waaaay more body. I used this shampoo, along with the Technician Conditioner, a few years ago after receiving it as a gift; I always got lots of complimets on my hair then. Because of the price, I bought something less expensive, but not cheap, when I finished the bottle. Instantly my hair looked less full and wasn&#x27;t quite as manageable and I had my first bad hair day in a long while. After finishing that other brand (it starts and ends with an &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; and is famous for its natural ingredients) I broke down and bought bottles of the Fekkai Technician Shampoo and Technician Conditioner. Glorious! Good hair days were back again! Other people are noticing as well and I&#x27;m getting those standard questions, &amp;#34;did you get a haircut?&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;did you color your hair?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Nope&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;not recently,&amp;#34; I just switched back to the world&#x27;s best shampoo and conditioner.&amp;#34; I keep buying this shampoo because nothing else makes my hair look as glorious.</li>
            <li> These Fekkai products are amazing. Seriously.  After using them, I wonder how / why other haircare companies do not do whatever it is that Fekkai does.  I&#x27;ll expain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their shampoo cleans your hair.  I mean--it&#x27;s clean, but NOT stripped.  It doesn&#x27;t lather up because of how it&#x27;s made to clean your HAIR and not just strip it down to nothing (and then dry it out, rendering it unable to continue to grow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner, paired with it&#x27;s partner shampoo, keeps your hair feeling smooth, manageable, and shiny (I sound like a commercial, but I swear, I do not intend to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Chi or Nexxus products.  I always use Chi serum.  I am very picky about  my haircare.  I have red long hair, and it breaks and falls out SO easily it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint the cause.  I rarely even style it, because it&#x27;s too stressful on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all said, using this and it&#x27;s matching shampoo product has completely changed how I look at my hair.  I can wash my hair with the Color Care, and then condition it with this, and OMG I don&#x27;t need the serum!  When I do use it, it&#x27;s AMAZING.  I can wash (little lather), condition (sooooo nice), rinse (clean as a whistle), comb out (no issues, and my hair is 1/2 way down my back), and dry just my bangs (come on ladies, we all know how important the bangs are--if we dry them, the rest can work itself out on most days)--and it looks like I spent hours styling it.  I can curl it with my fingers, and it looks marvelous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My color (red, natural, but amped up) is bright and (seriously) sparkly!  I would love to stock my guest bathrooms with this so I can share the amazing qualities of this product with those I love.  I&amp;#34;m not kidding--so that should tell you &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; about the product haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, and feels great.  I cannot recommend this enough. (That&#x27;s a first!)</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo for my hair. Helps keep color from fading and leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and course hair. After reading the reviews, I decided to buy the little bottle to test out this brand. I ordered the Technician Color Care shampoo and conditioner. I have went through the shampoo and conditioner bottles before posting to see how it worked long term. This makes my hair so shiny and soft! It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, either. I now have both the conditioner and shampoo on my subscribe and save because I know I will use it. I can actually let my hair air dry and it doesn&#x27;t look like crazy witch hair (I also bought the little bottle of glossing creme and it works wonders)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually hate paying more for hair care products, but this is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, I love it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has changed since Proctor &amp; Gamble took it over. I wish I had an old bottle of it (pre-Industrial Giant takeover) so I could compare the ingredients then with the ingredients now.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s changed, and not for the better. It just doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling as good as the original formula did, and I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what it is that&#x27;s different about it, but it could only be the ingredients. Not worth paying top dollar for any more, and I won&#x27;t be. Looking for a new shampoo that&#x27;s NOT from some huge faceless corporation that doesn&#x27;t  give a rip about my hair, or anyone&#x27;s hair, for that matter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Fekkai Technician Color Care for years--my hair looks noticeably better (moisturized, easy to style, good volume) with Fekkai products than with others.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and suppleness of my hair after using this. Bottle is very small - wish I felt like I was getting a bit more value.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.  It smells so good and left my hair feeling soft.  The shampoo gives a nice lather and really got my hair clean. I will be buying this shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for quite awhile not and have been very pleased with the fact that my color fades much less. I used to have the color fade considerable in between colorings but with this shampoo it holds well. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo it leaves&lt;br /&gt; my hair shiny &amp; silky and doesn&#x27;t kill my color.  I did see a reviewer mention hair loss - i highly doubt it was the shampoo but probably the hair color.  I have always wanted this shampoo as every time i got a sample of it - i would rave about it - well i decided i am worth it and so glad i bought this!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo I usually switch shampoos a few times a year but this is for sure one of my favorites. It helps keep my color form fading has a pleasant smell and is a great quality shampoo it leaves my hair feeling very clean with no film</li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t lather up much. I am unfamiliar with the brand to know if that is a characteristic of it, but I didn&#x27;t care for it. It felt drying to me and felt like tangled up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. My hair looks great and I didn&#x27;t have to use a conditioner. I would recommend and will buy again considering price is a little high but worth it.</li>
            <li> This smells different from the other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve been using this exact brand and type for years but the most recent one I got smelled really strange</li>
