            <li>The kit is ok.  </li>
            <li>okay when I&#x27;m away.  </li>
            <li>Very functional and a great price.</li>
            <li>You are better off going to the drug store and buying each tool separately and putting them in a makeup bag.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>The case is just okay, but it doesn&#x27;t botther me, since my husband alrready have a learher case where he carries it now.</li>
            <li>Its nice to have a set of cool looking things.</li>
            <li>The nail clippers fell apart easily and the case arrived ripped.</li>
            <li>, these are an excellent gift, but be sure to give yourself a few months for delivery.</li>
            <li>Seemed somewhat cheap.</li>
            <li>I like the quality of the metal; it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  </li>
            <li>The zipper closes neatly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the outside is good to look at, but then the implements are cheap.</li>
            <li>But overall a good product.</li>
            <li>Not so with this and at such a good price, too.</li>
            <li>Seems like case design didn&#x27;t include testing with a full compliment of tools.</li>
            <li>I got it super quick</li>
            <li>Nice sturdy tools in solid bag.</li>
            <li>It took awhile for my package to arrive; but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>The other tools seemed of good quality.</li>
            <li>, the products is exactly what i expected, the clippers are sturdy, strong and cute.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my husband and he was very pleased with the clippers and the other tools included.</li>
            <li>The pieces seem pretty durable.  </li>
            <li>again and in Germany you get better stuff for the same price like the China trash in USA!</li>
            <li>Very high quality set.</li>
            <li>My husband has been wanting his own little grooming kit and put off getting himself one.</li>
            <li>Absolute piece of junk...</li>
            <li>Heavy duty product so far so good.</li>
            <li>Next time I will buy the good old German stuff (Solingen, Zwilling)</li>
            <li>The tools have a high quality look and feel to them and perform very well.</li>
            <li>Decent quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a manicure set that would satisfy me and this is well worth the price, even though it&#x27;s a Chinese manufactured product.</li>
            <li>Going by excellent reviews, I was somewhat disappointed.  </li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t need them right away</li>
            <li>Case could look a little better outside</li>
            <li>Solid construction, strong metal, sharp edges.  </li>
            <li>All the instruments are of high quality; much nicer than I expected.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than I expected.</li>
            <li>They can barely cut through a nail.</li>
            <li>The case is ok, not great, but the tools are well made.</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that inside if the case easily scratches or cuts if you scrape the clippers on them.  </li>
            <li>So much nicer than i expected for the price!</li>
            <li>The scissor is not really sharp and the spring clipper (in the picture on the right side) is to small to handle.</li>
            <li>The nail clippers do not cut evenly, the nippers are not sharp and when the blades are squeezed together you can see a gap where they don&#x27;t even touch, same with the tweezers, they just don&#x27;t work, tried to tweeze a brow brow hair with no luck.  </li>
            <li>Not what I expected, not really good, like most of the stuff made in China.</li>

            <li> Absolute piece of junk... Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The kit is ok.  I do have to take apart the clipper as it gets caught up and doesn&#x27;t open all the way sometimes.</li>
            <li> good product, I liked the quality of the items.</li>
            <li> Nice set, great value for the price, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wanting his own little grooming kit and put off getting himself one. So, at Christmastime I took it upon myself to give this to him as a gift. He loved it. He was especially happy for the utility of it but was humored by the smiley faces which made it something of a conversation piece.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers fell apart easily and the case arrived ripped.</li>
            <li> After getting one bad set after another for Father&#x27;s Day and Christmas and on and on.......went to Amazon, looked for the stars and bought it.  Solid construction, strong metal, sharp edges.  let me add another 5-star to the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a manicure set that would satisfy me and this is well worth the price, even though it&#x27;s a Chinese manufactured product.</li>
            <li> Looking good, takes time and attentional - make it so.</li>
            <li> It took awhile for my package to arrive; but it was well worth the wait. All the instruments are of high quality; much nicer than I expected. I even caught the wife using it yesterday.</li>
            <li> Given as Birthday Gifts (but I tried this also)  Heavy duty product so far so good.</li>
            <li> Going by excellent reviews, I was somewhat disappointed.  It was a gift for my husband and he has very tough toenails.  The toenail clippers did not have wide enough openings. The other tools seemed of good quality. Also, the envelope and box it was sent in through regular mail were smashed.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of this set.</li>
            <li> Works well and I definitely like  the variety of instruments given in this kit.  I&#x27;m not a very big fan of the file but I use my wife&#x27;s if I&#x27;m home or it does okay when I&#x27;m away.  The only complaint is that inside if the case easily scratches or cuts if you scrape the clippers on them.  It&#x27;s some sort of sy the tickets product and not a smooth leather</li>
            <li> Adequate, but not great.</li>
            <li> Just what my son wanted!</li>
            <li> The scissor is not really sharp and the spring clipper (in the picture on the right side) is to small to handle. Not what I expected, not really good, like most of the stuff made in China. Next time I will buy the good old German stuff (Solingen, Zwilling) again and in Germany you get better stuff for the same price like the China trash in USA!</li>
            <li> Ehhh, zipper on the case broke after one use.</li>
            <li> Very functional and a great price.</li>
            <li> Very high quality set. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the metal; it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  I clipped my toenails and had no problems!  Ha!</li>
            <li> My wife kept taking my nail trimmers and grooming scissors so I bought this so I can keep track of them. I think thses are great quality and the trimmers offer a clean cut on the nail. Its nice to have a set of cool looking things.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he was very pleased with the clippers and the other tools included.</li>
            <li> My wife gave me the Men&#x27;s Manicure G Sourcingbay 9in1 for Christmas. I love it!. I have no problems with clipping or trimming my fingers or toes nails. I had read that the case had issues - the zipper not closing the case fully. Not with my case. The zipper closes neatly and smoothly. I now give myself a manicure every two weeks.</li>
            <li> This set got good reviews so I ordered it for travel.  The nail clippers do not cut evenly, the nippers are not sharp and when the blades are squeezed together you can see a gap where they don&#x27;t even touch, same with the tweezers, they just don&#x27;t work, tried to tweeze a brow brow hair with no luck.  You are better off going to the drug store and buying each tool separately and putting them in a makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Nail clippers don&#x27;t cut and tweezers cut everything.tweezers are extremely sharp and cut hairs you may want to tweeze.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleasantly surprised by the wonderful quality of the implements in this kit. Sometimes the outside is good to look at, but then the implements are cheap. Not so with this and at such a good price, too. I&#x27;ll be very happy to give this as a gift.</li>
            <li> I was a little dubious about buying this product as it was being shipped by boat from China  but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance. Delivery time was around 3 weeks. The tools have a high quality look and feel to them and perform very well. Even the case they came in suprised me. As long as you don&#x27;t need them right away it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, clippers fall apart.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife for Christmas. Ordered it in Nov. and it arrived in Jan. These are shipped from China. That said, these are excellent quality. The case is ok, not great, but the tools are well made. I foresee these tools lasting several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, these are an excellent gift, but be sure to give yourself a few months for delivery.</li>
            <li> After a lot of searching and reading of reviews I bought two of these kits for gifts. Excellent quality, very attractive inside and out. The tools are sharp and do what they should. I also bought shaving bags to accompany this gift.</li>
            <li> At first glance this was an awesome product until in use. Everything is incredibly dull</li>
            <li> Much nicer than I expected. Heavy well made and SHARP! A manicurist saw mine and said they were a great value!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! It took 5 weeks to arrive and the quality of the clippers is terrible. They can barely cut through a nail. I&#x27;m looking for another set because these just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I just love it it was a gift for my husband and he loves it very good quality very pleased</li>
            <li> Decent quality. Nice zippered case. Have to play around with the individual tools to get the case to close as it should. Seems like case design didn&#x27;t include testing with a full compliment of tools.</li>
            <li> excellent, high quality</li>
            <li> Great product! I got it super quick, the products is exactly what i expected, the clippers are sturdy, strong and cute. The case is just okay, but it doesn&#x27;t botther me, since my husband alrready have a learher case where he carries it now. I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely pretty great, i wasn&#x27;t expecting it to look really nice when i received it but its a definite must buy.</li>
            <li> Really nice quality set.  Built to last.  I feel good every time I use it.  One of those products that gives you a warm and fuzzy.</li>
