            <li>There are none better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given a tin to all of my family members and they love it too.</li>
            <li>Many think they are carcinogenic.</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips moist, and they just don&#x27;t chap any more.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Wish it were a screw top?</li>
            <li>I have searched locally in south Louisiana for this salve, I was so happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love putting in on my elbows and lips.</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this as lip balm, haven&#x27;t used it for anything else</li>
            <li>Have bought more since.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It would be better if they did crosscut the barcode in permanent marker.  </li>
            <li>C.O. Bigelow brand is so much better.</li>
            <li>and I have given many cans as gifts and many of those people asked where they can get more.</li>
            <li>but we knew we should be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and turned many friends and family onto it as well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>it has so many uses</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Best salve next to sliced bread(I don&#x27;t think it compares I just like that saying)</li>
            <li>I am so glad I could order thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love it, use as lip balm</li>
            <li>Way better than any &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; style lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Like a better version of Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad we could find it for her..  </li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>i do love the product but bought them gifts</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t been able to find it</li>
            <li>Lips look healthy, not &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>One tin lasts forever, and you will find so many uses for it.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s most beneficial after a shower or hand wash,to seal in the water.</li>
            <li>I love this rosebud salve.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, so this is perfect because it stays on for a long time</li>
            <li>This product is the BEST for chapped lips and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li>They make different types now,but the original is the best.</li>
            <li>This product is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a good price, was shipped fast, and I will this seller again.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells lovely--a light rose scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering and that fades relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>also that is easy to take along anywhere</li>
            <li>This is SUCH nice lip balm--feels good on hands, too.</li>
            <li>Good quality, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My father told me about Rose Bud in 1980 when our first daughter had a rash.</li>
            <li>This is an incredible all around product for chapped lips and dry skin.</li>
            <li>This salve has a fine texture and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However the case was not opened smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is silky and has a light scent.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I turned to  Amazon to look to see if it was still available.</li>
            <li>I used Rosebud Salve in my younger days, and was THRILLED to discover it again when I was searching for a lower cost alternative to Baume de Rose by Terry.  </li>
            <li>Right between my eyes on the top of my nose.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant, not too thick, and stays on fairly well, but needs to be reapplied often.  </li>
            <li>I typically use as a lip balm and it goes great on top of lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s prices are VERY good, especially since Hollywood recently discovered this amazing product so now everyone&#x27;s jacking up the price...  </li>
            <li>visiting family.&lt;br /&gt;much better to get it shipped to the house ;-)</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Hot spots develop on my skin that I&#x27;ve not been able to get rid of except by using Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve.  </li>
            <li>My grandmother, mother, and sister were so excited when I gave them each a tin.</li>
            <li>Works great on cuticles, dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li>Great for dry cuticles too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for curing hangnails, which go along with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Delivered in a cleanly wrapped package.</li>
            <li>I have really dry hands, and I find this to be a great softening balm.</li>
            <li>I used it for my son&#x27;s diaper rash &amp; it cleared right up!</li>
            <li>I think they thought she was a boy,but in any case it&#x27;s a true story.</li>
            <li>seriously, this is the greatest stuff in the world!!!</li>
            <li>It is great for dry lips, and really keeps lips comfortable and in shape if one does not want to wear lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Woke up with super puffy skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is not very sticky, smells good and gets absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li>it is so much moisturizing makes your lips feel so soft it feels good t on your cuticles too.</li>
            <li>Really good product for dry lips/skin.</li>
            <li>Also good for burns and dry patches.</li>
            <li>Not like my other rose salve!</li>
            <li>I am still on my first tin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This makes a great little gift for friends and family.  </li>
            <li>It goes on light and smooth, and it feels like a nice little indulgence.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t try this you are missing out on a great product.</li>
            <li>The price is for a 4 pack and it was definitley worth it.  </li>
            <li>totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>its nice product, if you can open the container every time you want to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little gift giveaway, with Prime, arrived exactly on time.</li>
            <li>The consistency is light but effective - a little thinner than vaseline and not sticky at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also wonderful for cuticles, and any other dry areas on your skin.  </li>
            <li>it makes your lips so soft and if there chapped it heals it very quickly.</li>
            <li>you very much.</li>
            <li>it is a fine product,  Amazon has always given great service and items, fast shipping would recommend to everyone, one of the few products that will do what it says it will do, will order again!!!</li>
            <li>I received my first Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve as a Christmas gift from a co-worker.  </li>
            <li>but it keeps my lips soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>everything, only place we were able to find this was in NM&lt;</li>
            <li>Ordered extra and gifted to my friends.</li>
            <li>My mother-in-law has used this religiously for most of her life.</li>
            <li>In fact, my 84-year-old grandfather still gets his hand-written order filled directly by Smith&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I&#x27;ve ordered multiple tins several times from Amazon!  </li>
            <li>small size is good for carrying.</li>
            <li>Just rub it into dry skin on the backs of your hands or elbows or wherever, and it absorbs quickly and leaves skin smooth, moisturized, and protected.  </li>
            <li>Perfect consistency -- thick enough not to come off easily, but greasy enough to really coat your lips and protect them.  </li>
            <li>Some of the different \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; have a rather strong smell and seem to be sweetened.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Rosebud - the original one - as long as I can remember and can&#x27;t find anything better or even equal to Rosebud.</li>
            <li>Really softens the lips?  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>My Daughters like it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have used it when I bought a lipstick that was just too much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for listening.</li>
            <li>( AKA this is the REAL thing)  and shipping time and price i have found ANYWHERE in the WORLD.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>BUT, the last six I ordered will be my last because it isn&#x27;t near as good as it has</li>
            <li>YOU MUST ORDER THIS ORIGINAL because the scented products (and the tubes) disappoint - not the same consistency.</li>
            <li>That &amp; a few other lovely symptoms like my hair falling out has not made me a very happy person lately, anyway this was something I had just always had.  </li>
            <li>and I tend to lick my lips more than your average bear.</li>
            <li>great salve the tins are hard to open sometimes.</li>
            <li>There is a reason that Rosebud Salve is a cult beauty classic, I don&#x27;t leave my house without it.</li>
            <li>Like that it has minimal ingredients, and the container, but nothing special really and didn&#x27;t help my lips more than any other product of this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I also love the little container.  </li>
            <li>i have bought several tins and give them away to friends and family as gifts or just for fun.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it during the winter months.</li>
            <li>as could  not  use any  of them for gifts and had to buy all new gifts.</li>
            <li>it will heal open wounds overnight, cure blemishes in less time than my own acne medicine will, and leaves me with baby soft lips after every use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Love the small, convenient container</li>
            <li>Talk about finding an old friend!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still the exact same.</li>
            <li>It is not only smooth on chapped lips, also works on the dry parts of my skin.</li>
            <li>It stays on for a long time, much better than any other I used.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight rose scent that is super subtle (no taste) and a creamy texture.</li>
            <li>I actually have used this little tub of salve for many problems.  </li>
            <li>I also love the delicate, soft scent.</li>
            <li>The salve saves their lips from old man winter&#x27;s bite.</li>
            <li>He is 8 years old and his face and neck now feels like baby skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t close the cover completely to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really want them to change to a different container</li>
            <li>My three boys come to me frequently asking for the &amp;#34;Rosebud&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>She used to order it directly from the company and used it on everything.  </li>
            <li>My 83 year old aunt sold it as a child</li>
            <li>It blends with the lipstick &amp; turns it into a more subtle gloss.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light but rosey - not overwhelming or old ladyish at all.  </li>
            <li>My grandmother first gave me this as a child and now decades later I am still buying it for myself and younger generations too!</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what was expected, and well packaged.</li>
            <li>THis product used to be a medicinal ointment sold way &amp;#34;Back when&amp;#34; at drug stores, but now comes with a very she-she price tab and only found in other specialty stores, but it is worth every penny and last for years.</li>
            <li>Tried plain petroleum jelly a week later and it was fine.</li>
            <li>If you have a really bad case of chapped lips, this balm is great.  </li>
            <li>No irritation and have used it on eyelids after looking at YouTube video and worked by the second day to clear my redness and dryness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are tons of natural ingredients, that don&#x27;t pose the risks of petrol products - such as shea butter, beeswax, coconut oil - that lip balms can be made from.  </li>
            <li>I also used it for pink eye &amp; it healed fast.</li>
            <li>I am 77 years old and sold this very same Rosebud Salve (albeit a much larger tin) when I was about 8 or 9 years old for 50 cents.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally I will get detergent burn (really sensitive skin) on my hands and Rosebud</li>
            <li>Good for lips and sore noses when I have a cold.</li>
            <li>The most luxurious lip balm, moistens your lips without false flavor or scent.  </li>
            <li>Super nice to the lips.. and other random dry patches that pop up on the face or hands.  </li>
            <li>This is the only thing that gets my whole family through the rough NE Ohio winters.</li>
            <li>Lasts long, makes lips soft and keeps them moisturized</li>
            <li>My 90 year old mother had been looking for RoseBud salve for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go to sleep without my Rosebud salve to keep my lips soft all night, and I never wake up with dry, chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>The tin can get messy when it&#x27;s hot outside; and (2)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ever seen it stain anything either, but I have never flat out</li>
            <li>and I kind of knew something was wrong because my skin would get so dry, then harden, then crack &amp; peel off.....</li>

            <li> Many think they are carcinogenic.</li>
            <li> It keeps my lips moist, and they just don&#x27;t chap any more.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Wish it were a screw top?</li>
            <li> I have searched locally in south Louisiana for this salve, I was so happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love putting in on my elbows and lips.</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely.</li>
            <li> I love this as lip balm, haven&#x27;t used it for anything else</li>
            <li> Have bought more since.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It would be better if they did crosscut the barcode in permanent marker.  </li>
            <li> C.O. Bigelow brand is so much better.</li>
            <li> and I have given many cans as gifts and many of those people asked where they can get more.</li>
            <li> but we knew we should be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and turned many friends and family onto it as well.</li>

            <li> Love it, use as lip balm</li>
            <li> Way better than any &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; style lip balm.  </li>
            <li> Like a better version of Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Glad we could find it for her..  </li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> i do love the product but bought them gifts</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t been able to find it</li>
            <li> Lips look healthy, not &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> One tin lasts forever, and you will find so many uses for it.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s most beneficial after a shower or hand wash,to seal in the water.</li>
            <li> I love this rosebud salve.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> , so this is perfect because it stays on for a long time</li>
            <li> This product is the BEST for chapped lips and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li> They make different types now,but the original is the best.</li>
            <li> This product is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good price, was shipped fast, and I will this seller again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells lovely--a light rose scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering and that fades relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> also that is easy to take along anywhere</li>
            <li> This is SUCH nice lip balm--feels good on hands, too.</li>
            <li> Good quality, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My father told me about Rose Bud in 1980 when our first daughter had a rash.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible all around product for chapped lips and dry skin.</li>
            <li> This salve has a fine texture and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However the case was not opened smoothly.</li>
            <li> It is silky and has a light scent.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I turned to  Amazon to look to see if it was still available.</li>
            <li> I used Rosebud Salve in my younger days, and was THRILLED to discover it again when I was searching for a lower cost alternative to Baume de Rose by Terry.  </li>
            <li> Right between my eyes on the top of my nose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pleasant, not too thick, and stays on fairly well, but needs to be reapplied often.  </li>
            <li> I typically use as a lip balm and it goes great on top of lipstick.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s prices are VERY good, especially since Hollywood recently discovered this amazing product so now everyone&#x27;s jacking up the price...  </li>
            <li> visiting family.&lt;br /&gt;much better to get it shipped to the house ;-)</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Hot spots develop on my skin that I&#x27;ve not been able to get rid of except by using Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve.  </li>
            <li> My grandmother, mother, and sister were so excited when I gave them each a tin.</li>
            <li> Works great on cuticles, dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Great for dry cuticles too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for curing hangnails, which go along with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Delivered in a cleanly wrapped package.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands, and I find this to be a great softening balm.</li>
            <li> I used it for my son&#x27;s diaper rash &amp; it cleared right up!</li>
            <li> I think they thought she was a boy,but in any case it&#x27;s a true story.</li>
            <li> seriously, this is the greatest stuff in the world!!!</li>
            <li> It is great for dry lips, and really keeps lips comfortable and in shape if one does not want to wear lipstick.  </li>
            <li> Woke up with super puffy skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is not very sticky, smells good and gets absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li> it is so much moisturizing makes your lips feel so soft it feels good t on your cuticles too.</li>
            <li> Really good product for dry lips/skin.</li>
            <li> Also good for burns and dry patches.</li>
            <li> Not like my other rose salve!</li>
            <li> I am still on my first tin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This makes a great little gift for friends and family.  </li>
            <li> It goes on light and smooth, and it feels like a nice little indulgence.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t try this you are missing out on a great product.</li>
            <li> The price is for a 4 pack and it was definitley worth it.  </li>
            <li> totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> its nice product, if you can open the container every time you want to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great little gift giveaway, with Prime, arrived exactly on time.</li>
            <li> The consistency is light but effective - a little thinner than vaseline and not sticky at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also wonderful for cuticles, and any other dry areas on your skin.  </li>
            <li> it makes your lips so soft and if there chapped it heals it very quickly.</li>
            <li> you very much.</li>
            <li> it is a fine product,  Amazon has always given great service and items, fast shipping would recommend to everyone, one of the few products that will do what it says it will do, will order again!!!</li>
            <li> I received my first Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve as a Christmas gift from a co-worker.  </li>
            <li> but it keeps my lips soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> everything, only place we were able to find this was in NM&lt;</li>
            <li> Ordered extra and gifted to my friends.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law has used this religiously for most of her life.</li>
            <li> In fact, my 84-year-old grandfather still gets his hand-written order filled directly by Smith&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I&#x27;ve ordered multiple tins several times from Amazon!  </li>
            <li> small size is good for carrying.</li>
            <li> Just rub it into dry skin on the backs of your hands or elbows or wherever, and it absorbs quickly and leaves skin smooth, moisturized, and protected.  </li>
            <li> Perfect consistency -- thick enough not to come off easily, but greasy enough to really coat your lips and protect them.  </li>
            <li> Some of the different \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; have a rather strong smell and seem to be sweetened.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rosebud - the original one - as long as I can remember and can&#x27;t find anything better or even equal to Rosebud.</li>
            <li> Really softens the lips?  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> My Daughters like it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have used it when I bought a lipstick that was just too much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for listening.</li>
            <li> ( AKA this is the REAL thing)  and shipping time and price i have found ANYWHERE in the WORLD.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> BUT, the last six I ordered will be my last because it isn&#x27;t near as good as it has</li>
            <li> YOU MUST ORDER THIS ORIGINAL because the scented products (and the tubes) disappoint - not the same consistency.</li>
            <li> That &amp; a few other lovely symptoms like my hair falling out has not made me a very happy person lately, anyway this was something I had just always had.  </li>
            <li> and I tend to lick my lips more than your average bear.</li>
            <li> great salve the tins are hard to open sometimes.</li>
            <li> There is a reason that Rosebud Salve is a cult beauty classic, I don&#x27;t leave my house without it.</li>
            <li> Like that it has minimal ingredients, and the container, but nothing special really and didn&#x27;t help my lips more than any other product of this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I also love the little container.  </li>
            <li> i have bought several tins and give them away to friends and family as gifts or just for fun.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it during the winter months.</li>
            <li> as could  not  use any  of them for gifts and had to buy all new gifts.</li>
            <li> it will heal open wounds overnight, cure blemishes in less time than my own acne medicine will, and leaves me with baby soft lips after every use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Love the small, convenient container</li>
            <li> Talk about finding an old friend!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still the exact same.</li>
            <li> It is not only smooth on chapped lips, also works on the dry parts of my skin.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a long time, much better than any other I used.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight rose scent that is super subtle (no taste) and a creamy texture.</li>
            <li> I actually have used this little tub of salve for many problems.  </li>
            <li> I also love the delicate, soft scent.</li>
            <li> The salve saves their lips from old man winter&#x27;s bite.</li>
            <li> He is 8 years old and his face and neck now feels like baby skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t close the cover completely to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really want them to change to a different container</li>
            <li> My three boys come to me frequently asking for the &amp;#34;Rosebud&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> She used to order it directly from the company and used it on everything.  </li>
            <li> My 83 year old aunt sold it as a child</li>
            <li> It blends with the lipstick &amp; turns it into a more subtle gloss.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light but rosey - not overwhelming or old ladyish at all.  </li>
            <li> My grandmother first gave me this as a child and now decades later I am still buying it for myself and younger generations too!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what was expected, and well packaged.</li>
            <li> THis product used to be a medicinal ointment sold way &amp;#34;Back when&amp;#34; at drug stores, but now comes with a very she-she price tab and only found in other specialty stores, but it is worth every penny and last for years.</li>
            <li> Tried plain petroleum jelly a week later and it was fine.</li>
            <li> If you have a really bad case of chapped lips, this balm is great.  </li>
            <li> No irritation and have used it on eyelids after looking at YouTube video and worked by the second day to clear my redness and dryness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are tons of natural ingredients, that don&#x27;t pose the risks of petrol products - such as shea butter, beeswax, coconut oil - that lip balms can be made from.  </li>
            <li> I also used it for pink eye &amp; it healed fast.</li>
            <li> I am 77 years old and sold this very same Rosebud Salve (albeit a much larger tin) when I was about 8 or 9 years old for 50 cents.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally I will get detergent burn (really sensitive skin) on my hands and Rosebud</li>
            <li> Good for lips and sore noses when I have a cold.</li>
            <li> The most luxurious lip balm, moistens your lips without false flavor or scent.  </li>
            <li> Super nice to the lips.. and other random dry patches that pop up on the face or hands.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing that gets my whole family through the rough NE Ohio winters.</li>
            <li> Lasts long, makes lips soft and keeps them moisturized</li>
            <li> My 90 year old mother had been looking for RoseBud salve for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go to sleep without my Rosebud salve to keep my lips soft all night, and I never wake up with dry, chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> The tin can get messy when it&#x27;s hot outside; and (2)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever seen it stain anything either, but I have never flat out</li>
            <li> and I kind of knew something was wrong because my skin would get so dry, then harden, then crack &amp; peel off.....</li>
            <li> but I tell you the truth, based on my families experience and word from other old time users too.</li>
            <li> For chapped lips, dry cuticles, cuts and scrapes, blemishes, dry skin, and a whole slew of other things, Rosebud is my jam.  </li>
            <li> It heals cuts faster and is the only thing we use for chapped lips, all year long.</li>
            <li> I use it on my lips every night, and on dry skin or cuticles when ever I need extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I love the product but it was the condition of it that is so disappointing..  </li>
            <li> Two (minor)</li>
            <li> I disagree, but it does have a good amount of powder smell to it, so beware if you hate the smell of baby powder.</li>
            <li> I actually saw when I placed my last order that you have the option of little tubes.</li>
            <li> My mother had a little left when she recently had shingles and used it on them.  </li>
            <li> I use it on lips, cuticles and any really dry skin spots.</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I was a kid to heal calluses areas and dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer dry skin and severe chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> Anywhere that feels dry.</li>
            <li> Life saver for my wife&#x27;s dry lips.</li>
            <li> My eyelids were abnormally dry from allergies, so I thought applying this would help.</li>
            <li> I use it in my dry nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used stuff that only seems to last a few minutes, but this stuff keeps going.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that I occasionally have difficulty getting the lid open.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my hands when they are dry!</li>
            <li> Spend a little extra for time-proven quality and value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find outside of Urban Outfitters!  </li>
            <li> It was a deeper pink (and a lot cheaper) but it still works as well.</li>
            <li> I received a tin of this a few years back for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have also battled with facial dandruff for a few years and could not get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> Item as described, delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> I use it in my lips occasionally, and it has no taste, despite the heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> It had a few weird ingredients that I couldn&#x27;t identify, but overall, I think it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li> all tins are the same....  please redesign so those of us with weak or slippy fingers can get the darn thing open!!</li>
            <li> If you have any dry areas on you put a little dab of this on it.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me a little of vasaline except this stuff absorbes and makes your dry spots go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so may things, but this is one of the very few that actually works, both as a prventative and a cure.  </li>
            <li> They did not let us down.</li>
            <li> Very thick concentrated product but only a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> all of them were a mess they had melted..  </li>
            <li> The only other product that has worked for me as well as this is a balm by Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Beauty Rush, but they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> metal on metal is just a little tight - and I bought the 4 pack -</li>
            <li> I think they need to add that little twist thing that is on shoe polish cans.  </li>
            <li> My mother used to buy Rosebud when I was little, so I have never been without it.</li>
            <li> A little overrated.</li>
            <li> I used it as a little girl</li>
            <li> Tin is near impossible to open!</li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is the container, or actually opening the container with it on your hands can be difficult.  </li>
            <li> We have trouble finding it</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the tin it comes in, which can be difficult to open</li>
            <li> Small cans but a little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> It was in one spot, and only a small spot, but seriously on my face!  </li>
            <li> makeup drawer (killer on those little lip lines if you use this before bed!)</li>
            <li> My grandma used this when we were small on our cheeks when we would be wind burnt.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you have not tried this you are missing out.</li>
            <li> The Smith&#x27;s Rosebud is hard to find and our daughter and friend loves this brand.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve for years and we always have at least one tin in the house at all times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for at least 50 years+.</li>
            <li> 1 container was badly damaged and 1 other was slight dented and hard to remove the lid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No, seriously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously tempted to stockpile it.</li>
            <li> With the dry cold weather we have been having I put it around my eyes before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> These arrived with half salve in base and half in cover.</li>
            <li> It did not CURE a skin problem, it helped to graduly resolve the ugly dry alligator looking hide on my face.  </li>
            <li> I also dab a little around the edges of my nose when I have a cold, to keep it from chapping.</li>
            <li> The flavor is a little bit artificial.</li>
            <li> Im addicted to chapstick and can&#x27;t stand not having anything on my lips</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> , sadly, I read the ingredients: petrolatum, cotton seed oil, and scent.  </li>
            <li> Here is one quote: &amp;#34;Petroleum jelly can create the illusion of moisturized, hydrated skin, all the while suffocating your pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water-repellant and not water-soluble, meaning it merely seals the barrier so that moisture does not leave the skin.</li>
            <li> Looks tacky and questionable.  </li>
            <li> sorry,</li>
            <li> Gets rid of the WORST chapped lips (antibiotic ointment doesn&#x27;t compare), and every cut, scrape or irritation externally you have!</li>
            <li> I think I will smear a thin coat on my crows feet around my eyes and see how it works!</li>
            <li> It heals cracked and dry hands, terrible cuticles, blemishes (just try it), cuts, chapped lips, and even healed a cut on my dog&#x27;s ear.</li>
            <li> This is basically perfumed vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google petroleum products, which are by-products of processing crude oil.  </li>
            <li> qualms: (1)</li>
            <li> disappointed</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t forget those awful chapped hands or burns!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My son had terrible, chapped lips this winter and nothing he tried was helping.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite beauty aid. I use it on lips, cuticles and any really dry skin spots.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for years for around $6 or $7 dollars a tin so this 4 pack for $20 is a great deal. Now I can keep one at work, next to my bed, in my purse, in my car, etc!</li>
            <li> Lasts long, makes lips soft and keeps them moisturized</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm I have used for !!! So moisturizing and feels good on my lips!!! Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what was expected, and well packaged. Really good product for dry lips/skin.</li>
            <li> Great little gift giveaway, with Prime, arrived exactly on time. My go-to lip balm and skin treatment.</li>
            <li> Received as a gift &amp; thought it was just another salve but it is not.  I&#x27;ve used on my cuticles and heels to soften.  One night I put under my eyes and they were NOT puffy the next morning but softened my wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve used it on my lips and it is much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  It feels good, eases my chapped lips and do not gum up like most salves but shines.</li>
            <li> The Smith&#x27;s Rosebud is hard to find and our daughter and friend loves this brand.  The salve saves their lips from old man winter&#x27;s bite.</li>
            <li> If I were stranded on an island and had to pick one thing (aside from food &amp; water) to bring... this might be it. Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve is good for everything - best lip balm / cuticle cream / intensive facial moisturizer / diaper balm ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, seriously. It is addictive. I buy the 4 pack so I can keep a tin wherever I am. I love it that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously tempted to stockpile it. Just in case.</li>
            <li> have used for years, used as stocking stuffers. best salve for small cuts, scrapes, and burns and best product to use on chapped lips.  Small cans but a little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I was a kid to heal calluses areas and dry cracked skin. My dad has been looking for this stuff for years. It&#x27;s good stuff I bought it for me and him.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The only lip balm I can use that does not cause irritation.</li>
            <li> My father told me about Rose Bud in 1980 when our first daughter had a rash. It heals cuts faster and is the only thing we use for chapped lips, all year long. I received my order as promised .</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Great light rose scent. Works great on cuticles, dry hands and feet. One of my must have products!</li>
            <li> The salve is great, it does a perfect job as a lip balm. There are none better. Would recommend to anyone who needs lip balm!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!  I&#x27;ve given a tin to all of my family members and they love it too. Works well on everything from chapped lips/skin to speed up healing of cuts. Great for dry cuticles too. The best all purpose salve!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS MAGIC! it will heal open wounds overnight, cure blemishes in less time than my own acne medicine will, and leaves me with baby soft lips after every use. amazing. i have bought several tins and give them away to friends and family as gifts or just for fun. it has a light, sweet scent that is very pleasant but not overpowering. i put this on EVERYTHING. seriously, this is the greatest stuff in the world!!!</li>
            <li> I used Rosebud Salve in my younger days, and was THRILLED to discover it again when I was searching for a lower cost alternative to Baume de Rose by Terry.  I was thrilled when I got the Rosebud Salve... it smells great, glides on so smoothly, and feels soooo soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, sadly, I read the ingredients: petrolatum, cotton seed oil, and scent.  Petrolatum is petroleum jelly... vaseline!  This is basically perfumed vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google petroleum products, which are by-products of processing crude oil.  Many think they are carcinogenic. There are a lot of risks to using petrol based products on your face (&amp; mouth!).  Even if you don&#x27;t believe in the risks, the scientific fact is that petroleum jelly is occlusive and hydrophobic.  Here is one quote: &amp;#34;Petroleum jelly can create the illusion of moisturized, hydrated skin, all the while suffocating your pores. It&#x27;s water-repellant and not water-soluble, meaning it merely seals the barrier so that moisture does not leave the skin. So while you might feel the instant gratification of a softened surface, you&#x27;re actually drying out your pores by keeping out air and moisture. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are tons of natural ingredients, that don&#x27;t pose the risks of petrol products - such as shea butter, beeswax, coconut oil - that lip balms can be made from.  I for one do not want petroleum jelly on my mouth.</li>
            <li> I suffer dry skin and severe chapped lips.  I found Rosebud Salve on another site some years ago, and it has changed the way I dread winter and chapped lip season.  It keeps my lips moist, and they just don&#x27;t chap any more.  It&#x27;s also great for curing hangnails, which go along with my dry skin.  I also dab a little around the edges of my nose when I have a cold, to keep it from chapping. This product is wonderful!</li>
            <li> As good as it gets when it comes to lip balm - that&#x27;s what I hear from the user I give for gifts.</li>
            <li> Great for gifts! loved the value pack!!</li>
            <li> Great product, wish I had know about it sooner.</li>
            <li> Love it. Really softens the lips?  Only complaint is that I occasionally have difficulty getting the lid open. Wish it were a screw top?</li>
            <li> I have searched locally in south Louisiana for this salve, I was so happy to find it on Amazon! This salve does everything it promises. I use it nightly on my lips and during the winter I use it when my daughter&#x27;s cheeks get wind burned. Always a wonderful product to have on hand.</li>
            <li> My son has severe eczema. I use this on his face and neck morning and night. He is 8 years old and his face and neck now feels like baby skin. My grandma used this when we were small on our cheeks when we would be wind burnt.</li>
            <li> This product is the BEST for chapped lips and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li> There is a reason that Rosebud Salve is a cult beauty classic, I don&#x27;t leave my house without it. I have 1 tin in my bathroom, 1 tin in my bed, 1 tin in my purse, and one tin at my office.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been buying this for years! It&#x27;s moisturizes well, is never sticky, and doesn&#x27;t feel waxy at all. This is a good price, was shipped fast, and I will this seller again.</li>
            <li> I received my first Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve as a Christmas gift from a co-worker.  I loved it so much I&#x27;ve ordered multiple tins several times from Amazon!  It makes an awesome lip gloss!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for almost EVERYTHING! I used it for my son&#x27;s diaper rash &amp; it cleared right up! I also used it for pink eye &amp; it healed fast. &amp; it&#x27;s awesome for lips.</li>
            <li> I saw this recommended in Consumers Report. I began my hunt and couldn&#x27;t find it. Once again Amazon.com came to my rescue! I love putting in on my elbows and lips. The smell is lovely.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible all around product for chapped lips and dry skin. I can&#x27;t live without it during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I love this as lip balm, haven&#x27;t used it for anything else but it keeps my lips soft and smooth. Im addicted to chapstick and can&#x27;t stand not having anything on my lips, so this is perfect because it stays on for a long time</li>
            <li> Great salve. No irritation and have used it on eyelids after looking at YouTube video and worked by the second day to clear my redness and dryness. Have bought more since. Highly recommend for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm out there. I love it it makes your lips so soft and if there chapped it heals it very quickly. I would definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the great reviews.  The price is for a 4 pack and it was definitley worth it.  I even use it on my hands when they are dry!</li>
            <li> Super nice to the lips.. and other random dry patches that pop up on the face or hands.  The smell is nice and a light rose scent.</li>
            <li> The best lip balm ever.</li>
            <li> great salve the tins are hard to open sometimes.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> was as a gift to be given to another person, when received was then mailed to the person that it was a gift for.</li>
            <li> It would be better if they did crosscut the barcode in permanent marker.  Looks tacky and questionable.  A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good items and a nice seller!!!&lt;br /&gt;However the case was not opened smoothly. I tried to open a lid of the item around 5 minutes. I almost flung this one to the floor. I don&#x27;t close the cover completely to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it has a fault, it is still good.</li>
            <li> It feels great, smells great and is a wonderful moisturizer for lips and I use around my eyes also to hydrate them.  Love the small, convenient container also that is easy to take along anywhere you need to.  Have used for years now and will continue to use forever.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve for years and we always have at least one tin in the house at all times. We use it for all kinds of things. (Just Google &amp;#34;Rosebud Salve uses&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll see what it can do.) A must have for any household.</li>
            <li> BUT, the last six I ordered will be my last because it isn&#x27;t near as good as it has been.&lt;br /&gt;So sorry, but I tell you the truth, based on my families experience and word from other old time users too.</li>
            <li> My Daughters like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;they carry it always, and everywhere, becasue of their lip probrom.&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is WONDERFUL!  If you have any dry areas on you put a little dab of this on it.  From what I understand this stuff has been around forever.  It reminds me a little of vasaline except this stuff absorbes and makes your dry spots go away. I recently found out I have hypothyroisism and I kind of knew something was wrong because my skin would get so dry, then harden, then crack &amp; peel off..... ON MY FACE!!! Can you imagine?  It was in one spot, and only a small spot, but seriously on my face!  Right between my eyes on the top of my nose.  That &amp; a few other lovely symptoms like my hair falling out has not made me a very happy person lately, anyway this was something I had just always had.  I kept it around for chapped lips and cuticles.  So I started putting some on my lovely face scale and it went away!!  I&#x27;m not going to tell you some phoney it was gone in a second, and I was being treated for my thyroid problem.  It did not CURE a skin problem, it helped to graduly resolve the ugly dry alligator looking hide on my face.  I also have used it when I bought a lipstick that was just too much.  It blends with the lipstick &amp; turns it into a more subtle gloss.  With the dry cold weather we have been having I put it around my eyes before I go to bed.  I actually have used this little tub of salve for many problems.  I love it!  I haven&#x27;t ever seen it stain anything either, but I have never flat out smeared it onto a cloth to see if it would.  The only negative I can think of is the container, or actually opening the container with it on your hands can be difficult.  I think they need to add that little twist thing that is on shoe polish cans.  I don&#x27;t really want them to change to a different container just make it a bit easier to open.  I actually saw when I placed my last order that you have the option of little tubes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since childhood and have passed it on to my grandchildren.They love it too! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest lip balm on the planet.  There&#x27;s just the faintest smell of girlyness. It feels sublime on your skin.  Also good for burns and dry patches.</li>
            <li> I was looking for SMITH&#x27;S ROSEBUD SALVE for a while and I liked the price.  I have used this product for over 40 years.  The price was the best I found.</li>
            <li> My mother used to buy Rosebud when I was little, so I have never been without it. It was a deeper pink (and a lot cheaper) but it still works as well. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it, thank you.</li>
            <li> I love the product but it was the condition of it that is so disappointing..  all of them were a mess they had melted..  In the condition that it was in I don&#x27;t feel that I should have to pay to send it back to your company....Thanks for listening.</li>
            <li> i have been buying Rosebud Salve original scent for years and this is the VERY best source for Price, authenticity( AKA this is the REAL thing)  and shipping time and price i have found ANYWHERE in the WORLD. Great company and product- You will NOT have chapped lips if you use this regularly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve been used so far. Feels good, smell good and work well. I use it for my lips, hands and feet. Anywhere that feels dry. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Gave this as Christmas stocking stuffers and to a couple that are heavy air travelers with which that really appreciated the tins. Helped to keep their lips moist during flying .</li>
            <li> The very best!!! My dad used used rosebud after shaving. He died at 90, always worked in the sun &amp; his face looked like a man in his fifty&#x27;s when he pass away. I am 75 &amp; used it all my life.</li>
            <li> If you have a really bad case of chapped lips, this balm is great.  I&#x27;ve tried so may things, but this is one of the very few that actually works, both as a prventative and a cure.  It&#x27;s pleasant, not too thick, and stays on fairly well, but needs to be reapplied often.  Some of the different \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; have a rather strong smell and seem to be sweetened.  They still work, but I prefer the lighter fragrances without sweetner.  The only other product that has worked for me as well as this is a balm by Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Beauty Rush, but they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The smell, the color, the feel are all wonderful!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THESE. Changed brand because I found a 4 pack of these on Amazon for $20. C.O. Bigelow brand is so much better. These arrived with half salve in base and half in cover. Consistency is too soft/gloopy. Not like my other rose salve! Sending these back!</li>
            <li> This product is very good for sensitive skins around the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps the lips with adequade moisture, and in case if of hurt, it will speed the healing.</li>
            <li> Very good for chapped lips , face cheeks , etc... use often.</li>
            <li> Great product, used for years it is a fine product,  Amazon has always given great service and items, fast shipping would recommend to everyone, one of the few products that will do what it says it will do, will order again!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I have been using it for over 60 years and I have given many cans as gifts and many of those people asked where they can get more.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I like it, my daughter, and my granddaughters. We have trouble finding it but we knew we should be able to find it on Amazon. They did not let us down. It is a great product and came very quick also. Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> improved metal tin so easier to open now</li>
            <li> I received a tin of this a few years back for Christmas. It does wonders on chapped lips and hands, especially in the winter.  I have also battled with facial dandruff for a few years and could not get rid of it.  This cured that too.  I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Best thing out there! Gets rid of the WORST chapped lips (antibiotic ointment doesn&#x27;t compare), and every cut, scrape or irritation externally you have! THis product used to be a medicinal ointment sold way &amp;#34;Back when&amp;#34; at drug stores, but now comes with a very she-she price tab and only found in other specialty stores, but it is worth every penny and last for years. Very thick concentrated product but only a little goes a long way. YOU MUST ORDER THIS ORIGINAL because the scented products (and the tubes) disappoint - not the same consistency. I have used this for years and turned many friends and family onto it as well. My three boys come to me frequently asking for the &amp;#34;Rosebud&amp;#34; if they can&#x27;t find it  ,which is amazing because I keep tins ALL over my home! makeup drawer (killer on those little lip lines if you use this before bed!) kitchen drawer, nightstand, purse.... If you don&#x27;t try this you are missing out on a great product. I think I will smear a thin coat on my crows feet around my eyes and see how it works! And don&#x27;t forget those awful chapped hands or burns!!!!!!!!!!! I was thrilled to find the multi-pak sets sold on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing lip salve EVER!  I use it all the time on my lips, cuticles, hands, under eyes.  It&#x27;s awesome.  I&#x27;ll be ordering it for life.  The scent is light but rosey - not overwhelming or old ladyish at all.  The consistency is light but effective - a little thinner than vaseline and not sticky at all.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> Every time I go visit her (yearly) in her Country she requests that bring some of this Salve with me.  She LOVES it and is hooked.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> smells good. nice to apply on lips. also can be used as hand cream. small size is good for carrying.</li>
            <li> This salve is exquisite!  The most luxurious lip balm, moistens your lips without false flavor or scent.  Perfection!  It&#x27;s also wonderful for cuticles, and any other dry areas on your skin.  I even like using it on my eyelids sometimes, just for shine!  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Talk about finding an old friend!  I am 77 years old and sold this very same Rosebud Salve (albeit a much larger tin) when I was about 8 or 9 years old for 50 cents.  It was a cure all as my Mama used to say and I am proud to say that Rosebud is now sitting in my medicine cabinet waiting to be used.  I got some extra to give my grandchildren, who think they know all the answers to everything!</li>
            <li> I love the smell! It is not only smooth on chapped lips, also works on the dry parts of my skin. I recommend it to all the people in my family.</li>
            <li> Have been using Rosebud Salve for years now.&lt;br /&gt;heals everything, only place we were able to find this was in NM&lt;br /&gt;when visiting family.&lt;br /&gt;much better to get it shipped to the house ;-)</li>
            <li> Been using this product for decades. It is great for irritation and wind burn.</li>
            <li> This is SUCH nice lip balm--feels good on hands, too. It has a slight rose scent that is super subtle (no taste) and a creamy texture. Feels great and protects lips from chapping over night. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to give testimonials for anything, but this is the best stuff in the world.  For chapped lips, dry cuticles, cuts and scrapes, blemishes, dry skin, and a whole slew of other things, Rosebud is my jam.  Two (minor) qualms: (1) The tin can get messy when it&#x27;s hot outside; and (2) It&#x27;s really hard to find outside of Urban Outfitters!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Delivered in a cleanly wrapped package. Items were as described. Life saver for my wife&#x27;s dry lips. totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> i just love me some rose bud ...i would recommend it to everyone...its a GREAT product...it has so many uses</li>
            <li> Love it.  Ordered extra and gifted to my friends.</li>
            <li> A little overrated. I have a moderate (but ongoing) lip picking problem and hoped this would help. Like that it has minimal ingredients, and the container, but nothing special really and didn&#x27;t help my lips more than any other product of this sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t put this around your eyes! My eyelids were abnormally dry from allergies, so I thought applying this would help. Woke up with super puffy skin around my eyes. Tried plain petroleum jelly a week later and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I have very sensitive skin and I tend to lick my lips more than your average bear. I need to use a product that I am not allergic to, that works well and that is not waxy. I suffer from chapped lips all-year-round and this is the only product that works for me. Occasionally I will get detergent burn (really sensitive skin) on my hands and Rosebud will save the day. It is silky and has a light scent. It works!!</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm ever! I stopped using Chapstick about 2 years ago and began using ONLY Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve. I no longer have to constantly reapply lip balm. My son had terrible, chapped lips this winter and nothing he tried was helping. I gave him a tin of this. He would only use it at night, but it healed his chapped lips! Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Best salve next to sliced bread(I don&#x27;t think it compares I just like that saying) I am so glad I could order thru Amazon. It is good for everything!!!</li>
            <li> This product is good for whatever ails you. I am really impressed with it. I use it in my dry nose. Yuck-I know!</li>
            <li> Love it, use as lip balm</li>
            <li> wife loves this salve. She says its great. Used it for years. Use it on every thing. give it a 5 star rating</li>
            <li> My grandmother first gave me this as a child and now decades later I am still buying it for myself and younger generations too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years...lips, nails, etc.  Just love I!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Best price is here on Amazon</li>
            <li> We love these things!  Way better than any &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; style lip balm.  Perfect consistency -- thick enough not to come off easily, but greasy enough to really coat your lips and protect them.  Like a better version of Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I have bought and used this salve before.  I typically use as a lip balm and it goes great on top of lipstick.  I keep one with me at all times.  Great for dry/chapped lips and is not tacky like a gloss.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It arrived, well-packaged, as described and on time.</li>
            <li> My 90 year old mother had been looking for RoseBud salve for a long time.  Her mother used to use it. This is some good stuff!!  Glad we could find it for her..  Ty</li>
            <li> This salve has a fine texture and goes on smoothly.  I also love the delicate, soft scent. My only complaint is the tin it comes in, which can be difficult to open</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.  It stays on for a long time, much better than any other I used.  I have to use chapstick daily which just did not last or keep my lips moist.  I also love the little container.  It is retro and very cute.  I bought four and gave them out to my friends as I was very impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff smells lovely--a light rose scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering and that fades relatively quickly.  It goes on light and smooth, and it feels like a nice little indulgence.  It also works wonderfully as a hand and skin balm.  Just rub it into dry skin on the backs of your hands or elbows or wherever, and it absorbs quickly and leaves skin smooth, moisturized, and protected.  I&#x27;ve also found that it helps with chafed or irritated skin too.  Slather on a dollop, and irritated skin is healed overnight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes a great little gift for friends and family.  It&#x27;s the sort of thing that everyone can find a use for.</li>
            <li> 1 container was badly damaged and 1 other was slight dented and hard to remove the lid. i do love the product but bought them gifts so was 2 short./.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed as could  not  use any  of them for gifts and had to buy all new gifts.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that really works to heal.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Best for winter skin and summer sun damage</li>
            <li> Hot spots develop on my skin that I&#x27;ve not been able to get rid of except by using Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve.  My wife had some that she used on me after I&#x27;d tried a number of ointments that did not work including cortizone cream, camphor, benadryl, and anti bacterial cream.  Can&#x27;t say that it works for all skin rash but it did for whatever it is that I had.</li>
            <li> Someone told us about these and they are really really good! This is not very sticky, smells good and gets absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law has used this religiously for most of her life. She uses it on everything...chapped hands and lips to diaper rash. She hasn&#x27;t been able to find it so we ordered it for her. I even use it now and it&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and looked forever to find some its the best!!!! My grandma used this for everything. Try it on chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fourth generation (and my kids are fifth) of our family who ADORE Rosebud salve!  In fact, my 84-year-old grandfather still gets his hand-written order filled directly by Smith&#x27;s.  We&#x27;ve used it for everything from lips to cuts to chapped hands, and it always delivers.  I won&#x27;t go to sleep without my Rosebud salve to keep my lips soft all night, and I never wake up with dry, chapped lips.  Amazon&#x27;s prices are VERY good, especially since Hollywood recently discovered this amazing product so now everyone&#x27;s jacking up the price...  There&#x27;s NO comparison to 99-cent lip balms, not even in the same ball park!  Spend a little extra for time-proven quality and value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SO happy to see another generation discovering the wonder that is Rosebud salve!!</li>
            <li> its nice product, if you can open the container every time you want to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal on metal is just a little tight - and I bought the 4 pack - all tins are the same....  please redesign so those of us with weak or slippy fingers can get the darn thing open!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered these! They make great gifts, and are so versatile! I use it on my lips every night, and on dry skin or cuticles when ever I need extra moisture. It arrived perfectly packaged.</li>
            <li> Item as described, delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> Feel wonderful on your lips.  I put my lipstick on and this over it.</li>
            <li> wonderful light scet, very soothing</li>
            <li> I sold this for 25 cents a tin over 60 years ago. Bought it four  or eight at a time and when all was sold I claimed a prize for selling. I still have a silver intial ring I collected as a prize</li>
            <li> Texture is perfect, not sticky. Lips look healthy, not &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34;. Good quality, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this I&#x27;ve used it for at least 50 years+.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you have not tried this you are missing out. It heals cracked and dry hands, terrible cuticles, blemishes (just try it), cuts, chapped lips, and even healed a cut on my dog&#x27;s ear. One tin lasts forever, and you will find so many uses for it.  I have them everywhere; in my bathroom, room, and purse.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff!  This is the only thing that gets my whole family through the rough NE Ohio winters.</li>
            <li> I love this salve, it&#x27;s amazing. The product was a very good price and arrived in perfect condition before expected. I am very happy with this salve.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this salve.  My Grandma used it on everything when I was a child.  My mother had a little left when she recently had shingles and used it on them.  The doctor said he didn&#x27;t know what it was but to keep using it as it was doing a good job in clearing up the shingles.  That&#x27;s when I turned to  Amazon to look to see if it was still available.</li>
            <li> Tin is near impossible to open!</li>
            <li> Oh the smell takes me back to my childhood!</li>
            <li> I found Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve at a local store.  It is great for dry lips, and really keeps lips comfortable and in shape if one does not want to wear lipstick.  I was told that it originated as a salve for burn victims, and greatly improves their recovery from severe burns.  I use it all of the time, over the last two years.  I was happy to find it on Amazon with my Prime membership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judith S.</li>
            <li> I love this rosebud salve! I used it as a little girl and it&#x27;s still the exact same. My grandmother, mother, and sister were so excited when I gave them each a tin.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s just okay. Not so good as I thought. The flavor is a little bit artificial.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands, and I find this to be a great softening balm. It doesn&#x27;t contain water, so it&#x27;s not a cream or a lotion. I think it&#x27;s most beneficial after a shower or hand wash,to seal in the water. I like the scent, but my daughter commented that it smells like baby powder, or rosy diapers. I disagree, but it does have a good amount of powder smell to it, so beware if you hate the smell of baby powder. I like that it feels softening, but not greasy. It had a few weird ingredients that I couldn&#x27;t identify, but overall, I think it&#x27;s very versatile. I use it in my lips occasionally, and it has no taste, despite the heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this rosebud salve. I bought a tub for friends and family for Christmas. it is so much moisturizing makes your lips feel so soft it feels good t on your cuticles too. This product is great for sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it!!</li>
            <li> My grandmother turned me on to this stuff over 45 years ago.  She used to order it directly from the company and used it on everything.  It is a miracle salve.  It is definitely my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; lip goo.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Has a nice, yet light, rose smell that isn&#x27;t offensive.  Keeps my lips moist and soothed for hours.  I&#x27;ve used stuff that only seems to last a few minutes, but this stuff keeps going.  I am still on my first tin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rosebud - the original one - as long as I can remember and can&#x27;t find anything better or even equal to Rosebud.</li>
            <li> Well I learned about it in the 1960&#x27;s when I used to sell it for 50 cent&#x27;s for an 8oz tin. They haven&#x27;t changed a thing the last 100yrs. My 83 year old aunt sold it as a child an in-turn got a 22 cal rifle I think they thought she was a boy,but in any case it&#x27;s a true story. I love it. They make different types now,but the original is the best. They make a strawberry that I like also. It can be found at amazon.com.You can get 4 for 20 bucks no shipping,but i am a prime member,so prices may vary.</li>
            <li> I read about this in a magazine some time ago.  I love this stuff!  Good for lips and sore noses when I have a cold.</li>
