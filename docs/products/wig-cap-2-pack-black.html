            <li>Wish I had known it was so snug fitting.</li>
            <li>so i guess they are okay.</li>
            <li>Thank you :-)</li>
            <li>I tried many time.</li>
            <li>i love it..</li>
            <li>but when I look at it I feel like it is nothing more then a pair of panty hose over my hair.</li>
            <li>perfect snug and fits a larger head</li>
            <li>Was there before time and love the product.</li>
            <li>i love doing business with you guys</li>
            <li>Nothing more</li>
            <li>pulled most of the hair out of my wig</li>
            <li>and cheap too!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good product, though it really depends on what kind of wig cap</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Like imagine a sock that you cut out the top and bottom of.</li>
            <li>I guess if you wanted a net...was okay.</li>
            <li>Been using for 3 weeks now and it was been very useful to me!</li>
            <li>As long as you dont let your dog chew on them, they&#x27;re perfect!</li>
            <li>Which is fine because I think it works better.</li>
            <li>Good product, delivers was fast, I received it like in two weeks.</li>
            <li>great wig cap, solid, very comfortable.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to just Google how to do it.</li>
            <li>it slipped off easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and wash.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried it with my wig yet but it looks good and it fit my head.</li>
            <li>These tore quite easily, and they don&#x27;t fit all.</li>
            <li>it works fine</li>
            <li>Super soft and stretchy and stays on great.</li>
            <li>but it didnt fit.</li>
            <li>My friend texted me about these saying they were on sale with free shipping</li>
            <li>didnt really fit on my head</li>
            <li>They stretch to fit the head and do not rip or run .  </li>
            <li>Snug and secure.  </li>
            <li>it seems to fit my head</li>
            <li>fit well</li>
            <li>They fit well and STAY PUT when i&#x27;m wearing my wigs.</li>
            <li>they fit very nice and could even fit my friend (who has a smaller head)</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!!</li>
            <li>This wig is very useful to me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too much experience with wig caps, but this is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Really helped with my wigs and probably the best wig caps I&#x27;ve used in a long time!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited</li>
            <li>not disappointed it does what its intended to do</li>
            <li>The tighter head band keeps in from sliding around to much and the more elastic area can keep all of my hair up and out of the way.</li>
            <li>nice and soft.</li>
            <li>but there a whole in the top which it says nothing about in the description.</li>
            <li>Fits my head comfortably and it&#x27;s the right color.</li>
            <li>These fit nicely onto my head, and they definitely are easier to use, (for me anyway), compared to wig caps that have a fishnet design.</li>
            <li>the price was much cheaper than at a wig shop in my area and the caps are a comfortable fit</li>
            <li>they fits very well easy</li>
            <li>for Gem City Comic Con, but they came March 31st (two weeks after I ordered them)!</li>
            <li>It feels abit to tight but great for those with alot of hair</li>
            <li>it doesnt fit on my head very well and it slides off</li>
            <li>All in all the price wins out.</li>
            <li>For the price they were great, I even used on to tame a friends dreads and keep them in place.</li>
            <li>so I bought them right away</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually really comfy!</li>
            <li>These stay in place more than the net ones.</li>
            <li>it was exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get it report more later on this ;))</li>
            <li>Really needed these and thank you!</li>
            <li>(blonde) because it was easily seen underneathe.</li>
            <li>wig cap fits up to large head.i like this product, have ordered this product</li>
            <li>I have a large head and it holds well.</li>
            <li>They slide on my head, and they simply just don&#x27;t fit me.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t work very well for me as a wig cap.</li>
            <li>now everyone wants one..</li>
            <li>Its the same quality you would expect for wig caps this cheap.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really stretchy and cover a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>Very comfy and doesn&#x27;t pull on your head or hair.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell you why.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to them.</li>
            <li>also not that very flexible.</li>
            <li>I am actually wearing this right now~!</li>
            <li>I like to say I have a larger than average head, and these absolutely don&#x27;t fit, and they tear quite easily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>and the black was great with a black wig .</li>
            <li>My head doesnt fit, lol :(</li>
            <li>It arrived and fit as expected</li>
            <li>Bought this so a cheap halloween wig would stop slipping off.</li>
            <li>The cap is a bit big for me, but it worth what i paid.</li>
            <li>Barely fits on the top of my head with my hair down.</li>
            <li>They held them down just fine.</li>
            <li>They fit a bit tight but it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li>These fit my head snuggly and not too tight to give me a headache</li>
            <li>So far the cops have not come knocking on my door.</li>
            <li>I ordered it early March</li>
            <li>stretches well, doesn&#x27;t go back to being tight very quickly though.</li>
            <li>Another thing to point out too, is that because my head is a little larger than most, it&#x27;s stretches enough for it to not cause me a headache after 20 minutes of wear.</li>
            <li>It compresses my long hair, and fits really well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like them, they stretched out awfully fast.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected when I ordered them.</li>
            <li>I was afraid they would be too small, but they fit comfortably and don&#x27;t slip!</li>

            <li> They held them down just fine.</li>
            <li> They fit a bit tight but it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> These fit my head snuggly and not too tight to give me a headache</li>
            <li> So far the cops have not come knocking on my door.</li>
            <li> I ordered it early March</li>
            <li> stretches well, doesn&#x27;t go back to being tight very quickly though.</li>
            <li> Another thing to point out too, is that because my head is a little larger than most, it&#x27;s stretches enough for it to not cause me a headache after 20 minutes of wear.</li>
            <li> It compresses my long hair, and fits really well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them, they stretched out awfully fast.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected when I ordered them.</li>
            <li> I was afraid they would be too small, but they fit comfortably and don&#x27;t slip!</li>
            <li> Took way too long for something so simple and I no longer need it...</li>
            <li> A little small, not bad though.</li>
            <li> Not too tight for me, only problem I really have with it so far is that it&#x27;s hard to figure out how to get it on..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far from my expectations, completely useless, doesn&#x27;t fit my head and a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I only left two stars due to this...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality its ok...will work for averege long hair.</li>
            <li> Long shipping time, though.</li>
            <li> It does not make sense to tell a consumer that they have a choice in color when they clearly do not.  </li>
            <li> Not for very long hair dough..satified with product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are soft and comfortable and don&#x27;t squeeze your head painfully in any way.</li>
            <li> Received the product on time but it was a single wig cap not a 2 pack.</li>
            <li> Only down fall, I&#x27;m going to dye it the color of the wig I purchase</li>
            <li> Hopefully on the next order I&#x27;ll be sent the black caps as ordered.</li>
            <li> , however I got the picture: Black, sheer, and it fits like a glove (and my head it a little bigger than the one size fits all).</li>
            <li> A little big</li>
            <li> It was nicer then i expected..</li>
            <li> The caps shipped out on the expected date.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not too thin and the elastic band stays in place very well.</li>
            <li> Does the job as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, I didn&#x27;t buy it to wear a wig, I bought it to slick my hair back and &amp;quot;train&amp;quot; my hair to stay down.</li>
            <li> They are durable but since they are a pantyhose material they are also subject to getting &#x27;runs&#x27; I wouldn&#x27;t over stretch them and beware of  long fingernails.</li>
            <li> The only complaint was I was sent blonde color caps instead of black.</li>
            <li> See some other reviews</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re quite firm and keep my long hair in check always, and they&#x27;ve lasted me couple years now.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you got these in a package labeled &amp;#34;phone accessories,&amp;#34; and got really nervous that they sent the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no netting, its just literally a cap which does no justice for keeping hair down.</li>
            <li> Wouldnt stay on my head even after I tied, and pinned down my hair.</li>
            <li> Came with two, took a week and a half to get to me</li>
            <li> Although however I got beige instead of black that I had ordered.</li>
            <li> I ordered the cap in black and they sent it in nude.  </li>
            <li> The net wig cap that came with my wigs kept getting caught on the little clips used to adjust the wig, which resulted in the net of the cap tearing and my hair falling out, which was very frustrating, but that is NOT A PROBLEM with these wig caps.</li>
            <li> Cap is WAY too tight.</li>
            <li> The caps are too air tight.</li>
            <li> Little tight but functional.</li>
            <li> a little bit to get used to since I don&#x27;t wear wigs often.</li>
            <li> not comfortable.</li>
            <li> The wig caps came in a few days</li>
            <li> Holds wigs firmly in place.</li>
            <li> Waste.</li>
            <li> The cap is rather small and really tight on the head.</li>
            <li> I tried to wear it and when I took it off my hair was a mess!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to tight and is itchy!</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I wear them for a while I usually ball them up so they don&#x27;t stretch out.</li>
            <li> size too small ..size for toddlers</li>
            <li> They work but are small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> but after a while of using it it does tend to lose its hold :/</li>
            <li> The wig caps are a bit small on my head, But they are fine.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Also hard to bundle the hair in these type, but for this price, won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This is a helpful wig cap because I have gotten into wearing wigs lately.</li>
            <li> The cap sucks.</li>
            <li> and there I do not see any problem with it, or at least not yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this a 4/5</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and I have to use 3-4 of these to keep my hair and a wig in place.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> Just really slow mailing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a small sock!</li>
            <li> So buy it, if you know what I mean?</li>
            <li> It not good me.</li>
            <li> So sorry I purchased the product, did not fit my head and would not stay in place when trying to put the wig on.</li>
            <li> a bit too thin, though.</li>
            <li> and they said they got the wrong color or something else that went wrong</li>
            <li> the one I recived was useless to me</li>
            <li> wtf is this 😑</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t never go wrong with a wig cap.</li>
            <li> These were very thin.</li>
            <li> ill save you 30+ days of waiting and a couple bucks with some disappointment.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re not in desperate need I don&#x27;t suggest them, but if you need something to work, these should do it.</li>
            <li> I must say I&#x60;m rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I got these 3 weeks after I needed them</li>
            <li> This was not what I ordered and I was very disappointed in the color they did send.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They fit a bit tight but it&#x27;s supposed to, it&#x27;s a wig cap. Totally awesome overall. Super soft and stretchy and stays on great. Love these will use them for my jade Harley cosplay c:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually really comfy! Not too tight for me, only problem I really have with it so far is that it&#x27;s hard to figure out how to get it on.. But it&#x27;s easy to just Google how to do it.</li>
            <li> Really helped with my wigs and probably the best wig caps I&#x27;ve used in a long time!</li>
            <li> Fits my head comfortably and it&#x27;s the right color. See some other reviews and they said they got the wrong color or something else that went wrong, however I got the picture: Black, sheer, and it fits like a glove (and my head it a little bigger than the one size fits all). Another thing to point out too, is that because my head is a little larger than most, it&#x27;s stretches enough for it to not cause me a headache after 20 minutes of wear. It&#x27;s perfect for me. :)</li>
            <li> Order this and received something else instead.</li>
            <li> It arrived and fit as expected</li>
            <li> i dont have a big head or anything but it didnt fit. its meant for like a doll or a child..</li>
            <li> I am actually wearing this right now~! I would definitely buy this again because it does the job perfectly. It compresses my long hair, and fits really well.</li>
            <li> Cap is WAY too tight. Wish I had known it was so snug fitting.</li>
            <li> It fits and was cheep</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far from my expectations, completely useless, doesn&#x27;t fit my head and a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good product, delivers was fast, I received it like in two weeks.</li>
            <li> These were very thin. They did the job and they didnt rip so i guess they are okay.</li>
            <li> These tore quite easily, and they don&#x27;t fit all. They slide on my head, and they simply just don&#x27;t fit me. I like to say I have a larger than average head, and these absolutely don&#x27;t fit, and they tear quite easily. I use Bobby pins to keep my hair in place under my wig cap, and the wig cap just ripped apart.</li>
            <li> A little big but it did the job.</li>
            <li> Too small. Good thing i only paid $1.57</li>
            <li> I recived a fish net style wig cap I was exoecting a stocking style one , the one I recived was useless to me</li>
            <li> Their the perfect size for anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wear them for a while I usually ball them up so they don&#x27;t stretch out.</li>
            <li> Product was not received as promised.  Had found product at Sallys for a lessor cost.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My friend texted me about these saying they were on sale with free shipping and I was so excited so I bought them right away and they did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too much experience with wig caps, but this is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Product (wig cap) was as I ordered and I am very pleased with it. Also, package came from China and to my surprise the mailing included a red braided, w/beads friendship bracelet. Very, very cute. Thank you :-)</li>
            <li> didnt really fit on my head</li>
            <li> size too small ..size for toddlers 2 years of age and it does not stay on your head.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I got these 3 weeks after I needed them and I ordered them in plenty of time. I ordered them at the same time I ordered the wigs and I had the wigs well in advance of the event.</li>
            <li> TOO BIG AND DOES NOT STAY WELL</li>
            <li> Im fascinated with my wigcap! I never used it before, but after I tried it I will never use a wig without it!&lt;br /&gt;It helps you save a lot of time and hassle!</li>
            <li> This is a helpful wig cap because I have gotten into wearing wigs lately.</li>
            <li> These fit nicely onto my head, and they definitely are easier to use, (for me anyway), compared to wig caps that have a fishnet design.</li>
            <li> I bought a wig and the caps on the same day, but this arrives earlier. The cap is a bit big for me, but it worth what i paid.</li>
            <li> great wig cap, solid, very comfortable. wig cap fits up to large head.i like this product, have ordered this product</li>
            <li> worked great, and super cheap</li>
            <li> stretches well, doesn&#x27;t go back to being tight very quickly though. Also hard to bundle the hair in these type, but for this price, won&#x27;t complain. Came with two, took a week and a half to get to me</li>
            <li> They are very nice and true to picture. The only complaint was I was sent blonde color caps instead of black. Hopefully on the next order I&#x27;ll be sent the black caps as ordered.</li>
            <li> It not good me. Because slid on my hair and wigs can&#x27;t struck on it. I tried many time.I had no idea.</li>
            <li> These are well made and perfect for the price.  They stretch to fit the head and do not rip or run .  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> took FOREVER to get delivered. found uot it was coming from china and now im wondering if its laced with lead. ill save you 30+ days of waiting and a couple bucks with some disappointment. goto the store and buy a nylon sock because thats basiclly what this is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost both of them already</li>
            <li> I have received the item</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you got these in a package labeled &amp;#34;phone accessories,&amp;#34; and got really nervous that they sent the wrong thing. But if you open the bag and pull them apart, it is the caps c: I was afraid they would be too small, but they fit comfortably and don&#x27;t slip! They weren&#x27;t supposed to be here until April 11-29th and I needed them the 5&amp;6th for Gem City Comic Con, but they came March 31st (two weeks after I ordered them)! Definitely will buy again. Perfect for Karkat!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work very well for me as a wig cap. My hair is extremely thick and I have to use 3-4 of these to keep my hair and a wig in place. Mostly,I use these when I am on the motorcycle; they keep me from getting helmet hair or wind strewn pony tails. They are durable but since they are a pantyhose material they are also subject to getting &#x27;runs&#x27; I wouldn&#x27;t over stretch them and beware of  long fingernails. All in all the price wins out. I will be buying these again.</li>
            <li> So sorry I purchased the product, did not fit my head and would not stay in place when trying to put the wig on.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried it with my wig yet but it looks good and it fit my head. So I am just gonna give it a 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This item is perfect for when you are going to wear a wig like with costumes or just to wear the wig. It got here way before the deadline.</li>
            <li> They slide off child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wig cap. Although however I got beige instead of black that I had ordered. Which is fine because I think it works better.</li>
            <li> Wearing them around the Crib.,</li>
            <li> It was nicer then i expected.. i love it.. now everyone wants one.. my daughter looked great in it.. and got great compliments..</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and it works but when I look at it I feel like it is nothing more then a pair of panty hose over my hair.</li>
            <li> These stay in place more than the net ones. Very happy with these</li>
            <li> perfect snug and fits a larger head</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and fits</li>
            <li> it doesnt fit on my head very well and it slides off</li>
            <li> The caps are too air tight. does not allow circulation of air to flow and heats up the head. not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very good,  comfortable wig caps.</li>
            <li> Was there before time and love the product.</li>
            <li> will work nice on hair for wig for 50&#x27;s event at church.</li>
            <li> The elastic didnt grip to your head an it slipped off easily. It didnt hold the wig in place and it constantly needed to be readjusted. My hair would constantly fall out the back. Its the same quality you would expect for wig caps this cheap.</li>
            <li> They have a very nice fit. Was worried at first because of how small they were. The tighter head band keeps in from sliding around to much and the more elastic area can keep all of my hair up and out of the way.</li>
            <li> The wig caps came in a few days the price was much cheaper than at a wig shop in my area and the caps are a comfortable fit yes I would recommend these caps</li>
            <li> It does is work! Not for very long hair dough..satified with product.&lt;br /&gt;Quality its ok...will work for averege long hair.</li>
            <li> The caps shipped out on the expected date. They&#x27;re really stretchy and cover a lot of hair. Sometimes they ride up on my head, but it&#x27;s nothing a hair pin can&#x27;t fix. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I order this product because of the price.  I ordered the cap in black and they sent it in nude.  This was not what I ordered and I was very disappointed in the color they did send.  It does not make sense to tell a consumer that they have a choice in color when they clearly do not.  I would not order this product again.</li>
            <li> It only came with one wig cap. It forever to get to my house... but the quality and condition it arrived in was perfect. I wish I would have gotten my second cap though.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping and great price.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with every thing we have gotten from you. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Bought this so a cheap halloween wig would stop slipping off. Very comfy and doesn&#x27;t pull on your head or hair.</li>
            <li> A little small, not bad though.</li>
            <li> nice and soft. Fits like a cap should.  Snug and secure.  Does not pull your own hairs when in use.</li>
            <li> My head doesnt fit, lol :(</li>
            <li> Very nice wig caps. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Held my hair up well enough for my Asuka wig.</li>
            <li> I wear these things under my fitted hats nd they fits very well easy i love doing business with you guys thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a small sock! Nothing more</li>
            <li> 2 for the price of one can&#x27;t be beat!!!</li>
            <li> They work but are small. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again, but they work for now. *sighs* if you&#x27;re not in desperate need I don&#x27;t suggest them, but if you need something to work, these should do it.</li>
            <li> As expected. Holds wigs firmly in place. Long shipping time, though.</li>
            <li> These fit my head snuggly and not too tight to give me a headache</li>
            <li> It came on time and its really great. Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Been using for 3 weeks now and it was been very useful to me! It protects my hair and it fits well.</li>
            <li> I think it worked great. I really can&#x27;t tell you why. Because I would have to kill you all. So far the cops have not come knocking on my door. So it was a steal. And did it&#x27;s job that night. So buy it, if you know what I mean?</li>
            <li> The cap sucks. The cap slides around, and even when putting on the wig, it comes off very easily. There&#x27;s no netting, its just literally a cap which does no justice for keeping hair down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small. Barely fits on the top of my head with my hair down. I think I&#x27;ll rip it if I even try to get my hair underneath it.</li>
            <li> wtf is this 😑 i could&#x27;ve made this myself.</li>
            <li> pulled most of the hair out of my wig</li>
            <li> For the price they were great, I even used on to tame a friends dreads and keep them in place. They held them down just fine.</li>
            <li> It feels abit to tight but great for those with alot of hair</li>
            <li> Little tight but functional.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!! Perfect</li>
            <li> it works fine it seems to fit my head and there I do not see any problem with it, or at least not yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this a 4/5</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be here 2 months ago! I was really looking forward to them. Waste. Of. My. Money.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job what can I say.</li>
            <li> They came before time, and .. im not disappointed it does what its intended to do</li>
            <li> Will serve it&#x27;s purpose well. Not too thin and the elastic band stays in place very well.</li>
            <li> They came within the time frame and fit my head perfectly.</li>
            <li> Just a wig cap. Does the job as expected.</li>
            <li> a bit too thin, though.</li>
            <li> These were perfect! The net wig cap that came with my wigs kept getting caught on the little clips used to adjust the wig, which resulted in the net of the cap tearing and my hair falling out, which was very frustrating, but that is NOT A PROBLEM with these wig caps.</li>
            <li> i find it very nice but after a while of using it it does tend to lose its hold :/</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of wigs for cosplaying reasons, and these wig caps have done me well throughout the years. They&#x27;re quite firm and keep my long hair in check always, and they&#x27;ve lasted me couple years now. Just these 2 will last you throughout your cosplaying life!! (If you don&#x27;t misuse them of course).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine cap that hides one&#x27;s own hair</li>
            <li> they fit very nice and could even fit my friend (who has a smaller head) after i wore it</li>
            <li> it was exactly what i needed. fit well and the black was great with a black wig . and cheap too!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and durable, these are great for my cosplay wigs. Thanks!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t never go wrong with a wig cap.</li>
            <li> thank you for your product and your time</li>
            <li> The product came in well and it was perfectly fine,&lt;br /&gt;just as in the description,&lt;br /&gt;but I found that I prefer the mesh wig caps because they make it a lot easier to tuck in your extra strands of hair and such.&lt;br /&gt;overall, it&#x27;s a good product, though it really depends on what kind of wig cap you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;They are soft and comfortable and don&#x27;t squeeze your head painfully in any way.</li>
            <li> Fits my head perfectly. I also use as a weave net under my sew ins. Great Price.2 for 1.</li>
            <li> Was going to try a weave or wig, impulse order, Mid-age crisis Ha ha.</li>
            <li> The band holds hair in place so that the wig stays set.</li>
            <li> It works okay but there a whole in the top which it says nothing about in the description.</li>
            <li> Received the product on time but it was a single wig cap not a 2 pack. Is a good quality very strong and durable. Easy to use and wash.</li>
            <li> I feel these are quite slippery</li>
            <li> This wig is very useful to me. I have a large head and it holds well. I am very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected when I ordered them. They fit well and STAY PUT when i&#x27;m wearing my wigs.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get it report more later on this ;))</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, I didn&#x27;t buy it to wear a wig, I bought it to slick my hair back and &amp;quot;train&amp;quot; my hair to stay down. It&#x27;s to tight and is itchy! I tried to wear it and when I took it off my hair was a mess! It doesn&#x27;t work like a regular hair trainer stocking cap for me. I had to go back to the T-shirt factory to buy what works.....</li>
            <li> The wig caps are a bit small on my head, But they are fine.&lt;br /&gt;Its also not that very flexible.</li>
            <li> Its a sock for your head, what do you want to know?</li>
            <li> Over all great product</li>
            <li> I love these! They are washable and perfect xD</li>
            <li> it arrived a week before it said it would. But despite it being a package of 2 only 1 arrived. The cap is rather small and really tight on the head. I must say I&#x60;m rather disappointed. But it does hold hair back quite well.</li>
            <li> Basic cap no complaints</li>
            <li> Essentially just panty hose. I didn&#x27;t like them, they stretched out awfully fast.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Took way too long for something so simple and I no longer need it...</li>
            <li> Fits VERY COMFORTABLY.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great Quality Product!</li>
            <li> As long as you dont let your dog chew on them, they&#x27;re perfect! And if you do, they still work. 10/10 on durability.</li>
            <li> No problem with the purchase. Just really slow mailing. I ordered it early March and I got it April 16.</li>
            <li> Served it&#x27;s purpose well.</li>
            <li> In the photo ( I know you shouldn&#x27;t focus on it) I assumed what I would get would be a sheer cap...and I got a net. Like imagine a sock that you cut out the top and bottom of. That&#x27;s what I received. I only left two stars due to this...however the product itself...I guess if you wanted a net...was okay.</li>
            <li> Wouldnt stay on my head even after I tied, and pinned down my hair.</li>
            <li> Did it&#x27;s job perfectly. Only down fall, I&#x27;m going to dye it the color of the wig I purchase (blonde) because it was easily seen underneathe. It also was so snug that I had a headache...a little bit to get used to since I don&#x27;t wear wigs often.</li>
            <li> Really needed these and thank you!</li>
            <li> Awesome delivery, Highly recommend !</li>
