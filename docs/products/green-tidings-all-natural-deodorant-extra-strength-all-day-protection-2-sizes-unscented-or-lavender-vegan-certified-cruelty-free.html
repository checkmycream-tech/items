            <li>This is a great product with great customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have experienced after time, for some reason</li>
            <li>I then tried the vinegar mixture before I applied the deodorant and that has greatly helped.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product, have been using for years</li>
            <li>Great product~</li>

            <li>Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li>Another great thing about this product is that it comes in a tube.  </li>

            <li>It feels great not to worry about it anymore.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation.</li>
            <li>This does, its the best, use scented oils to apply your own scent if you wish, just put a drop in the cap overnight.</li>
            <li>Great deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Great product - I&#x27;ve been trying to get my husband to switch from the aluminum based ones</li>

            <li>Great antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>A great deodorant without aluminum.</li>
            <li>Tried it and it works just great.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this unscented version to anyone as a great unisex, non-toxic deodorant.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
            <li>And healthy!!</li>
            <li>So happy I gave this a try, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>The product works amazing!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>

            <li>I have been thrilled with the results!  </li>
            <li>I have been nothing but completly impressed and satisfied with this brand.</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>Great deodorant that&#x27;s good for you.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s not killing me is honestly a bonus!</li>
            <li>But what impressed me the most was one day in the shower</li>
            <li>I love that this deodorant is the best at smell that I have come across!  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.. very effective.  </li>
            <li>The lavender smell is pleasant and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The best part is there is almost no BO even after a full day of use - even after sweating!  </li>
            <li>Its easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothing, and best of all it lasts ALL day!</li>
            <li>Works great and is perfect to use while pregnant or nursing.</li>
            <li>, I am doing good things for my body</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s good for you an the environment.</li>
            <li>This is a GOOD thing.  </li>
            <li>The baking soda gives it a pasty texture (in a good way) rather than being sticky and gel-like.</li>
            <li>it is that good..</li>
            <li>I am thankful the search for a GOOD</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>This is just a good.</li>
            <li>and after read the good reviews on amazon on this product and figured i would give it a try</li>
            <li>Excellent, won&#x27;t kill you with toxic chemicals while keeping you free of smell.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>Your not supposed to use it after shaving, but what good is a deodorant if you can&#x27;t use it after you shower and shave.  </li>
            <li>I feel good about using it.</li>
            <li>The Good:  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel good or work too well.</li>
            <li>and I saw this deodorant had good reviews on Amazon, so I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I feel good knowing</li>
            <li>However, that&#x27;s where the good stops.</li>
            <li>Now after 2 weeks I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never smelled better!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look impressive, it has no scent, but it is effective, neat, and easily applied.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and not bad for you like the store brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels great (firm/soft), it applies great (smooth)</li>
            <li>and it works wonderfully even when I&#x27;m under pressure when it&#x27;s very hot</li>
            <li>It would be great if they had more options than unscented and lavender (preferably something manly).</li>
            <li>Best protection from odor, in a natural product, I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, stays on all day best natural roll on</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>I was sweating more than I do with out it!</li>
            <li>I had a sample size of the unscented, and used it in the summertime -- the best time to really give it a go!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this!  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed and interested to see how it holds up to my sweat in the summer.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome - no scent, and no weird sweating.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>100% recommended, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>I love this deodrant!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>LOVE that it includes magnesium oil!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>So glad I discovered this product!</li>
            <li>and i am so glad i did!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and will be recommending it to everyone!</li>
            <li>At first I was very happy to receive this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this deoderant!</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot and this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Seriously amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing .  </li>
            <li>and this stuff is amazing..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This one feels amazing.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is amazing.</li>
            <li>No residue or any kind of irritation on skin.</li>
            <li>My wife tried it and liked it, also; we will be ordering some of the lavender-scented for her.</li>
            <li>Effective as a deoderant.  </li>
            <li>I have been loving this Deodorant.  </li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t an anti-perspirant, it is an effective deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Do they want honest opinions from the clients who purchase their products?</li>
            <li>I sat in a non-air conditioned auditorium for two hours sweating to death and came out smelling like a rose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s some kind of miracle formula.</li>
            <li>and I think that may be what makes it so effective for me</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll be honest, I can&#x27;t work up a good odor, even more popular deodorants couldn&#x27;t help me, but this does the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the best deodorant that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s as effective as Mitchum.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can skip a day and don&#x27;t notice any smell.</li>
            <li>I really liked this as an alternative to aluminum containing antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>Best all natural deodorant yet!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, including 10 days on vacation where I did a fair amount of hiking (putting it to a good test!), and found it to be perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed and very glad I did!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed and would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>This is the best all natural deodorant I have tried, and trust me, I have tried MANY!</li>
            <li>I use the unscented variety and it is impressive that is succeeds without simply masking scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using a very strong deodorant with aluminum.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deoderant out there!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a perfect natural deodorant for years!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t apply very smoothly; the texture is kind of grippy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>By far the best deodorant I have purchased and continued to used!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to find a product that works so well and is so healthy .  </li>
            <li>This is the most effective deodorant that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Excellent because it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Excellent natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is by far is the best deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>and honestly I think it&#x27;s much better for my body to get those toxins out and not keep them inside of me.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best all-natural deodorant on the market.  </li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I have ever tried</li>
            <li>This is the best one we have tried so far.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have tried so far</li>
            <li>I had been using Arm &amp; Hammer essentials for a year or so,  but was looking for something more effective.  </li>
            <li>So I am one happy customer and it is worth every penny because I truly have a piece of mind knowing that even though I sweating there is no odor.</li>
            <li>The best all natural product on the market.</li>
            <li>I have experienced some irritation, I&#x27;m trying not to shave right before applying it to see if that eliminates the rash.  </li>
            <li>The great thing with this is that it doesn&#x27;t overdry the skin around my armpits, washes right off when I&#x27;m taking a shower</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural deodorants in search of the best one.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased with this deodorant in that I did not sweat at all and was even able to wear tops more than once -- I&#x27;ve NEVER been able to do that!</li>
            <li>As for the customer service, the mechanism on my first tube was damaged, and I had to manually push the product up, which didn&#x27;t work out that great.  </li>
            <li>This is true happiness for me</li>
            <li>It was not painful, but I cannot believe the product was good for me if it caused that severe of a burn.</li>
            <li>So thrilled to find an all natural deodorant that works beautifully as well as contributing to a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, unpolluted lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Very kind and willing to work with me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the second best thing I have found as antiperspirant alternative.</li>
            <li>She is so pleased with the product that I just reordered and will continue to do so.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also way better than at home remedies.</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple different all-natural deodorants, and this is the best one.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I also get allergic to so many products, organic or not</li>
            <li>Thanks for having  a great product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this deodorant</li>
            <li>I purchased the unscented and love it.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>so I cannot say that this will be safe for everyone</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 4 stars, mostly because of my body type, is that the coconut oil can cause a reaction after shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>I do like the lavender one better then the unscented</li>
            <li>This deodorant feels light and doesn&#x27;t have me smelling ripe even after 2 days!</li>
            <li>luck! :)</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>, I imagine most people won&#x27;t have to deal with this.</li>
            <li>it is not an antiperspirant  but that is ok.</li>
            <li>i mostly wanted to odor control without chemicals</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Ordered one more for my teenager son.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes unscented.</li>
            <li>I have used many others, Tom&#x27;s etc.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I also love that it truly is unscented,</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>this one is definitely the best!!!</li>
            <li>With that all said, I will continue to use this product and tell as many people as I can to use it also.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I like this more than the lavender scented one.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>I also love the texture.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to suggest to the sellers to roduce in 2 pack for a better value.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I also feel muh better about breastfeeding</li>
            <li>I will have to wait until it gets a bit hotter before I am totally sure that it works well.</li>
            <li>After three weeks I am totally satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>this deodorant able to keep up with that and no stinky armpits anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Will definately be buying more, and the lavender scent&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s in a roll-out stick...</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t bother me any more.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you don&#x27;t perspire a lot, it would be OK.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it works for me all day.</li>
            <li>you will have me buying stock! :-)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go more than a day without reapplying</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend you try to go without a shower and then apply on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten rashes or irritation from many, but not this one.</li>
            <li>Exceeded my expectations and worked magically.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I prefer the unscented over the lavender as I feel the lavender smells more musky (more of what I would expect a man to smell like).</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>okay, but let some bits of odor through.</li>
            <li>I used to wear Dove or Sure antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to avoid the aluminum exposure now, too.</li>
            <li>I have tried many deodorants, but I have never had a burn.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I tried.</li>
            <li>Ordering more.</li>
            <li>but I love it now.</li>
            <li>I have tried many &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; deodorants because I know they are healthier.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t just walk around sticky, stinking like rotten onions and staining all of my bras and shirts for a week in hopes that it will magically start working the way it should.  </li>
            <li>much more than counterparts.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is okay, but my skin did NOT like it.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product that works very well.</li>
            <li>Although the odor is not 100% eliminated, it is very significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly amazed that a natural product can be this effective!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best natural deodorant on the market, and I have tried so many of them!  </li>
            <li>Very clean stuff.</li>
            <li>I was using coconut oil + baking soda, which worked pretty good</li>
            <li>Good product that does exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>The good news is that the lavender isnt overpowering at all, and in fact, I dont notice the smell beyond first application.</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a good natural deodorant for some time and this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>It also does not have any smell which is nice and lasts a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li>So excited!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that a natural product can be so good.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is made with  magnesium oil, among its other awesome ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; chemical free deodorants and none of them have worked at all for me.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what a great product.</li>
            <li>And, most importantly, keeps me from smelling.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is chemical free.</li>
            <li>Great Natural Deodarant.  </li>
            <li>great natural  odorless deodorant in terms of efficacy.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, then this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried assorted natural deodorants, scented and unscented, and wasn&#x27;t happy with any of them.  </li>
            <li>Great to have a natural deodorant that works</li>
            <li>It was surprising how much I sweat.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use that much - sweet!</li>
            <li>Both issues required laundry interventions in HE top loader to achieve 100% success!</li>
            <li>Overall I am a happy camper with this deodorant and will continue to purchase it as long as it keeps working &#x3D;D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied!</li>
            <li>The ingredients are great too because it has Magnesium in it, which is something your body can absorb since many people don&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li>I tried it out like after showering, on a day where I didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere just to be sure I wouldn&#x27;t stink in public lol.</li>
            <li>Sure it costs more, but if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Works great but careful applying when the air is warm.</li>
            <li>Although it does wash out of clothes easily.</li>
            <li>Nothing too strong.</li>
            <li>I have to give this deodorant a strong four stars.</li>
            <li>I have used it every day for nine months and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I used to be a Mitchum girl - you know that deodorant that&#x27;s &amp;#34;so strong</li>
            <li>The baking soda is too strong for my body PH.  </li>
            <li>It smells great (not truly unscented, but still a more neutral smell than the lavender which is way too strong), goes on smoothly, and actually does keep odor away.  </li>
            <li>I am a very healthy, and very hygienic person, I shower once a day, in the summer twice a day.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many natural deodorants and this, by far, is the best!</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural deodorants and this is, by far, the best.</li>
            <li>I, obviously, did my own research, and with the great ratings here on Amazon, it was, definitely, worth a try.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>My skin feels fine</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li>The unscented is just fine.</li>
            <li>Despite both working out and being pregnant, I don&#x27;t ever have body odor under my arms when I use this!</li>
            <li>in fact this is better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve used, ever.... 2 weeks of use and not 1 unpleasant sniff or sticky squirmy slimy underarm feeling.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best natural deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li>By far the best of all the natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s aluminum free, scent free, and keeps me stink free all day and then some.      </li>
            <li>This has been by far the best natural deodorant I have tried</li>
            <li>and I got huge sore bumpy rashes.</li>
            <li>In search of an aluminum free deodorant I tried Burt Bees and this.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say, I finally found the all-natural deodorant works!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased at how fresh it keeps me without the worry of what I&#x27;m smearing on my body.  </li>
            <li>deodorant goes on smooth and does not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I let them know about it - and promptly received an email from Jennifer offering to send me a free replacement (which they did).  </li>
            <li>This is the best product that I use for everyday use and all day deodorant.</li>
            <li>Not that smooth to run under your arms.</li>
            <li>After I swipe, I use my hands to smooth it like a crest.  </li>
            <li>Green Tidings is great!</li>
            <li>Applies smoothly with no clumping or irritation.</li>
            <li>I had initially had an issue with my order but was met with great customer service.</li>
            <li>While I may still sweat some days, this product is fantastic in keeping me odor free.  </li>
            <li>And apply LIGHTLY.  </li>
            <li>so I need unscented, and aluminum free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using something aluminum free</li>
            <li>Fantastic, leaves minimul residue and scent.</li>
            <li>Smooth application area with fingertips to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective and I really like it.</li>
            <li>And my then the oil has absorbed into me or my pj&#x27;s and isn&#x27;t an issue any more.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>Good natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I already told my family members, who have been looking for a good all natural deodorant, about this stuff</li>
            <li>So far so good, been using it for about a week</li>
            <li>This deodorant was a good idea in theory - all natural ingredients, no aluminum.  </li>
            <li>Loved it for awhile but developed a wicked allergy that took months and a RX cream to get rid of.</li>
            <li>and if I dropped it (which seemed to happen frequently it would crack and chip and and jagged edges don&#x27;t feel good under your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Highly Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>This deodorant is the first I have found that works!!  </li>
            <li>Give thanks!!!  </li>
            <li>Super cool!  </li>
            <li>This is the second time I purchase this Deodrant, very effective, doesn&#x27;t stain and no rash, not sure it&#x27;s lasts 24hrs as ad says, but def of if the best I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Works great, keeps me dry all day and smell free.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so excited to use a pit stick.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>I excited tested it on my workout day, after two hours sweating workout in the gym</li>
            <li>and it is worth the price!</li>
            <li>Most feel really sticky and I&#x27;ll start being stinky not even half-way through my day!  </li>
            <li>Or, are they really interested in getting rave reviews to sell more  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price of admission!</li>
            <li>If you buy this product make sure you are not magnesium intolerant or go get your levels checked first, or you will regret it.</li>
            <li>Keeps you fresh all day!</li>
            <li>This item is definitely not the product for me but the customer service was good and I feel overall happy with having given it a try because of that.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>In general, finding a good deodorant has always been a challenge for me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many natural deodorants in the past and they were ok at best .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy I finally found a natural deoderant that works.</li>
            <li>Overall though, I will probably continue to purchase as this is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I refuse to use anything with chemicals and have tried many many natural versions.</li>
            <li>It quickly warms to your body temperature so it goes on fairly smooth.  </li>
            <li>After not being satisfied by the scented natural deodarants I&#x27;ve bought, I opted for the unscented one this time, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried several unscented deodorants and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>I am currently giving my underarms a couple days to get better on their own before calling the Dr.  </li>
            <li>I have a special needs child who cannot have chemicals, ext.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, and I&#x27;ve tried just about ever natural deodorant out there over the years.</li>
            <li>but this unscented deodorant made my skin bright red and inflamed.</li>
            <li>No smell even after a full days work.</li>
            <li>Now that I am convinced this is the deodorant for me, I intend to place an order for a full size in unscented.</li>
            <li>I have tried about 5 or 6 natural deodorants, including making my own.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this deodorant despite the price</li>
            <li>, I decided that many people couldn&#x27;t be promoting a product that didn&#x27;t really work.)</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>It really works better than regular deodorants and it&#x27;s good for you.</li>
            <li>if you can fit it into your budget, I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>So if it isn&#x27;t obvious and doesn&#x27;t smell I&#x27;m good with</li>
            <li>No painful itching or rash.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this unscented version a try because, let&#x27;s face it, the true test of a deo is if it eliminates the odor and not mask it( and</li>
            <li>When I was using the magnesia deodorant, I seemed to sweat under my arms more than ever, to the point where I was frequently very self-conscious of it.</li>
            <li>One more &amp;#34;editorial note&amp;#34; : Please don&#x27;t overlook possibility that modern diet and symptoms of dysbosis (leaky gut) are underlying problematic odor.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this seems to be a natural product without aluminum.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many deodorants and feel I smell, not matter how much I apply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most effective &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a decent amount of them.</li>
            <li>I am completely sold on this product and so happy to be using something natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants but this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Great deodorant, it lasts all day and it&#x27;s gentle on the skin, very moisturizing...will definitely buy from now on &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to create a healthy anti-perspirant as the concept of blocking your sweat glands from being able to secrete what they are designed to do</li>
            <li>Thanks green tidings for an awesome product!</li>
            <li>I am now purchasing my 3rd bottle and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I finally that found a safe product that keeps me from smelling like one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can smell it occasionally throughout the day which is refreshing and better than alternative smells!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad that I have found a natural product!!</li>
            <li>I wore it to the beach one day, and it was very hot.</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased to report that it not only does it not burn or leave flaky residue skin</li>
            <li>I have tried several natural deodorants, but this one is really the best!</li>
            <li>With that in mind, I&#x27;d recommend it to others looking for a suitable natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>but I am hopeful to return to using this again after my post-pregnancy hormones return to normal :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more pricy than more commercial antiperspirants, but the performance is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I teach &amp; take hot yoga &amp; this has not failed me!!</li>
            <li>So far, I love everything about this deodorant, though the true test will be wearing it through the summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really been an easy transition because there has been no transition.  </li>
            <li>Hands down best Natural Deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li>And it held up very well!!</li>
            <li>LOVE this natural deodorant!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>This really works!!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a week, and it does exactly what a deodorant is supposed to do without destroying my skin, and it&#x27;s the absolute best!</li>
            <li>Love that it is natural too!</li>
            <li>Love this natural deodorant!  </li>
            <li>I love that it lasts a while on and is super soft and also does not effect your clothes.</li>
            <li>I have been impressed with this product so far, usually I feel confident applying it once a day, if I work out, I may apply once more for extra caution.</li>
            <li>i am trying to go natural with most things i use daily and am so glad i found this!</li>
            <li>Works great for me and a little goes along way.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a natural deodorant for years, this is the best one I have ever used hands down!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural deodorant out there, and nothing has ever impressed me until Green Tidings.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best all natural deodorant I have found, and I have tried a lot of different brands.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews for Green Tidings I decided to order the unscented since I&#x27;m not one for flowery smells.  </li>
            <li>The Green Tidings company had great customer services as well.</li>
            <li>But I thought I was destined to not smell fresh because of that decision.</li>
            <li>I decided to make the switch from the mainstream aluminum based deodorants to the natural kind recently and stumbled upon this brand and many others alike.</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It contains no harsh or potentially harmful chemicals, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I wish the price was lower but even so, this product is 100% worth it.</li>
            <li>I even was able to work out early in the morning</li>
            <li>, they always seemed to smell more than my natural smell.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and could not use most of the homemade recipes, but have not had a problem with this one at all.</li>
            <li>Really worth the price.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and keeps me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>Initially, I tried making my own then moved to Tom&#x27;s which I did not like.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try to see if it works for your body.</li>
            <li>but I guarantee its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Most natural deodorants cause me to get a rash after I&#x27;ve used them for a week, and I believe it&#x27;s the baking soda, but they work well for odor.  </li>
            <li>I love that this has natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Keeps me smelling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of natural deodorants, spent tons of money, and this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant for many years</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rare to find any product which irritates me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really wanted a natural option that could effectively control the odor.</li>
            <li>plus, I&#x27;m not crazy about lavender scented stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE this natural deoderant and even with the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m FRESH</li>
            <li>One application in the morning followed by a full day of work and hot flow</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still feeling and smelling fresh by the end of my work day,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for 3 days so far, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This product beats anything that is out there right now</li>
            <li>A tip...apply right after the shower.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t happen right away - it did take a couple of days for it to work</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any skin issues either (even applying right after shaving).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Green Tidings got it right.</li>
            <li>Clogging up my pores with aluminum just doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>Been using this now for the last few weeks and am very happy with it, staying odor-free throughout the day and love that this product uses natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased to find a safe, natural product that I&#x27;m not afraid to use daily.</li>
            <li>They really got it right with this one!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more confident and less self-conscious.</li>
            <li>However, I wanted to give natural deodarants one more try, and after seeing all of the positive reviews for this one I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>not so fresh, but what do you expect when you are spending the day sweating on a hot beach?</li>
            <li>After using Green Tidings, the difference is absolutely remarkable.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying a &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorant &amp; I&#x27;m really glad this is what I picked as a first try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a hot and humid week and this deodorant has kept its promise to keep me smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>I Tried SO MANY other natural deodorants, many of them had fantastic reviews, but for whatever reason they just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>First of all, the one positive thing is that product as a deodorant worked better than any natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Not only effective, but it lasts much longer than the mineral based deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I think I put on too much and go through it really quick</li>
            <li>Green Tidings is excellent in controling odor--even being worn into the next day.</li>
            <li>Strong and natural blend.  </li>
            <li>The scent, out of the tube, was pleasant, but after a few hours of wearing it, I realized that it didn&#x27;t quite work with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>Will only be buying this from now on and highly recommend it to anybody looking for a great all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed because I had absolutely no odor after long shifts, intense workouts at the gym and</li>
            <li>On my first day, I think I applied too much, and my skin got a mild rash.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of keeping me less sweaty and smelly in the hot Texas summers.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day I was happy that I had no odor and less wetness than with a normal deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have this on hand if it&#x27;s an exceptionally hot day I layer it over my Thai stone.</li>
            <li>and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li>It absolutely works!</li>
            <li>It goes on a lot drier than other products I have tried so you have to get used to the increased friction versus more glide friendly products</li>
            <li>I had primal pit paste before which is my second favorite.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job very well!</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>just finished the first &#x27;try it&#x27;</li>
            <li>Have tried a few natural deodorants and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Better than commercial anti-perspirants!  </li>
            <li>are that it&#x27;s a bit sticky when you first apply it</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an organic deodorant that really works for years and THIS IS IT!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it consistently because of the price</li>
            <li>I tried the Lavender first</li>
            <li>far as natural, unscented deodorants go - Green Tidings is the best that I have found.  </li>
            <li>You do need to use it consistently to give your body time to adjust.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>This really works for me!  </li>
            <li>I do a lot of public speaking and get nervous when i do so and sweat a lot too, especially in hot climates</li>
            <li>Thank you so so so much!</li>
            <li>However, for the first time in my life I have received darkened armpits from this product.</li>
            <li>If a have to shave I try to do it at night to be able to apply the deodorant next morning without problems.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>only downside for me is the price, but we can wait for a discount or something :)</li>
            <li>, it really works!</li>
            <li>I put coconut oil on my pits first, to help the product glide on easier.</li>
            <li>This really does work all day!  </li>
            <li>My first amazon review</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t stain my shirts and also perfectly controlled my uncomfortable smell.</li>
            <li>Even when I&#x27;m really hot &amp; sweaty, I do not smell.</li>
            <li>And the fact that this product is organic, i doubted it at first</li>
            <li>That worked pretty well</li>
            <li>perhaps the essential oil makes it feel a bit more sticky for me?  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I was even willing to have more bo then usual if it meant it was better for my body</li>
            <li>I chose the unscented version which is exactly that...unscented.</li>
            <li>I got the unscented version, and it works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>I can say with certainty, this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>Good for a few hours, I guess.</li>
            <li>This is a great deodorant, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long for what you pay for.</li>
            <li>We both sleep much more soundly with less tossing and turning.</li>
            <li>Having a drawer full of new deodorant packs that just do not work for me.</li>
            <li>Loved the deodorant especially the fact that you apply only a little and you are good for the day.</li>
            <li>At first, it seems like it may be too hard to spread effectively but upon contact with the skin it glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I found it really hard to apply it smoothly too, and I kind of had to dig in to get  it to spread.  </li>
            <li>Way better than any traditional antiperspirant and much healthier.</li>
            <li>it really works better than extra strength store bought deodorant!</li>
            <li>Next was Real Purity which was OK</li>
            <li>My 21 year old daughter is the one who suggested we try a more natural deodorant</li>
            <li>love this product so much that I always buy extra just in</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any adverse reactions to any of the ingredients either which pretty much sealed the deal for me on this one.</li>
            <li>Since this is aluminum free - which I love - and has natural ingredients I&#x27;m curious as to how the scented deo will be like.</li>
            <li>I then tried the Green Tidings unscented option and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>This does as good a job as any chemical laden deodorant I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I tried an all-natural, organic, made with essential oils version made by a lovely woman at the farmer&#x27;s market - smelled good in the tube but was not effective for me.</li>
            <li>Most deodorants irritate my skin, so my choices are limited.</li>
            <li>It certainly does the job as a deodorant</li>
            <li>So i was careful, I still had to wipe some off though because the stick is very soft and just kind of comes off a lot at once.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, I sweat very little, and when I&#x27;m hot or active, I sweat more, but it&#x27;s vastly reduced from before and feels very healthy and normal.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is the first natural deodorant that has worked for me!</li>
            <li>/&gt;TLDR - &amp;#34;Car restoring, project loving, bordeline republican stereotypical guy gives in and tries the all natural stuff for the sake of his health and girl friend and found true love in a deodorant that works better than anything he&#x27;s tried before.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I am especially sweaty and hormonal right now, with being pregnant, thus easier for me to get body odor under my arms.</li>
            <li>Sometimes when the deodorant is in a warm place it is a little tricky, I have to wipe it on.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I do a little more is wash under my arms to make sure that I wash all of the deodorant off.  </li>
            <li>It works really well for preventing odors</li>
            <li>I think I found a real keeper thanks all for your posts so that I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>I feel much safer using a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t contain various chemicals but had doubts that a natural deodorant wouldn&#x27;t be able to beat the Arizona heat.  </li>
            <li>prevent smell that much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that my underarms are getting lighter in color (maybe too much info)</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This deoderant works really well with no aluminum, this will be the one I use from now on.</li>
            <li>Does not have much of an odor of it</li>
            <li>Is not irritating to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat much, but I feel like it helps with that as well.</li>
            <li>I prefer the unscented version since I don&#x27;t really like the smell of Lavender.</li>
            <li>I do feel like it gets used up fast,</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but I will not be repurchasing because the irritation is just to much for me.</li>
            <li>When wearing this there is not scent and that&#x27;s really what it&#x27;s all about.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this</li>
            <li>Being a guy, the lavender scent isn&#x27;t very noticeable</li>
            <li>This deodorant works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>we would much rather folks tell us the truth rather than flatter us with words.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t sweat much.</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up on finding one I could use that</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>When you apply to much, it will leave residue on clothes, but washes out.</li>
            <li>I think I was applying too much.  </li>
            <li>I was very hopeful that this would work, but it did not hold the odor at bay.</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is a very dense stick and it is absolutely unscented.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant really works to prevent odor even through a workout at the gym.  </li>
            <li>Works really well, but it has the consistency of a glue stick.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Be very cautious in using this.</li>
            <li>so I either have to press harder to force it or lighter to be able to glide it around,</li>
            <li>I think this is a very reliable choice for an unscented deodorant</li>
            <li>This absolutely kills/prevents it</li>
            <li>The crystal works decent in mild weather but Green Tidings is much better, and even held up in 100 degree heat this summer.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses it now - boys use the unscented - girls the lavender.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li>The deodorant works very well</li>
            <li>Thanks for this deodorant.</li>
            <li>however, when I went on vacation to a tropical location that had weather in the 90s, the product was really greasy under my arms</li>
            <li>Using too much will prove to be a mistake.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t twist too much out.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Very sticky</li>
            <li>After much research I decided to try this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>The product is unscented and has been keeping me relatively odour free all day.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s also after intense workout at the gym.</li>
            <li>So much for options.</li>
            <li>I was about ready to see a dermatologist about this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I find that if I apply to much I get some what irritated</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done w/ the stick I bought &amp; am getting ready to reorder.</li>
            <li>but then i didnt believe that it really covers the smell the whole day.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell, and I guess I wasn&#x27;t perspiring that much, either, because I&#x27;m also not noticeably wetter or anything.</li>
            <li>I even tried making my own with coconut oil and baking soda (which are 2 of the ingredients of Green Tidings) but it was kind of messy and burned my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I know if it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance</li>
            <li>-I have to carry a &amp;#34;sweat rag&amp;#34; with me everywhere which is really embarrassing and very unprofessional at work.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this deodorant as I&#x27;ve been using ones with chemicals for years.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem like an allergic reaction but if I had to guess I&#x27;d say my sweat glands are irritated or clogged... ?</li>
            <li>Finding a natural deodorant that actually works has been challenging.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different natural deodorants and this one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving it a four since I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be sure it&#x27;ll work this great long term...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than regular deodorant and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Though Lavilin was pricier, it just couldn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s own against Green Tidings.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning to more natural &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and the chemical anti-persirants are far from natural.</li>
            <li>They will get back to you on what you can do to get through the adjustment period if you truly want to be better to your body and use a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched unsuccessfully for years for a natural deodorant until now!!!</li>
            <li>I am right now re-ordering a few more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now in hot weather, and it keeps me dry and odor free all day, with just one application.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time on other more popular brands that you can pick up at the drug store.</li>
            <li>I live in HOT, HUMID, NORTH Florida.</li>
            <li>I like Green tidings because it is easy to apply (some natural deodorants do not have easy application)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wake up for anything normally!</li>
            <li>I was a little sceptical at first, like most people are</li>
            <li>(in addition to requests from many other companies items I purchased in that order — it&#x27;s not just this company that asks for feedback.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but seems to have a quality list of ingredients (feels like the healthiest deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used) and it works better than any other.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the idea of poisoning myself with aluminum and all other junk that is found in most deodorants these days, but I also don&#x27;t like to stink 2 hours after the shower.</li>
            <li>Works great even for my teenage daughter who is a heavy sweater!</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, also, that while this will not prevent you from sweating completely, because it is not an antiperspirant and because your body is meant to sweat, I still find that it does a really good job of preventing excessive sweating and keeps embarrassing pit odor at bay.  </li>
            <li>all-natural and overall, does its job right!</li>
            <li>I have only tried the unscented and like it because I am often times sensitive to strong scents.  </li>
            <li>I read all the positive reviews for this product before I ordered, but I was still surprised at how well it works!  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use your product for as long as it is available because  </li>
            <li>and I sweat way more than I normally would with or without any other deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time trying a natural deodorant</li>
            <li>This is my first ever deoderant that I&#x27;ve bought that was natural and unscented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep my review short and sweet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I want to be natural, I wasn&#x27;t convinced I would be able to use a natural deodorant (without an antiperspirant) regularly.  </li>
            <li>To start with I want to say that this is the first natural deodorant I have used.  </li>
            <li>I am a believer in this deodorant but at the price, I wish the last little bit in the bottom was more accessible to use.</li>
            <li>but then I end up not being sure if I&#x27;ve applied too much or too little.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s a minor gripe over what seems to work as a very effective, long lasting deodorant.</li>
            <li>it really is good, but wow, this price is really hard to swallow.</li>
            <li>works better than expected compared to other aluminum free deodorants.</li>
            <li>He said it keeps him dry and odor free all day.</li>
            <li>Definitely less is more in application.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t keep me dry or smell free.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, however I have tried so many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and none worked.</li>
            <li>I am glad I can now use a product with simple organic ingredients, especially being on my underarms every day.</li>
            <li>After much searching, it&#x27;s nice to have finally found an all natural deodorant that actually works and doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a wild flower.  </li>
            <li>I take Valium on a daily basis to deal with mild anxiety issues</li>
            <li>It actually works better than traditional deodorants.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the 2.7oz, unscented tube and that particular products lasted me about 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One quick glide to get a bit of product under the arm is enough.  </li>
            <li>In 2015 alone, have tried 4 different aluminum- free deodorants, natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get yellow stains on my shirts, and because of the potential healthy issues.  </li>
            <li>After Toms I tried another organic brand from my local &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; food store and that died out so quickly that my coworkers even mentioned something by 3pm</li>
            <li>There is one particular benefit of this product for me that will make me continue to purchase it despite the price.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with this stuff- especially for not having any weird chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>It works decently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to finally find a product that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum and doesn&#x27;t actually have a scent.</li>
            <li>With growing more conscientious of health and wellbeing, I’ve been looking for a natural deodorant free of Aluminum, Paraben, and other harmful chemicals for a long time with no luck.</li>
            <li>I can live with that; just that it surprised me when it first happened.</li>
            <li>The first one was a spray, however the smell was too strong and I would end up smelly within a few hours.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different deodorants over the last several years to switch from my use of an anti-perspirant containing aluminum without much success.</li>
            <li>I suspect it would melt in high heat, so don&#x27;t leave it in your car in the summer.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>got the Unscented version and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never had that happen to me before, so I googled it, and it turned out to be the high concentration of baking soda in this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got high hopes that this brand will work just as well AND not cause a rash since it uses no baking soda.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>With high hopes and a bit of skepticism, I purchased the Lavender.  </li>
            <li>After one month (including a week in the keys in high 80&#x27;s sweating my butt off)</li>
            <li>If I use this as my only deodorant, the baking soda eventually causes a rash, so now I only use it as I strong deodorant if I have to do something that will cause me to really sweat.</li>
            <li>Now for an activity like this you would think some sporty deodorant or an old school brand like Old Spice (something so strong only your dad would wear) would work</li>
            <li>It works better than any other natural deodorant I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I love the explanation of each ingredient in the little brochure that came with the deodorant and how well it explains what each one does .  </li>
            <li>I have tried just about every natural deodorant out there, none of which have worked, until now!!</li>
            <li>but it did get a little better the longer</li>
            <li>With Green tidings, my clothes and I both still smell fresh and clean at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>As a consumer, this is the kind of communication and care from a company that I want my hard earned money to support.</li>
            <li>I was searching for an effective non-toxic deodorant for my pregnant daughter, who is due in October, and I found it with Green Tidings.  </li>
            <li>All natural deodorant tend to be gentle, and doesn’t work.</li>
            <li>This natural deodorant really does the trick.</li>
            <li>In fact, I really don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I could clearly feel it was all natural.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with natural deodorant, and I have to say I am very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly (not sticky), does not stain clothing, works just like (in fact I think even better than) &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but I think this is worth noting, especially since summer is around the corner.</li>
            <li>Green Tidings is like magic to me.</li>
            <li>The FDA re-evaluating some of the ingredients in those traditional deodorants just confirms what many have been saying for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely does what it says it will and keeps you fresh.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m confident that it all will in a few months</li>
            <li>I tried all the &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; chemical deodorants, and none of them worked for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>it is TOTALLY worth it because I only buy it once a month.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the only deodorant that keeps you fresh, even after sweating.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have body odor or stink.</li>
            <li>and it also SO worth it for such a quality product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Green Tidings!  :)</li>
            <li>I hope that those of you out there with various medical conditions that cause far too much unnatural sweat will give this a try if you are looking for a more natural product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with normal store bought deodorant but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a complaint though since it works for me</li>
            <li>And I was able to get my boyfriend to start using it, he was a firm believer that it would not be strong enough for his manliness, but low and behold he loves it.</li>
            <li>Probably fine for other people, just doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
            <li>Seriously, what&#x27;s not to love?!?  </li>
            <li>However, I would love to see them try to introduce a few new scents - peppermint, perhaps?  </li>
            <li>It goes on pretty dry which irritated my armpit for the first week</li>
            <li>right here, I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a big deal right now.  </li>
            <li>Keep it in a cool, dry place and it will make the product firmer and easier to glide across your skin.</li>
            <li>Historically, I&#x27;ve used your run of the mill antiperspirant/deodorant (like Secret, Dove, etc.), and while they smelled good at first, I found that they just built up on my clothing, under my arms,</li>
            <li>but since I live in the Northeast</li>
            <li>I live in Phoenix and sweating a lot goes without saying...</li>
            <li>I just dismissed this because I wasn&#x27;t having any itching and just figuring that I was getting used to a new deodorant that didn&#x27;t have the chemicals my body was used to.</li>
            <li>It passed the &amp;#34; Hard work, very sweaty, day&amp;#34; test :)</li>
            <li>Green Tidings was far better</li>
            <li>The idea of having real lavender oil in my deodorant is a real plus as it actually has a therapeutic effect.</li>
            <li>I love this product, have used a few all natural deodorants and they stink compared to this (ha)...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I bought unscented, and it has a nice subtle smell to it.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the price , which for an organic natural product is worth it and the texture.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive</li>
            <li>After reading so many reviews of all the different kinds of natural deodorants I decided to give green tidings a chance based upon all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have definitely put it to the test and been very sweaty with NO ODOR!  </li>
            <li>and by golly its all natural!</li>
            <li>Oh my WOW!</li>
            <li>Needs further assurance, I used it for a week now with all vigorous excise to test the product -&amp;#62; it never failed once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure, but after using this for the past 2 weeks I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it works.</li>
            <li>The only reason I take one star off is due to price, which hopefully they&#x27;ll be able to reduce as time goes on.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li>No odor even under hot stressful conditions which in my line of work is daily.</li>
            <li>All natural deodorant that works!</li>
            <li>I recently moved to Hot Arizona and need something that does the job.</li>
            <li>all natural deodorant is now over!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other brands and this one finally actually works.</li>
            <li>no messy fingers!</li>
            <li>However, I developed the rash under my arms that has been detailed in other reviews and it took quite some time to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li>Some deodorants only work for the first month.  </li>
            <li>I do love the product so the two stars may be misleading, but it is due to a combination of several factors.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li>By far out performs any organic option today!</li>
            <li>I bought the unscented one because I usually wear perfume and/or scented body lotions and didn&#x27;t want to wear too many scents all at once.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd stick now and even though it&#x27;s a bit pricier than other deodorants, I find that it lasts longer than most</li>
            <li>I have had a growing concern over aluminum after my first mammogram and the fact that you can&#x27;t use aluminum antiperspirant prior to the test.  </li>
            <li>My face &amp; head are always the first to sweat, followed by my back</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually sensitive-skinned, but I broke out in a full-blown rash with this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>and it seems there was a technical glitch that I did not get their first response to me.</li>
            <li>Have tried other natural products that didn&#x27;t do the job of enabling me to be odor free.</li>
            <li>I only hope that business is good enough that Green Tidings can continue to produce this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge Green Tidings advocate and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who cares about the products they use.</li>
            <li>I prefer this brand over other brands because it goes on clear, which means not as many white deodorant marks on clothing.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Tom&#x27;s, and truthfully only continued using them because they were a natural company and not because the deodorant worked as well or better than other brands.</li>
            <li>I used to use other natural deodorants (crystal clear, tom&#x27;s, arm and hammer natural) and none kept me smelling fine.</li>
            <li>THIS is fantastic, it glides on and lasts all day and washes off without that residue typical deodorants leave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first natural deodorant that actually works for me.</li>
            <li>Unbelievably, this product works better than any deodorant I have ever used, both natural and synthetic.</li>
            <li>lasted as long as can be expected, worked REALLY well, better actually than anything i&#x27;ve bought in a drugstore.</li>
            <li>Not from one use, but wearing the same shirt several times (between washings) a mild tint developed on the fabric.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with the simple, all natural lifestyle, but there was one thing that I just could not live without for not only my sake but for the sake of others around me (you&#x27;re reading this review, so you know what I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout)...deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I had any advice for the company I would say to make a clear version for evening attire.</li>
            <li>but clearly I returned this ASAP.</li>
            <li>The real test was not starting to smell at the end of the work day (office job) then changing to go to the gym.</li>
            <li>I have tried all sorts of &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants (sticks, rocks...) and either stink or sweat hours after using them.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>A natural deodorant that works.  </li>
            <li>I got the unscented and am surprised it works.  </li>
            <li>I tried to find a natural deodorant, since I also found out that your body is supposed to sweat and antiperspirants block those pores so you can&#x27;t sweat out the toxins.</li>
            <li>Finally, I can go through the whole day without odor.</li>
            <li>because none of the natural stuff I tried worked.</li>
            <li>However, prior to using this deodorant, I was using prescription strength regular deodorant and allowing my body to sweat again takes some getting used to, and I have to be more careful about what clothing I wear to avoid armpit sweat spots.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll be on my search again for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a natural alternative.</li>
            <li>A natural deodorant and antiperspirant that is what I was looking for when I found this product.</li>
            <li>I have a whole stick left and can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>If you want a natural deodorant, it fits the bill.</li>
            <li>and I do have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have searched for years for a natural deodorant without aluminum that works.</li>
            <li>I then started trying all natural deodorants, but they would not work, I could smell myself if I started to sweat.</li>
            <li>It might just be that I have sensitive armpits, but I&#x27;m just putting this out there.</li>
            <li>I was advised by my oncologist to switch to a natural, no aluminum deodorant.</li>
            <li>This winter I took the plunge into all natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>All natural, no chemicals.</li>
            <li>$15 seems like a lot for deodorant, but since it actually works really well</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this burned my underarms.</li>
            <li>I almost gave up looking for a reliable natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone jus looking for a natural alternative for what ever reason.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of all organic, natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I have tried, looked, bought every natural deodorant out there and NONE of them work.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for my 25 yr old daughter or I.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural AND it works.</li>
            <li>Point is, so far I can tell it has 24 hour protection.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to try a natural product, I would give this one a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and it will squeeze over the rim of the applicator, which is wasteful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly grateful for a company to invent a product that doesn&#x27;t just work, but has integrity with respect to quality natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and do not stain my clothing.</li>
            <li>Finally, a product my whole family will use because it WORKS.</li>
            <li>oils to insure complete coverage.</li>
            <li>: I have never been skin sensitive to any product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>All natural, unscented, and all day protection ...</li>
            <li>I never considered myself to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>That  said, I was pleasantly surprised with how well the deodorant worked.</li>
            <li>Not having used natural deodorant before I had my doubts.</li>
            <li>my underarm area seamed drier which surprised me seeing as it has coconut oil in it.</li>
            <li>I have had issues with underarm odor, and have been on the search for a natural solution.</li>
            <li>However, if you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried for years to find a deodorant that will last for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed that putting a few drops of water on the top of the product helps apply it to the underarm immensely.</li>
            <li>After many attempts at finding a natural/non toxic deodorant, I finally came across Green Tidings.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily like any normal deodorant, but does not have the questionable ingredients I was worried about being absorbed into my body.  </li>
            <li>Just a week into using it I noticed a dark patch where I typically apply deodorant that was kind of scaly to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Our goal at Green Tidings is for our customers to be happy, and to resolve any issues you may have!&amp;#34; This is a company that appreciates business, wants a chance to make things right if a customer is unhappy, and values input from customers in general.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s own, less than a typical &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; brand does.  </li>
            <li>I was in Miami, outside all day in the heat and by the end of the day, the only smell was the very very gentle/almost invisible herb-like scent of the deodorant.  </li>
            <li>For the first 2 weeks, Green Tidings on the left armpit went up against Tom&#x27;s of Maine unscented on the right.  </li>
            <li>the search continues for a less harsh product that can be purchased at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the main reason I began looking for a replacement, and I was even considering going back to an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I only used it twice so far, I will give it a little more time before I make my final opinion.</li>
            <li>I used it until I developed a major rash.</li>
            <li>After several months of trying different natural deodorants, Green Tidings keeps me feeling confident through the day.  </li>
            <li>I expected to be like all the other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried over the years (there are a handful of mostly unused natural deodorants that I&#x27;ve given up on at any given time in my bathroom), but this one is definitely different.</li>
            <li>There is a slight scent to it but nothing noticeable and not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge improvement over the standard deodorants I&#x27;ve tried (which work for about half the day then seem to quit).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product, you only need a thin coat and it hardly has an odor.  </li>
            <li>The second one had a scent that was even more strong and didn&#x27;t cover the odor at all, so I would have a sweet funk to me, which I hated.</li>
            <li>The only negative is it doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly and has to be rubbed in manually if you apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>I love green tidings I was not sure when I first tried it</li>
            <li>I work 12hr days in a physically demanding job so my quest for an all natural deodorant that truly works has been challenging to say the least.</li>
            <li>I settled on a milk of magnesia deodorant that left a visible white stain under my arms after application (kind of embarrassing), stained the shirt if I wasn&#x27;t careful putting on the shirt, and &amp;#34;barely&amp;#34; made it through an active day.</li>
            <li>I purchased this deodorant because I&#x27;ve been getting burn marks and darkened armpits from regular deodorants and needed to try something new.  </li>
            <li>I quickly notified Green Tidings about the issue and received a new working deodorant in the mail a couple days later.</li>
            <li>Green Tidings, though, keeps me smell free throughout an entire day, even when I am sweating and/or working out.</li>
            <li>Personally, if the evening one weren&#x27;t completely natural I would still wear this one during the day and the clear version at night.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure if any deodorant is being applied during the first swipe or so, so I often end up using too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having a problem with odor asserting itself in the late afternoon when I was using more commercial antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants and this is the winner!</li>
            <li>The only natural deodorant that works for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty active person and this has worked well in all situations.  </li>
            <li>I still sweat and the natural smell of the product smells a little like the clay I used to make a volcano for my first grade science project.</li>
            <li>It worked great up until my arm pits reacted badly to the product</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but this deodorant is a amazing.</li>
            <li>I would buy this product again and I expect this tube to last for quite a long time based on the density and how much I use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll go back to some of the name brand ones I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>It does seem to get used up faster than the non-natural deodorants, and is a bit more expensive, but I would definitely buy this again and am willing to pay the extra for the effectiveness and peace of mind that it does not contain harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I had read reviews that you had to be careful about not putting on too much.</li>
            <li>My armpit skin has been sensitive and can&#x27;t handle regular deodorants.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for over a year to replace my traditional deodorant with something natural</li>
            <li>Finally, a natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li>A week later, both of my arm pits peeled completely off.</li>
            <li>I tried numerous natural deoderants before settling on this one.</li>
            <li>Finally a natural deodorant that actually works!!!</li>
            <li>Worked well until I developed a burning rash on the third day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times and so far it works well.</li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned with the reviews that mentioned irritation, but I decided to take the chance since I wanted as natural a product as possible.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely had to roll up the tube.</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my standard chemical-laden deodorant with something that was natural and worked well.  </li>
            <li>An all natural personal item that works.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I developed a rash shortly after I gave birth</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY natural deodorant I have found that works for me.</li>
            <li>I have tried several natural deodorant products.  </li>
            <li>A natural deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li>I will probably look for a different natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>As a 32 year old athletic male, I may or may not be the target demographics for this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a natural deodorant that actually works....</li>
            <li>My wife and I have been searching for a natural deodorant that actually performs well and doesn&#x27;t cause skin rashes.</li>
            <li>All Natural Deodorant Extra Strength.  </li>
            <li>I like that the ingredients are all natural and listed on the label, no big fancy chemical names.  </li>
            <li>The texture of the deodorant is like a paste, it&#x27;s not rough or anything.  </li>
            <li>I tried two different natural deodorants before trying this one.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear or with minimal residue, has barely any scent, and seems to work very well through an entire day, including tennis/running/</li>
            <li>Never have I used a natural deodorant (or even a regular store bought deodorant) that works this well.  </li>
            <li>Finally, an all natural deodorant that works...</li>
            <li>Most of them just made things worse.</li>
            <li>But I can use it as usual if it&#x27;s in a cool location.  </li>
            <li>I live in the South (and there is a heat wave going on right now), plus I just got back from a trip where I was hiking &amp; being very active in the sun &amp; heat daily for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Despite my perpetual state of sweat and previously using the clinical antiperspirants, I have easily adopted the green tidings and have been very pleasantly surprised at how well it works!  </li>
            <li>That meant I&#x27;d be re-wearing my clothes more often than usual with less frequent washing.</li>
            <li>I used the product for two days and found that I was moist, stinky and it gave my brand new white bra yellow stains in the armpit area.</li>
            <li>so I went with using it every other day for a few weeks and then was able to go to daily usage with no problems.  </li>
            <li>I want to reiterate a few things other reviews pointed out, because I read through most of them before I purchased (ultimately, that&#x27;s why I decided to try it</li>
            <li>was willing to go through the reapplications bus of the organic benefits, but once it stated burning, itching and turning my skin black, I had to stop.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I do something extreme or it&#x27;s extremely hot, I still only need to reapply it once.</li>
            <li>Especially after trying all sorts of other natural deodorant and not finding a single one that kept me fresh all day...</li>
            <li>I waited about a month and a half after starting to use this product before writing a review to allow enough time in case the effectiveness changed - but it&#x27;s been very consistent.  </li>
            <li>Pour 3% hydrogen peroxide directly onto underarms of a freshly washed dark t-shirt while still wet</li>
            <li>, only complaint is that it does leave discoloration visible on light colored clothing</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve ever found to actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, this has been the only natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li>I have finally found a natural deoderant that actually works.</li>
            <li>I used to have to put another swipe of my old deodersnt  on before bed, but this actually does last 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Finally I found a natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s the only truly natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found that actually works.</li>
            <li>I switched from Antiperspirant to this because it is all natural, and Green Tidings really cares about the environment.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several natural deodorants and this is the only one that works and works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and the key is to make sure that you put a light coating on, not a huge thick amount.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, my armpits were just a little tender</li>
            <li>I first noticed a little redness when I got out of the shower a day or two after I started using it</li>
            <li>Then I got little knots that at first didn&#x27;t hurt but have since become tender</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now, but it is summer and in this time we&#x27;ve had excessive heat warnings but this product has worked better than any conventional antiperspirant &amp; deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I also love what it does NOT contain: aluminum, parabens, BPAs, gluten, and other icky stuff.  </li>
            <li>Without divulging my underarm secrets, I can say that it has solved a problem that my former brand barely touched with twice-daily applications.</li>
            <li>I had to unfortunately opt out for a deoderant with similar ingrediants but catered to more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to exhort future buyers to be aware and maybe if you are able, try the product in a part of you skin before starting the normal usage, in order to avoid this situation as it has been the most uncomfortable and painful irritation/skin burn</li>
            <li>Then i tried Green Tidings and from the first day i could tell the  difference .</li>
            <li>The deodorant is creamy and somewhat soft, only need a thin, light application.</li>
            <li>I do have trouble with application - when I first uncap it</li>
            <li>It took a few days of consistent use</li>
            <li>Green Tidings deodorant lasts for the entire day and when I wake up next morning I am still fresh.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical about how well this would work but the good reviews convinced me to buy some.  </li>
            <li>I had already switched to aluminum free deodorants when I read their lanels and realized they were still full of bad ingredients.</li>
            <li>All day protection, easy to use, and it is non irritating.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews on Green Tidings, I decided to try it .  </li>
            <li>but with that mind, as long as i allowed the deodorant to absorb within a few seconds, I did not notice any stains on my shirts nor have i experienced any weird discolorations under my arms as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very disappointed as I thought I had found the perfect deodorant.</li>
            <li>Regular deodrants usually make me itch and do not feel right.</li>
            <li>this lead me to a trip to Ralph&#x27;s where I searched every deodorant and found the same exact active ingredient in every single brand except for Toms.</li>
            <li>Needless to say a deodorant is very important.</li>
            <li>There is a sort of balancing act: too much and it will goo-up and stink, too little</li>
            <li>Leaves a little residue but keeps the odor at bay even after an intense workout.</li>
            <li>If you think you may be even a little sensitive, steer clear.</li>
            <li>I could hardly believe that this natural product really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly the dry product I was expecting since it&#x27;s more of a compacted solidified mass forced into a twist dispenser so that it takes form.</li>
            <li>I live an active lifestyle, biking 5 miles each way to/from work each day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this is the only one that actually worked AND with which I didn&#x27;t break out (very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t go on clear will leave a white residue on your clothes if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>

            <li> This is a great product with great customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have experienced after time, for some reason</li>
            <li> I then tried the vinegar mixture before I applied the deodorant and that has greatly helped.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been using for years</li>
            <li> Great product~</li>

            <li> It feels great not to worry about it anymore.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation.</li>
            <li> This does, its the best, use scented oils to apply your own scent if you wish, just put a drop in the cap overnight.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Great product - I&#x27;ve been trying to get my husband to switch from the aluminum based ones</li>

            <li> A great deodorant without aluminum.</li>

            <li> I would recommend this unscented version to anyone as a great unisex, non-toxic deodorant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
            <li> And healthy!!</li>
            <li> So happy I gave this a try, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> The product works amazing!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>

            <li> This deoderant is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been thrilled with the results!  </li>
            <li> I have been nothing but completly impressed and satisfied with this brand.</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> Great deodorant that&#x27;s good for you.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s not killing me is honestly a bonus!</li>
            <li> But what impressed me the most was one day in the shower</li>
            <li> I love that this deodorant is the best at smell that I have come across!  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.. very effective.  </li>
            <li> The lavender smell is pleasant and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The best part is there is almost no BO even after a full day of use - even after sweating!  </li>
            <li> Its easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothing, and best of all it lasts ALL day!</li>
            <li> Works great and is perfect to use while pregnant or nursing.</li>
            <li> , I am doing good things for my body</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s good for you an the environment.</li>
            <li> This is a GOOD thing.  </li>
            <li> The baking soda gives it a pasty texture (in a good way) rather than being sticky and gel-like.</li>
            <li> it is that good..</li>
            <li> I am thankful the search for a GOOD</li>
            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> This is just a good.</li>
            <li> and after read the good reviews on amazon on this product and figured i would give it a try</li>
            <li> Excellent, won&#x27;t kill you with toxic chemicals while keeping you free of smell.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> Your not supposed to use it after shaving, but what good is a deodorant if you can&#x27;t use it after you shower and shave.  </li>
            <li> I feel good about using it.</li>
            <li> The Good:  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel good or work too well.</li>
            <li> and I saw this deodorant had good reviews on Amazon, so I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I feel good knowing</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s where the good stops.</li>
            <li> Now after 2 weeks I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never smelled better!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look impressive, it has no scent, but it is effective, neat, and easily applied.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and not bad for you like the store brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels great (firm/soft), it applies great (smooth)</li>
            <li> and it works wonderfully even when I&#x27;m under pressure when it&#x27;s very hot</li>
            <li> It would be great if they had more options than unscented and lavender (preferably something manly).</li>
            <li> Best protection from odor, in a natural product, I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, stays on all day best natural roll on</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I was sweating more than I do with out it!</li>
            <li> I had a sample size of the unscented, and used it in the summertime -- the best time to really give it a go!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this!  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed and interested to see how it holds up to my sweat in the summer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome - no scent, and no weird sweating.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> 100% recommended, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I love this deodrant!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> LOVE that it includes magnesium oil!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> So glad I discovered this product!</li>
            <li> and i am so glad i did!</li>

            <li> At first I was very happy to receive this product.</li>

            <li> and I can honestly say that I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing .  </li>
            <li> and this stuff is amazing..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This one feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is amazing.</li>
            <li> No residue or any kind of irritation on skin.</li>
            <li> My wife tried it and liked it, also; we will be ordering some of the lavender-scented for her.</li>
            <li> Effective as a deoderant.  </li>
            <li> I have been loving this Deodorant.  </li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t an anti-perspirant, it is an effective deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Do they want honest opinions from the clients who purchase their products?</li>
            <li> I sat in a non-air conditioned auditorium for two hours sweating to death and came out smelling like a rose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s some kind of miracle formula.</li>
            <li> and I think that may be what makes it so effective for me</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll be honest, I can&#x27;t work up a good odor, even more popular deodorants couldn&#x27;t help me, but this does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the best deodorant that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s as effective as Mitchum.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can skip a day and don&#x27;t notice any smell.</li>
            <li> I really liked this as an alternative to aluminum containing antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> Best all natural deodorant yet!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, including 10 days on vacation where I did a fair amount of hiking (putting it to a good test!), and found it to be perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed and very glad I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed and would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best all natural deodorant I have tried, and trust me, I have tried MANY!</li>
            <li> I use the unscented variety and it is impressive that is succeeds without simply masking scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a very strong deodorant with aluminum.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deoderant out there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a perfect natural deodorant for years!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t apply very smoothly; the texture is kind of grippy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> By far the best deodorant I have purchased and continued to used!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to find a product that works so well and is so healthy .  </li>
            <li> This is the most effective deodorant that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Excellent because it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Excellent natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is by far is the best deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> and honestly I think it&#x27;s much better for my body to get those toxins out and not keep them inside of me.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best all-natural deodorant on the market.  </li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I have ever tried</li>
            <li> This is the best one we have tried so far.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have tried so far</li>
            <li> I had been using Arm &amp; Hammer essentials for a year or so,  but was looking for something more effective.  </li>
            <li> So I am one happy customer and it is worth every penny because I truly have a piece of mind knowing that even though I sweating there is no odor.</li>
            <li> The best all natural product on the market.</li>
            <li> I have experienced some irritation, I&#x27;m trying not to shave right before applying it to see if that eliminates the rash.  </li>
            <li> The great thing with this is that it doesn&#x27;t overdry the skin around my armpits, washes right off when I&#x27;m taking a shower</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants in search of the best one.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased with this deodorant in that I did not sweat at all and was even able to wear tops more than once -- I&#x27;ve NEVER been able to do that!</li>
            <li> As for the customer service, the mechanism on my first tube was damaged, and I had to manually push the product up, which didn&#x27;t work out that great.  </li>
            <li> This is true happiness for me</li>
            <li> It was not painful, but I cannot believe the product was good for me if it caused that severe of a burn.</li>
            <li> So thrilled to find an all natural deodorant that works beautifully as well as contributing to a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, unpolluted lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Very kind and willing to work with me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the second best thing I have found as antiperspirant alternative.</li>
            <li> She is so pleased with the product that I just reordered and will continue to do so.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also way better than at home remedies.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple different all-natural deodorants, and this is the best one.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I also get allergic to so many products, organic or not</li>
            <li> Thanks for having  a great product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this deodorant</li>
            <li> I purchased the unscented and love it.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> so I cannot say that this will be safe for everyone</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars, mostly because of my body type, is that the coconut oil can cause a reaction after shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> I do like the lavender one better then the unscented</li>
            <li> This deodorant feels light and doesn&#x27;t have me smelling ripe even after 2 days!</li>
            <li> luck! :)</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> , I imagine most people won&#x27;t have to deal with this.</li>
            <li> it is not an antiperspirant  but that is ok.</li>
            <li> i mostly wanted to odor control without chemicals</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Ordered one more for my teenager son.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes unscented.</li>
            <li> I have used many others, Tom&#x27;s etc.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I also love that it truly is unscented,</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> this one is definitely the best!!!</li>
            <li> With that all said, I will continue to use this product and tell as many people as I can to use it also.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I like this more than the lavender scented one.</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> I also love the texture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to suggest to the sellers to roduce in 2 pack for a better value.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I also feel muh better about breastfeeding</li>
            <li> I will have to wait until it gets a bit hotter before I am totally sure that it works well.</li>
            <li> After three weeks I am totally satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> this deodorant able to keep up with that and no stinky armpits anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Will definately be buying more, and the lavender scent&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s in a roll-out stick...</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t bother me any more.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you don&#x27;t perspire a lot, it would be OK.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and it works for me all day.</li>
            <li> you will have me buying stock! :-)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go more than a day without reapplying</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend you try to go without a shower and then apply on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten rashes or irritation from many, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations and worked magically.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I prefer the unscented over the lavender as I feel the lavender smells more musky (more of what I would expect a man to smell like).</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> okay, but let some bits of odor through.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Dove or Sure antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to avoid the aluminum exposure now, too.</li>
            <li> I have tried many deodorants, but I have never had a burn.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I tried.</li>
            <li> Ordering more.</li>
            <li> but I love it now.</li>
            <li> I have tried many &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; deodorants because I know they are healthier.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t just walk around sticky, stinking like rotten onions and staining all of my bras and shirts for a week in hopes that it will magically start working the way it should.  </li>
            <li> much more than counterparts.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is okay, but my skin did NOT like it.  </li>
            <li> Very nice product that works very well.</li>
            <li> Although the odor is not 100% eliminated, it is very significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly amazed that a natural product can be this effective!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best natural deodorant on the market, and I have tried so many of them!  </li>
            <li> Very clean stuff.</li>
            <li> I was using coconut oil + baking soda, which worked pretty good</li>
            <li> Good product that does exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> The good news is that the lavender isnt overpowering at all, and in fact, I dont notice the smell beyond first application.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good natural deodorant for some time and this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> It also does not have any smell which is nice and lasts a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li> So excited!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that a natural product can be so good.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is made with  magnesium oil, among its other awesome ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; chemical free deodorants and none of them have worked at all for me.  </li>
            <li> Wow, what a great product.</li>
            <li> And, most importantly, keeps me from smelling.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is chemical free.</li>
            <li> Great Natural Deodarant.  </li>
            <li> great natural  odorless deodorant in terms of efficacy.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, then this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried assorted natural deodorants, scented and unscented, and wasn&#x27;t happy with any of them.  </li>
            <li> Great to have a natural deodorant that works</li>
            <li> It was surprising how much I sweat.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use that much - sweet!</li>
            <li> Both issues required laundry interventions in HE top loader to achieve 100% success!</li>
            <li> Overall I am a happy camper with this deodorant and will continue to purchase it as long as it keeps working &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are great too because it has Magnesium in it, which is something your body can absorb since many people don&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> I tried it out like after showering, on a day where I didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere just to be sure I wouldn&#x27;t stink in public lol.</li>
            <li> Sure it costs more, but if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Works great but careful applying when the air is warm.</li>
            <li> Although it does wash out of clothes easily.</li>
            <li> Nothing too strong.</li>
            <li> I have to give this deodorant a strong four stars.</li>
            <li> I have used it every day for nine months and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a Mitchum girl - you know that deodorant that&#x27;s &amp;#34;so strong</li>
            <li> The baking soda is too strong for my body PH.  </li>
            <li> It smells great (not truly unscented, but still a more neutral smell than the lavender which is way too strong), goes on smoothly, and actually does keep odor away.  </li>
            <li> I am a very healthy, and very hygienic person, I shower once a day, in the summer twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants and this, by far, is the best!</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants and this is, by far, the best.</li>
            <li> I, obviously, did my own research, and with the great ratings here on Amazon, it was, definitely, worth a try.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> My skin feels fine</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li> The unscented is just fine.</li>
            <li> Despite both working out and being pregnant, I don&#x27;t ever have body odor under my arms when I use this!</li>
            <li> in fact this is better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve used, ever.... 2 weeks of use and not 1 unpleasant sniff or sticky squirmy slimy underarm feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best natural deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li> By far the best of all the natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aluminum free, scent free, and keeps me stink free all day and then some.      </li>
            <li> This has been by far the best natural deodorant I have tried</li>
            <li> and I got huge sore bumpy rashes.</li>
            <li> In search of an aluminum free deodorant I tried Burt Bees and this.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say, I finally found the all-natural deodorant works!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really pleased at how fresh it keeps me without the worry of what I&#x27;m smearing on my body.  </li>
            <li> deodorant goes on smooth and does not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I let them know about it - and promptly received an email from Jennifer offering to send me a free replacement (which they did).  </li>
            <li> This is the best product that I use for everyday use and all day deodorant.</li>
            <li> Not that smooth to run under your arms.</li>
            <li> After I swipe, I use my hands to smooth it like a crest.  </li>
            <li> Green Tidings is great!</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly with no clumping or irritation.</li>
            <li> I had initially had an issue with my order but was met with great customer service.</li>
            <li> While I may still sweat some days, this product is fantastic in keeping me odor free.  </li>
            <li> And apply LIGHTLY.  </li>
            <li> so I need unscented, and aluminum free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using something aluminum free</li>
            <li> Fantastic, leaves minimul residue and scent.</li>
            <li> Smooth application area with fingertips to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective and I really like it.</li>
            <li> And my then the oil has absorbed into me or my pj&#x27;s and isn&#x27;t an issue any more.</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> Good natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I already told my family members, who have been looking for a good all natural deodorant, about this stuff</li>
            <li> So far so good, been using it for about a week</li>
            <li> This deodorant was a good idea in theory - all natural ingredients, no aluminum.  </li>
            <li> Loved it for awhile but developed a wicked allergy that took months and a RX cream to get rid of.</li>
            <li> and if I dropped it (which seemed to happen frequently it would crack and chip and and jagged edges don&#x27;t feel good under your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Highly Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the first I have found that works!!  </li>
            <li> Give thanks!!!  </li>
            <li> Super cool!  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchase this Deodrant, very effective, doesn&#x27;t stain and no rash, not sure it&#x27;s lasts 24hrs as ad says, but def of if the best I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Works great, keeps me dry all day and smell free.</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so excited to use a pit stick.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> I excited tested it on my workout day, after two hours sweating workout in the gym</li>
            <li> and it is worth the price!</li>
            <li> Most feel really sticky and I&#x27;ll start being stinky not even half-way through my day!  </li>
            <li> Or, are they really interested in getting rave reviews to sell more  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price of admission!</li>
            <li> If you buy this product make sure you are not magnesium intolerant or go get your levels checked first, or you will regret it.</li>
            <li> Keeps you fresh all day!</li>
            <li> This item is definitely not the product for me but the customer service was good and I feel overall happy with having given it a try because of that.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> In general, finding a good deodorant has always been a challenge for me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants in the past and they were ok at best .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy I finally found a natural deoderant that works.</li>
            <li> Overall though, I will probably continue to purchase as this is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I refuse to use anything with chemicals and have tried many many natural versions.</li>
            <li> It quickly warms to your body temperature so it goes on fairly smooth.  </li>
            <li> After not being satisfied by the scented natural deodarants I&#x27;ve bought, I opted for the unscented one this time, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several unscented deodorants and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> I am currently giving my underarms a couple days to get better on their own before calling the Dr.  </li>
            <li> I have a special needs child who cannot have chemicals, ext.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, and I&#x27;ve tried just about ever natural deodorant out there over the years.</li>
            <li> but this unscented deodorant made my skin bright red and inflamed.</li>
            <li> No smell even after a full days work.</li>
            <li> Now that I am convinced this is the deodorant for me, I intend to place an order for a full size in unscented.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 5 or 6 natural deodorants, including making my own.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this deodorant despite the price</li>
            <li> , I decided that many people couldn&#x27;t be promoting a product that didn&#x27;t really work.)</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> It really works better than regular deodorants and it&#x27;s good for you.</li>
            <li> if you can fit it into your budget, I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> So if it isn&#x27;t obvious and doesn&#x27;t smell I&#x27;m good with</li>
            <li> No painful itching or rash.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this unscented version a try because, let&#x27;s face it, the true test of a deo is if it eliminates the odor and not mask it( and</li>
            <li> When I was using the magnesia deodorant, I seemed to sweat under my arms more than ever, to the point where I was frequently very self-conscious of it.</li>
            <li> One more &amp;#34;editorial note&amp;#34; : Please don&#x27;t overlook possibility that modern diet and symptoms of dysbosis (leaky gut) are underlying problematic odor.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this seems to be a natural product without aluminum.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many deodorants and feel I smell, not matter how much I apply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most effective &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a decent amount of them.</li>
            <li> I am completely sold on this product and so happy to be using something natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants but this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant, it lasts all day and it&#x27;s gentle on the skin, very moisturizing...will definitely buy from now on &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to create a healthy anti-perspirant as the concept of blocking your sweat glands from being able to secrete what they are designed to do</li>
            <li> Thanks green tidings for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I am now purchasing my 3rd bottle and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad that I finally that found a safe product that keeps me from smelling like one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can smell it occasionally throughout the day which is refreshing and better than alternative smells!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad that I have found a natural product!!</li>
            <li> I wore it to the beach one day, and it was very hot.</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased to report that it not only does it not burn or leave flaky residue skin</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorants, but this one is really the best!</li>
            <li> With that in mind, I&#x27;d recommend it to others looking for a suitable natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> but I am hopeful to return to using this again after my post-pregnancy hormones return to normal :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more pricy than more commercial antiperspirants, but the performance is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I teach &amp; take hot yoga &amp; this has not failed me!!</li>
            <li> So far, I love everything about this deodorant, though the true test will be wearing it through the summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really been an easy transition because there has been no transition.  </li>
            <li> Hands down best Natural Deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li> And it held up very well!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this natural deodorant!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This really works!!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week, and it does exactly what a deodorant is supposed to do without destroying my skin, and it&#x27;s the absolute best!</li>
            <li> Love that it is natural too!</li>
            <li> Love this natural deodorant!  </li>
            <li> I love that it lasts a while on and is super soft and also does not effect your clothes.</li>
            <li> I have been impressed with this product so far, usually I feel confident applying it once a day, if I work out, I may apply once more for extra caution.</li>
            <li> i am trying to go natural with most things i use daily and am so glad i found this!</li>
            <li> Works great for me and a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural deodorant for years, this is the best one I have ever used hands down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural deodorant out there, and nothing has ever impressed me until Green Tidings.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best all natural deodorant I have found, and I have tried a lot of different brands.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews for Green Tidings I decided to order the unscented since I&#x27;m not one for flowery smells.  </li>
            <li> The Green Tidings company had great customer services as well.</li>
            <li> But I thought I was destined to not smell fresh because of that decision.</li>
            <li> I decided to make the switch from the mainstream aluminum based deodorants to the natural kind recently and stumbled upon this brand and many others alike.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It contains no harsh or potentially harmful chemicals, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I wish the price was lower but even so, this product is 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> I even was able to work out early in the morning</li>
            <li> , they always seemed to smell more than my natural smell.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and could not use most of the homemade recipes, but have not had a problem with this one at all.</li>
            <li> Really worth the price.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and keeps me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> Initially, I tried making my own then moved to Tom&#x27;s which I did not like.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try to see if it works for your body.</li>
            <li> but I guarantee its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Most natural deodorants cause me to get a rash after I&#x27;ve used them for a week, and I believe it&#x27;s the baking soda, but they work well for odor.  </li>
            <li> I love that this has natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Keeps me smelling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of natural deodorants, spent tons of money, and this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant for many years</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s rare to find any product which irritates me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really wanted a natural option that could effectively control the odor.</li>
            <li> plus, I&#x27;m not crazy about lavender scented stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE this natural deoderant and even with the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m FRESH</li>
            <li> One application in the morning followed by a full day of work and hot flow</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still feeling and smelling fresh by the end of my work day,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 3 days so far, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This product beats anything that is out there right now</li>
            <li> A tip...apply right after the shower.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t happen right away - it did take a couple of days for it to work</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any skin issues either (even applying right after shaving).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Green Tidings got it right.</li>
            <li> Clogging up my pores with aluminum just doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> Been using this now for the last few weeks and am very happy with it, staying odor-free throughout the day and love that this product uses natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased to find a safe, natural product that I&#x27;m not afraid to use daily.</li>
            <li> They really got it right with this one!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m more confident and less self-conscious.</li>
            <li> However, I wanted to give natural deodarants one more try, and after seeing all of the positive reviews for this one I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> not so fresh, but what do you expect when you are spending the day sweating on a hot beach?</li>
            <li> After using Green Tidings, the difference is absolutely remarkable.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorant &amp; I&#x27;m really glad this is what I picked as a first try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a hot and humid week and this deodorant has kept its promise to keep me smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> I Tried SO MANY other natural deodorants, many of them had fantastic reviews, but for whatever reason they just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> First of all, the one positive thing is that product as a deodorant worked better than any natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Not only effective, but it lasts much longer than the mineral based deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I think I put on too much and go through it really quick</li>
            <li> Green Tidings is excellent in controling odor--even being worn into the next day.</li>
            <li> Strong and natural blend.  </li>
            <li> The scent, out of the tube, was pleasant, but after a few hours of wearing it, I realized that it didn&#x27;t quite work with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> Will only be buying this from now on and highly recommend it to anybody looking for a great all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed because I had absolutely no odor after long shifts, intense workouts at the gym and</li>
            <li> On my first day, I think I applied too much, and my skin got a mild rash.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of keeping me less sweaty and smelly in the hot Texas summers.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I was happy that I had no odor and less wetness than with a normal deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have this on hand if it&#x27;s an exceptionally hot day I layer it over my Thai stone.</li>
            <li> and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> It absolutely works!</li>
            <li> It goes on a lot drier than other products I have tried so you have to get used to the increased friction versus more glide friendly products</li>
            <li> I had primal pit paste before which is my second favorite.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job very well!</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> just finished the first &#x27;try it&#x27;</li>
            <li> Have tried a few natural deodorants and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> Better than commercial anti-perspirants!  </li>
            <li> are that it&#x27;s a bit sticky when you first apply it</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an organic deodorant that really works for years and THIS IS IT!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it consistently because of the price</li>
            <li> I tried the Lavender first</li>
            <li> far as natural, unscented deodorants go - Green Tidings is the best that I have found.  </li>
            <li> You do need to use it consistently to give your body time to adjust.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> This really works for me!  </li>
            <li> I do a lot of public speaking and get nervous when i do so and sweat a lot too, especially in hot climates</li>
            <li> Thank you so so so much!</li>
            <li> However, for the first time in my life I have received darkened armpits from this product.</li>
            <li> If a have to shave I try to do it at night to be able to apply the deodorant next morning without problems.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> only downside for me is the price, but we can wait for a discount or something :)</li>
            <li> , it really works!</li>
            <li> I put coconut oil on my pits first, to help the product glide on easier.</li>
            <li> This really does work all day!  </li>
            <li> My first amazon review</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stain my shirts and also perfectly controlled my uncomfortable smell.</li>
            <li> Even when I&#x27;m really hot &amp; sweaty, I do not smell.</li>
            <li> And the fact that this product is organic, i doubted it at first</li>
            <li> That worked pretty well</li>
            <li> perhaps the essential oil makes it feel a bit more sticky for me?  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I was even willing to have more bo then usual if it meant it was better for my body</li>
            <li> I chose the unscented version which is exactly that...unscented.</li>
            <li> I got the unscented version, and it works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> I can say with certainty, this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> Good for a few hours, I guess.</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> We both sleep much more soundly with less tossing and turning.</li>
            <li> Having a drawer full of new deodorant packs that just do not work for me.</li>
            <li> Loved the deodorant especially the fact that you apply only a little and you are good for the day.</li>
            <li> At first, it seems like it may be too hard to spread effectively but upon contact with the skin it glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I found it really hard to apply it smoothly too, and I kind of had to dig in to get  it to spread.  </li>
            <li> Way better than any traditional antiperspirant and much healthier.</li>
            <li> it really works better than extra strength store bought deodorant!</li>
            <li> Next was Real Purity which was OK</li>
            <li> My 21 year old daughter is the one who suggested we try a more natural deodorant</li>
            <li> love this product so much that I always buy extra just in</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any adverse reactions to any of the ingredients either which pretty much sealed the deal for me on this one.</li>
            <li> Since this is aluminum free - which I love - and has natural ingredients I&#x27;m curious as to how the scented deo will be like.</li>
            <li> I then tried the Green Tidings unscented option and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> This does as good a job as any chemical laden deodorant I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I tried an all-natural, organic, made with essential oils version made by a lovely woman at the farmer&#x27;s market - smelled good in the tube but was not effective for me.</li>
            <li> Most deodorants irritate my skin, so my choices are limited.</li>
            <li> It certainly does the job as a deodorant</li>
            <li> So i was careful, I still had to wipe some off though because the stick is very soft and just kind of comes off a lot at once.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, I sweat very little, and when I&#x27;m hot or active, I sweat more, but it&#x27;s vastly reduced from before and feels very healthy and normal.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is the first natural deodorant that has worked for me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;TLDR - &amp;#34;Car restoring, project loving, bordeline republican stereotypical guy gives in and tries the all natural stuff for the sake of his health and girl friend and found true love in a deodorant that works better than anything he&#x27;s tried before.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I am especially sweaty and hormonal right now, with being pregnant, thus easier for me to get body odor under my arms.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when the deodorant is in a warm place it is a little tricky, I have to wipe it on.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I do a little more is wash under my arms to make sure that I wash all of the deodorant off.  </li>
            <li> It works really well for preventing odors</li>
            <li> I think I found a real keeper thanks all for your posts so that I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I feel much safer using a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t contain various chemicals but had doubts that a natural deodorant wouldn&#x27;t be able to beat the Arizona heat.  </li>
            <li> prevent smell that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my underarms are getting lighter in color (maybe too much info)</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This deoderant works really well with no aluminum, this will be the one I use from now on.</li>
            <li> Does not have much of an odor of it</li>
            <li> Is not irritating to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat much, but I feel like it helps with that as well.</li>
            <li> I prefer the unscented version since I don&#x27;t really like the smell of Lavender.</li>
            <li> I do feel like it gets used up fast,</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but I will not be repurchasing because the irritation is just to much for me.</li>
            <li> When wearing this there is not scent and that&#x27;s really what it&#x27;s all about.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this</li>
            <li> Being a guy, the lavender scent isn&#x27;t very noticeable</li>
            <li> This deodorant works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> we would much rather folks tell us the truth rather than flatter us with words.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t sweat much.</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up on finding one I could use that</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> When you apply to much, it will leave residue on clothes, but washes out.</li>
            <li> I think I was applying too much.  </li>
            <li> I was very hopeful that this would work, but it did not hold the odor at bay.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is a very dense stick and it is absolutely unscented.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant really works to prevent odor even through a workout at the gym.  </li>
            <li> Works really well, but it has the consistency of a glue stick.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Be very cautious in using this.</li>
            <li> so I either have to press harder to force it or lighter to be able to glide it around,</li>
            <li> I think this is a very reliable choice for an unscented deodorant</li>
            <li> This absolutely kills/prevents it</li>
            <li> The crystal works decent in mild weather but Green Tidings is much better, and even held up in 100 degree heat this summer.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses it now - boys use the unscented - girls the lavender.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li> The deodorant works very well</li>
            <li> Thanks for this deodorant.</li>
            <li> however, when I went on vacation to a tropical location that had weather in the 90s, the product was really greasy under my arms</li>
            <li> Using too much will prove to be a mistake.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t twist too much out.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Very sticky</li>
            <li> After much research I decided to try this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> The product is unscented and has been keeping me relatively odour free all day.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s also after intense workout at the gym.</li>
            <li> So much for options.</li>
            <li> I was about ready to see a dermatologist about this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I find that if I apply to much I get some what irritated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done w/ the stick I bought &amp; am getting ready to reorder.</li>
            <li> but then i didnt believe that it really covers the smell the whole day.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell, and I guess I wasn&#x27;t perspiring that much, either, because I&#x27;m also not noticeably wetter or anything.</li>
            <li> I even tried making my own with coconut oil and baking soda (which are 2 of the ingredients of Green Tidings) but it was kind of messy and burned my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I know if it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance</li>
            <li> -I have to carry a &amp;#34;sweat rag&amp;#34; with me everywhere which is really embarrassing and very unprofessional at work.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this deodorant as I&#x27;ve been using ones with chemicals for years.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem like an allergic reaction but if I had to guess I&#x27;d say my sweat glands are irritated or clogged... ?</li>
            <li> Finding a natural deodorant that actually works has been challenging.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different natural deodorants and this one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it a four since I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be sure it&#x27;ll work this great long term...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than regular deodorant and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Though Lavilin was pricier, it just couldn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s own against Green Tidings.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning to more natural &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and the chemical anti-persirants are far from natural.</li>
            <li> They will get back to you on what you can do to get through the adjustment period if you truly want to be better to your body and use a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched unsuccessfully for years for a natural deodorant until now!!!</li>
            <li> I am right now re-ordering a few more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now in hot weather, and it keeps me dry and odor free all day, with just one application.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on other more popular brands that you can pick up at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I live in HOT, HUMID, NORTH Florida.</li>
            <li> I like Green tidings because it is easy to apply (some natural deodorants do not have easy application)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wake up for anything normally!</li>
            <li> I was a little sceptical at first, like most people are</li>
            <li> (in addition to requests from many other companies items I purchased in that order — it&#x27;s not just this company that asks for feedback.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but seems to have a quality list of ingredients (feels like the healthiest deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used) and it works better than any other.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the idea of poisoning myself with aluminum and all other junk that is found in most deodorants these days, but I also don&#x27;t like to stink 2 hours after the shower.</li>
            <li> Works great even for my teenage daughter who is a heavy sweater!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, also, that while this will not prevent you from sweating completely, because it is not an antiperspirant and because your body is meant to sweat, I still find that it does a really good job of preventing excessive sweating and keeps embarrassing pit odor at bay.  </li>
            <li> all-natural and overall, does its job right!</li>
            <li> I have only tried the unscented and like it because I am often times sensitive to strong scents.  </li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews for this product before I ordered, but I was still surprised at how well it works!  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use your product for as long as it is available because  </li>
            <li> and I sweat way more than I normally would with or without any other deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It was my first time trying a natural deodorant</li>
            <li> This is my first ever deoderant that I&#x27;ve bought that was natural and unscented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep my review short and sweet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I want to be natural, I wasn&#x27;t convinced I would be able to use a natural deodorant (without an antiperspirant) regularly.  </li>
            <li> To start with I want to say that this is the first natural deodorant I have used.  </li>
            <li> I am a believer in this deodorant but at the price, I wish the last little bit in the bottom was more accessible to use.</li>
            <li> but then I end up not being sure if I&#x27;ve applied too much or too little.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a minor gripe over what seems to work as a very effective, long lasting deodorant.</li>
            <li> it really is good, but wow, this price is really hard to swallow.</li>
            <li> works better than expected compared to other aluminum free deodorants.</li>
            <li> He said it keeps him dry and odor free all day.</li>
            <li> Definitely less is more in application.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t keep me dry or smell free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, however I have tried so many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and none worked.</li>
            <li> I am glad I can now use a product with simple organic ingredients, especially being on my underarms every day.</li>
            <li> After much searching, it&#x27;s nice to have finally found an all natural deodorant that actually works and doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a wild flower.  </li>
            <li> I take Valium on a daily basis to deal with mild anxiety issues</li>
            <li> It actually works better than traditional deodorants.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the 2.7oz, unscented tube and that particular products lasted me about 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One quick glide to get a bit of product under the arm is enough.  </li>
            <li> In 2015 alone, have tried 4 different aluminum- free deodorants, natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get yellow stains on my shirts, and because of the potential healthy issues.  </li>
            <li> After Toms I tried another organic brand from my local &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; food store and that died out so quickly that my coworkers even mentioned something by 3pm</li>
            <li> There is one particular benefit of this product for me that will make me continue to purchase it despite the price.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this stuff- especially for not having any weird chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> It works decently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to finally find a product that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum and doesn&#x27;t actually have a scent.</li>
            <li> With growing more conscientious of health and wellbeing, I’ve been looking for a natural deodorant free of Aluminum, Paraben, and other harmful chemicals for a long time with no luck.</li>
            <li> I can live with that; just that it surprised me when it first happened.</li>
            <li> The first one was a spray, however the smell was too strong and I would end up smelly within a few hours.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different deodorants over the last several years to switch from my use of an anti-perspirant containing aluminum without much success.</li>
            <li> I suspect it would melt in high heat, so don&#x27;t leave it in your car in the summer.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> got the Unscented version and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never had that happen to me before, so I googled it, and it turned out to be the high concentration of baking soda in this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got high hopes that this brand will work just as well AND not cause a rash since it uses no baking soda.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> With high hopes and a bit of skepticism, I purchased the Lavender.  </li>
            <li> After one month (including a week in the keys in high 80&#x27;s sweating my butt off)</li>
            <li> If I use this as my only deodorant, the baking soda eventually causes a rash, so now I only use it as I strong deodorant if I have to do something that will cause me to really sweat.</li>
            <li> Now for an activity like this you would think some sporty deodorant or an old school brand like Old Spice (something so strong only your dad would wear) would work</li>
            <li> It works better than any other natural deodorant I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I love the explanation of each ingredient in the little brochure that came with the deodorant and how well it explains what each one does .  </li>
            <li> I have tried just about every natural deodorant out there, none of which have worked, until now!!</li>
            <li> but it did get a little better the longer</li>
            <li> With Green tidings, my clothes and I both still smell fresh and clean at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> As a consumer, this is the kind of communication and care from a company that I want my hard earned money to support.</li>
            <li> I was searching for an effective non-toxic deodorant for my pregnant daughter, who is due in October, and I found it with Green Tidings.  </li>
            <li> All natural deodorant tend to be gentle, and doesn’t work.</li>
            <li> This natural deodorant really does the trick.</li>
            <li> In fact, I really don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I could clearly feel it was all natural.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with natural deodorant, and I have to say I am very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly (not sticky), does not stain clothing, works just like (in fact I think even better than) &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I think this is worth noting, especially since summer is around the corner.</li>
            <li> Green Tidings is like magic to me.</li>
            <li> The FDA re-evaluating some of the ingredients in those traditional deodorants just confirms what many have been saying for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely does what it says it will and keeps you fresh.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m confident that it all will in a few months</li>
            <li> I tried all the &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; chemical deodorants, and none of them worked for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> it is TOTALLY worth it because I only buy it once a month.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only deodorant that keeps you fresh, even after sweating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have body odor or stink.</li>
            <li> and it also SO worth it for such a quality product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Green Tidings!  :)</li>
            <li> I hope that those of you out there with various medical conditions that cause far too much unnatural sweat will give this a try if you are looking for a more natural product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with normal store bought deodorant but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a complaint though since it works for me</li>
            <li> And I was able to get my boyfriend to start using it, he was a firm believer that it would not be strong enough for his manliness, but low and behold he loves it.</li>
            <li> Probably fine for other people, just doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously, what&#x27;s not to love?!?  </li>
            <li> However, I would love to see them try to introduce a few new scents - peppermint, perhaps?  </li>
            <li> It goes on pretty dry which irritated my armpit for the first week</li>
            <li> right here, I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a big deal right now.  </li>
            <li> Keep it in a cool, dry place and it will make the product firmer and easier to glide across your skin.</li>
            <li> Historically, I&#x27;ve used your run of the mill antiperspirant/deodorant (like Secret, Dove, etc.), and while they smelled good at first, I found that they just built up on my clothing, under my arms,</li>
            <li> but since I live in the Northeast</li>
            <li> I live in Phoenix and sweating a lot goes without saying...</li>
            <li> I just dismissed this because I wasn&#x27;t having any itching and just figuring that I was getting used to a new deodorant that didn&#x27;t have the chemicals my body was used to.</li>
            <li> It passed the &amp;#34; Hard work, very sweaty, day&amp;#34; test :)</li>
            <li> Green Tidings was far better</li>
            <li> The idea of having real lavender oil in my deodorant is a real plus as it actually has a therapeutic effect.</li>
            <li> I love this product, have used a few all natural deodorants and they stink compared to this (ha)...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I bought unscented, and it has a nice subtle smell to it.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the price , which for an organic natural product is worth it and the texture.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive</li>
            <li> After reading so many reviews of all the different kinds of natural deodorants I decided to give green tidings a chance based upon all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have definitely put it to the test and been very sweaty with NO ODOR!  </li>
            <li> and by golly its all natural!</li>
            <li> Oh my WOW!</li>
            <li> Needs further assurance, I used it for a week now with all vigorous excise to test the product -&amp;#62; it never failed once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure, but after using this for the past 2 weeks I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it works.</li>
            <li> The only reason I take one star off is due to price, which hopefully they&#x27;ll be able to reduce as time goes on.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> No odor even under hot stressful conditions which in my line of work is daily.</li>
            <li> All natural deodorant that works!</li>
            <li> I recently moved to Hot Arizona and need something that does the job.</li>
            <li> all natural deodorant is now over!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other brands and this one finally actually works.</li>
            <li> no messy fingers!</li>
            <li> However, I developed the rash under my arms that has been detailed in other reviews and it took quite some time to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> Some deodorants only work for the first month.  </li>
            <li> I do love the product so the two stars may be misleading, but it is due to a combination of several factors.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li> By far out performs any organic option today!</li>
            <li> I bought the unscented one because I usually wear perfume and/or scented body lotions and didn&#x27;t want to wear too many scents all at once.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd stick now and even though it&#x27;s a bit pricier than other deodorants, I find that it lasts longer than most</li>
            <li> I have had a growing concern over aluminum after my first mammogram and the fact that you can&#x27;t use aluminum antiperspirant prior to the test.  </li>
            <li> My face &amp; head are always the first to sweat, followed by my back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually sensitive-skinned, but I broke out in a full-blown rash with this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> and it seems there was a technical glitch that I did not get their first response to me.</li>
            <li> Have tried other natural products that didn&#x27;t do the job of enabling me to be odor free.</li>
            <li> I only hope that business is good enough that Green Tidings can continue to produce this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge Green Tidings advocate and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who cares about the products they use.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brand over other brands because it goes on clear, which means not as many white deodorant marks on clothing.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Tom&#x27;s, and truthfully only continued using them because they were a natural company and not because the deodorant worked as well or better than other brands.</li>
            <li> I used to use other natural deodorants (crystal clear, tom&#x27;s, arm and hammer natural) and none kept me smelling fine.</li>
            <li> THIS is fantastic, it glides on and lasts all day and washes off without that residue typical deodorants leave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first natural deodorant that actually works for me.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably, this product works better than any deodorant I have ever used, both natural and synthetic.</li>
            <li> lasted as long as can be expected, worked REALLY well, better actually than anything i&#x27;ve bought in a drugstore.</li>
            <li> Not from one use, but wearing the same shirt several times (between washings) a mild tint developed on the fabric.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with the simple, all natural lifestyle, but there was one thing that I just could not live without for not only my sake but for the sake of others around me (you&#x27;re reading this review, so you know what I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout)...deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I had any advice for the company I would say to make a clear version for evening attire.</li>
            <li> but clearly I returned this ASAP.</li>
            <li> The real test was not starting to smell at the end of the work day (office job) then changing to go to the gym.</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants (sticks, rocks...) and either stink or sweat hours after using them.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> A natural deodorant that works.  </li>
            <li> I got the unscented and am surprised it works.  </li>
            <li> I tried to find a natural deodorant, since I also found out that your body is supposed to sweat and antiperspirants block those pores so you can&#x27;t sweat out the toxins.</li>
            <li> Finally, I can go through the whole day without odor.</li>
            <li> because none of the natural stuff I tried worked.</li>
            <li> However, prior to using this deodorant, I was using prescription strength regular deodorant and allowing my body to sweat again takes some getting used to, and I have to be more careful about what clothing I wear to avoid armpit sweat spots.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll be on my search again for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a natural alternative.</li>
            <li> A natural deodorant and antiperspirant that is what I was looking for when I found this product.</li>
            <li> I have a whole stick left and can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> If you want a natural deodorant, it fits the bill.</li>
            <li> and I do have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have searched for years for a natural deodorant without aluminum that works.</li>
            <li> I then started trying all natural deodorants, but they would not work, I could smell myself if I started to sweat.</li>
            <li> It might just be that I have sensitive armpits, but I&#x27;m just putting this out there.</li>
            <li> I was advised by my oncologist to switch to a natural, no aluminum deodorant.</li>
            <li> This winter I took the plunge into all natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> All natural, no chemicals.</li>
            <li> $15 seems like a lot for deodorant, but since it actually works really well</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this burned my underarms.</li>
            <li> I almost gave up looking for a reliable natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone jus looking for a natural alternative for what ever reason.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of all organic, natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I have tried, looked, bought every natural deodorant out there and NONE of them work.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my 25 yr old daughter or I.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural AND it works.</li>
            <li> Point is, so far I can tell it has 24 hour protection.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to try a natural product, I would give this one a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and it will squeeze over the rim of the applicator, which is wasteful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly grateful for a company to invent a product that doesn&#x27;t just work, but has integrity with respect to quality natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural and do not stain my clothing.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product my whole family will use because it WORKS.</li>
            <li> oils to insure complete coverage.</li>
            <li> : I have never been skin sensitive to any product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> All natural, unscented, and all day protection ...</li>
            <li> I never considered myself to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> That  said, I was pleasantly surprised with how well the deodorant worked.</li>
            <li> Not having used natural deodorant before I had my doubts.</li>
            <li> my underarm area seamed drier which surprised me seeing as it has coconut oil in it.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with underarm odor, and have been on the search for a natural solution.</li>
            <li> However, if you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to find a deodorant that will last for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that putting a few drops of water on the top of the product helps apply it to the underarm immensely.</li>
            <li> After many attempts at finding a natural/non toxic deodorant, I finally came across Green Tidings.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily like any normal deodorant, but does not have the questionable ingredients I was worried about being absorbed into my body.  </li>
            <li> Just a week into using it I noticed a dark patch where I typically apply deodorant that was kind of scaly to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Our goal at Green Tidings is for our customers to be happy, and to resolve any issues you may have!&amp;#34; This is a company that appreciates business, wants a chance to make things right if a customer is unhappy, and values input from customers in general.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s own, less than a typical &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; brand does.  </li>
            <li> I was in Miami, outside all day in the heat and by the end of the day, the only smell was the very very gentle/almost invisible herb-like scent of the deodorant.  </li>
            <li> For the first 2 weeks, Green Tidings on the left armpit went up against Tom&#x27;s of Maine unscented on the right.  </li>
            <li> the search continues for a less harsh product that can be purchased at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the main reason I began looking for a replacement, and I was even considering going back to an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I only used it twice so far, I will give it a little more time before I make my final opinion.</li>
            <li> I used it until I developed a major rash.</li>
            <li> After several months of trying different natural deodorants, Green Tidings keeps me feeling confident through the day.  </li>
            <li> I expected to be like all the other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried over the years (there are a handful of mostly unused natural deodorants that I&#x27;ve given up on at any given time in my bathroom), but this one is definitely different.</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent to it but nothing noticeable and not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge improvement over the standard deodorants I&#x27;ve tried (which work for about half the day then seem to quit).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product, you only need a thin coat and it hardly has an odor.  </li>
            <li> The second one had a scent that was even more strong and didn&#x27;t cover the odor at all, so I would have a sweet funk to me, which I hated.</li>
            <li> The only negative is it doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly and has to be rubbed in manually if you apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> I love green tidings I was not sure when I first tried it</li>
            <li> I work 12hr days in a physically demanding job so my quest for an all natural deodorant that truly works has been challenging to say the least.</li>
            <li> I settled on a milk of magnesia deodorant that left a visible white stain under my arms after application (kind of embarrassing), stained the shirt if I wasn&#x27;t careful putting on the shirt, and &amp;#34;barely&amp;#34; made it through an active day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant because I&#x27;ve been getting burn marks and darkened armpits from regular deodorants and needed to try something new.  </li>
            <li> I quickly notified Green Tidings about the issue and received a new working deodorant in the mail a couple days later.</li>
            <li> Green Tidings, though, keeps me smell free throughout an entire day, even when I am sweating and/or working out.</li>
            <li> Personally, if the evening one weren&#x27;t completely natural I would still wear this one during the day and the clear version at night.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if any deodorant is being applied during the first swipe or so, so I often end up using too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a problem with odor asserting itself in the late afternoon when I was using more commercial antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants and this is the winner!</li>
            <li> The only natural deodorant that works for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty active person and this has worked well in all situations.  </li>
            <li> I still sweat and the natural smell of the product smells a little like the clay I used to make a volcano for my first grade science project.</li>
            <li> It worked great up until my arm pits reacted badly to the product</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this deodorant is a amazing.</li>
            <li> I would buy this product again and I expect this tube to last for quite a long time based on the density and how much I use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll go back to some of the name brand ones I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> It does seem to get used up faster than the non-natural deodorants, and is a bit more expensive, but I would definitely buy this again and am willing to pay the extra for the effectiveness and peace of mind that it does not contain harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews that you had to be careful about not putting on too much.</li>
            <li> My armpit skin has been sensitive and can&#x27;t handle regular deodorants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for over a year to replace my traditional deodorant with something natural</li>
            <li> Finally, a natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li> A week later, both of my arm pits peeled completely off.</li>
            <li> I tried numerous natural deoderants before settling on this one.</li>
            <li> Finally a natural deodorant that actually works!!!</li>
            <li> Worked well until I developed a burning rash on the third day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times and so far it works well.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned with the reviews that mentioned irritation, but I decided to take the chance since I wanted as natural a product as possible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely had to roll up the tube.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my standard chemical-laden deodorant with something that was natural and worked well.  </li>
            <li> An all natural personal item that works.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I developed a rash shortly after I gave birth</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY natural deodorant I have found that works for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorant products.  </li>
            <li> A natural deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li> I will probably look for a different natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> As a 32 year old athletic male, I may or may not be the target demographics for this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a natural deodorant that actually works....</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been searching for a natural deodorant that actually performs well and doesn&#x27;t cause skin rashes.</li>
            <li> All Natural Deodorant Extra Strength.  </li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are all natural and listed on the label, no big fancy chemical names.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the deodorant is like a paste, it&#x27;s not rough or anything.  </li>
            <li> I tried two different natural deodorants before trying this one.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear or with minimal residue, has barely any scent, and seems to work very well through an entire day, including tennis/running/</li>
            <li> Never have I used a natural deodorant (or even a regular store bought deodorant) that works this well.  </li>
            <li> Finally, an all natural deodorant that works...</li>
            <li> Most of them just made things worse.</li>
            <li> But I can use it as usual if it&#x27;s in a cool location.  </li>
            <li> I live in the South (and there is a heat wave going on right now), plus I just got back from a trip where I was hiking &amp; being very active in the sun &amp; heat daily for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Despite my perpetual state of sweat and previously using the clinical antiperspirants, I have easily adopted the green tidings and have been very pleasantly surprised at how well it works!  </li>
            <li> That meant I&#x27;d be re-wearing my clothes more often than usual with less frequent washing.</li>
            <li> I used the product for two days and found that I was moist, stinky and it gave my brand new white bra yellow stains in the armpit area.</li>
            <li> so I went with using it every other day for a few weeks and then was able to go to daily usage with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I want to reiterate a few things other reviews pointed out, because I read through most of them before I purchased (ultimately, that&#x27;s why I decided to try it</li>
            <li> was willing to go through the reapplications bus of the organic benefits, but once it stated burning, itching and turning my skin black, I had to stop.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I do something extreme or it&#x27;s extremely hot, I still only need to reapply it once.</li>
            <li> Especially after trying all sorts of other natural deodorant and not finding a single one that kept me fresh all day...</li>
            <li> I waited about a month and a half after starting to use this product before writing a review to allow enough time in case the effectiveness changed - but it&#x27;s been very consistent.  </li>
            <li> Pour 3% hydrogen peroxide directly onto underarms of a freshly washed dark t-shirt while still wet</li>
            <li> , only complaint is that it does leave discoloration visible on light colored clothing</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve ever found to actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, this has been the only natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a natural deoderant that actually works.</li>
            <li> I used to have to put another swipe of my old deodersnt  on before bed, but this actually does last 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s the only truly natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found that actually works.</li>
            <li> I switched from Antiperspirant to this because it is all natural, and Green Tidings really cares about the environment.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorants and this is the only one that works and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and the key is to make sure that you put a light coating on, not a huge thick amount.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, my armpits were just a little tender</li>
            <li> I first noticed a little redness when I got out of the shower a day or two after I started using it</li>
            <li> Then I got little knots that at first didn&#x27;t hurt but have since become tender</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now, but it is summer and in this time we&#x27;ve had excessive heat warnings but this product has worked better than any conventional antiperspirant &amp; deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I also love what it does NOT contain: aluminum, parabens, BPAs, gluten, and other icky stuff.  </li>
            <li> Without divulging my underarm secrets, I can say that it has solved a problem that my former brand barely touched with twice-daily applications.</li>
            <li> I had to unfortunately opt out for a deoderant with similar ingrediants but catered to more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to exhort future buyers to be aware and maybe if you are able, try the product in a part of you skin before starting the normal usage, in order to avoid this situation as it has been the most uncomfortable and painful irritation/skin burn</li>
            <li> Then i tried Green Tidings and from the first day i could tell the  difference .</li>
            <li> The deodorant is creamy and somewhat soft, only need a thin, light application.</li>
            <li> I do have trouble with application - when I first uncap it</li>
            <li> It took a few days of consistent use</li>
            <li> Green Tidings deodorant lasts for the entire day and when I wake up next morning I am still fresh.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about how well this would work but the good reviews convinced me to buy some.  </li>
            <li> I had already switched to aluminum free deodorants when I read their lanels and realized they were still full of bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> All day protection, easy to use, and it is non irritating.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews on Green Tidings, I decided to try it .  </li>
            <li> but with that mind, as long as i allowed the deodorant to absorb within a few seconds, I did not notice any stains on my shirts nor have i experienced any weird discolorations under my arms as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed as I thought I had found the perfect deodorant.</li>
            <li> Regular deodrants usually make me itch and do not feel right.</li>
            <li> this lead me to a trip to Ralph&#x27;s where I searched every deodorant and found the same exact active ingredient in every single brand except for Toms.</li>
            <li> Needless to say a deodorant is very important.</li>
            <li> There is a sort of balancing act: too much and it will goo-up and stink, too little</li>
            <li> Leaves a little residue but keeps the odor at bay even after an intense workout.</li>
            <li> If you think you may be even a little sensitive, steer clear.</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe that this natural product really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly the dry product I was expecting since it&#x27;s more of a compacted solidified mass forced into a twist dispenser so that it takes form.</li>
            <li> I live an active lifestyle, biking 5 miles each way to/from work each day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this is the only one that actually worked AND with which I didn&#x27;t break out (very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t go on clear will leave a white residue on your clothes if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old and after many years using heavy aluminum deodorants (secret, suave, etc.)</li>
            <li> even though it doesn&#x27;t have any added fragrances, you&#x27;ll notice when you put your nose right over it, it has a weird smell that I personally dislike, but you don&#x27;t smell it much while it’s on.</li>
            <li> Further testing to use another brand one day out of the testing period to see if it is the product worked, or simply because of the weather played the trick that I don’t stink -&amp;#62; test result, I stunk the day that I used other natural deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wish access was little easier than the screw on cap, and little less bulky or smaller sizes to be able to put in under a shirt if you forget to put it on with shirt off.</li>
            <li> I have tried other natural deodorants and was underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> This has never happened to me before with any other deodorant, and since I was all burned I started using baking soda with water as a natural deodorant because of the irritation, so I don&#x27;t understand what happened or what caused me this, as I am not an allergic person.</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed this will all other natural deodorants</li>
            <li> even other natural deoderants like Tom&#x27;s, Jason and Crystal  didn&#x27;t hold up like</li>
            <li> Have used other natural deodorant products...</li>
            <li> I have used a couple of other natural deodorants but none of them feel like this one.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t seem to melt or harden/dry up to a rock like some other natural baking soda deods...</li>
            <li> When I received it I thought I would test it against two other natural deodorants I had on hand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and one other brand of natural deodorant on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Usually about 1 to 2 hours of normal activity and no extreme temperatures, I could smell the odor and would reapply.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I got Green Tidings All Natural Deodorant after seeing a former teachers&#x27; recommendation on social media.  </li>
            <li> I took the (theoretical) half star away as I wish it was a little less expensive, and that the application of the product was a bit more smooth</li>
            <li> It would have gotten 5 if there were a clear version that didn&#x27;t leave slight residue when I wear dressy white sleevless tops.</li>
            <li> I have recently started checking out all natural deodorants and looking for ways to use less chemical products in my life.  </li>
            <li> I actually feel like I smell less after the end of the day than I did with my old over the counter deodorant.</li>
            <li> Thanks green tidings!</li>
            <li> I developed really dark pits.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Green Tidings!</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t flaky, it doesn&#x27;t smell weird, and, most importantly, I don&#x27;t smell weird.</li>
            <li> Thanks Green Tidings!</li>
            <li> I feel strange being the only one who doesn&#x27;t like this product</li>
            <li> Also, I get a sense that this tube is going to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> - didn&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> compared to how long the traditional antiperspirant sticks lasted me, but the positives outweigh the cost for</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t last for long time.</li>
            <li> I finally found one: Green Tiding Natural Deodorant!</li>
            <li> To deodorize laundry, including bath towels we add 1 c. white vinegar or 2.5 Kangen water OR peroxide with 2 scoops Charlie&#x27;s Soap + 2 scoops Hard Water additive per large load.</li>
            <li> I used all types and coming from Axe spray, I hear a lot of bad things about them I wanted to switch on something more natural.</li>
            <li> and I would end up smelling completely ripe before the day was half done.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a different form because it feels like trying to rub a dry bar of soap made of bark under your arms</li>
            <li> Green Tidings All Natural Deodorant actually works.  </li>
            <li> However, after a few weeks of use my skin developed a rash, became really red and inflamed, started scabbing, and became darkened/discolored.  </li>
            <li> I am both shocked and pleased at how well it works!</li>
            <li> It is not ideal for dark-colored sleeveless tops, though, as it does leave very noticeable white  marks, but its ability to fight odor far outweighs this issue.</li>
            <li> Through heat, stress, and exercise, Green Tidings kept me completely odor-free!  </li>
            <li> Green Tidings does not keep you from sweating (which is natural!)</li>
            <li> Green Tidings is my answer to a natural deodorant that truly works!</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t love is the packaging - the circular shape and the fact that it&#x27;s impossible to get the last 1/2&amp;#34; or so of product out of the bottom without using your fingers or a knife.  </li>
            <li> I have tried this deodorant in some extreme situations such as welding outside, wearing a leather protective jacket, in 80+ degree weather</li>
            <li> I have used a few other natural deodorants (last one I had to stop using because it didn&#x27;t work and left stains on my clothes).</li>
            <li> Goes on dry, not wet and creamy like the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s obviously more expensive than your average deodorant, it works just as well and gives you a piece of mind that you&#x27;re not hurting yourself with a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed that this didn&#x27;t work out as I was trying to be more health conscious.  </li>
            <li> if I use it everyday, I do have sensitive underarm skin</li>
            <li> I have to say, I am amazed that my underarms smell like nothing even after a long day and working out.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews for Green Tidings all natural deodorant and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I had minor irritation once from the product</li>
            <li> but those are not natural products either.</li>
            <li> and I have even gone for as long as 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> While sweating is a normal body function, it seemed excessive and I began to wonder if the deodorant was contributing to it.</li>
            <li> Green Tidings won with complete odor elimination.</li>
            <li> You want minimal coverage, otherwise you may have some white residue.</li>
            <li> So I have stopped using it and unfortunately went back to the regular, not good for you kind that also doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> Two week trip to Europe -- on my feet walking or standing 80% of the day long -- I sweat a lot even before I gained a lot of weight.</li>
            <li> I was sick of putting all kind of chemicals on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a dancer and even after a long dance practice my underarms are dry and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I figured I would use it for the time then go back to my other product, i didn&#x27;t expect it to work.  </li>
            <li> It lasts through all of my fitness classes and NO smell, no need to reapply, no irritation and you only need to apply a little so the product will last</li>
            <li> I tried numerous other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants that you can buy in stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m open to trying other brands though because this is a bit pasty for my tastes...</li>
            <li> I have tried Tom&#x27;s and some of the other brands from my local health food store with no luck.  </li>
            <li> other brand that I bought at the same time as this was the Crystal in the roll on and spray form.  </li>
            <li> Green Tidings can be a little difficult to apply, but it is so worthwhile to experiment!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give me a rash or leave my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> Well, even though this is just a deodorant I am bone dry with no odor at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This works just as well and keeps me dry without the harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Does keep me dry.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to relaunder soon after--I had zero fading on navy 100% cotton tees, but did not allow peroxide treated garments to dry.</li>
            <li> I am an active 6&#x27;8&amp;#34; male.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up a few months ago and went back to toxic ingredient deodorants,</li>
            <li> I used to use a regular &amp;#34;speed stick&amp;#34; until a few years ago I was constantly getting rashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why because I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After using the product for a couple of weeks I developed small boils in my armpits and have discontinued use.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of natural products in the past but have had no luck.  </li>
            <li> To avoid that I apply a small amount under my arms and then rub in with my fingers for complete absorption.</li>
            <li> Not sure what would have done this, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very oily and not very effective after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I was in ft. Lauderdale, Florida on vacation last week and this stuff stood up to the heat and humidity down there.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the large and two travel sizes within the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> Typically i would have to wipe off my deodorant every few hours with a wipe and reapply, but so far, no need to!</li>
            <li> Stay dry all day!</li>
            <li> It is the only deodorant I can use due to allergic reaction to all other deodorants.</li>
            <li> But this stuff works for a solid 6-8 hours or so, at which point I do sweat but much less than I would without it.</li>
            <li> The brochure references that you might experience some slight irritation as your body begins to eliminate aluminum that was used from prior products.</li>
            <li> I had been using Crystal Rock and Crystal spray previously but would be stinking by mid day no matter how I tried to apply the combination.  </li>
            <li> , the product seems very dry</li>
            <li> since I have a lot of allergies and certain scents make it worse.</li>
            <li> It  does leave white residue on my shirts and it is a little pricey compared to my stone</li>
            <li> Throughout the day, if I am stressed, I rub a little lavender oil on the back of my neck and it does wonders.</li>
            <li> a little dense, or perhaps sticky, going on but totally works.  </li>
            <li> So I may try other similar ones that have less ingredients.  </li>
            <li> After hearing so many bad things about the antiperspirants on the market, I stopped buying them.</li>
            <li> For this reason I recommend the larger size product, as with the 1oz size too much is wasted.</li>
            <li> It literally lasts 24 hours, you only need a few swipes -</li>
            <li> After a few hours, I did reapply because I could tell I was starting to smell</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d take a chance and try something else and after reading several reviews I thought I&#x27;d give Green Tidings</li>
            <li> I followed the directions from Green Tidings to the letter, but the rash kept coming back.</li>
            <li> You still sweat (which I expected) but there is no smell.  </li>
            <li> One application lasts roughly 24 hours, so there was no need to reapply half-way through the day.  </li>
            <li> After only 2 days of using this deodorant I got a severe irritation/burn which has been going on for a few days now.</li>
            <li> It did not really hurt, but I quit using it because of the discoloration and &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; of the skin.</li>
            <li> I think the problem for me with the Green Tidings one was the sheer amount of it.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t make me soaking wet or anything</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s time to shower again when I wake up there is absolutely no smell.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this product for a few days, but so far--PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Even after working all day and then working out afterwards, I smell absolutely no odor in my underarms.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the Unscented version of Green Tidings.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was amazed that there was absolutely no fragrance from the deodorant.</li>
            <li> Then for the next 2 weeks, Green Tidings went up against Lavilin deodorant cream.  </li>
            <li> careful though</li>
            <li> I tried quite a few products and they just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Green Tidings has finally ended the search.</li>
            <li> I have only had to use backup antiperspirant once since I began using the green tidings.  </li>
            <li> Application of this was difficult unless I was fresh out of the shower and still wet.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for several weeks now and it applies easily, is not sticky, and stops odor no matter what activity I have been involved with.</li>
            <li> My teenager and I have discarded many natural deodorants in the past, some with coconut oil base.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical in the beginning, but after all the natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried with no success I thought I&#x27;d give it a try after reading all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> but if I went to long I would smell a little bit.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this would do anything, but I really found that after about a week of using this I was staying quite dry and had no odor.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes have that with this product, but I noticed that usually happens if I apply after recently shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to coat it on like other deodorants.  </li>
            <li> No skin irritation either, as with some other baking soda-based deodorants.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin or clog pores of my underarms like other deodorants can.</li>
            <li> But like many others, it left me with a terrible rash for several days.</li>
            <li> You only need a SMALL amount of this product, 2-3 swipes and it will block odor ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> I never had a rash using any other deodorant.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will be when the warmer weather finally gets here but for my purposes, it might make sense to apply both in the morning and at night.  </li>
            <li> I would still sweat profusely, but even worse, smelled like a hoagie shop after 20 minutes of normal activity.  </li>
            <li> This worked extremely well, so well in fact that I convinced my husband to start using it as well.  </li>
            <li> my other reviews.</li>
            <li> I am gifting this product to other family members who are underarm challenged.</li>
            <li> Will definitely recommend Green Tidings to all my friends and family!</li>
            <li> the other deodorant I was using didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The other brand I got in roll on and in spray.  </li>
            <li> and then every other part of my body.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I contacted Green Tidings to see if this is something they&#x27;ve heard of before and if my body was having a strange reaction to the ingredients.</li>
            <li> had it not been for my other issues.   </li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants and was very disappointed by all of them.</li>
            <li> something is not right with this product; after a couple days, I noticed my underarm area looked a little strange.  </li>
            <li> Sad because this is the only natural deodorant I had found that worked all day.</li>
            <li> Other than the fact that it is a little rough going on, it seems to work as well as anything else I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I had used conventional deos for ages</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike conventional deos</li>
            <li> This deodorant gave me piece of mind without all of the added chemicals in conventional deodorant.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting an alternative to the heavily scented and not very effective products that are on the market.  </li>
            <li> the very first thing I noticed is that it leaves white marks on my clothes, I also felt that I didnt &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; as bad after working out and my under sweating was a little less.</li>
            <li> The only set-back I noticed is that the coconut oil sometimes dries onto my underarm hair and is hard to get off.</li>
            <li> The product is like hard solid soap.</li>
            <li> My husband manages a landscape company and is out working on job sites on average 10+ hours a day.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the price is a bit steep.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is as a guy with armpit hair it can get stuck in your hair.</li>
            <li> However, it left residue on my shirts, and after using it for several weeks I developed a painful rash on my armpits...</li>
            <li> , all of the dark skin hasn&#x27;t come off yet</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price.</li>
            <li> I am mortified to have dark armpits because of this product.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t glide on.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a deodorant w/o all of the harsh chemicals that actually works for the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> Like a few others I wanted to go the route of a deodorant that was minus the aluminum.</li>
            <li> So while my day job is behind a desk my interests take me far from it</li>
            <li> I do not shave my underarms and sometimes have overused deodorant sticks to guarantee coverage down to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes we do get a little (and very very little) sweaty but it feels great knowing that we&#x27;re aren&#x27;t adding another awful chemical to our bodies.</li>
            <li> days after I stopped using green tidings, the black layer started peeling off like dead dry</li>
            <li> and I still have the large red, painful welts on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> THANK YOU Green Tidings for a natural deodorant that WORKS ALL DAY EVERYDAY!!!</li>
            <li> I apply it to clean armpits once a day and it lasts all day, not one ounce of bad smell.  </li>
            <li> I wish Amazon allowed half stars - in which case I&#x27;d leave 4.5....</li>
            <li> For me, applying less &#x3D; no rash + all day and night protection.</li>
            <li> I did have slight sensitivity one time after shaving but not since then</li>
            <li> but it does neutralize the scent and after using it for 6 months I can say that I sweat LESS under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If anything, I&#x27;ve sweated less.</li>
            <li> I think I sweat less than I ever realized</li>
            <li> odd odor</li>
            <li> and I tried using less.</li>
            <li> It forms a slight coating under the arms, but it isn&#x27;t disagreeable and the coverage lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li> This burnt my pits black.</li>
            <li> I also found I seem to sweat less using their unscented version rather than the lavender --</li>
            <li> All natural products were even worse, until a friend recommended Green Tidings.  </li>
            <li> Lavilin - a gooey mess.</li>
            <li> I have tried Tom&#x27;s and other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; options from natural stores and they all failed, meaning the odor wasn&#x27;t neutralized.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it worked distinctly worse than other days with similar amounts of activity.</li>
            <li> after over a month of use I have developed a really bad rash under both of my armpits that sting and itches like no other.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately my armpits are left red irritated and feeling raw.</li>
            <li> Previously, I have tried Crystal, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Desert Essence and a few others.</li>
            <li> Even though it is not an anti-perspirant, I find that I sweat a lot less after just a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> I have tried &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; offerings from Toms (not the same since they sold the company) and the Crystal brand (too much mess and weak packaging).  </li>
            <li> Even if I still sweat a little, it doesn&#x27;t stink when I use this.</li>
            <li> this deodorant you do sweat a little</li>
            <li> I took off one star as I think it&#x27;s a little pricey for the size</li>
            <li> It is a little pasty</li>
            <li> My armpits have not darkened like they usually do with other deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Just a little.</li>
            <li> I had tried a few others with little or no luck keeping odor to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered for years from irritation after applying deodorant from different companies claiming its fir sensitive skin and still suffered from irritation and bad odor as well.</li>
            <li> I think a lot of people are frustrated by natural deodorants that simply don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now and have been applying it everyday.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear Tom&#x27;s or Crystal deodorants, no irritations with Green Tidings.  </li>
            <li> I have allergies to the store bought types and even a few &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; ones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a heavy sweater</li>
            <li> We found Green Tidings and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> He was so skeptical and didn&#x27;t feel the natural deodorants worked at all .  </li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with deodorants, I would develop a rash under my arms and end up at the doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I was a bit skeptical, but was pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for Green Tidings I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks of using Green Tidings</li>
            <li> I have been using green tidings for about 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like trying to rub a semi dried out glue stick under my arm.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have both switched to Green Tidings (unscented).</li>
            <li> After seeing this product on the green tidings</li>
            <li> Waste of $$.  </li>
            <li> and I never found one that eliminates body odor like Green Tidings does.</li>
            <li> Thank you Green Tidings</li>
            <li> I will use the product in the winter when I don&#x27;t have to shave my underarms everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be heavy handed.  </li>
            <li> This has it all without harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has worked as well as Green Tidings</li>
            <li> and I will stick with it for a few months.</li>
            <li> and I have now tired 11 different brands,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Which led me to the internet and then to Amazon and then to Green Tidings.</li>
            <li> A couple years ago, I bought a bunch of aluminum-free deodorants and found few that worked.</li>
            <li> so I stopped using it for a few days</li>
            <li> I started using Green Tidings again, and I have been using it for three weeks</li>
            <li> The Green Tidings Deodorant has even worked so well that I&#x27;ve forgotten to apply deodorant once or twice</li>
            <li> Did some research and found Green Tidings.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a waste in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I stopped using Green tidings because I ran out after about a week</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of days to get used to Green Tidings</li>
            <li> They either left those annoying white stains or required multiple applications.  </li>
            <li> But with Green Tidings, a couple of rolls in the morning</li>
            <li> I have been using the unscented Green Tidings deodorant for almost a week now without any worries about odor or sweat.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to like it, with its natural ingredient list, but unfortunately my skin just didn&#x27;t approve.</li>
            <li> The other problem with it is it&#x27;s so hard.</li>
            <li> skin.&lt;br /&gt;Not every product works for every person but at least give this a try when you have given up hope on all other forms of odor control.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> It did not say anything about going on clear, it just looked like it would, I do have to get another deodorant that does not leave white marks on my clothes, disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it keeps the bad odor away, down side is it stains my clothes tho</li>
            <li> I am unable to use regular deodorants due to health reasons and have been unable to find a product that actually works.</li>
            <li> I have to get used to using a stick again as I have been using a roll-on for the past few years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having to use it twice a day is only a minor annoying and not a complete deal-breaker.  </li>
            <li> not very effective for odor.</li>
            <li> I noticed dark dead skin crumbling off of my underarms while washing them!!</li>
            <li> And especially after you find yourself with pain in your upper chest because your lymph nodes are inflamed from a bad reaction to the pounds of deoderant you&#x27;ve placed under your arm.</li>
            <li> However, I still have to use the vinegar solution daily, even after several months of use, or I still get the painful rash.</li>
            <li> After years of trying numerous &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; deodorant and getting frustrated, i assumed there wasn&#x27;t going to be one that actually worked.</li>
            <li> A completely natural alternative to the toxic, chemical laden, mass produced corporate crap deodorant out there.</li>
            <li> This Green Tidings deodorant is everything I was hoping for: goes on dry, not sticky or greasy or heavy, no strange scent, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes, and is terrific at keeping odors away without any nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> usually when i find something i like or that works</li>
            <li> I chose the unscented one since usually</li>
            <li> We were looking for a natural deodorant to replace another brand that wasn&#x27;t quite cutting it.</li>
            <li> We ordered a second one and it arrived without fail.</li>
            <li> It has converted both my wife and I. No more deodorants that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I do have two small gripes and those</li>
            <li> I usually used Toms but even that started to bug me.</li>
            <li> Thank you Green Tidings!</li>
            <li> Over two decades of damage was REVERSED after a few weeks of using this product!</li>
            <li> Overall not impressed and over priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a safe deodorant that doesn&#x27;t break me out or cause some terrible rash, I think this is the one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of that evil aluminum clinical deodorant for many years because I sweat like a 400-lb dude with a wine hangover.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a trial to replace the Aubrey Organics Pine deodorant spray I usually use.  </li>
            <li> No more embarrassing moments.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Green Tidings!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews for products, but I have now been using this deodorant for 3 months</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it in the usual granola</li>
            <li> so it does not glide like your usual stuff</li>
            <li> It seems to clump up into small chunks when I sweat</li>
            <li> I have been using the deodorant for the past 2 weeks</li>
            <li> but this one does not leave as much behind as other products I have used.</li>
            <li> A thick layer of skin literally peeled off, leaving slightly raw skin below.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first because I struggle every time I have to buy one because if it works for me, 2 or 3 weeks after... it just stop working</li>
            <li> It is also very messy to apply as it is very thick and pasty and causes a mess on the counter and in your armpit.</li>
            <li> It said, &amp;#34;We are a small business, and reviews mean the world to us.  </li>
            <li> As some other people has mentioned this product also caused me a terrible burn under my arms, I spent like 3 weeks suffering in this process, after the irritation passed my underarm turned very dark, then that skin fell off and now I am almost totally recovered.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a single day it has failed me.</li>
            <li> knowing my baby is not right next to all the nasty chemicals in traditional deodorants.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have this bad of a reaction to the store bought sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and then I woke up several times during the night itching like crazy</li>
            <li> There is some common ingredient between the two brands that causes this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always used a national brand stick and never liked the smells</li>
            <li> I got the unscented to have to maintain the least amount of ingredients.</li>
            <li> Another negative is that it did stain my clothes.  </li>
            <li> The last disappointment is the price.</li>
            <li> Little sloppy to apply.</li>
            <li> thank you, Green Tidings!!</li>
            <li> but you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I accepted a long time ago that I&#x27;m a guy that loves to get his hands dirty</li>
            <li> The skin where I applied this has started to turn a dark brown very unappealing.</li>
            <li> The product is just too expensive and you receive so little.</li>
            <li> The instant you reapply it, any bad smell you might have had vanishes anyway.</li>
            <li> It definitely does what it says on the tin, but there is something in it that my skin reacts badly to.</li>
            <li> I still get a bump occasionally, but nothing painful or anything.</li>
            <li> I get really read, and its very painful.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with both forms of that brand but am surprised at how well I like the Green Tidings.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this rather expensive deodorant with high hopes and was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> , most leave me with painful burns, residue and end up making me smell worst than if I used nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> (But those were with brands like Secret, Dove, etc) .</li>
            <li> is unhealthy in</li>
            <li> Try to keep your roll out to a minimum thin line, when applying.</li>
            <li> Helps with odor but almost makes sweat worse.</li>
            <li> Just a thin amount..then apply.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t not experienced any irritation that some users have noted.</li>
            <li> I have used dozens of deodorants in my life and this is by far the worst deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Dirty, messy, rusty destroyed cars that leave you in the sun for hours at time dirty and drenched in sweat.</li>
            <li> It mattes up the hair and just generally feels terrible.</li>
            <li> Those that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, usually leave me sweaty and smelling awful in a few hours.</li>
            <li> Addition of baking soda makes it feel slightly chalky, but I suppose that helps provide base for stick formula.</li>
            <li> The screw on cap is a little annoying as sometimes some of the product gets caught in the threads and squeezes out the bottom.</li>
            <li> Bad product and not effective with me&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t stop odor break through either.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> I feel like the price is too expensive for the ingredients that are used.</li>
            <li> Not that it matters but its consistency is also a problem - sticky and uncomfortable to apply.</li>
            <li> even after TWO days that I didn&#x27;t shower because I was ill of an infection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive</li>
            <li> It is expensive.</li>
            <li> It literally kills me inside how expensive this deodorant is, but I have to hand it to GT, it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive :</li>
            <li> Pit paste-epic fail.</li>
            <li> It is expensive for a reason..</li>
            <li> but it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> It was awful but felt that was what was expected going that route.</li>
            <li> And left a nasty residue on my clothing :(</li>
            <li> All of them would begin to fail around halfway through the day leaving me frustrated.</li>
            <li> I have never done a review on a product in my life, but thought anyone that suffers from the embarrassment of underarm odor</li>
            <li> I plan to reorder for myself, my son and my niece who suffers from hyperhydrosis.  </li>
            <li> I admit I was very skeptical to try this product, but after reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, the bottom would turn but the deodorant wouldn&#x27;t raise up, making it impossible to use.</li>
            <li> stuff made my underarms itch so badly that I had nightmares about itching my underarms</li>
            <li> I have a bad reaction with scented deoderants.</li>
            <li> and I can leave after without smelling bad.  </li>
            <li> Works well for keeping dru, but causes bad skin rash.</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> and I broke out really bad from this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite shocked.  </li>
            <li> and I was so frustrated.</li>
            <li> It gets stuck to my armpits as I put it on and my hubby who has under arm hair says it tugs at the hairs which can be a bit painful.</li>
            <li> I was quite frustrated and contacted the company.</li>
            <li> Received it five days ago and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Rash :(  </li>
            <li> I highley doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed if you try it.</li>
            <li> but I  think spending $90 a year on deodorant is stupid.</li>
            <li> They were either absolutely worthless or needed to be reapplied after a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - it is an oil base</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked!</li>
            <li> - that&#x27;s insane!</li>
            <li> Shocking was not smelling or needing to reapply post gym and shower.</li>
            <li> It gets on lyrics 2 stars because the price is insane.</li>
            <li> After having a baby I was having horrible BO.</li>
            <li> As a man with armpit hair, trying to apply this stuff is horrible.</li>
            <li> AND I have terrible chemical sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> Polyester gym clothes are worst offenders.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I been using this deo on &amp; off because it works but I get a skin reaction if I use it everyday, I do have sensitive underarm skin</li>
            <li> Loved the deodorant especially the fact that you apply only a little and you are good for the day. I have been using this for about a month now and have been applying it everyday. No residue or any kind of irritation on skin. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll go back to some of the name brand ones I&#x27;ve used so far. No smell even after a full days work. I would definitively recommend this deodorant.</li>
            <li> The product works. After using it for six days, perspiration stopped and I don&#x27;t smell any odor.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; chemical free deodorants and none of them have worked at all for me.  I admit I was very skeptical to try this product, but after reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to try it. I have been thrilled with the results!  It works GREAT!  I sweat a lot and this stuff is amazing, I have NO odor at all when using it.  I have experienced some irritation, I&#x27;m trying not to shave right before applying it to see if that eliminates the rash.  I&#x27;m very impressed and would highly recommend it to everyone. Love it!</li>
            <li> I used to use a prescription antiperspirant but concerns about aluminum prompted me to try this&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it work well, I am doing good things for my body&lt;br /&gt;Truly a great product</li>
            <li> This actually works! I have tried other natural deodorants and was underwhelmed. This, however, did not disappoint! My wife tried it and liked it, also; we will be ordering some of the lavender-scented for her. Great product!</li>
            <li> This Green Tidings deodorant is everything I was hoping for: goes on dry, not sticky or greasy or heavy, no strange scent, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes, and is terrific at keeping odors away without any nasty chemicals. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, including 10 days on vacation where I did a fair amount of hiking (putting it to a good test!), and found it to be perfect. Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I have this on hand if it&#x27;s an exceptionally hot day I layer it over my Thai stone. It  does leave white residue on my shirts and it is a little pricey compared to my stone but it&#x27;s the second best thing I have found as antiperspirant alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants and this is the winner!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with natural deodorant, and I have to say I am very pleasantly surprised.  Historically, I&#x27;ve used your run of the mill antiperspirant/deodorant (like Secret, Dove, etc.), and while they smelled good at first, I found that they just built up on my clothing, under my arms, cause some irritation, and at the end of the day ended up not even smelling very good.  I thought I&#x27;d give this a try upon the recommendation of a friend.  I have to say, I am amazed that my underarms smell like nothing even after a long day and working out.  It does seem to get used up faster than the non-natural deodorants, and is a bit more expensive, but I would definitely buy this again and am willing to pay the extra for the effectiveness and peace of mind that it does not contain harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> So happy I gave this a try, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I was searching for an effective non-toxic deodorant for my pregnant daughter, who is due in October, and I found it with Green Tidings.  She is so pleased with the product that I just reordered and will continue to do so.  Great Product!  Thank you...</li>
            <li> omggggg. I put this on after I showered. I had read reviews that you had to be careful about not putting on too much. So i was careful, I still had to wipe some off though because the stick is very soft and just kind of comes off a lot at once. Then I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff made my underarms itch so badly that I had nightmares about itching my underarms and then I woke up several times during the night itching like crazy - that&#x27;s insane! I don&#x27;t wake up for anything normally! I don&#x27;t even have this bad of a reaction to the store bought sensitive skin usuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess it works for a lot of people. But  not me!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this one is by far the best.  Goes on smoothly (not sticky), does not stain clothing, works just like (in fact I think even better than) &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorant.  Highly, highly recommend.  My search is over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the packaging - the circular shape and the fact that it&#x27;s impossible to get the last 1/2&amp;#34; or so of product out of the bottom without using your fingers or a knife.  For this reason I recommend the larger size product, as with the 1oz size too much is wasted.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on other more popular brands that you can pick up at the drug store. This is the only natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve ever found to actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it does not keep me from sweating, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to. It isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant, it&#x27;s a deodorant and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also way better than at home remedies. I was using coconut oil + baking soda, which worked pretty good but after a while, the abrasive baking soda would irritate my underarms. NOT the case with this stuff!</li>
            <li> It works really well for preventing odors BUT the downfall is that for some like, it causes me to break out in a red rash under the arms. We had the same problem with primal pit. There is some common ingredient between the two brands that causes this. Too bad!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best natural deodorant on the market, and I have tried so many of them!  It literally lasts 24 hours, you only need a few swipes - I have definitely put it to the test and been very sweaty with NO ODOR!  Love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I feel strange being the only one who doesn&#x27;t like this product but it did not work for me. I was sweating more than I do with out it! I tried it for a week and then gave up.</li>
            <li> Hello! I have never wrote a review before, but I think this might be helpful for someone else. As some other people has mentioned this product also caused me a terrible burn under my arms, I spent like 3 weeks suffering in this process, after the irritation passed my underarm turned very dark, then that skin fell off and now I am almost totally recovered. This has never happened to me before with any other deodorant, and since I was all burned I started using baking soda with water as a natural deodorant because of the irritation, so I don&#x27;t understand what happened or what caused me this, as I am not an allergic person. I just wanted to exhort future buyers to be aware and maybe if you are able, try the product in a part of you skin before starting the normal usage, in order to avoid this situation as it has been the most uncomfortable and painful irritation/skin burn I&#x27;ve ever had in my life..</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple different all-natural deodorants, and this is the best one. I had a sample size of the unscented, and used it in the summertime -- the best time to really give it a go!  I never smelled a thing, and that was something I did not expect! I wore it to the beach one day, and it was very hot. After a few hours, I did reapply because I could tell I was starting to smell not so fresh, but what do you expect when you are spending the day sweating on a hot beach? The instant you reapply it, any bad smell you might have had vanishes anyway. Now that I am convinced this is the deodorant for me, I intend to place an order for a full size in unscented. I&#x27;m so glad I found this!  I never want to go back to anti-perspirant or chemical/toxic deodorants again!  But I thought I was destined to not smell fresh because of that decision. Now I think my search is over!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I felt compelled here to say something. Like a few others I wanted to go the route of a deodorant that was minus the aluminum. Was using Tom&#x27;s for a while even though it left me with flaky armpits and after 4 hours or so needing to be reapplied. It was awful but felt that was what was expected going that route. I thought I&#x27;d take a chance and try something else and after reading several reviews I thought I&#x27;d give Green Tidings a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased to report that it not only does it not burn or leave flaky residue skin it actually works as a deodorant. The real test was not starting to smell at the end of the work day (office job) then changing to go to the gym. Shocking was not smelling or needing to reapply post gym and shower. That has never happened with any deodorant. Well day three of using this and only applying it once a day and even after doing a sweaty cardio session i am still not smelling any funk. I think I found a real keeper thanks all for your posts so that I would give it a try. Now I will suggest my wife and teenagers try it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorants, but this one is really the best! It is not sticky but not too powdery. It doesn&#x27;t give me a rash or leave my skin too dry. They really got it right with this one! The only set-back I noticed is that the coconut oil sometimes dries onto my underarm hair and is hard to get off. However, I have noticed this will all other natural deodorants but this one does not leave as much behind as other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 6&#x27;6&amp;#34; guy who plays sports regularly and sweat a LOT. I wore Dove deodorant for years but the aluminum was taking a toll on my skin. In search of an aluminum free deodorant I tried Burt Bees and this. Green Tidings was far better and I highly recommend. I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I feel much safer using a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t contain various chemicals but had doubts that a natural deodorant wouldn&#x27;t be able to beat the Arizona heat.  So far so good...this product has worked surprisingly well!  I am very impressed and interested to see how it holds up to my sweat in the summer.</li>
            <li> Works alright. No irritation on use. Doesn&#x27;t mask/prevent smell that much.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as I&#x27;m heading to a retreat where everything has to be unscented. I figured I would use it for the time then go back to my other product, i didn&#x27;t expect it to work.  It absolutely works! I&#x27;m quite shocked.  I also get allergic to so many products, organic or not but this has given me no reaction.  Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> Finally! A deodorant that WORKS and by golly its all natural! Hallelujah. I&#x27;ve never been so excited to use a pit stick. There&#x27;s truly no scent. Very clean stuff. Worth it!</li>
            <li> By far the best deodorant I have purchased and continued to used! I have tried all sorts of &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants (sticks, rocks...) and either stink or sweat hours after using them. THIS is fantastic, it glides on and lasts all day and washes off without that residue typical deodorants leave. Plus it&#x27;s good for you an the environment. Keep making it!</li>
            <li> Oh my WOW! Lets start with the fact I have tried everything under the sun to get a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant to work. I LOVE THIS STUFF!! My sister told me about it and I was skeptical....well let me tell you this stuff works!! I have told and will keep telling everyone about this stuff! THANK YOU Green Tidings for a natural deodorant that WORKS ALL DAY EVERYDAY!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to find a deodorant that will last for more than a few hours. Having a drawer full of new deodorant packs that just do not work for me. Then i tried Green Tidings and from the first day i could tell the  difference . I will continue to use your product for as long as it is available because  usually when i find something i like or that works it becomes unavailable and the search goes on. Thanks for having  a great product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. I used to use Tom&#x27;s, and truthfully only continued using them because they were a natural company and not because the deodorant worked as well or better than other brands. Green Tidings is a whole different story. This stuff is awesome - no scent, and no weird sweating. It just works. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> With growing more conscientious of health and wellbeing, I’ve been looking for a natural deodorant free of Aluminum, Paraben, and other harmful chemicals for a long time with no luck. All natural deodorant tend to be gentle, and doesn’t work. I read the reviews for Green Tidings all natural deodorant and decided to give it a try.  I excited tested it on my workout day, after two hours sweating workout in the gym, I didn’t smell at all!! It is a miracle to me. Needs further assurance, I used it for a week now with all vigorous excise to test the product -&amp;#62; it never failed once. Further testing to use another brand one day out of the testing period to see if it is the product worked, or simply because of the weather played the trick that I don’t stink -&amp;#62; test result, I stunk the day that I used other natural deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am happy to say, I finally found the all-natural deodorant works!</li>
            <li> Been using this now for the last few weeks and am very happy with it, staying odor-free throughout the day and love that this product uses natural ingredients.  Will purchase again!  5 stars!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this deodorant and it is the BEST I have EVER used! This product beats anything that is out there right now and I will NEVER use anything else! I have always had deodorant issues and have tried everything out there including all the clinical strength products.  I am so happy that I decided to try this product because it truly is the best.  I apply this once per day and it lasts until the next day and possibly longer.  It lasts through all of my fitness classes and NO smell, no need to reapply, no irritation and you only need to apply a little so the product will last and it is worth the price! I purchased the unscented and love it.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my underarms are getting lighter in color (maybe too much info) but I think this is worth noting, especially since summer is around the corner. &#x3D;) I do not have sensitive skin so I cannot say that this will be safe for everyone but I highly recommend it! Never again will I purchase a different product...thank you, Green Tidings!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. I teach &amp; take hot yoga &amp; this has not failed me!! Love it! Bought one for my husband &amp; have shared with friends.</li>
            <li> This deoderant works really well with no aluminum, this will be the one I use from now on.</li>
            <li> I used it all weekend and worked my 12 hour nursing shifts without even once thinking about my armpits.  This is a GOOD thing.  Other than the fact that it is a little rough going on, it seems to work as well as anything else I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I decided to make the switch from the mainstream aluminum based deodorants to the natural kind recently and stumbled upon this brand and many others alike. After reading so many reviews of all the different kinds of natural deodorants I decided to give green tidings a chance based upon all of the positive reviews. I was a little sceptical at first, like most people are I&#x27;m sure, but after using this for the past 2 weeks I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it works. I was in ft. Lauderdale, Florida on vacation last week and this stuff stood up to the heat and humidity down there. I also move around quite a bit during my 10 hour days at work and by the end of the day, I don&#x27;t stink. I didn&#x27;t have any adverse reactions to any of the ingredients either which pretty much sealed the deal for me on this one. I&#x27;d give it a go. Unscented#</li>
            <li> This is what I have been looking for.  A natural deodorant that works.  I tried several others before I found this.  I now don&#x27;t stink again.  What a relief.  Its a stick.  I got the unscented and am surprised it works.  It goes on a lot drier than other products I have tried so you have to get used to the increased friction versus more glide friendly products but that is no big deal especially since this works and I don&#x27;t stink anymore.  I am an active 6&#x27;8&amp;#34; male.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and not bad for you like the store brands.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE natural deodorant.  I had primal pit paste before which is my second favorite.  This one seems to last the longest- as in all day!</li>
            <li> Great.  Effective as a deoderant.  I bought one for home and one for my locker.  No skin irritation for me.  I am glad I can now use a product with simple organic ingredients, especially being on my underarms every day.</li>
            <li> A very good alternative.  Not only effective, but it lasts much longer than the mineral based deodorants.  Does not have much of an odor of it&#x27;s own, less than a typical &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; brand does.  Is not irritating to the skin.  The only reason I take one star off is due to price, which hopefully they&#x27;ll be able to reduce as time goes on.</li>
            <li> I ordered the unscented and received the lavender.  The product works amazing!  If I put it on after my shower I don&#x27;t need to reaply until the next shower even if I skip a day. It gets on lyrics 2 stars because the price is insane. It lasted oily 2 months. I don&#x27;t know about you but I  think spending $90 a year on deodorant is stupid.</li>
            <li> This is great deodorant. The baking soda gives it a pasty texture (in a good way) rather than being sticky and gel-like. At first, it seems like it may be too hard to spread effectively but upon contact with the skin it glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 5 or 6 natural deodorants, including making my own. After hearing so many bad things about the antiperspirants on the market, I stopped buying them. I tried to find a natural deodorant, since I also found out that your body is supposed to sweat and antiperspirants block those pores so you can&#x27;t sweat out the toxins. Finding a natural deodorant that actually works has been challenging. I have tried Tom&#x27;s and other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; options from natural stores and they all failed, meaning the odor wasn&#x27;t neutralized. Usually about 1 to 2 hours of normal activity and no extreme temperatures, I could smell the odor and would reapply. I gave each brand about 1 to 2 weeks to see if it works. Finally I found this product on Amazon and although it was more expensive than the others, I decided to try it. Finally, I can go through the whole day without odor. If I do something extreme or it&#x27;s extremely hot, I still only need to reapply it once. I don&#x27;t sweat much, but I feel like it helps with that as well. I prefer the unscented version since I don&#x27;t really like the smell of Lavender. I literally smell nothing. The ingredients are great too because it has Magnesium in it, which is something your body can absorb since many people don&#x27;t get enough of it. The reason I gave it 4 stars, mostly because of my body type, is that the coconut oil can cause a reaction after shaving or waxing. My body doesn&#x27;t do well with anything oily, even coconut oil causes break outs. I sometimes have that with this product, but I noticed that usually happens if I apply after recently shaving or waxing. So now, I try to do that at night and apply this in the morning and it has helped a lot.I still get a bump occasionally, but nothing painful or anything. Overall, this has been the only natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li> I love it so far. This deo does it&#x27;s job very well! I tried it out like after showering, on a day where I didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere just to be sure I wouldn&#x27;t stink in public lol. And it held up very well!! I chose the unscented one since usually I have a bad reaction with scented deoderants. (But those were with brands like Secret, Dove, etc) . Since this is aluminum free - which I love - and has natural ingredients I&#x27;m curious as to how the scented deo will be like. even other natural deoderants like Tom&#x27;s, Jason and Crystal  didn&#x27;t hold up like this one did. I&#x27;m very happy I finally found a natural deoderant that works.</li>
            <li> Good natural deodorant.  I can&#x27;t wear Tom&#x27;s or Crystal deodorants, no irritations with Green Tidings.  The deodorant is creamy and somewhat soft, only need a thin, light application.</li>
            <li> I have been loving this Deodorant.  I do feel like it gets used up fast, but well worth it.  I do like the lavender one better then the unscented</li>
            <li> Finally found a deodorant that works! And it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is awesome. It contains no harsh or potentially harmful chemicals, and it works great. I recently went 72 hours between showers, with only one application of this deodorant, and I remained odorless the entire time. Amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the best all natural deodorant I have tried, and trust me, I have tried MANY! I finally gave up a few months ago and went back to toxic ingredient deodorants, because none of the natural stuff I tried worked. I figured they just never would and this would be the one beauty product I use that would be toxic. Then I came across this brand and read the reviews, which a lot were similar to my story, so decided to give this one a try. I&#x27;m not disappointed and very glad I did! I am especially sweaty and hormonal right now, with being pregnant, thus easier for me to get body odor under my arms. I also workout a lot. Despite both working out and being pregnant, I don&#x27;t ever have body odor under my arms when I use this! I&#x27;m shocked! I already told my family members, who have been looking for a good all natural deodorant, about this stuff and now I&#x27;m telling you...you won&#x27;t regret your purchase! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Best all natural deodorant yet!!! I&#x27;ve tried a lot too! Really works!</li>
            <li> just finished the first &#x27;try it&#x27; stick of this--- loved it! lasted as long as can be expected, worked REALLY well, better actually than anything i&#x27;ve bought in a drugstore. Have tried a few natural deodorants and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> I wish Amazon allowed half stars - in which case I&#x27;d leave 4.5....I waited about a month and a half after starting to use this product before writing a review to allow enough time in case the effectiveness changed - but it&#x27;s been very consistent.  This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far.  Most feel really sticky and I&#x27;ll start being stinky not even half-way through my day!  I have tried this deodorant in some extreme situations such as welding outside, wearing a leather protective jacket, in 80+ degree weather and I can leave after without smelling bad.  However, prior to using this deodorant, I was using prescription strength regular deodorant and allowing my body to sweat again takes some getting used to, and I have to be more careful about what clothing I wear to avoid armpit sweat spots.  I took the (theoretical) half star away as I wish it was a little less expensive, and that the application of the product was a bit more smooth - sometimes it bunches up a bit.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different natural deodorants and this one just isn&#x27;t the best. I do not like the texture, it falls apart as you apply it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this deodorant despite the price but unfortunately my armpits are left red irritated and feeling raw. I&#x27;m not sure why because I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin. The skin where I applied this has started to turn a dark brown very unappealing. I guess I&#x27;ll be on my search again for a natural deodorant. It does however stop the odor but I will not be repurchasing because the irritation is just to much for me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural deodorant for years, this is the best one I have ever used hands down! I have allergies to the store bought types and even a few &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; ones, most leave me with painful burns, residue and end up making me smell worst than if I used nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;The last store bought one I was using was Tom&#x27;s of Maine unscented and I would end up smelling completely ripe before the day was half done. This deodorant feels light and doesn&#x27;t have me smelling ripe even after 2 days! I&#x27;m normally a heavy sweater but this stays in place without need to reapply. This is true happiness for me and I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a natural alternative.</li>
            <li> When wearing this there is not scent and that&#x27;s really what it&#x27;s all about. A natural deodorant and antiperspirant that is what I was looking for when I found this product. I have been nothing but completly impressed and satisfied with this brand. I would reccomend anyone use this in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> The product works great! We were looking for a natural deodorant to replace another brand that wasn&#x27;t quite cutting it. We found Green Tidings and decided to give it a try. My husband manages a landscape company and is out working on job sites on average 10+ hours a day. He said it keeps him dry and odor free all day. We highly recommend this product. The only problem we&#x27;ve had is with the product packaging. When it arrived, the bottom would turn but the deodorant wouldn&#x27;t raise up, making it impossible to use. We had to cut the bottom layer of plastic out and manually press the stick up. We ordered a second one and it arrived without fail.</li>
            <li> not very effective for odor. Gave me a rash</li>
            <li> After much searching, it&#x27;s nice to have finally found an all natural deodorant that actually works and doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a wild flower.  While this isn&#x27;t an anti-perspirant, it is an effective deodorant.  When I first started using it, my armpits were just a little tender so I went with using it every other day for a few weeks and then was able to go to daily usage with no problems.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to create a healthy anti-perspirant as the concept of blocking your sweat glands from being able to secrete what they are designed to do is unhealthy in it&#x27;s self.  This is my third order of this product.  I only hope that business is good enough that Green Tidings can continue to produce this deodorant.  Thanks for making this, don&#x27;t change a thing!  Update July 2016: I recently switched from the unscented version to the lavender version. Being a guy, the lavender scent isn&#x27;t very noticeable do don&#x27;t worry about it smelling like a woman&#x27;s deodorant. I know that was a sexist statement but you know what I mean. Over the last year, our massage therapist has introduced my wife and I to the wonders of essential oils and the therapeutic benefits. We now put lavender oil in a diffuser every night in our bedroom. We both sleep much more soundly with less tossing and turning. Even our dog likes it!  Throughout the day, if I am stressed, I rub a little lavender oil on the back of my neck and it does wonders. The idea of having real lavender oil in my deodorant is a real plus as it actually has a therapeutic effect. I highly recommend this. And just for the record, I&#x27;m not an earthy-crunchy hippie type. I take Valium on a daily basis to deal with mild anxiety issues so I know what works and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> a little dense, or perhaps sticky, going on but totally works.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;m really pleased at how fresh it keeps me without the worry of what I&#x27;m smearing on my body.  Good product that does exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best natural deodorant I have ever used. Previously, I have tried Crystal, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Desert Essence and a few others. All of them would begin to fail around halfway through the day leaving me frustrated. I began to give up hope that I&#x27;d ever find one that could actually get me through the day. I kept deodorant at work as a back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier this year, I was about to leave on a 3.5 week trip to Europe with just one carry on bag. That meant I&#x27;d be re-wearing my clothes more often than usual with less frequent washing. I knew I needed to find a deodorant that worked and this is it. Green Tidings is like magic to me. I live an active lifestyle, biking 5 miles each way to/from work each day. With Green tidings, my clothes and I both still smell fresh and clean at the end of the day. I can&#x27;t think of a single day it has failed me. I can actually wear shirts multiple times in a row which was a lifesaver during my trip. I use the unscented variety and it is impressive that is succeeds without simply masking scents. I recommend this to everyone I know now. I think a lot of people are frustrated by natural deodorants that simply don&#x27;t work. I wish the price was lower but even so, this product is 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing.  Don&#x27;t have to coat it on like other deodorants.  I even was able to work out early in the morning and it still lasted all day and to the next morning.  Better than commercial anti-perspirants!  *Update--have been using this for over 6 months now--still zero complaints, working great, often longer than 24 hours, no problems during hot/humid summer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural deodorant out there, and nothing has ever impressed me until Green Tidings. This stuff actually works! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now in hot weather, and it keeps me dry and odor free all day, with just one application. No skin irritation either, as with some other baking soda-based deodorants.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin or clog pores of my underarms like other deodorants can. Unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t stop odor break through either.  I was hopeful but I&#x27;ve replaced it with Schmidt&#x27;s Cedarwood Juniper deodorant.</li>
            <li> If I use this as my only deodorant, the baking soda eventually causes a rash, so now I only use it as I strong deodorant if I have to do something that will cause me to really sweat. I use Real Purity roll on deodorant for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a great product. It has converted both my wife and I. No more deodorants that don&#x27;t work. I have purchased the large and two travel sizes within the past few weeks. I work out and no extra application is needed. Nice!</li>
            <li> It cakes on like sludge.  It also dries like plaster on underarm hair so when you shower the next morning your hair is all knotted.</li>
            <li> This works when everything else doesn&#x27;t including botox injections to stop sweating. No odor even under hot stressful conditions which in my line of work is daily. Works for about 10 hours before it fades in efficacy. I am never looking back at another product. I have been using it now for 4 months. I had minor irritation once from the product but I was  irritated from shaving. I have VERY sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Not every product works for every person but at least give this a try when you have given up hope on all other forms of odor control.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! :)</li>
            <li> I am not a smelly person by nature and I&#x27;ve always used a national brand stick and never liked the smells, they always seemed to smell more than my natural smell. This product has a miniscule aroma that is almost undetectable. It works great! I do have two small gripes and those are that it&#x27;s a bit sticky when you first apply it and it&#x27;s pricey compared to store brands but those are not natural products either. After using the product for a couple of weeks I developed small boils in my armpits and have discontinued use. I&#x27;m very disappointed as I thought I had found the perfect deodorant. Probably fine for other people, just doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant that&#x27;s good for you. I have sensitive skin and could not use most of the homemade recipes, but have not had a problem with this one at all.</li>
            <li> I use this as my day-to-day deodorant. There is a sort of balancing act: too much and it will goo-up and stink, too little and it&#x27;s useless. It would be great if they had more options than unscented and lavender (preferably something manly). Overall though, I will probably continue to purchase as this is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different deodorants over the last several years to switch from my use of an anti-perspirant containing aluminum without much success. They were either too sticky or ineffective against stopping odor by the end of the day. This product was recommended by one of my family members as solution to those problems. I have been using this deodorant for several weeks now and it applies easily, is not sticky, and stops odor no matter what activity I have been involved with. I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am both shocked and pleased at how well it works! I expected to be like all the other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried over the years (there are a handful of mostly unused natural deodorants that I&#x27;ve given up on at any given time in my bathroom), but this one is definitely different. There&#x27;s no odor, not even by the time I&#x27;m stepping back into the shower again. It&#x27;s incredible! I am totally throwing out all of the others I&#x27;ve experimented with. I want to reiterate a few things other reviews pointed out, because I read through most of them before I purchased (ultimately, that&#x27;s why I decided to try it, I decided that many people couldn&#x27;t be promoting a product that didn&#x27;t really work.) Definitely less is more in application. On my first day, I think I applied too much, and my skin got a mild rash. I have severe allergies and sensitive skin, so I just need to be careful, I imagine most people won&#x27;t have to deal with this. For me, applying less &#x3D; no rash + all day and night protection. Also, I did receive an email request from the company to leave a review (in addition to requests from many other companies items I purchased in that order — it&#x27;s not just this company that asks for feedback.) It said, &amp;#34;We are a small business, and reviews mean the world to us.  We would like to thank you for being a customer!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Are you not 100% happy with your purchase?  Do you have any questions, comments or feedback?  Please email us and let us know!  Our goal at Green Tidings is for our customers to be happy, and to resolve any issues you may have!&amp;#34; This is a company that appreciates business, wants a chance to make things right if a customer is unhappy, and values input from customers in general. As a consumer, this is the kind of communication and care from a company that I want my hard earned money to support.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants in the past and they were ok at best .  After reading all the positive reviews on Green Tidings, I decided to try it .  This product is amazing .  It works so well.  I love the explanation of each ingredient in the little brochure that came with the deodorant and how well it explains what each one does .  I begged my husband to give the deodorant try.  He was so skeptical and didn&#x27;t feel the natural deodorants worked at all .  He is now a believer .  It&#x27;s so nice to find a product that works so well and is so healthy .  Thank you for creating this product .</li>
            <li> I have used a few other natural deodorants (last one I had to stop using because it didn&#x27;t work and left stains on my clothes). I had great hopes for this one owing to the excellent reviews. It seemed to work well for a while, enough so that I returned to Amazon to buy 2 of the larger deodorant sticks. It was great because I didn&#x27;t smell at the end of the day. However, I had to stop using this deodorant after getting a rash in my armpits every time I worked out or sweated even a bit. I followed the directions from Green Tidings to the letter, but the rash kept coming back. I have a whole stick left and can&#x27;t use it. Sigh. On to the next one.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective deodorant that I have ever used. Way better than any traditional antiperspirant and much healthier. It&#x27;s amazing that a natural product can be so good.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants and was very disappointed by all of them. i am trying to go natural with most things i use daily and am so glad i found this! It took some time to get used to it and i actually got an itchy bumpy rash for about a week. it is gone now and i have no body odor even when it is 90 degrees and i am sweating like a piggy. it is not an antiperspirant  but that is ok. i mostly wanted to odor control without chemicals and i found it!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is absolutely wonderful!!! I have finally found a natural deoderant that actually works. I used to have to put another swipe of my old deodersnt  on before bed, but this actually does last 24 hours. The only negative is that the price is a bit steep.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Even if I still sweat a little, it doesn&#x27;t stink when I use this.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! I have tried a couple of natural products in the past but have had no luck.  I have been using this product for about a month now and it&#x27;s worked great.  You still sweat (which I expected) but there is no smell.  I&#x27;m a pretty active person and this has worked well in all situations.  I&#x27;m honestly amazed that a natural product can be this effective!</li>
            <li> This is a great product with great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant goes on smooth and does not irritate my skin at all.  Even though it is not an anti-perspirant, I find that I sweat a lot less after just a few days of use.  The best part is there is almost no BO even after a full day of use - even after sweating!  I don&#x27;t know how they figured that part out but they did.  As for the customer service, the mechanism on my first tube was damaged, and I had to manually push the product up, which didn&#x27;t work out that great.  I let them know about it - and promptly received an email from Jennifer offering to send me a free replacement (which they did).  I have since ordered another 2.7oz and a 1oz for travel.  I am completely sold on this product and so happy to be using something natural!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works very well for me.  Sometimes I have experienced after time, for some reason, deodorants quit working.  Not so for this one.  The only negative is it doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly and has to be rubbed in manually if you apply too much pressure.  If you want a natural deodorant, it fits the bill.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is the first natural deodorant that has worked for me! But like many others, it left me with a terrible rash for several days. I then tried the vinegar mixture before I applied the deodorant and that has greatly helped. However, I still have to use the vinegar solution daily, even after several months of use, or I still get the painful rash. I feel like the price is too expensive for the ingredients that are used. But since I don&#x27;t want aluminum going under my arms, I am still using the product.&lt;br /&gt;Frustration:  Customers can only get a discount when ordering this product if they rate it 5 Stars in their reviews!!!  Now I have to evaluate the motives of the company. Do they want honest opinions from the clients who purchase their products? Or, are they really interested in getting rave reviews to sell more  We are involved in business and we would much rather folks tell us the truth rather than flatter us with words. So with that being said...the search continues for a less harsh product that can be purchased at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> All natural deodorant that works!</li>
            <li> I went out of my way to review this ..it is that good..I am always playing sports or at the gym and this stuff is amazing..it really works better than extra strength store bought deodorant! Highly Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I used to use a regular &amp;#34;speed stick&amp;#34; until a few years ago I was constantly getting rashes.  For awhile I used nothing and was smelly.  Then for awhile I&#x27;d been using cotton balls and milk of magnesia (which works, but is a hassle).  This is convenient and comfy.  I suspect it would melt in high heat, so don&#x27;t leave it in your car in the summer.  And, most importantly, keeps me from smelling.  Woo!</li>
            <li> works better than expected compared to other aluminum free deodorants. will buy again.</li>
            <li> Green Tidings All Natural Deodorant actually works.  I was sick of putting all kind of chemicals on my skin.  I was skeptical this would do anything, but I really found that after about a week of using this I was staying quite dry and had no odor.  Works for me!</li>
            <li> It works! Love this product. Ordered one more for my teenager son. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best all natural deodorant I have found, and I have tried a lot of different brands.  Through heat, stress, and exercise, Green Tidings kept me completely odor-free!  One application lasts roughly 24 hours, so there was no need to reapply half-way through the day.  It is not ideal for dark-colored sleeveless tops, though, as it does leave very noticeable white  marks, but its ability to fight odor far outweighs this issue. It comes with a warning that you should not use it after shaving your armpits, but I do, and I have not had any issues with burning/stinging and I do have sensitive skin.  I will definitely be buying this deodorant again and again!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My armpit skin has been sensitive and can&#x27;t handle regular deodorants. I usually used Toms but even that started to bug me. So I found this. It&#x27;s amazing. I got the unscented to have to maintain the least amount of ingredients. It works well. My skin feels fine and I don&#x27;t sweat much. When I do sweat it doesn&#x27;t stink so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Great product!!!  Best protection from odor, in a natural product, I have ever experienced.  Will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> The BEST deodorant I have ever used by any company ever. The fact that it&#x27;s not killing me is honestly a bonus!</li>
            <li> The formula is excellent - lasts all day and then some! The screw on cap is a little annoying as sometimes some of the product gets caught in the threads and squeezes out the bottom.</li>
            <li> Excellent because it is all natural. It is the only deodorant I can use due to allergic reaction to all other deodorants.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deoderant out there! Works great for me and a little goes along way. I love that it comes unscented. I&#x27;m not a fan of smelly deodarants that compete with cologne.&lt;br /&gt;One application lasts all day for me. Only complaint is as a guy with armpit hair it can get stuck in your hair. To avoid that I apply a small amount under my arms and then rub in with my fingers for complete absorption.</li>
            <li> all-natural and overall, does its job right!</li>
            <li> After only 2 days of using this deodorant I got a severe irritation/burn which has been going on for a few days now. It&#x27;s not going away and my armpits look like they have been burned. I am a male so this is not associated with shaving.  Not that it matters but its consistency is also a problem - sticky and uncomfortable to apply. I have used dozens of deodorants in my life and this is by far the worst deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  I have searched for years for a natural deodorant without aluminum that works. I have battled underarm&lt;br /&gt;odor forever as well as the odor left on my clothes. I could hardly believe that this natural product really works. No odor and no smell on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I got the Unscented version and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this product, have used a few all natural deodorants and they stink compared to this (ha)...in fact this is better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve used, ever.... 2 weeks of use and not 1 unpleasant sniff or sticky squirmy slimy underarm feeling. 100% recommended, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Stop looking for another deodarant. THIS IS IT. After trying almost every deodarant out there that claims to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, I tried this one, and I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER AGAIN. Yard work in the heat? You won&#x27;t reek! So excited! Worth every penny!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this deodorant!!! I sweat a lot and only need to use this once a day to keep the odor away!! It&#x27;s amazing!! And healthy!!</li>
            <li> I love this deodrant! Regular deodrants usually make me itch and do not feel right. This one feels amazing. I love that it lasts a while on and is super soft and also does not effect your clothes. Will definitely be purchasing again! Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Great product. It really works better than regular deodorants and it&#x27;s good for you. Will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for over a year to replace my traditional deodorant with something natural so I wouldn&#x27;t be putting Aluminum and Polyglycol etc in my body. The FDA re-evaluating some of the ingredients in those traditional deodorants just confirms what many have been saying for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first natural deodorant that actually works for me. I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Herban Cowboy, a bunch of health food store brands -- all with no luck. Most of them just made things worse. But this stuff works for a solid 6-8 hours or so, at which point I do sweat but much less than I would without it. It actually works better than traditional deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought unscented, and it has a nice subtle smell to it. Nothing too strong. I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Very oily and not very effective after a few hours.  Does get itchy at times too.  Good for a few hours, I guess.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I don&#x27;t write reviews but this has surpassed my expectations and I  would definitely recommend it. No underarm odor and irritation! Will continue using it and post another review in a couple months</li>
            <li> Excellent natural deodorant. I have used many others, Tom&#x27;s etc. and they never last. This does as good a job as any chemical laden deodorant I&#x27;ve used in the past. Goes on dry, not wet and creamy like the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products. Finally, a natural deodorant that actually works. Definitely worth the price of admission!</li>
            <li> Great deodorant! I know it is more expensive than others, but it actually works and won&#x27;t harm you, so if you can fit it into your budget, I think it is worth it. I used to use other natural deodorants (crystal clear, tom&#x27;s, arm and hammer natural) and none kept me smelling fine. Green Tidings, though, keeps me smell free throughout an entire day, even when I am sweating and/or working out. Love it.</li>
            <li> Omg. This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> something is not right with this product; after a couple days, I noticed my underarm area looked a little strange.  Not necessarily discolored, but crackly. It did not really hurt, but I quit using it because of the discoloration and &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; of the skin. A week later, both of my arm pits peeled completely off. A thick layer of skin literally peeled off, leaving slightly raw skin below. It was not painful, but I cannot believe the product was good for me if it caused that severe of a burn.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been using for years</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with deodorants, I would develop a rash under my arms and end up at the doctor&#x27;s office.  I then started trying all natural deodorants, but they would not work, I could smell myself if I started to sweat. I was ready to give up on finding one I could use that would actually  work. I then tried this deodorant and it works the best of anything I have ever used. If you have had problems with deodorants like I have, you must give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to love this deodorant. It&#x27;s the most effective &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a decent amount of them. Definitely does what it says it will and keeps you fresh. However, it left residue on my shirts, and after using it for several weeks I developed a painful rash on my armpits... I&#x27;d never had that happen to me before, so I googled it, and it turned out to be the high concentration of baking soda in this. I know it was from this deodorant because it went away as soon as I switched to something without baking soda in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use the Arm &amp; Hammer aluminum-free deodorant, which also has baking soda, and didn&#x27;t have any irritation from that. I think the problem for me with the Green Tidings one was the sheer amount of it. It might just be that I have sensitive armpits, but I&#x27;m just putting this out there. If you have easily-irritated skin, this one might not work for you...</li>
            <li> This natural deodorant really does the trick. I use it in the morning, and it last all day. the delivery was on time and the package was secured. I will be ordering from this seller again!  Thanks again</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant. It was my first time trying a natural deodorant and I am glad that I did. It works really well. I also love that it truly is unscented, since I have a lot of allergies and certain scents make it worse.</li>
            <li> After transitioning from toxic big brands, i am never looking back. Thanks green tidings for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> It works! Love it.  I am right now re-ordering a few more.</li>
            <li> I tried numerous natural deoderants before settling on this one. Works great, keeps me dry all day and smell free. I had ordered the unscented but recieved the lavender by mistake. The good news is that the lavender isnt overpowering at all, and in fact, I dont notice the smell beyond first application. I have been impressed with this product so far, usually I feel confident applying it once a day, if I work out, I may apply once more for extra caution. have never had a stinky day while using this.</li>
            <li> Try using sparingly. Try to keep your roll out to a minimum thin line, when applying. When you apply to much, it will leave residue on clothes, but washes out. This is the best product that I use for everyday use and all day deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I did have slight sensitivity one time after shaving but not since then and it&#x27;s been a couple of months.  I think I was applying too much.  This stuff lasts forever and you don&#x27;t have to use that much - sweet!</li>
            <li> Great product! Have used other natural deodorant products...this one is definitely the best!!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is by far is the best deodorant I have ever tried. It is unscented and actually works. And I was able to get my boyfriend to start using it, he was a firm believer that it would not be strong enough for his manliness, but low and behold he loves it.</li>
            <li> It works well and does what its supposed too, but the only issue is that I have an reaction too it. I tried it for over a week to see if it would get used to it and go away but it never did. I get really read, and its very painful.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants and this, by far, is the best! Leaves a little residue but keeps the odor at bay even after an intense workout. LOVE that it includes magnesium oil! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this deodorant. Without divulging my underarm secrets, I can say that it has solved a problem that my former brand barely touched with twice-daily applications. It doesn&#x27;t look impressive, it has no scent, but it is effective, neat, and easily applied. Three cheers!</li>
            <li> Great product~ I went to Gym 4-5 times weekly. Since I started to use this deodorant, it worked well. I will continue to order it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, and I&#x27;ve tried just about ever natural deodorant out there over the years. Really worth the price.</li>
            <li> I really like the green tidings deodorant. It lasts all day and keeps me smelling fresh. I would say it definitely does the job. Especially after trying all sorts of other natural deodorant and not finding a single one that kept me fresh all day...till now! Thanks green tidings!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I recently read an article on the dangers of the chemicals in antiperspirants and went searching for an organic deodorant. I recently moved to Hot Arizona and need something that does the job. Well, even though this is just a deodorant I am bone dry with no odor at the end of the day. The only downside is the price , which for an organic natural product is worth it and the texture. Not that smooth to run under your arms. With that all said, I will continue to use this product and tell as many people as I can to use it also.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is absolutely awesome and just what I was looking for. A completely natural alternative to the toxic, chemical laden, mass produced corporate crap deodorant out there. Thank you Green Tidings! I will be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> great product! please don&#x27;t change formula.</li>
            <li> Very nice product that works very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty good. I&#x27;ll admit that I was a bit skeptical, but was pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  No smell,  ahhhhh</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at ALL. And left a nasty residue on my clothing :(</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. I was advised by my oncologist to switch to a natural, no aluminum deodorant. I was very hopeful that this would work, but it did not hold the odor at bay. It is also very messy to apply as it is very thick and pasty and causes a mess on the counter and in your armpit.</li>
            <li> LOVE this natural deodorant!  I had tried a few others with little or no luck keeping odor to a minimum.  This product is great!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an organic deodorant that really works for years and THIS IS IT! I sat in a non-air conditioned auditorium for two hours sweating to death and came out smelling like a rose. Couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> This winter I took the plunge into all natural deodorants. Initially, I tried making my own then moved to Tom&#x27;s which I did not like. Next was Real Purity which was OK but if I went to long I would smell a little bit. After reading the reviews for Green Tidings I decided to give it a try. I LOVE this deodorant. I can go well over 24 hours without odor. I am now purchasing my 3rd bottle and could not be more pleased. I am thankful the search for a GOOD all natural deodorant is now over!</li>
            <li> Finally a natural deodorant that actually works!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants in search of the best one.  I have only been using this for a couple weeks but it seems to be working great.  No odor at all, I bought the uncounted version.  Definitely worth a try to see if it works for your body.</li>
            <li> I like this more than the lavender scented one. Does a good job of keeping me less sweaty and smelly in the hot Texas summers.Love that it is chemical free.I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a natural deodorant that actually works. I refuse to use the mainstream deodorants and have had the consequence of smelling for quite some time. I have tried so many other brands and this one finally actually works. I gave up hope a while ago but thankfully gave thus a try. I got the unscented and my wife and I both use it which has made us and everyone around us very happy.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants and this is, by far, the best.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant. I searched for an alternative to my regular name brand when I read the ingredients and was horrified. This works just as well and keeps me dry without the harmful ingredients. I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is amazing!! I refuse to use anything with chemicals and have tried many many natural versions. Nothing works like this one. It&#x27;s unscented, moisturizing, and lasts all day. It&#x27;s some kind of miracle formula. All natural, no chemicals. You MUST give it a try!</li>
            <li> This really works!!  Just love it. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used! Pricy, I know, but I guarantee its worth every penny. I&#x27;m 22 years old and after many years using heavy aluminum deodorants (secret, suave, etc.) I developed really dark pits. Almost 5-6 shades darker than my skin tone. After about 3 weeks of using Green Tidings I was really impressed because I had absolutely no odor after long shifts, intense workouts at the gym and even after TWO days that I didn&#x27;t shower because I was ill of an infection. But what impressed me the most was one day in the shower I noticed dark dead skin crumbling off of my underarms while washing them!! My pits were noticeably lighter after my shower! Over two decades of damage was REVERSED after a few weeks of using this product! I love it! I haven&#x27;t been using it consistently because of the price BUT I will invest in the one ounce probably every month because this is the best product for my pits, all of the dark skin hasn&#x27;t come off yet but I&#x27;m confident that it all will in a few months and I&#x27;ll have an even tone. You only need a SMALL amount of this product, 2-3 swipes and it will block odor ALL DAY. Buy this now!</li>
            <li> $15 seems like a lot for deodorant, but since it actually works really well it is completely worth it. Most deodorants irritate my skin, so my choices are limited. Those that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, usually leave me sweaty and smelling awful in a few hours. I have been using this for about a week, and it does exactly what a deodorant is supposed to do without destroying my skin, and it&#x27;s the absolute best!</li>
            <li> I have tried &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; offerings from Toms (not the same since they sold the company) and the Crystal brand (too much mess and weak packaging).  I then tried the Green Tidings unscented option and have been very pleased.  It goes on easily like any normal deodorant, but does not have the questionable ingredients I was worried about being absorbed into my body.  I expect to be sticking with this product for some time to come!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this burned my underarms. It also didn&#x27;t prevent me from smelling by the end of the work day and I work in an office.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.  I still sweat but it does neutralize odor.  I also love the texture.  After I swipe, I use my hands to smooth it like a crest.  There&#x27;s no odor or residue.  Super cool!  I&#x27;d like to suggest to the sellers to roduce in 2 pack for a better value.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive so I will likely continue to search for alternate solution.</li>
            <li> Helps with odor but almost makes sweat worse. Overall not impressed and over priced.</li>
            <li> Worked well until I developed a burning rash on the third day. I never had a rash using any other deodorant. If you think you may be even a little sensitive, steer clear.</li>
            <li> I have to give this deodorant a strong four stars. I would do 4 1/2 if I could. It would have gotten 5 if there were a clear version that didn&#x27;t leave slight residue when I wear dressy white sleevless tops. I almost gave up looking for a reliable natural deodorant. This was going to be my last try and I&#x27;m very glad it works! I tend to wear deodorants for about a year and then they stop working for me and I&#x27;m off to search for another. This one has magnesium oil as an ingredient and I think that may be what makes it so effective for me personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this deodorant you do sweat a little but it doesn&#x27;t stink. That took a while for me to get used to but it doesn&#x27;t make me soaking wet or anything and honestly I think it&#x27;s much better for my body to get those toxins out and not keep them inside of me. So if it isn&#x27;t obvious and doesn&#x27;t smell I&#x27;m good with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for me anyway, there was about a week where I was nervous bc it seemed like It wasn&#x27;t going to work. I hung in there bc of another Amazon user review mentioning this as well. I&#x27;m glad I did. Now I can wear it on a 90 degree day at an amusement park and feel confident it won&#x27;t fail me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had any advice for the company I would say to make a clear version for evening attire. Personally, if the evening one weren&#x27;t completely natural I would still wear this one during the day and the clear version at night. Just sayin&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this deodorant is a amazing. After having a baby I was having horrible BO. I could litteraly smell myself during middle of the night feedings and I was so frustrated. I tried all the &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; chemical deodorants, and none of them worked for more than a few hours. I have been using green tidings for about 3 weeks now. I never smell anymore! My husband agress too, and is even considering issuing it. I also feel muh better about breastfeeding knowing my baby is not right next to all the nasty chemicals in traditional deodorants. Good stuff right here, I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times and so far it works well. I will have to wait until it gets a bit hotter before I am totally sure that it works well. Most natural deodorants cause me to get a rash after I&#x27;ve used them for a week, and I believe it&#x27;s the baking soda, but they work well for odor.  I&#x27;ve got high hopes that this brand will work just as well AND not cause a rash since it uses no baking soda. I will update.</li>
            <li> After three weeks I am totally satisfied with my purchase.  This is a very dense stick and it is absolutely unscented.  I do not shave my underarms and sometimes have overused deodorant sticks to guarantee coverage down to my skin.  I was a bit concerned with the reviews that mentioned irritation, but I decided to take the chance since I wanted as natural a product as possible.  I have had zero irritation and it only takes me 3 - 4 strokes on hairy pits to get the coverage I need.  I generally only apply once per 24 hours and I have even gone for as long as 48 hours.  I would buy this product again and I expect this tube to last for quite a long time based on the density and how much I use.</li>
            <li> I love that this deodorant is the best at smell that I have come across!  Sometimes when the deodorant is in a warm place it is a little tricky, I have to wipe it on.  But I can use it as usual if it&#x27;s in a cool location.  Love that it is natural too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched unsuccessfully for years for a natural deodorant until now!!! This works! I&#x27;d been using a very strong deodorant with aluminum. This is just a good. I just wish I&#x27;d started using it years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a safe deodorant that doesn&#x27;t break me out or cause some terrible rash, I think this is the one! So far, I love everything about this deodorant, though the true test will be wearing it through the summer. Thanks, Green Tidings!</li>
            <li> So far so good, been using it for about a week and I don&#x27;t smell throughout the day. I have the unscented version, so even though it doesn&#x27;t have any added fragrances, you&#x27;ll notice when you put your nose right over it, it has a weird smell that I personally dislike, but you don&#x27;t smell it much while it’s on. The deodorant seems to achieve its overall goal in that I don&#x27;t smell throughout the day. It applies pasty almost like cream but with that mind, as long as i allowed the deodorant to absorb within a few seconds, I did not notice any stains on my shirts nor have i experienced any weird discolorations under my arms as others have mentioned. With that in mind, I&#x27;d recommend it to others looking for a suitable natural deodorant. My only complaint is the price.</li>
            <li> This deodorant really works to prevent odor even through a workout at the gym.  However it is not an anti-perspirant.  I have noticed that I occasionally sweat but since I live in the Northeast it&#x27;s not a big deal right now.  Not sure how it will be when the warmer weather finally gets here but for my purposes, it might make sense to apply both in the morning and at night.  There is a slight scent to it but nothing noticeable and not unpleasant.  You can smell it in the tube but not on.  Another great thing about this product is that it comes in a tube.  I also use Schmidt&#x27;s sometimes and Green Tidings is much easier to apply.  My 21 year old daughter is the one who suggested we try a more natural deodorant and she likes it as well.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting an alternative to the heavily scented and not very effective products that are on the market.  Sure it costs more, but if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  Also, I get a sense that this tube is going to last a long time.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and the key is to make sure that you put a light coating on, not a huge thick amount. I&#x27;ve barely had to roll up the tube.</li>
            <li> Daily use no problems and provides protection as stated.. Unscented is the way to go for men.</li>
            <li> Works really well, but it has the consistency of a glue stick. As a man with armpit hair, trying to apply this stuff is horrible. It&#x27;s like trying to rub a semi dried out glue stick under my arm. It mattes up the hair and just generally feels terrible. But, it&#x27;s the only truly natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found that actually works.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my standard chemical-laden deodorant with something that was natural and worked well.  I tried numerous other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants that you can buy in stores.  None of them worked - I would still sweat profusely, but even worse, smelled like a hoagie shop after 20 minutes of normal activity.  I got Green Tidings All Natural Deodorant after seeing a former teachers&#x27; recommendation on social media.  I tried the Lavender first but it gave me a rash (I am allergic to alot of shampoos, lotions, and soaps!) so I gave it to a friend (she loves it!) and tried the unscented.  I have been using it for about 6 months now and I will NEVER go back to the chemical deodorants again!  I like Green tidings because it is easy to apply (some natural deodorants do not have easy application) and it does not clog up the pores under my arm.  We have sweat glands under our arms because we are supposed to sweat there.  Green Tidings does not keep you from sweating (which is natural!) but it does neutralize the scent and after using it for 6 months I can say that I sweat LESS under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as natural, unscented deodorants go - Green Tidings is the best that I have found.  You do need to use it consistently to give your body time to adjust.  And, don&#x27;t expect it to act like the chemical-laden deodorants and keep you from sweating at all under your arms - which is something that we are taught is unacceptable in today&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> Very positively impressed with this, I will order it again</li>
            <li> the very first thing I noticed is that it leaves white marks on my clothes, I also felt that I didnt &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; as bad after working out and my under sweating was a little less. I only used it twice so far, I will give it a little more time before I make my final opinion. It did not say anything about going on clear, it just looked like it would, I do have to get another deodorant that does not leave white marks on my clothes, disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great performance. Maybe the best I ever used. Little sloppy to apply.</li>
            <li> At last!  An all natural personal item that works. This really is a great product! &#x27;Received it five days ago and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  It does not irritate and actually lasts throughout the day.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the future. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love that this has natural ingredients and I don&#x27;t have to worry about what&#x27;s going into my body, it works well to keep odor at bay, only complaint is that it does leave discoloration visible on light colored clothing</li>
            <li> Works well for keeping dru, but causes bad skin rash.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple of other natural deodorants but none of them feel like this one. The amount of sweat has come done and it feels like I have nothing. Invisible. It feels great not to worry about it anymore.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been looking for. I am unable to use regular deodorants due to health reasons and have been unable to find a product that actually works. I live in Phoenix and sweating a lot goes without saying...this deodorant able to keep up with that and no stinky armpits anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone jus looking for a natural alternative for what ever reason. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of that evil aluminum clinical deodorant for many years because I sweat like a 400-lb dude with a wine hangover. However, using all those chemicals ceased to appeal and I decided I&#x27;d rather pit out occasionally than end up with Alzheimer&#x27;s. Green Tidings is great! It&#x27;s made of all organic, natural ingredients, it isn&#x27;t flaky, it doesn&#x27;t smell weird, and, most importantly, I don&#x27;t smell weird. If anything, I&#x27;ve sweated less. I am definitely going to be a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> Great Natural Deodarant.  Keeps me smelling fresh all day.  Product does not necessarily stop sweating, as it is not an anti-perspirant.  Tried unscented and Lavendar, prefer the lavendar.</li>
            <li> I was in search of a deoderant that was all-natural and would get me through the third trimester of my pregnancy where I found myself sweating quite a bit!  This worked extremely well, so well in fact that I convinced my husband to start using it as well.  As with all deodorants, this prevents odor, not sweat. Unfortunately, I developed a rash shortly after I gave birth but I am hopeful to return to using this again after my post-pregnancy hormones return to normal :)</li>
            <li> This really works for me!  After several months of trying different natural deodorants, Green Tidings keeps me feeling confident through the day.  The lavender smell is pleasant and not overpowering.  Even though it is not an antiperspirant, I find that I stay drier than with the brand I used to use.  You don&#x27;t need a lot.  It quickly warms to your body temperature so it goes on fairly smooth.  So glad I discovered this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of natural deodorants, spent tons of money, and this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried! Applies smoothly with no clumping or irritation. Works great even for my teenage daughter who is a heavy sweater! Will definately be buying more, and the lavender scent&lt;br /&gt; Is great too!!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY natural deodorant I have found that works for me. As a woman, hormones can influence body odor and it becomes more complicated. I was very happy to discover this and I love that it&#x27;s in a roll-out stick...no messy fingers!</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;m really pleased to find a safe, natural product that I&#x27;m not afraid to use daily. Thanks Green Tidings!</li>
            <li> This product has exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now, but it is summer and in this time we&#x27;ve had excessive heat warnings but this product has worked better than any conventional antiperspirant &amp; deodorant I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s worked through working out, playing with the kids, running errands in the heat...I think I sweat less than I ever realized I could! I&#x27;m only giving it a four since I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be sure it&#x27;ll work this great long term...</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a trial to replace the Aubrey Organics Pine deodorant spray I usually use.  Application of this was difficult unless I was fresh out of the shower and still wet.  I used this product for 2 weeks and can vouch that it does reduce body odor well.  However, I developed the rash under my arms that has been detailed in other reviews and it took quite some time to get rid of it.  Be very cautious in using this.</li>
            <li> It does work on 90 degree day and still no smell. I didn&#x27;t break out from it. There is baking soda in it. It is expensive.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t apply very smoothly; the texture is kind of grippy so I either have to press harder to force it or lighter to be able to glide it around, but then I end up not being sure if I&#x27;ve applied too much or too little. But that&#x27;s a minor gripe over what seems to work as a very effective, long lasting deodorant. Haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation. I think this is a very reliable choice for an unscented deodorant and I will likely re-order again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Although it&#x27;s obviously more expensive than your average deodorant, it works just as well and gives you a piece of mind that you&#x27;re not hurting yourself with a bunch of chemicals. It goes on pretty dry which irritated my armpit for the first week but it doesn&#x27;t bother me any more.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorant products.  This is by far the best I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Will never by another deo again. I have struggled for years with odor. This absolutely kills/prevents it</li>
            <li> I have tried, looked, bought every natural deodorant out there and NONE of them work. This does, its the best, use scented oils to apply your own scent if you wish, just put a drop in the cap overnight.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant.  By far the best of all the natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  No stinging or rashes, and it works even on the hottest days.  My husband and I have both switched to Green Tidings (unscented).</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I cannot believe it! A natural deodorant that actually works! I have tried just about every natural deodorant out there, none of which have worked, until now!! After seeing this product on the green tidings Facebook page and after read the good reviews on amazon on this product and figured i would give it a try and i am so glad i did! I do a lot of public speaking and get nervous when i do so and sweat a lot too, especially in hot climates and i found after using this product i have no smell whatsoever! I LOVE this product and will be recommending it to everyone! This will be the only deodorant i will use from now on. Thank you so so so much!</li>
            <li> Excellent, won&#x27;t kill you with toxic chemicals while keeping you free of smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long for what you pay for. I will probably look for a different natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this is the only one that actually worked AND with which I didn&#x27;t break out (very sensitive skin). I bought the unscented version, if that helps.</li>
            <li> Hands down best Natural Deodorant on the market. I have also tried the lavender scent but prefer the unscented.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best all-natural deodorant on the market.  I have used it every day for nine months and still going strong.  Some deodorants only work for the first month.  Not this one.  I am a huge Green Tidings advocate and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who cares about the products they use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t keep me dry or smell free. Waste of $$.  Maybe if you don&#x27;t perspire a lot, it would be OK. Didn&#x27;t work for my 25 yr old daughter or I.</li>
            <li> The crystal works decent in mild weather but Green Tidings is much better, and even held up in 100 degree heat this summer. Packaging is a bit much, especially as this is my second order. But definitely give the product a try.</li>
            <li> Not the best but not the worst. Wish it came in a different form because it feels like trying to rub a dry bar of soap made of bark under your arms</li>
            <li> Great product - I&#x27;ve been trying to get my husband to switch from the aluminum based ones and I finally found one that he thinks actually works!  The whole family uses it now - boys use the unscented - girls the lavender.  Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I used all types and coming from Axe spray, I hear a lot of bad things about them I wanted to switch on something more natural. This is the only deodorant I use now.</li>
            <li> great natural  odorless deodorant in terms of efficacy. wish access was little easier than the screw on cap, and little less bulky or smaller sizes to be able to put in under a shirt if you forget to put it on with shirt off.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. It&#x27;s all natural AND it works. I have been searching for a good natural deodorant for some time and this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. And I can get it in two days with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> At first I was very happy to receive this product. The product did work in terms of eliminating smell. However, for the first time in my life I have received darkened armpits from this product. I will never use this product again. I am mortified to have dark armpits because of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant for many years and I never found one that eliminates body odor like Green Tidings does. It certainly does the job as a deodorant and I highly recommend this product. No more embarrassing moments. Thank you Green Tidings</li>
            <li> Rash :(  Soooo wanted it to work without a rash!  Oh well...</li>
            <li> Bad product and not effective with me&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  It smells great (not truly unscented, but still a more neutral smell than the lavender which is way too strong), goes on smoothly, and actually does keep odor away.  However, after a few weeks of use my skin developed a rash, became really red and inflamed, started scabbing, and became darkened/discolored.  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, then this is a great product.  Otherwise, try one of the crystals instead.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever deoderant that I&#x27;ve bought that was natural and unscented. I&#x27;d just like to say that I take a shower once a day, when I wake up and I apply then. When it&#x27;s time to shower again when I wake up there is absolutely no smell. And I&#x27;m not saying that like everyone else that says &amp;#34;they don&#x27;t smell&amp;#34; i do smell. If I&#x27;m inactive if I stick my nose in there I&#x27;d smell- big deal. But this eliminates odors like febreeze- if febreeze even works idk never tried it lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. Point is, so far I can tell it has 24 hour protection. I still sweat but it doesn&#x27;t smell. I work 12 hours as a paramedic and if I don&#x27;t wear it I could smell myself venting from the neck of the shirt. It doesn&#x27;t happen with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my other reviews. I&#x27;ve done a lot.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I thought this was the answer to my yellow-stains on the underarms of my shirts.  But I used it after shaving once (about two weeks ago) and I still have the large red, painful welts on my underarms.  The same thing happened to my daughter.  Your not supposed to use it after shaving, but what good is a deodorant if you can&#x27;t use it after you shower and shave.  I will use the product in the winter when I don&#x27;t have to shave my underarms everyday.</li>
            <li> It literally kills me inside how expensive this deodorant is, but I have to hand it to GT, it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great (firm/soft), it applies great (smooth), it doesn&#x27;t seem to melt or harden/dry up to a rock like some other natural baking soda deods... it really is good, but wow, this price is really hard to swallow.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first because I struggle every time I have to buy one because if it works for me, 2 or 3 weeks after... it just stop working but this one I could feel the difference form day one. Although is unscented I can&#x27;t smell no **odd odor** at the end of the day... No rash for now.,although I do follow the instructions they say &#x27;&#x27; don&#x27;t apply on cracked skin&#x27;&#x27; (so, don&#x27;t apply it after shaving). If a have to shave I try to do it at night to be able to apply the deodorant next morning without problems.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside for me is the price, but we can wait for a discount or something :)</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I have ever tried, it really works!</li>
            <li> make my underarm darker i don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Great product!  I switched from Antiperspirant to this because it is all natural, and Green Tidings really cares about the environment.  The deodorant works very well, I am so happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I only have to apply in morning and lasts all day.  Even after waking up, it&#x27;s still working from the day before. No painful itching or rash. Thanks for this deodorant.</li>
            <li> As a 32 year old athletic male, I may or may not be the target demographics for this product.  I can confirm though that I used this product as directed and it definitely did not provide all day odor protection.  This is a twice a day product for people like me.  I bought the 2.7oz, unscented tube and that particular products lasted me about 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having to use it twice a day is only a minor annoying and not a complete deal-breaker.  However what is a deal breaker is the fact that this deodorant made my underarms break out in both a rash and in acne.  I&#x27;ve never had underarm acne in my entire life until I started to use this product.  In fact, I really don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all and it&#x27;s rare to find any product which irritates me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switching deodorants to Arm and Hammer naturals, all of the acne and rashes went away.  This deodorant was a good idea in theory - all natural ingredients, no aluminum.  However it just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a natural deodorant that actually works....and I think I have finally found it!  I have been really pleased with this product.  I have only tried the unscented and like it because I am often times sensitive to strong scents.  If you are looking to try a natural product, I would give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it works for me all day. The product is just too expensive and you receive so little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep my review short and sweet.  This stuff works! It&#x27;s aluminum free, scent free, and keeps me stink free all day and then some.      I had initially had an issue with my order but was met with great customer service. I will be buying again....</li>
            <li> I do love the product so the two stars may be misleading, but it is due to a combination of several factors. First of all, the one positive thing is that product as a deodorant worked better than any natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting it as an antiperspirant so I had no expectation for that... however, when I went on vacation to a tropical location that had weather in the 90s, the product was really greasy under my arms and I sweat way more than I normally would with or without any other deodorant.  It was surprising how much I sweat.  Another negative is that it did stain my clothes.  Not from one use, but wearing the same shirt several times (between washings) a mild tint developed on the fabric.  The last disappointment is the price.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this product for a few days, but so far--PERFECT. Would have given 5 stars, but will see what happens in warmer weather.  Happy. UPDATE:  have now reordered this deodorant, works great and will continue to use. UPDATE:  after going through the summer in 100 degree days, I changed my stars from 4 to 5!!   And, just ordered a 3 pack.  While I may still sweat some days, this product is fantastic in keeping me odor free.  I feel good about using it.</li>
            <li> Burn Burn Burn. I so wanted this to work, but after a week of use I got the burn, and please don&#x27;t tell me anything about &amp;#34;detoxing&amp;#34; my armpits. I haven&#x27;t used regular deodorant in over a year. The other problem with it is it&#x27;s so hard. I actually pulled armpit hairs out applying it. The search goes on...</li>
            <li> Great deodorant, it lasts all day and it&#x27;s gentle on the skin, very moisturizing...will definitely buy from now on &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been searching for a natural deodorant that actually performs well and doesn&#x27;t cause skin rashes. This is the best one we have tried so far. I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t hold up in the gym, but it works flawlessly. Very impressed!</li>
            <li> I sweat. I live in HOT, HUMID, NORTH Florida. This product works. I am going to buy an extra to give as a tester to my daughter. If she says it works (she&#x27;s a runner and lives in Austin, TX) you will have me buying stock! :-)</li>
            <li> Good stuff.. very effective.  Using too much will prove to be a mistake.  Just don&#x27;t do it.  One quick glide to get a bit of product under the arm is enough.  Don&#x27;t twist too much out.  Just a thin amount..then apply.  And apply LIGHTLY.  Don&#x27;t be heavy handed.  It&#x27;s soft and it will squeeze over the rim of the applicator, which is wasteful.  I&#x27;m open to trying other brands though because this is a bit pasty for my tastes...</li>
            <li> This has it all without harsh chemicals.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this deoderant! I sweat A LOT! And it smells like nobody&#x27;s business if left unchecked. I had used conventional deos for ages but I really wanted a natural option that could effectively control the odor. I thought I&#x27;d give this unscented version a try because, let&#x27;s face it, the true test of a deo is if it eliminates the odor and not mask it( and plus, I&#x27;m not crazy about lavender scented stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as a rule I always applied a LOT of deo and I did the same with this at the beginning of the day and lo, and behold! No smelly pits even at the end of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike conventional deos I can&#x27;t go more than a day without reapplying but I have no issues with that. The great thing with this is that it doesn&#x27;t overdry the skin around my armpits, washes right off when I&#x27;m taking a shower AND this doesn&#x27;t stick to my razor, dulling the blade, so now my blades last longer too! Woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this natural deoderant and even with the price it is TOTALLY worth it because I only buy it once a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a stinky girl AND I have terrible chemical sensitivity issues.  In 2015 alone, have tried 4 different aluminum- free deodorants, natural deodorants.  Nothing has worked as well as Green Tidings All Natural Deodorant Extra Strength.  The Good:  I can wear this to work and to the beach and I do not smell like a sweaty pit monster.  The not-so-good: I still sweat and the natural smell of the product smells a little like the clay I used to make a volcano for my first grade science project. It also leaves an oily residue on my clothes however, this washes out and does not stain.  This is the best product I have tried so far and I will stick with it for a few months. A tip...apply right after the shower. I don&#x27;t recommend you try to go without a shower and then apply on top. It won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably, this product works better than any deodorant I have ever used, both natural and synthetic. I&#x27;ve gotten rashes or irritation from many, but not this one. It also does not have any smell which is nice and lasts a full 24 hours. I&#x27;m truly grateful for a company to invent a product that doesn&#x27;t just work, but has integrity with respect to quality natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It was o.k. Very sticky and I tried using less. Does keep me dry.</li>
            <li> I had been using Arm &amp; Hammer essentials for a year or so,  but was looking for something more effective.  Saw this product advertised on Amazon and gave it a try.  I&#x27;m impressed with the results!  It forms a slight coating under the arms, but it isn&#x27;t disagreeable and the coverage lasts and lasts.  It is unscented and contains arrowroot for moisture absorbance, plus oils to condition the skin.  I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now, and even after returning from a run or a stressful day, I can tell it&#x27;s still doing the job.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any noticeable streaking on shirts, either.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this product.</li>
            <li> The only natural deodorant that works for me! I put coconut oil on my pits first, to help the product glide on easier. Then, I finish with a dab of essential oil in whatever scent I&#x27;m in the mood for. Sexy,healthy pits!</li>
            <li> This has been by far the best natural deodorant I have tried and I have now tired 11 different brands, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive :(......but definitely going to keep ordering this item!!</li>
            <li> The product is like hard solid soap. Doesn&#x27;t feel good or work too well.</li>
            <li> Works great but careful applying when the air is warm. Also, I noticed that putting a few drops of water on the top of the product helps apply it to the underarm immensely. May never go back to &amp;#34;The Stone&amp;#34; again.</li>
            <li> I have recently started checking out all natural deodorants and looking for ways to use less chemical products in my life.  After much research I decided to try this deodorant.  I like that the ingredients are all natural and listed on the label, no big fancy chemical names.  Bought the 2oz size and have been using it for just over 3 months and it&#x27;s been going well.  The texture of the deodorant is like a paste, it&#x27;s not rough or anything.  The product is unscented and has been keeping me relatively odour free all day.  I haven&#x27;t not experienced any irritation that some users have noted. I took off one star as I think it&#x27;s a little pricey for the size but if you&#x27;re looking for a deodorant with no chemicals I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a working deodorant for a while.  I am starting to wear cologne so I need unscented, and aluminum free so I don&#x27;t get yellow stains on my shirts, and because of the potential healthy issues.  I have tried Tom&#x27;s and some of the other brands from my local health food store with no luck.  They were either absolutely worthless or needed to be reapplied after a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this via an Amazon search and figured I would give it a try.  Let me be yet another person to confirm, this stuff is wonderful.  This really does work all day!  Even after working all day and then working out afterwards, I smell absolutely no odor in my underarms.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I got the unscented. My underarms smell like NOTHING at the end of the day. That&#x27;s also after intense workout at the gym. Kind of pricy but very happy with results!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is working well for me, even through workouts! Will be ordering this from now on. It is a little pasty but I find that where you store it makes a difference. Keep it in a cool, dry place and it will make the product firmer and easier to glide across your skin.</li>
            <li> So while my day job is behind a desk my interests take me far from it and they include restoring cars. Dirty, messy, rusty destroyed cars that leave you in the sun for hours at time dirty and drenched in sweat. Now for an activity like this you would think some sporty deodorant or an old school brand like Old Spice (something so strong only your dad would wear) would work best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. And especially after you find yourself with pain in your upper chest because your lymph nodes are inflamed from a bad reaction to the pounds of deoderant you&#x27;ve placed under your arm. You start to think what the hell am I doing? And what the hell is in this stuff?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next this lead me to a trip to Ralph&#x27;s where I searched every deodorant and found the same exact active ingredient in every single brand except for Toms. So much for options. So I tried Toms which took me to about 2pm in an office setting and boom I start to smell. After Toms I tried another organic brand from my local &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; food store and that died out so quickly that my coworkers even mentioned something by 3pm (IN THE OFFICE).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which led me to the internet and then to Amazon and then to Green Tidings. Now after 2 weeks I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never smelled better!! In the morning, in the evening, as I sit here in bed writing this review. I&#x27;m wearing this amazing stuff and smell zero body odor even when checking and that makes me extremely happy! I accepted a long time ago that I&#x27;m a guy that loves to get his hands dirty but I&#x27;m glad that I finally that found a safe product that keeps me from smelling like one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR - &amp;#34;Car restoring, project loving, bordeline republican stereotypical guy gives in and tries the all natural stuff for the sake of his health and girl friend and found true love in a deodorant that works better than anything he&#x27;s tried before.&amp;#34;  **** Siskel and Ebert</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants before and none of them have worked.  However, this deodorant works great!  It&#x27;s better than regular deodorant and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I tried two different natural deodorants before trying this one. The first one was a spray, however the smell was too strong and I would end up smelly within a few hours. The second one had a scent that was even more strong and didn&#x27;t cover the odor at all, so I would have a sweet funk to me, which I hated. However, I wanted to give natural deodarants one more try, and after seeing all of the positive reviews for this one I decided to give it a try. All I can say is wow! No odor all day, and that&#x27;s after running around all day AND going to the gym. And I&#x27;ll be honest, I can&#x27;t work up a good odor, even more popular deodorants couldn&#x27;t help me, but this does the job. Yes I sweat, but it doesn&#x27;t smell. After not being satisfied by the scented natural deodarants I&#x27;ve bought, I opted for the unscented one this time, and I love it. I highley doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed if you try it.</li>
            <li> My first amazon review and I&#x27;ve to say very impressed with the product.  I wanted deodorant without aluminum in it and this product works.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it keeps the bad odor away, down side is it stains my clothes tho it comes off when washed</li>
            <li> The brochure references that you might experience some slight irritation as your body begins to eliminate aluminum that was used from prior products. I used this product for six days and here is a breakdown of my experience:&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 - seemed okay&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 -  sweaty and noticed a bit of redness&lt;br /&gt;Day 3-6  - sweaty and stinky with redness&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I decided to stop using the product. I then noticed that the skin in my underarms was actually PEELING off - like a sunburn would. So the redness was not just irritation, it was like a chemical burn. Not sure what would have done this, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but clearly I returned this ASAP.</li>
            <li> Love this natural deodorant!  I have also purchased the lavender scented.  Works great and is perfect to use while pregnant or nursing.</li>
            <li> I have tried assorted natural deodorants, scented and unscented, and wasn&#x27;t happy with any of them.  After reading all the great reviews for Green Tidings I decided to order the unscented since I&#x27;m not one for flowery smells.  This is my second week of using this product and I&#x27;m sold!  It didn&#x27;t happen right away - it did take a couple of days for it to work and I now have no underarm odor even after doing yard work in the sun for 3 hours.  I will definitely re-order.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great antiperspirant. Bad deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is all natural. It goes not manage under arm smell.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchase this Deodrant, very effective, doesn&#x27;t stain and no rash, not sure it&#x27;s lasts 24hrs as ad says, but def of if the best I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> A couple years ago, I bought a bunch of aluminum-free deodorants and found few that worked. I settled on a milk of magnesia deodorant that left a visible white stain under my arms after application (kind of embarrassing), stained the shirt if I wasn&#x27;t careful putting on the shirt, and &amp;#34;barely&amp;#34; made it through an active day. Sometimes it worked distinctly worse than other days with similar amounts of activity. I recently tried the Unscented version of Green Tidings. It goes on clear or with minimal residue, has barely any scent, and seems to work very well through an entire day, including tennis/running/whatever activity I may be doing. The effectiveness is very impressive! It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but seems to have a quality list of ingredients (feels like the healthiest deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used) and it works better than any other. I do have trouble with application - when I first uncap it, it seems hardened and I&#x27;m not sure if any deodorant is being applied during the first swipe or so, so I often end up using too much. I think that&#x27;s why my 2.7 oz unit lasted only a couple of weeks. Seems like application with this product is a bit of a skill that I still need to refine.  There is one particular benefit of this product for me that will make me continue to purchase it despite the price. When I was using the magnesia deodorant, I seemed to sweat under my arms more than ever, to the point where I was frequently very self-conscious of it. While sweating is a normal body function, it seemed excessive and I began to wonder if the deodorant was contributing to it. It&#x27;s the main reason I began looking for a replacement, and I was even considering going back to an antiperspirant. After using Green Tidings, the difference is absolutely remarkable. Most of the time, I sweat very little, and when I&#x27;m hot or active, I sweat more, but it&#x27;s vastly reduced from before and feels very healthy and normal. It&#x27;s not an eyesore and I&#x27;m more confident and less self-conscious. Thank you, Green Tidings!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I broke out really bad from this deodorant.  If you buy this product make sure you are not magnesium intolerant or go get your levels checked first, or you will regret it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, however I have tried so many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and none worked. This is a great product and lasts all day. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is amazing!!! The one and ONLY that has ever worked for me. I am a very healthy, and very hygienic person, I shower once a day, in the summer twice a day. I have had a problem with underarm odor for about 7 or 8 years now. I don&#x27;t even sweat, but I have odor. I feel like I have tried everything to combat it to no avail. I was about ready to see a dermatologist about this and I saw this deodorant had good reviews on Amazon, so I thought I would give it a shot. IT WORKS! I have never done a review on a product in my life, but thought anyone that suffers from the embarrassment of underarm odor like I do then they need to know about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a perfect natural deodorant for years! I finally found one: Green Tiding Natural Deodorant! When I first put it on, I could clearly feel it was all natural. It didn&#x27;t stain my shirts and also perfectly controlled my uncomfortable smell. Thank you for this wonderful product. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> A Holy grail of deodorant! Exceeded my expectations and worked magically. It&#x27;s really the best deodorant that I have ever used. I&#x27;ve applied it once yesterday&#x27;s morning (Tuesday at 9:00 AM), and been wearing it since then (now it&#x27;s Wednesday 9:00 PM) and it&#x27;s been absolutely amazing! No smell at all. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical in the beginning, but after all the natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried with no success I thought I&#x27;d give it a try after reading all the positive reviews and I&#x27;m very glad I did! In the beginning I started off with irritated pits from my OTC deo so the baking soda added to the problem that I already had, and I had no odor at all with one application so I wanted to continue with this god sent product so I stopped using it for a few days so my pits could heal then I started using Green Tidings again, and I have been using it for three weeks and it works wonderfully even when I&#x27;m under pressure when it&#x27;s very hot I&#x27;m FRESH I find that if I apply to much I get some what irritated but I&#x27;m getting use to it as time goes on. So I am one happy customer and it is worth every penny because I truly have a piece of mind knowing that even though I sweating there is no odor. Thanks Green Tidings</li>
            <li> I love this product. I prefer the unscented over the lavender as I feel the lavender smells more musky (more of what I would expect a man to smell like). My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t glide on. It gets stuck to my armpits as I put it on and my hubby who has under arm hair says it tugs at the hairs which can be a bit painful. But otherwise very happy with it. I feel good knowing I&#x27;m using something aluminum free and I didn&#x27;t have to make it! :) I actually feel like I smell less after the end of the day than I did with my old over the counter deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorant &amp; I&#x27;m really glad this is what I picked as a first try. I&#x27;m almost done w/ the stick I bought &amp; am getting ready to reorder. I live in the South (and there is a heat wave going on right now), plus I just got back from a trip where I was hiking &amp; being very active in the sun &amp; heat daily for 2 weeks. Even when I&#x27;m really hot &amp; sweaty, I do not smell. (Yay!!!) This is a huge improvement over the standard deodorants I&#x27;ve tried (which work for about half the day then seem to quit). I haven&#x27;t had any skin issues either (even applying right after shaving). The Green Tidings Deodorant has even worked so well that I&#x27;ve forgotten to apply deodorant once or twice but it&#x27;s been fine. (FYI, just remember that this is deodorant only, not antiperspirant.) I definitely recommend it. (Edited to add: I ordered the 2.7 oz unscented stick &amp; it will have lasted me about 7 to 8 weeks by the time it is used up.)</li>
            <li> A great deodorant without aluminum. Works well and has a neutral smell.</li>
            <li> It definitely does what it says on the tin, but there is something in it that my skin reacts badly to. Just a week into using it I noticed a dark patch where I typically apply deodorant that was kind of scaly to the touch.  I found it really hard to apply it smoothly too, and I kind of had to dig in to get  it to spread.  I used coconut oil to compensate, both for the scaly patch and application, but it was never enough and since it&#x27;s summer, I don&#x27;t want people looking at my underarms and seeing discoloration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants but this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li> I have tried several unscented deodorants and this is by far the best one. I have to get used to using a stick again as I have been using a roll-on for the past few years. My girlfriend was amazed that there was absolutely no fragrance from the deodorant. I will purchase the three pack in the future to assure I don&#x27;t run out. The ingredients are natural and do not stain my clothing. Excellent product that I will recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant i have ever used in my life. I have suffered for years from irritation after applying deodorant from different companies claiming its fir sensitive skin and still suffered from irritation and bad odor as well. And the fact that this product is organic, i doubted it at first but then i didnt believe that it really covers the smell the whole day. I am gonna keep on purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, leaves minimul residue and scent. Keeps you fresh all day!</li>
            <li> It did not work at all!!!!! Will never buy again!!</li>
            <li> I had already switched to aluminum free deodorants when I read their lanels and realized they were still full of bad ingredients. Did some research and found Green Tidings. Tried it and it works just great. Mind you it is a deodorant not antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this stuff- especially for not having any weird chemicals in it. When I received it I thought I would test it against two other natural deodorants I had on hand. For the first 2 weeks, Green Tidings on the left armpit went up against Tom&#x27;s of Maine unscented on the right.  The referee: my husband&#x27;s nose. Green Tidings won with complete odor elimination. Tom&#x27;s hung in there okay, but let some bits of odor through. Then for the next 2 weeks, Green Tidings went up against Lavilin deodorant cream.  Though Lavilin was pricier, it just couldn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s own against Green Tidings. Green Tidings is my answer to a natural deodorant that truly works!</li>
            <li> Finally, a product my whole family will use because it WORKS. Without endangering our health! Even my &amp;#34;Naturally Fresh&amp;#34; crystal deodorant contains aluminum! My teenager and I have discarded many natural deodorants in the past, some with coconut oil base. Pit paste-epic fail. Used Dr. Mist for years, but it was never reliable. Green Tidings can be a little difficult to apply, but it is so worthwhile to experiment! You want minimal coverage, otherwise you may have some white residue. Smooth application area with fingertips to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; oils to insure complete coverage. Addition of baking soda makes it feel slightly chalky, but I suppose that helps provide base for stick formula. I am gifting this product to other family members who are underarm challenged. We can finally say goodbye to yellow antiperspirant stains, residual odors in &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; laundry. Both issues required laundry interventions in HE top loader to achieve 100% success! To deodorize laundry, including bath towels we add 1 c. white vinegar or 2.5 Kangen water OR peroxide with 2 scoops Charlie&#x27;s Soap + 2 scoops Hard Water additive per large load. FYI-Laundry detergents leave build-up that can harbor bacteria. Polyester gym clothes are worst offenders. Want to see what&#x27;s in your &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; laundry? Pour 3% hydrogen peroxide directly onto underarms of a freshly washed dark t-shirt while still wet that does not pass the sniff test! Be prepared to relaunder soon after--I had zero fading on navy 100% cotton tees, but did not allow peroxide treated garments to dry. One more &amp;#34;editorial note&amp;#34; : Please don&#x27;t overlook possibility that modern diet and symptoms of dysbosis (leaky gut) are underlying problematic odor.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work but it didn&#x27;t. The formula also has a funky smell. I guess my body chemistry isn&#x27;t compatible with it.</li>
            <li> Loved it for awhile but developed a wicked allergy that took months and a RX cream to get rid of. Sad because this is the only natural deodorant I had found that worked all day.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Dove or Sure antiperspirant. Reluctantly I tried this, and I&#x27;ve been amazed that it does work. I don&#x27;t smell, and I guess I wasn&#x27;t perspiring that much, either, because I&#x27;m also not noticeably wetter or anything. I&#x27;m glad to avoid the aluminum exposure now, too.</li>
            <li> Never have I used a natural deodorant (or even a regular store bought deodorant) that works this well.  I was in Miami, outside all day in the heat and by the end of the day, the only smell was the very very gentle/almost invisible herb-like scent of the deodorant.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands  and nothing in my life has worked like this stuff.  It is expensive for a reason.. it&#x27;s the only deodorant that keeps you fresh, even after sweating.</li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews for this product before I ordered, but I was still surprised at how well it works!  It&#x27;s been a hot and humid week and this deodorant has kept its promise to keep me smelling fresh.  I&#x27;ll be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> So thrilled to find an all natural deodorant that works beautifully as well as contributing to a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, unpolluted lifestyle. Will definitely recommend Green Tidings to all my friends and family!</li>
            <li> This burnt my pits black. I used it for 4days. I don&#x27;t normally have body odor or stink. But with this, I had to wash my armpit and re-apply 2 to 3 times a day. That&#x27;s a waste in my opinion. I have had to do that with the ladystick one dollar deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I was willing to go through the reapplications bus of the organic benefits, but once it stated burning, itching and turning my skin black, I had to stop.&lt;br /&gt;2 days after I stopped using green tidings, the black layer started peeling off like dead dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have never been skin sensitive to any product. I have tried many deodorants, but I have never had a burn.</li>
            <li> This item is definitely not the product for me but the customer service was good and I feel overall happy with having given it a try because of that.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I tried.</li>
            <li> The best all natural product on the market. By far out performs any organic option today!</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant because I&#x27;ve been getting burn marks and darkened armpits from regular deodorants and needed to try something new.  I liked the fact that this seems to be a natural product without aluminum.  I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews for products, but I have now been using this deodorant for 3 months and I can honestly say that I am very satisfied.  I bought the unscented one because I usually wear perfume and/or scented body lotions and didn&#x27;t want to wear too many scents all at once.  I apply it to clean armpits once a day and it lasts all day, not one ounce of bad smell.  My armpits have not darkened like they usually do with other deodorants.  Overall I am a happy camper with this deodorant and will continue to purchase it as long as it keeps working &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> This deodorant gave me piece of mind without all of the added chemicals in conventional deodorant. It&#x27;s effective and I really like it. The only problem was that it darkened the skin of my underarms.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Mitchum girl - you know that deodorant that&#x27;s &amp;#34;so strong you can even skip a day.&amp;#34; When I realized the toxins and aluminum in that stuff should be avoided I switched to the Crystal. That worked pretty well - didn&#x27;t last as long and if I dropped it (which seemed to happen frequently it would crack and chip and and jagged edges don&#x27;t feel good under your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s with tea tree oil (who needs to sweat that stuff starts out stinky!) Lavilin - a gooey mess. I tried an all-natural, organic, made with essential oils version made by a lovely woman at the farmer&#x27;s market - smelled good in the tube but was not effective for me. I even tried making my own with coconut oil and baking soda (which are 2 of the ingredients of Green Tidings) but it was kind of messy and burned my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Tidings got it right. It took a few days of consistent use but now it&#x27;s as effective as Mitchum. Honestly, I can skip a day and don&#x27;t notice any smell. I even seems to reduce sweating which is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful though - it is an oil base and I did notice some discoloration under the arms of a couple blouses. I&#x27;ve found that if I shower at night and apply this before bed I don&#x27;t need to re-apply in the morning. And my then the oil has absorbed into me or my pj&#x27;s and isn&#x27;t an issue any more.</li>
            <li> Recently decided to quit using anti-perspirant and go deodorant only. Clogging up my pores with aluminum just doesn&#x27;t seem right. Speed Stick was definitely NOT working by the end of the day. Went to Amazon and this had the best reviews. Couldn&#x27;t find it in the usual granola stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, the product seems very dry so it does not glide like your usual stuff but hey it works and should last a while. I get the unscented so I know if it&#x27;s really working. So far so good. Ordering more.</li>
            <li> After many attempts at finding a natural/non toxic deodorant, I finally came across Green Tidings.  I love the fact that it is made with  magnesium oil, among its other awesome ingredients.  I also love what it does NOT contain: aluminum, parabens, BPAs, gluten, and other icky stuff.  It&#x27;s also vegan and made in the USA.  Seriously, what&#x27;s not to love?!?  I prefer this brand over other brands because it goes on clear, which means not as many white deodorant marks on clothing.  I also found I seem to sweat less using their unscented version rather than the lavender -- perhaps the essential oil makes it feel a bit more sticky for me?  Keep in mind, also, that while this will not prevent you from sweating completely, because it is not an antiperspirant and because your body is meant to sweat, I still find that it does a really good job of preventing excessive sweating and keeps embarrassing pit odor at bay.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd stick now and even though it&#x27;s a bit pricier than other deodorants, I find that it lasts longer than most and it also SO worth it for such a quality product.  I would recommend this unscented version to anyone as a great unisex, non-toxic deodorant. However, I would love to see them try to introduce a few new scents - peppermint, perhaps?  Thanks, Green Tidings!  :)</li>
            <li> This product is great, stays on all day best natural roll on I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> I love green tidings I was not sure when I first tried it but I love it now. You won&#x27;t stink!! 03/04/2016 I stopped using Green tidings because I ran out after about a week the other deodorant I was using didn&#x27;t work. ( this is what had happened before) It takes a couple of days to get used to Green Tidings but it&#x27;s worth it! I love it!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is amazing. I don&#x27;t like the idea of poisoning myself with aluminum and all other junk that is found in most deodorants these days, but I also don&#x27;t like to stink 2 hours after the shower. I Tried SO MANY other natural deodorants, many of them had fantastic reviews, but for whatever reason they just didn&#x27;t work for me. Green Tidings deodorant lasts for the entire day and when I wake up next morning I am still fresh. I am a dancer and even after a long dance practice my underarms are dry and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product so much that I always buy extra just in case it goes out of stock. I would be heartbroken if they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like?  All natural, unscented, and all day protection ... just what is needed!</li>
            <li> I work 12hr days in a physically demanding job so my quest for an all natural deodorant that truly works has been challenging to say the least. I tried quite a few products and they just didn&#x27;t last. Green Tidings has finally ended the search. Its easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothing, and best of all it lasts ALL day! Will only be buying this from now on and highly recommend it to anybody looking for a great all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have tried many &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; deodorants because I know they are healthier.  I have a special needs child who cannot have chemicals, ext. on his skin.  I have had a growing concern over aluminum after my first mammogram and the fact that you can&#x27;t use aluminum antiperspirant prior to the test.  I have tried many deodorants and feel I smell, not matter how much I apply.  This deodorant is the first I have found that works!!  I plan to reorder for myself, my son and my niece who suffers from hyperhydrosis.  I bought unscented by will try lavender as well.  Thank you for making a quality product.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying the company has excellent customer service!! I used the product for two days and found that I was moist, stinky and it gave my brand new white bra yellow stains in the armpit area. I was quite frustrated and contacted the company. Very kind and willing to work with me. They explained that it was part of the &#x27;detox&#x27; period. I have used Crystal deodorant before without having to go through this sort of &#x27;detox&#x27;.  I do have a life and I can&#x27;t just walk around sticky, stinking like rotten onions and staining all of my bras and shirts for a week in hopes that it will magically start working the way it should.  I don&#x27;t understand all of the glowing reviews. I purchased this rather expensive deodorant with high hopes and was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> A yoga retreat on the Big Island truly changed my life!  I fell in love with the simple, all natural lifestyle, but there was one thing that I just could not live without for not only my sake but for the sake of others around me (you&#x27;re reading this review, so you know what I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout)...deodorant.  In general, finding a good deodorant has always been a challenge for me.  They either left those annoying white stains or required multiple applications.  All natural products were even worse, until a friend recommended Green Tidings.  I, obviously, did my own research, and with the great ratings here on Amazon, it was, definitely, worth a try.  With high hopes and a bit of skepticism, I purchased the Lavender.  The scent, out of the tube, was pleasant, but after a few hours of wearing it, I realized that it didn&#x27;t quite work with my body chemistry.  ;(  However, being one on a mission to embrace &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; yet not be stinky, I purchased the Unscented.  And I&#x27;m so glad I did!!!  One application in the morning followed by a full day of work and hot flow yoga w/ no stinky.  Finally, an all natural deodorant that works... Give thanks!!!  ;)</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  It works better than any other natural deodorant I have ever tried.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate and prevents any BO.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t go on clear will leave a white residue on your clothes if you aren&#x27;t careful.  Although it does wash out of clothes easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Have been using it for a week now and it really works.  I had been using Crystal Rock and Crystal spray previously but would be stinking by mid day no matter how I tried to apply the combination.  But with Green Tidings, a couple of rolls in the morning and I&#x27;m still feeling and smelling fresh by the end of my work day,  which is a cumulative 12+ hours. Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> Great to have a natural deodorant that works</li>
            <li> I am transitioning to more natural &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and the chemical anti-persirants are far from natural. I purchased this and one other brand of natural deodorant on Amazon.  The other brand I got in roll on and in spray.  I am very disappointed with both forms of that brand but am surprised at how well I like the Green Tidings.  I really like the fragrance and I can smell it occasionally throughout the day which is refreshing and better than alternative smells!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I want to be natural, I wasn&#x27;t convinced I would be able to use a natural deodorant (without an antiperspirant) regularly.  I have a medical condition that makes me sweat profusely regardless of the weather or physical activity-I have to carry a &amp;#34;sweat rag&amp;#34; with me everywhere which is really embarrassing and very unprofessional at work. My face &amp; head are always the first to sweat, followed by my back and then every other part of my body.  Although my armpits aren&#x27;t the sweatiest area, I have been using the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength formula of traditional antiperspirant.  Despite my perpetual state of sweat and previously using the clinical antiperspirants, I have easily adopted the green tidings and have been very pleasantly surprised at how well it works!  I have only had to use backup antiperspirant once since I began using the green tidings.  Once!  It&#x27;s really been an easy transition because there has been no transition.  I just started using it &amp; that was it.  I didn&#x27;t have to wait the month like they said some people take to adjust to not having an antiperspirant.  I think I put on too much and go through it really quick compared to how long the traditional antiperspirant sticks lasted me, but the positives outweigh the cost for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other brand that I bought at the same time as this was the Crystal in the roll on and spray form.  I think it&#x27;s the same liquid, just in a different dispenser.  Neither works.  I guess they might be deodorant, but they leave meclammy and I can&#x27;t stand that.  I guess you get what you pay for because they were cheaper than this brand.  I hope that those of you out there with various medical conditions that cause far too much unnatural sweat will give this a try if you are looking for a more natural product.  I didn&#x27;t think it would work and now I&#x27;m never going back to traditional products.  I am glad that I have found a natural product!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this deodorant as I&#x27;ve been using ones with chemicals for years. I was even willing to have more bo then usual if it meant it was better for my body but....after over a month of use I have developed a really bad rash under both of my armpits that sting and itches like no other. Perhaps it is from some of the extracts in the product. So I may try other similar ones that have less ingredients.  Either way it did not help 100% percent with keeping BO at bay and did not compare to regular deodorants but it did get a little better the longer I used it until I developed a major rash.</li>
            <li> The reviews are correct. This stuff works. Lasts all day. The unscented is just fine. It passed the &amp;#34; Hard work, very sweaty, day&amp;#34; test :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product but it is so expensive. much more than counterparts.</li>
            <li> have heat indexes over 100. am in and out. worked well and no smell. seemed to help with wetness also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a problem with odor asserting itself in the late afternoon when I was using more commercial antiperspirants. I didn&#x27;t expect this product to take care of issue so thoroughly! Green Tidings is excellent in controling odor--even being worn into the next day. It&#x27;s a bit more pricy than more commercial antiperspirants, but the performance is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product!  It truly is unscented.  I wore it today during one of the hottest days of this summer and no BO!!!!  I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I really liked this as an alternative to aluminum containing antiperspirants.  I found one (Le Couvent Des Minimes) that I preferred.  It works decently.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t work for me and I had to throw it away. I never considered myself to have sensitive skin but this unscented deodorant made my skin bright red and inflamed. Tried using it for two weeks thinking the redness would subside but it never did. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with normal store bought deodorant but something in this didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> This product worked for me!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t last for long time.</li>
            <li> Strong and natural blend.  I have tried several natural deodorants and this is the only one that works and works well. Stay dry all day!</li>
            <li> My search is over!! After years of trying numerous &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; deodorant and getting frustrated, i assumed there wasn&#x27;t going to be one that actually worked. I am thrilled that I was wrong! I have been using the unscented Green Tidings deodorant for almost a week now without any worries about odor or sweat. Typically i would have to wipe off my deodorant every few hours with a wipe and reapply, but so far, no need to! On my next order I will try the lavendar.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is okay, but my skin did NOT like it.  I&#x27;m not usually sensitive-skinned, but I broke out in a full-blown rash with this deodorant.  I so wanted to like it, with its natural ingredient list, but unfortunately my skin just didn&#x27;t approve.</li>
            <li> To start with I want to say that this is the first natural deodorant I have used.  That  said, I was pleasantly surprised with how well the deodorant worked. Not having used natural deodorant before I had my doubts. At the end of the day I was happy that I had no odor and less wetness than with a normal deodorant. However, that&#x27;s where the good stops. I first noticed a little redness when I got out of the shower a day or two after I started using it plus my underarm area seamed drier which surprised me seeing as it has coconut oil in it. I just dismissed this because I wasn&#x27;t having any itching and just figuring that I was getting used to a new deodorant that didn&#x27;t have the chemicals my body was used to. Then I got little knots that at first didn&#x27;t hurt but have since become tender and my skin has gotten even drier.  That&#x27;s when I contacted Green Tidings to see if this is something they&#x27;ve heard of before and if my body was having a strange reaction to the ingredients. It doesn&#x27;t really seem like an allergic reaction but if I had to guess I&#x27;d say my sweat glands are irritated or clogged... ? So I have stopped using it and unfortunately went back to the regular, not good for you kind that also doesn&#x27;t work as well.  I am currently giving my underarms a couple days to get better on their own before calling the Dr.  If anyone else has a similar story I&#x27;d like to know.  Really disappointed that this didn&#x27;t work out as I was trying to be more health conscious.  Ps I would have given 5 stars for the effectiveness had it not been for my other issues.   1-30-15 I am editing my review because I have since talked to their customer service several times and it seems there was a technical glitch that I did not get their first response to me. They have explained that I may be going through a detox as my body is getting rid of the poisons from years of the chemicals and given me pointers on how to get through it. I am going to give it another shot and hope the symptoms go away.I encourage you to contact them through your Amazon account if you have a reaction like I did. They will get back to you on what you can do to get through the adjustment period if you truly want to be better to your body and use a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly the dry product I was expecting since it&#x27;s more of a compacted solidified mass forced into a twist dispenser so that it takes form. It&#x27;s not really a complaint though since it works for me and it&#x27;s probably the best unscented deodorant I could find. It seems to clump up into small chunks when I sweat and I sometimes feel it when I move. I can live with that; just that it surprised me when it first happened. I&#x27;m glad to finally find a product that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum and doesn&#x27;t actually have a scent. Well, it does smell a bit like tea. Just a little.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a deodorant w/o all of the harsh chemicals that actually works for the past 2 years. I have FINALLY found it. I work in an operating room sometimes 12-16 hours a day. Needless to say a deodorant is very important. The Green Tidings company had great customer services as well. When I received the deodorant from Amazon the mechanism to push the deodorant up did not work. I quickly notified Green Tidings about the issue and received a new working deodorant in the mail a couple days later. I have been using the deodorant for the past 2 weeks and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product. Being a male I chose the unscented version which is exactly that...unscented. I definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 3 days so far, and I absolutely love it. I got the unscented version, and it works exactly as it should. All day protection, easy to use, and it is non irritating. There is a white residue if you apply it liberally, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it transferring to my clothes, and I prefer some residue to a chemical laden deodorant.</li>
            <li> This unscented deodorant actually works. I have had issues with underarm odor, and have been on the search for a natural solution. Although the odor is not 100% eliminated, it is very significantly reduced. There is no &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; solution, but this product is probably the closest thing. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about how well this would work but the good reviews convinced me to buy some.  After one month (including a week in the keys in high 80&#x27;s sweating my butt off) I can say with certainty, this stuff really works!  The only thing I do a little more is wash under my arms to make sure that I wash all of the deodorant off.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product, you only need a thin coat and it hardly has an odor.  Good product!</li>
            <li> My husband uses the unscented and just asked me to order him another- I guess he likes it too! Sometimes we do get a little (and very very little) sweaty but it feels great knowing that we&#x27;re aren&#x27;t adding another awful chemical to our bodies.</li>
            <li> This deoderant is amazing! However, if you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend this product. It worked great up until my arm pits reacted badly to the product and I got huge sore bumpy rashes. The baking soda is too strong for my body PH.  I had to unfortunately opt out for a deoderant with similar ingrediants but catered to more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product works well on me! Have tried other natural products that didn&#x27;t do the job of enabling me to be odor free.</li>
            <li> Two week trip to Europe -- on my feet walking or standing 80% of the day long -- I sweat a lot even before I gained a lot of weight. I was extremely pleased with this deodorant in that I did not sweat at all and was even able to wear tops more than once -- I&#x27;ve NEVER been able to do that! I am a believer in this deodorant but at the price, I wish the last little bit in the bottom was more accessible to use.</li>
