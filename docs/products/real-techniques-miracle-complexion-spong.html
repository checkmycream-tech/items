            <li>This is wonderful, i ll now buy this instead of beauty blender.</li>
            <li>This blends your foundation and concealer flawlessly.</li>
            <li>It helps with flawless application.</li>
            <li>Wonderful.</li>
            <li>it works beautifully with liquid foundation application.  </li>
            <li>It blends my conclear, foundation etc beautifully.</li>
            <li>Great value as well with a set of four.</li>
            <li>This is a great item for the price point it is at.</li>
            <li>The sponge itself is great</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to try the beauty blender but between the price and amazing reviews I had read about this one I went for it!</li>
            <li>but im sure it will work perfect!</li>
            <li>The sponge is THAT good.  </li>
            <li>Fair pricing and</li>
            <li>As for me, I, thankfully, have the good version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I follow a lot of makeup advice people and it&#x27;s DEFINITELY as good as the video review (on that site we all know about.)</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very process was excellent and</li>
            <li>So I looked online for recommendations for a good dupe and found many Youtube makeup women say this one was almost better.  </li>
            <li>Her opinion was that although I didn&#x27;t particularly look as though as I was wearing foundation, I looked as though I had the most perfect skin ever.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth application.  </li>
            <li>I like the finish this gives when using a heavier foundation because I can easily sheer it out and the pointed side is perfect for under eye concealing.</li>
            <li>I also use it to apply powder so this is one of my favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li>Just like the beauty blender but better price point.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully they will make more colors</li>
            <li>It gives a better finish with bb creams and foundations than my fingers or a brush.</li>
            <li>I love it, repurchase for so many times</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I like it and u will buy more and more</li>
            <li>I love the Beautyblender sponge</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I like it better than my Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li>I love these sponges though.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re both very happy with the way it applies makeup on all the different areas and contours of the face</li>
            <li>You face looks flawless; Pretty much airbrushed.</li>
            <li>For the longest time I really didn&#x27;t get what was so good about using this sponge.</li>
            <li>and my sister loved it so much she gave up a MAC brush</li>
            <li>Very nice soft cosmetic sponge for applying foundation.  </li>
            <li>And so easy to use.</li>
            <li>The sponge is fine but the listening was for a 4 pack.</li>
            <li>It gives me a very flawless finish and I use less product with it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer and the flat end is great.  </li>
            <li>THE FLAT SIDE IS INGENIOUS!!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is anything can be a dupe for the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li>cuz I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this product is  wonderful but the retail seller should had made it clear that it was only one sponge, I pay $14 for one sponge when it said 4 count.</li>
            <li>The design is perfect with the flat side and the soft pointy tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>Blends my foundation into my skin without the sponge absorbing most of my make up.</li>
            <li>Love the Real Technique Sponges.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>It is super soft and has great angles to fit into different corners of the face.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much, samantha chapman!</li>
            <li>Amazing product a total dupe for the beauty blender at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>This sponge from Real Techniques is a fabulous alternative.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price, but never compare to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>The different shape is also a nice difference from the BB.</li>
            <li>I now know what the hype&#x27;s about and think it&#x27;s worth buying, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>this sponge is excellent, I recommend it a lot, but to buy it at ulta or web page real techniques that is priced at $ 5.99 but costs more sales ECONOMIC here because I pay $ 8 more $ 8 shipping, very expensive.</li>
            <li>The price is definitely right.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this a little more than my Beauty Blender</li>
            <li>came in super fast.</li>
            <li>The RT one is not as soft as the beauty blender, but you can still get smooth finish with it.</li>
            <li>Not expensive but definitely advise sticking to these authentic products and not purchasing dupe sponges.  </li>
            <li>super soft!!</li>
            <li>Just as good as the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>couple of YouTube videos on this Real Techniques sponge and had to try it.  </li>
            <li>I like it as much as my Sigma kabuki and my e.l.f.</li>
            <li>Theyre all very</li>
            <li>It also blended very well.</li>
            <li>, I think I&#x27;d be tempted to buy this inexpensive sponge for future special occasions</li>
            <li>but once I got it down I saw why people love these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this sponge for those who don&#x27;t have the money to spend on Beauty Blenders.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this sponge.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li>It took me a little while of watching YouTube videos to make sure I was applying it correctly</li>
            <li>It is slightly more dense than beauty blender and a little harder to clean but at 1/3 of a cost compared to BB...</li>
            <li>It has ridges where you can easily get to the nose and under the eyes to cover dark circles.</li>
            <li>I have used this with L&#x27;oreal Pro matte foundation and Nars Sheer Glow Foundation; It worked pretty well with them.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>It works just exactly the same as beauty blender!</li>
            <li>They work really well and expand quite large after getting wet.</li>
            <li>Description should be revised to clear any confusion that consumers would have.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also extremely soft.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m a forty year old</li>
            <li>Only received one sponge, NOT four, so ended up paying more than this usually costs</li>
            <li>and we even use it for dry when needed for certain powder makeup depending on the application</li>
            <li>A flawless base in the shortest possible time.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re not an exact dupe for the BB, but they work extremely well.</li>
            <li>I can get the exact same result when using my fingers when dry.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not a fan of the price, especially when I like replacing sponges frequently.  </li>
            <li>As an everyday beauty blender user, I recommend these more than the expensive original.</li>
            <li>she thought she couldn&#x27;t live without and had used it for a LONG time.</li>
            <li>(Might work very well with other types of foundations as well...</li>

            <li> (Might work very well with other types of foundations as well...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long it will last, and so I won&#x27;t comment on that.  </li>
            <li> It gets big and squishy when wet</li>
            <li> This is misleading, and I could have just purchased a single sponge by itself at Walmart instead of wasting time ordering a single sponge by mail.</li>
            <li> Also, your foundation last longer because this helps spread a small amount evenly and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It lets me get into the harder to reach areas around my nose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read and watched Youtube reviews saying there are two versions of this sponge, with the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; version feeling like memory foam when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> it wet, which gives me non-cakey look.  </li>
            <li> I use this sponge wet to apply liquid foundation and powder contour.</li>
            <li> did the other three disapear?</li>
            <li> I never spent the outrageous amt of $$ on the Beauty Blender and am really glad</li>
            <li> These sponges are less bouncy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit less durable than Beauty Blenders, but it&#x27;s inexpensively replaced.  </li>
            <li> If I wet the sponge it just dilutes the foundation and sucks half of it in.....</li>
            <li> I will be picking up a few extras because of the price</li>
            <li> just used it for my Halloween and Day of the Dead makeup.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;ve used a few beauty sponges and know that the one raved about is the Beauty Blender, but there is no way I am paying $20 for a sponge!  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice hardly any difference in foundation application from the Beautyblender.  </li>
            <li> The sponge itself is at least a legitimate RT blender, but the description is incorrect.</li>
            <li> Really ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a game changer for makeup application.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed when I received only one.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if them real or fake !</li>
            <li> But even if I&#x27;m disappointed with that aspect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed to had paid over price for one when I thought I was getting a deal.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything can be a dupe for the original beauty blender. The RT one is not as soft as the beauty blender, but you can still get smooth finish with it. Worth the price, but never compare to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if them real or fake !</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be 4 count &amp; I only got ONE.</li>
            <li> Amazing product a total dupe for the beauty blender at a fraction of the price. Great value as well with a set of four.</li>
            <li> I like this sponge. Blends my foundation into my skin without the sponge absorbing most of my make up. Great product!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this a little more than my Beauty Blender and I like the price point too. It is slightly more dense than beauty blender and a little harder to clean but at 1/3 of a cost compared to BB...I would repurchase this over and over again. I like the finish this gives when using a heavier foundation because I can easily sheer it out and the pointed side is perfect for under eye concealing. I also use it to apply powder so this is one of my favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li> Just like the beauty blender but better price point.  Won&#x27;t be dissapointed with its performance. Hopefully they will make more colors</li>
            <li> Only received one sponge, NOT four, so ended up paying more than this usually costs</li>
            <li> this sponge is excellent, I recommend it a lot, but to buy it at ulta or web page real techniques that is priced at $ 5.99 but costs more sales ECONOMIC here because I pay $ 8 more $ 8 shipping, very expensive.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;ve used a few beauty sponges and know that the one raved about is the Beauty Blender, but there is no way I am paying $20 for a sponge!  NO WAY!  So I looked online for recommendations for a good dupe and found many Youtube makeup women say this one was almost better.  I think I would agree.  THE FLAT SIDE IS INGENIOUS!!  I use that on all of my face and the pointed end for around eyes.  It&#x27;s perfect.  I bought mine at Ulta for $5.99 several weeks ago.  I was in there yesterday and they were sold out!  I will be picking up a few extras because of the price and I like to wash them often.  I&#x27;ve washed the one I have several times and it&#x27;s still in great condition, but I still want extras!  It gives a better finish with bb creams and foundations than my fingers or a brush.</li>
            <li> I love it, repurchase for so many times</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with the product. It truly gives a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> I have ordered an additional pack of 2 (via Amazon). The sponge is THAT good.  And so easy to use. I never spent the outrageous amt of $$ on the Beauty Blender and am really glad I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw couple of YouTube videos on this Real Techniques sponge and had to try it.  Fair pricing and it works beautifully with liquid foundation application.  (Might work very well with other types of foundations as well...havent tried it tho.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just run sponge under water to moisten. Squeeze excess water out in a towel.  The design is perfect with the flat side and the soft pointy tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it! I like it as much as my Sigma kabuki and my e.l.f. brushes.  Theyre all very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this sponge makeup applicator!!</li>
            <li> My daughter says it is much wonderful</li>
            <li> This works well as a makeup sponge. I have the beauty blender as well and I use these as well as the BB equally. These sponges are less bouncy so they&#x27;re not an exact dupe for the BB, but they work extremely well. They&#x27;re also extremely soft. The different shape is also a nice difference from the BB. It lets me get into the harder to reach areas around my nose.  Highly recommend this sponge for those who don&#x27;t have the money to spend on Beauty Blenders.</li>
            <li> super soft!! havent used it yet but im sure it will work perfect! came in super fast.</li>
            <li> The sponge is fine but the listening was for a 4 pack. I only received one.</li>
            <li> I like it and u will buy more and more</li>
            <li> I love the Beautyblender sponge but I&#x27;m not a fan of the price, especially when I like replacing sponges frequently.  This sponge from Real Techniques is a fabulous alternative.  It gets big and squishy when wet and I don&#x27;t notice hardly any difference in foundation application from the Beautyblender.  I do prefer the Beautyblender&#x27;s tear drop shape, but I&#x27;ll probably always stick with this sponge because of the value for your money.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice soft cosmetic sponge for applying foundation.  Not expensive but definitely advise sticking to these authentic products and not purchasing dupe sponges.  It definitely makes a difference.  Love the Real Technique Sponges.  Very smooth application.  5 star seller.</li>
            <li> Thank you very process was excellent and</li>
            <li> NOTE: I&#x27;m only giving it one star because it says it is a 4 count and I only got ONE. Beware when you order, you may only get one.</li>
            <li> bought a bunch of these. I don&#x27;t use them too often but I should. They work really well and expand quite large after getting wet. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read and watched Youtube reviews saying there are two versions of this sponge, with the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; version feeling like memory foam when it&#x27;s wet.  It explains why some people say it&#x27;s nothing like the beauty blender.  As for me, I, thankfully, have the good version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge applies and blends my concealer and foundation like a dream!  I now know what the hype&#x27;s about and think it&#x27;s worth buying, in my opinion.  I&lt;br /&gt;use it wet, which gives me non-cakey look.  I have used this with L&#x27;oreal Pro matte foundation and Nars Sheer Glow Foundation; It worked pretty well with them.&lt;br /&gt;As for cleaning, I use Johnson&#x27;s head to toe baby wash, like I do with my brushes, to keep this sponge clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this sponge.  It&#x27;s a game changer for makeup application.</li>
            <li> Am I the only person in the world who this is not working for? I can get the exact same result when using my fingers when dry. If I wet the sponge it just dilutes the foundation and sucks half of it in..... Hmmmmm&lt;br /&gt;I had similar un-success using brushes. Maybe my fingers are just that awesome?</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it said it was a 4 count. It was definitely only one sponge. This is misleading, and I could have just purchased a single sponge by itself at Walmart instead of wasting time ordering a single sponge by mail. The sponge itself is at least a legitimate RT blender, but the description is incorrect.</li>
            <li> It works just exactly the same as beauty blender! but at 1/3 of the price! I love it. This is wonderful, i ll now buy this instead of beauty blender. Thank you very much, samantha chapman!</li>
            <li> As an everyday beauty blender user, I recommend these more than the expensive original. This is a great item for the price point it is at. It has ridges where you can easily get to the nose and under the eyes to cover dark circles. This blends your foundation and concealer flawlessly. HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try the beauty blender but between the price and amazing reviews I had read about this one I went for it! It blends my conclear, foundation etc beautifully. It gives me a very flawless finish and I use less product with it!</li>
            <li> Have only used this twice, yesterday and today.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I&#x27;m quite a fan of the Estee Lauder foundation brush, and thought I&#x27;d never go back to sponges.&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing.  When I got to work this morning, a colleague asked me about my look.  Her opinion was that although I didn&#x27;t particularly look as though as I was wearing foundation, I looked as though I had the most perfect skin ever.  And I&#x27;m a forty year old smoker.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, and so I won&#x27;t comment on that.  But even if I&#x27;m disappointed with that aspect, I think I&#x27;d be tempted to buy this inexpensive sponge for future special occasions etc.  It&#x27;s worth it.  A flawless base in the shortest possible time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this product is  wonderful but the retail seller should had made it clear that it was only one sponge, I pay $14 for one sponge when it said 4 count. I&#x27;m very disappointed to had paid over price for one when I thought I was getting a deal. So beware don&#x27;t buy if it&#x27;s below the regular $30 for 4 count. I&#x27;m thinking about returning it, which I don&#x27;t want too cuz I was excited to try it out.The star it&#x27;s only for the incorrect lettering not the product.</li>
            <li> THIS SAYS 4CT BUT I ONLY RECEIVED 1..... THIS IS A SCAM!!!! BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> I use this sponge wet to apply liquid foundation and powder contour. It helps with flawless application. After stippling your liquid foundation, roll the sponge for an airbrush look. Love it. I wash mine after each use with regular dish soap with care not to rip the product. 1 sponge if cared for well will last 3-4 months. I received my order on time, as described, and well packaged.</li>
            <li> It is super soft and has great angles to fit into different corners of the face. It also blended very well.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to state my opinion on the marketing of this product.  It is ONE sponge, not FOUR as the description misleads you to believe.  Very disappointed when I received only one.  Description should be revised to clear any confusion that consumers would have.  Really ridiculous.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I really didn&#x27;t get what was so good about using this sponge. So I didn&#x27;t buy one until recently. Let me tell you, I was so wrong. It took me a little while of watching YouTube videos to make sure I was applying it correctly but once I got it down I saw why people love these. You face looks flawless; Pretty much airbrushed. Also, your foundation last longer because this helps spread a small amount evenly and it goes a long way. Just don&#x27;t forget to dampen the sponge before you apply your foundation.</li>
            <li> I like it better than my Beauty Blender.  It&#x27;s softer and the flat end is great.  It&#x27;s a bit less durable than Beauty Blenders, but it&#x27;s inexpensively replaced.  The price is definitely right.</li>
            <li> I thought its a four pack? I only got one! did the other three disapear?</li>
            <li> The sponge itself is great but I only received one, not four.</li>
            <li> There were only 2 in there. I love these sponges though.</li>
            <li> I follow a lot of makeup advice people and it&#x27;s DEFINITELY as good as the video review (on that site we all know about.) Just as good as the more expensive brand. I got the FOUR pk and my sister loved it so much she gave up a MAC brush she thought she couldn&#x27;t live without and had used it for a LONG time. She took two and I kept two. We&#x27;re both very happy with the way it applies makeup on all the different areas and contours of the face and we even use it for dry when needed for certain powder makeup depending on the application you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used it for my Halloween and Day of the Dead makeup. Even lent it to my boyfriend for his outfit. Wonderful. Can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
