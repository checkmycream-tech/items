            <li> I have very sensitive feet and very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> But if I wait long enough after using it to put on socks or get into bed then there are no stains.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to any woman wanting soft feel, less callous&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have dry feet that lotion just eats up.  </li>
            <li> This product did  not live up to the reviews I read before I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> This works as well as any over the counter remedy for rough, dry or itchy feet.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that I have to be careful of using it with socks or getting into bed too soon after using it because it can leave stains on the socks/sheets.</li>
            <li> If your feet are very dry and cracked and you haven&#x27;t kept up on the care of their appearance this will help.</li>
            <li> While this does help keep feet moist and soft, it is basically a very thick greasy product similar to shea butter.  </li>
            <li> will use it but plan to try other products before buying again</li>
            <li> Got a small sample somewhere</li>
            <li> And the biggest bonus is that food odor is a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> They were sold in extremely small jars.  </li>
            <li> As usual, I check Amazon and found the 4 oz.</li>
            <li> I get a little crazy in the foot department especially during the summer.  </li>
            <li> I still use it though along with a buffer to get the tough spots on my callouses on my feet.</li>
            <li> This was not just a nuisance, but a painful embarrassing situation.  </li>

            <li> I have tried many products for many years to deal with my dry cracking skin on my feet.  This was not just a nuisance, but a painful embarrassing situation.  New Feet not only works, but works great!    New Feet is the final solution to my life long problem.</li>
            <li> I get a little crazy in the foot department especially during the summer.  While this does help keep feet moist and soft, it is basically a very thick greasy product similar to shea butter.  It&#x27;s not that I did not like it its just that I have creams that basically already do what it does.  Be prepared for greasy content.  If your feet are very dry and cracked and you haven&#x27;t kept up on the care of their appearance this will help.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! I love this stuff...the local beauty supply was out for several weeks so I was excited and relieved to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Got a small sample somewhere and it worked so well I had to have more.</li>
            <li> I purchased a sample size of this product and was so pleased with the results that I searched online to get more!  I have dry feet that lotion just eats up.  This product keeps them looking good in sandals!</li>
            <li> This works as well as any over the counter remedy for rough, dry or itchy feet.  It soaks into the skin quickly, although I always put on a pair of cotton socks just after applying.</li>
            <li> does not rub in as much as thought it would.  will use it but plan to try other products before buying again</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive feet and very dry skin.  Even socks can raise blisters and corns.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of lotions and salves but this is the best yet.  I&#x27;ll buy this over and over.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bette K&#x27;s New Feet Cream every day for about 2 years.  My podiatrist always comments on how great my feet look.   They are smooth and soft.  I am over 60, so smooth, soft feet don&#x27;t necessarily come with the physical description. And the biggest bonus is that food odor is a thing of the past.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  I have given a jar to all my relatives.  They all love it.</li>
            <li> I discovered this stuff on vacation at a shoe store in a tiny try it out size.  Liked it so much, I ordered the large size.  Not too oily or greasy.  Soaks in quickly and my feet are getting nicer by the day.</li>
            <li> This product did  not live up to the reviews I read before I ordered it.  I still use it though along with a buffer to get the tough spots on my callouses on my feet.</li>
            <li> This is the only foot cream that really makes my feet soft.  I put it on at night with socks and in a couple of days of that, smooth and silky feet my husband loves!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product at a hair care store.  They were sold in extremely small jars.  I tried it and went back to purchase more.  I inquired if they could get this item in larger containers and was told it only came in the &amp;#34;tiny&amp;#34; jars.  As usual, I check Amazon and found the 4 oz. size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes your feet soft and smooth without feeling greasy. It lasts all day.  I recommend this product, especially if you wear shoes/sandals that expose any part of your feet.  Men should use this product also.  I love it and do not plan to ever run out of it.  It is pleasant smelling.  You neet to try this product.  You will NOT regret it.</li>
            <li> It does what it promises to do:moisturize your feet! A great product that very few people know about it!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me. YUK</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 1997 and I am a huge fan.  Nothing solves dry skin problems on the feet better than this.  I also use it on the ends of my hair after blow drying it and it repairs split ends until I can go in for a hair trim.  I also use it for my cuticles if I give myself a manicure/pedicure at home. The only down side is that I have to be careful of using it with socks or getting into bed too soon after using it because it can leave stains on the socks/sheets. But if I wait long enough after using it to put on socks or get into bed then there are no stains. I also love that I live in the area where this product is made so I am supporting a local business.  I wish it was available at more nail salons!</li>
            <li> My Grandmother loves this cream she swears its the be all to her corns :)</li>
            <li> this is such a great product - however i love it for my feet and my hands...........I will keep buying this product</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cream for chaped feet and hands too.  it makes them feel so good. I purchased it for several friends.  i first found it a shoe store but they stopped selling it so looked on google until I found iit.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product but I get it for 8.00 for 4 0z. Jar at a shoe store! The price listed here is robbery! Buyer Beware!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its supposed to do --- feel are soft, feel great.  Would recommend this product to any woman wanting soft feel, less callous&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Bette K&#x27;s New Feet Cream  saved my feet! I went from having dry rough skin hanging off of my feet in huge sheets, to having really smooth soft healthy  skin, in a week! This is a wonderful  product!</li>
            <li> I like it because when I put it on I could feel the results. ok.thats why I like it you need to try it</li>
            <li> I got a tiny jar at the grocery store and fell in love with how perfect it was for feet!!  Regular lotions seem to dissappear without doing any good, but this product leaves your feet smooth and soft!!</li>
