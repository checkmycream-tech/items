            <li>I have been looking for a Professional Hot Comb and was happy to find it here.  </li>
            <li>It heats relatively quickly and smoothly glides through my hair without pulling or tangling.  </li>
            <li>My best friend has one, and said that it made her transitioning natural hair look like she&#x27;d just left the salon.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job RIGHT!</li>
            <li>This is a good tool for me to manage my coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It heats and gets hot quickly, retains the heat, easy to use and seems like it will stand the test of time.  </li>
            <li>The tool heats up quickly and has on/off switch and tempature controls.</li>
            <li>It works as I had hoped and I do recommend it to all who want to do a quick freshening of the hair.</li>
            <li>I might just switch to a mild relaxer to straighten.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get hot; but MUCH better on your hair than using a hot comb</li>
            <li>I am now going without chemicals in my hair and it was super super curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this new hot comb, it heats very quickly and the amount of heat is at or more than what she needs.</li>
            <li>I am not a professional stylist but found it easy to handle and use on my own hair.</li>
            <li>Fantastic hot comb, and does everything that it advertises to do.</li>
            <li>I love this hot comb it has a lot of heat settings and works real well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who does not want to fool with the stove hot comb!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertized!</li>
            <li>Thank you Hot Tools!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the heat and that it gets my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Being that my hair is naturally kinky, I have to be able to straighten the roots as well as the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>and if you know how to use it, it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>worth every penny.</li>
            <li>If you only need a warm comb this would work for you.</li>
            <li>The comb get very hot but not too hot to cause damage.  </li>
            <li>and I could find the right settings for my course hair.</li>
            <li>and my hunch was right.</li>
            <li>You do not get the full refund.&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron was too large.</li>
            <li>, I just wish they had a smaller one and one with very fine teeth.</li>
            <li>It will not straighten it, but it will straighten it to a point where my hair is soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li>It really gets hot quick and it straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I can get my hair very straight without even going to its highest setting.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this works wonders for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve had an electric comb</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight, wide teeth, and easy-to-use controls.  </li>
            <li>Skip it, please, and find a Gold N Hot comb.</li>
            <li>I will always remember this purchase and never, ever buy another Hot Tools product again.</li>
            <li>that I wasn&#x27;t finding that many options online or in local stores for her.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that requires a hot comb for their hair needs.</li>
            <li>I like that it comes with a stand for the hot comb.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this pressing comb for about 2 months and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I can regulate how hot I want it</li>
            <li>It takes awhile to get hot.</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts longer then my first one.</li>
            <li>Stayed hot and did not pull my hair.  </li>
            <li>The comb did get hot, but it had no effect whatsoever on my hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hot as specified.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and thank goodness because I really needed this hot comb.</li>
            <li>When the new growth is present it does a nice job of smoothing it out.  </li>
            <li>I have more control with this than with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I liked the exp with other non-comb /flat hair straightners</li>
            <li>I like it better than the flat iron</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better a flat iron when u are trying to maintain hair volume.</li>
            <li>I love this hot comb because it&#x27;s easy to use and it has wider teeth than the usual hot combs</li>
            <li>Work very well sonce the first day of usage.</li>
            <li>The little stand is actually pretty nice too</li>
            <li>I would certainly recomend it to every one.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy too.</li>
            <li>Woks very well.  </li>
            <li>this product really works well, and did not over heat which would damage the hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this comb.</li>
            <li>but it did straighten but not bone straight.</li>
            <li>This iron gets my hair ALMOST as straight as when I go to the salon.</li>
            <li>Also and shipping and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Stand was very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon you never cease to amaze me.</li>
            <li>very convenient to use i can sit on the couch with one .</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>WORKS REALLY WELL</li>
            <li>I recommend this for the price, Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>I like this hot comb, but it does not straighten my daughters natural hair the way the on the stove hot combs straighten,  but heyyyyyy</li>
            <li>The comb does not get hot enough, I have natural hair that is fine and curly.</li>
            <li>When I want to straighten my hair for a more conventional look, it&#x27;s quite a project.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything as reliable as the old fashioned hot comb and oven...</li>
            <li>The Hot Tools Professional 1150 Pressing Comb works well for me.  </li>
            <li>It heats up well too and does a decent job at straigtening.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotcomb to EVERY WOMAN who has \\&quot;hard-to-straighten\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li>, I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li>Recommend this product highly</li>
            <li>Fantastic, gets a bit hot round the handles, but there are gloves for that.</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice, so I am not able to give this product a fair rating.  </li>
            <li>This hot comb is heavier that i expected it to be, but it really got my 4C kinky hair straight.  </li>
            <li>As a young 1st generation American,  Afro-Caribbean girl, I strive NOT to process my hair, and prefer to just use HEAT for the styles that require a minimal amount of my hair to be straightened, well this Hot Tools Professional 1150 Pressing Comb with Multi-heat Control, did the job, it was shipped very quickly, literally 2 days after I ordered it, so</li>
            <li>But overall if ur looking for a tool that is hot and u need to get the curl kinks from your skelp</li>
            <li>Comb only gets hot intermittently.</li>
            <li>and this comb didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me.</li>
            <li>I relax only 3 times a year, and I use this on my daughter&#x27;s 4c natural hair when she wants her hair straight.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s old hot comb was no longer heating enough for her hair and it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li>then flat iron hair your fohair will be so straight and full of volume ,overall it is only for touch ups</li>
            <li>I have natural hair, very coarse, very curly, and this does not straighten my hair at all.</li>
            <li>The handle moves pivots a bit causing me to turn myself frequently.  </li>
            <li>My hair is natural</li>
            <li>but even though it natural, my hair type is too soft and the amount of hit from the iron could be damaging.</li>
            <li>I regret not paying closer attention to the lower reviews on this item, and totally bought into the notion that this would get my hair close to bone straight.</li>
            <li>The pressing comb didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as a regular pressing comb</li>
            <li>I just started transitioning from a relaxer to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone natural and I&#x27;ve never pressed my hair without somone&#x27;s assistance.</li>
            <li>It shipped early and has no problems with it.</li>
            <li>My old...</li>
            <li>I have coily ,kinky natural hair and this straightening comb does the job.</li>
            <li>So I bought this item to get my African hair straight, it did not</li>
            <li>it has control settings so it takes the guess work out of waiting to cool down</li>
            <li>does not get hot enough for my hair type, to late to return for full refund.</li>
            <li>It was in brand new packaging, and it was obvious</li>
            <li>After purchasing this, I was heartbroken because I spent my good money on this poor item, and being a student, I already don&#x27;t have cash to just throw away.</li>
            <li>I love that it gets my very coarse and thick 4a hair and roots</li>
            <li>This comb straightened it...into a big old bush!  </li>
            <li>I barely ever use it.  </li>
            <li>,I don&#x27;t see how when I could touch it with my bare hand.obviously not for an extended period of time...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been &#x27;afro&#x27; natural for 18 months and trying to experiment with different hair styles.</li>
            <li>As a mixed woman with semi-kinky hair, a hotcomb is a MAJOR NECESSITY!!</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, the service was fast, the product is well made, and it does what the advertisments said it would do, I actually thought she had went to the hairdressers the other day.</li>
            <li>High heat felt like 200 degrees , didn&#x27;t help my thick hair much</li>
            <li>and I do mean old hot comb died on me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair too much or too little.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Thank you Hot Tools!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the heat and that it gets my hair straight.</li>
            <li> Being that my hair is naturally kinky, I have to be able to straighten the roots as well as the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> and if you know how to use it, it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> worth every penny.</li>
            <li> If you only need a warm comb this would work for you.</li>
            <li> The comb get very hot but not too hot to cause damage.  </li>
            <li> and I could find the right settings for my course hair.</li>
            <li> and my hunch was right.</li>
            <li> You do not get the full refund.&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron was too large.</li>
            <li> , I just wish they had a smaller one and one with very fine teeth.</li>
            <li> It will not straighten it, but it will straighten it to a point where my hair is soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> It really gets hot quick and it straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I can get my hair very straight without even going to its highest setting.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this works wonders for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had an electric comb</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight, wide teeth, and easy-to-use controls.  </li>
            <li> Skip it, please, and find a Gold N Hot comb.</li>
            <li> I will always remember this purchase and never, ever buy another Hot Tools product again.</li>
            <li> that I wasn&#x27;t finding that many options online or in local stores for her.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that requires a hot comb for their hair needs.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes with a stand for the hot comb.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this pressing comb for about 2 months and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I can regulate how hot I want it</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to get hot.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts longer then my first one.</li>
            <li> Stayed hot and did not pull my hair.  </li>
            <li> The comb did get hot, but it had no effect whatsoever on my hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hot as specified.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and thank goodness because I really needed this hot comb.</li>
            <li> When the new growth is present it does a nice job of smoothing it out.  </li>
            <li> I have more control with this than with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I liked the exp with other non-comb /flat hair straightners</li>
            <li> I like it better than the flat iron</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better a flat iron when u are trying to maintain hair volume.</li>
            <li> I love this hot comb because it&#x27;s easy to use and it has wider teeth than the usual hot combs</li>
            <li> Work very well sonce the first day of usage.</li>
            <li> The little stand is actually pretty nice too</li>
            <li> I would certainly recomend it to every one.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy too.</li>
            <li> Woks very well.  </li>
            <li> this product really works well, and did not over heat which would damage the hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like this comb.</li>
            <li> but it did straighten but not bone straight.</li>
            <li> This iron gets my hair ALMOST as straight as when I go to the salon.</li>
            <li> Also and shipping and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get my hair straight.</li>
            <li> Stand was very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon you never cease to amaze me.</li>
            <li> very convenient to use i can sit on the couch with one .</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> WORKS REALLY WELL</li>
            <li> I recommend this for the price, Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> I like this hot comb, but it does not straighten my daughters natural hair the way the on the stove hot combs straighten,  but heyyyyyy</li>
            <li> The comb does not get hot enough, I have natural hair that is fine and curly.</li>
            <li> When I want to straighten my hair for a more conventional look, it&#x27;s quite a project.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything as reliable as the old fashioned hot comb and oven...</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools Professional 1150 Pressing Comb works well for me.  </li>
            <li> It heats up well too and does a decent job at straigtening.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotcomb to EVERY WOMAN who has \\&quot;hard-to-straighten\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> , I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> Recommend this product highly</li>
            <li> Fantastic, gets a bit hot round the handles, but there are gloves for that.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice, so I am not able to give this product a fair rating.  </li>
            <li> This hot comb is heavier that i expected it to be, but it really got my 4C kinky hair straight.  </li>
            <li> As a young 1st generation American,  Afro-Caribbean girl, I strive NOT to process my hair, and prefer to just use HEAT for the styles that require a minimal amount of my hair to be straightened, well this Hot Tools Professional 1150 Pressing Comb with Multi-heat Control, did the job, it was shipped very quickly, literally 2 days after I ordered it, so</li>
            <li> But overall if ur looking for a tool that is hot and u need to get the curl kinks from your skelp</li>
            <li> Comb only gets hot intermittently.</li>
            <li> and this comb didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me.</li>
            <li> I relax only 3 times a year, and I use this on my daughter&#x27;s 4c natural hair when she wants her hair straight.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s old hot comb was no longer heating enough for her hair and it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li> then flat iron hair your fohair will be so straight and full of volume ,overall it is only for touch ups</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, very coarse, very curly, and this does not straighten my hair at all.</li>
            <li> The handle moves pivots a bit causing me to turn myself frequently.  </li>
            <li> My hair is natural</li>
            <li> but even though it natural, my hair type is too soft and the amount of hit from the iron could be damaging.</li>
            <li> I regret not paying closer attention to the lower reviews on this item, and totally bought into the notion that this would get my hair close to bone straight.</li>
            <li> The pressing comb didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as a regular pressing comb</li>
            <li> I just started transitioning from a relaxer to natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone natural and I&#x27;ve never pressed my hair without somone&#x27;s assistance.</li>
            <li> It shipped early and has no problems with it.</li>
            <li> My old...</li>
            <li> I have coily ,kinky natural hair and this straightening comb does the job.</li>
            <li> So I bought this item to get my African hair straight, it did not</li>
            <li> it has control settings so it takes the guess work out of waiting to cool down</li>
            <li> does not get hot enough for my hair type, to late to return for full refund.</li>
            <li> It was in brand new packaging, and it was obvious</li>
            <li> After purchasing this, I was heartbroken because I spent my good money on this poor item, and being a student, I already don&#x27;t have cash to just throw away.</li>
            <li> I love that it gets my very coarse and thick 4a hair and roots</li>
            <li> This comb straightened it...into a big old bush!  </li>
            <li> I barely ever use it.  </li>
            <li> ,I don&#x27;t see how when I could touch it with my bare hand.obviously not for an extended period of time...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been &#x27;afro&#x27; natural for 18 months and trying to experiment with different hair styles.</li>
            <li> As a mixed woman with semi-kinky hair, a hotcomb is a MAJOR NECESSITY!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, the service was fast, the product is well made, and it does what the advertisments said it would do, I actually thought she had went to the hairdressers the other day.</li>
            <li> High heat felt like 200 degrees , didn&#x27;t help my thick hair much</li>
            <li> and I do mean old hot comb died on me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair too much or too little.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair this isn&#x27;t the right product.</li>
            <li> I have a teenage daughter, she is mixed with black and white with very dry coarse hair and prefers silky straight hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several items from Amazon for years, and this hands down makes my top 3 of worse purchases.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to a flat iron and this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> I have tried others, including the flat iron, to no avail.</li>
            <li> but it did give my hair volume and got all of the curls out which my flat iron did not do , so if you have course hair buy this and</li>
            <li> or you hair to have a flat iron to use both.</li>
            <li> they last a long time.</li>
            <li> So, as a warning to other black or mixed girls with natural hair, this will not do well for you.</li>
            <li> so it can take a lot of heat as long as I use it seldom.</li>
            <li> Have not tried it on long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hot enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long combination wavy/wooly hair, which I usually wear in its natural state.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a little &#x27;mixed&#x27;</li>
            <li> I like the wide teeth which allows the comb to glide through the hair with minimal breakage.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you order and ask for&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for straightening natural hair.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of knowing that I won&#x27;t make the terrible mistake of placing the comb on my hair without letting it cool first.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as expected and is odd period when running it through your hair.</li>
            <li> I usually use a flat iron thereafter.  </li>
            <li> but non the less.</li>
            <li> A little too cumbersome to use</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair and this product does the job in NO time!</li>
            <li> The teeth are not fine</li>
            <li> Not only that, I can also control the heating temperature without having to wet it with a few drops of cold water like I would with the hotcomb that has to be heated on a stove.</li>
            <li> It usually lasts just past the year warranty and may need to buy another.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s bulky, and this makes handling a bit awkward.  </li>
            <li> This comb did nothing for my hair because it&#x27;s too thick.</li>
            <li> Let alone reviews were also very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have a vary thin hair.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible, terrible hot comb.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this hot comb, but it does not straighten my daughters natural hair the way the on the stove hot combs straighten,  but heyyyyyy I would recommend to anyone who does not want to fool with the stove hot comb!</li>
            <li> Just buy one. It really gets hot quick and it straighten my hair. I have purchased 3 in the last 30 years and this one seems the best&lt;br /&gt;out of the others. Highly recommended</li>

            <li> I found this item to be so-so.  I barely ever use it.  The handle moves pivots a bit causing me to turn myself frequently.  I haven&#x27;t found anything as reliable as the old fashioned hot comb and oven...</li>
            <li> Very nice.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve had an electric comb and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> As a mixed woman with semi-kinky hair, a hotcomb is a MAJOR NECESSITY!! This hotcomb does it&#x27;s job RIGHT! Everytime I get a perm and finish drying/moisturizing my hair, I use this hotcomb. What it does is straighten it the way I want it to be straightened and it allows me to get to the roots. Not only that, I can also control the heating temperature without having to wet it with a few drops of cold water like I would with the hotcomb that has to be heated on a stove. Being that my hair is naturally kinky, I have to be able to straighten the roots as well as the rest of my hair. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotcomb to EVERY WOMAN who has \\&quot;hard-to-straighten\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> I am better off with a straightening comb that you put on the stove. This comb did nothing for my hair because it&#x27;s too thick. My hair is natural so I&#x27;m quite sure it would be great on permed hair that is in-between touch ups. Very sturdy too.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it works well, I just wish they had a smaller one and one with very fine teeth.</li>
            <li> I thought I need something stronger to straighten my hair but even though it natural, my hair type is too soft and the amount of hit from the iron could be damaging. Know you hair type before purchasing. It works perfect on sturborn kink</li>
            <li> The comb get very hot but not too hot to cause damage.  A easy solution in between visits to the pros.</li>
            <li> Hot tools professional hot comb is awesome for smoothing out the hair, it does a wonderful job joined with Thermafuse f450 flat iron cream, this item should always be around, Hot Tools is the bomb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hot enough for my hair. I have a vary thin hair. It doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Straightened hair well, dont like plastic attached to the top of comb</li>
            <li> As a young 1st generation American,  Afro-Caribbean girl, I strive NOT to process my hair, and prefer to just use HEAT for the styles that require a minimal amount of my hair to be straightened, well this Hot Tools Professional 1150 Pressing Comb with Multi-heat Control, did the job, it was shipped very quickly, literally 2 days after I ordered it, so Kudos to the vendor on that!  It was in brand new packaging, and it was obvious it was never opened, I am pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This straightening tool was great because the heat settings were adjustable and I could find the right settings for my course hair.</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools Professional 1150 Pressing Comb works well for me.  I have very long combination wavy/wooly hair, which I usually wear in its natural state.  When I want to straighten my hair for a more conventional look, it&#x27;s quite a project.  However, this comb works.  It heats relatively quickly and smoothly glides through my hair without pulling or tangling.  It has a nice weight, wide teeth, and easy-to-use controls.  I especially appreciate the plastic bumpers at each end of the comb to help prevent burning the skin.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s bulky, and this makes handling a bit awkward.  Still, for the price, it&#x27;s an efficient, well-made tool.</li>
            <li> It worked well. I like the wide teeth which allows the comb to glide through the hair with minimal breakage. I also liked the no-tangle cord. The button controls are nicely located so that you are not accidentally turning it off as you use it.</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that works for me. I like it so well, I&#x27;m buying another one (price is reduced from 2 weeks ago). It works just as described...great and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible, terrible hot comb. I have natural hair, very coarse, very curly, and this does not straighten my hair at all. I can&#x27;t send this back now because I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve purchased several items from Amazon for years, and this hands down makes my top 3 of worse purchases. I regret not paying closer attention to the lower reviews on this item, and totally bought into the notion that this would get my hair close to bone straight. After purchasing this, I was heartbroken because I spent my good money on this poor item, and being a student, I already don&#x27;t have cash to just throw away. So, as a warning to other black or mixed girls with natural hair, this will not do well for you. Skip it, please, and find a Gold N Hot comb. My best friend has one, and said that it made her transitioning natural hair look like she&#x27;d just left the salon. I will always remember this purchase and never, ever buy another Hot Tools product again.</li>
            <li> The product is great because of the temperature controls and the light weight of the tool. I have been using it on my 6-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair instead of putting chemicals in her hair to straighten it and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My hair gets pulled between the teeth. This thing pulls your hair out! Avoid it!</li>
            <li> Great product! I enjoy the heat and that it gets my hair straight. I can travel with this instrument as well. Love, Love, it!</li>
            <li> Woks very well.  I was looking for an alternative to a flat iron and this fits the bill.  I can get my hair very straight without even going to its highest setting.  I have more control with this than with a flat iron.  I like the Multi-heat setting so I can have varying degrees of straightening.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate in puchasing this item.  I love the bumper guards on the ends that keep you from burning yourself.  The price is right and it is easy to clean.  The tool heats up quickly and has on/off switch and tempature controls.</li>
            <li> This product, in my opinion, is the best on the market. I have very thick coarse hair and this product does the job in NO time! I have tried others, including the flat iron, to no avail. This product is temperature controlled and that makes it applicable for any hair type. GREAT product, great price, I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> this product really works well, and did not over heat which would damage the hair.  great product and yes, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I liked the exp with other non-comb /flat hair straightners</li>
            <li> Did some research, read alot of reviews. Ordered this. I have a teenage daughter, she is mixed with black and white with very dry coarse hair and prefers silky straight hair. This comb straightened it...into a big old bush!  Claims to reach 430 degrees,I don&#x27;t see how when I could touch it with my bare hand.obviously not for an extended period of time...but non the less. I will be returning this asap.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, gets a bit hot round the handles, but there are gloves for that. great thing about it is the heating guage.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s old hot comb was no longer heating enough for her hair and it was time to replace it. Surprise for me that I wasn&#x27;t finding that many options online or in local stores for her. Let alone reviews were also very hard to find. So I took a chance with this and my hunch was right. My wife loves this new hot comb, it heats very quickly and the amount of heat is at or more than what she needs. She has even told me we need to buy one of these for her mother and sister so they don&#x27;t steal her&#x27;s! The design is very well, it does not feel flimsy at all and the weight is OK, the stand it comes with is also very good. I would recommend this product to anyone that requires a hot comb for their hair needs.</li>
            <li> I really like this comb. I chose it to help relax the curls in my hair. It works as I had hoped and I do recommend it to all who want to do a quick freshening of the hair.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Very good quality. I like that it comes with a stand for the hot comb.  It heats up well too and does a decent job at straigtening.  I am not a professional stylist but found it easy to handle and use on my own hair.</li>
            <li> does not get hot enough for my hair type, to late to return for full refund.</li>
            <li> The pressing comb didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as a regular pressing comb but it did straighten but not bone straight. I had it on 400. I have medium textured, 4b-4c grade hair. I might just switch to a mild relaxer to straighten. I&#x27;ve been &#x27;afro&#x27; natural for 18 months and trying to experiment with different hair styles. It&#x27;s a sturdy piece with a swivel handle.</li>
            <li> I just started transitioning from a relaxer to natural hair.  I have a very coarse African-American hair.  This iron gets my hair ALMOST as straight as when I go to the salon.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I&#x27;ve gone natural and I&#x27;ve never pressed my hair without somone&#x27;s assistance. I&#x27;m pleased with the pressing comb because I can handle my edges and press my hair on my own.</li>
            <li> I will be honest and give this pressing comb a good rate though this tool does work well on my hair I still have to straighten my hair first and then take the comb thru it and my hair is a fragile curl also im mixed. But overall if ur looking for a tool that is hot and u need to get the curl kinks from your skelp I recommend</li>
            <li> Excellent, I love this tool, it also work well for short hair, very practical, functional and easy to use. Temperature heating is amazing and can be regulated with the knob. Great product, thanks! Also and shipping and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> This product is a simple product.  The heat settings do the trick to help take the texture out of the root area.  I usually use a flat iron thereafter.  I&#x27;ve only used it on hair that is relaxed.  When the new growth is present it does a nice job of smoothing it out.  It is what it is and if you know how to use it, it is worth the investment. The teeth are not fine so it will go thru thickish hair.</li>
            <li> Good for temporary fix!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this pressing comb for about 2 months and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. I can regulate how hot I want it but the best feature is the rubber tip at the end of the comb. It allows you to get close to the roots without the fear of burning your ears or neck.  I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery excellent quality.</li>
            <li> worth every penny. love it  a lot</li>
            <li> Product ok, I don&#x27;t believe heating settings are correct. Won&#x27;t buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> This is the best hot comb I&#x27;ve found. It usually lasts just past the year warranty and may need to buy another.</li>
            <li> Great! Just what I wanted and needed. Exactly as advertized!</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair this isn&#x27;t the right product. Won&#x27;t straighten hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hot comb it has a lot of heat settings and works real well. Good product for the price</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to get hot. I use it every now and again.</li>
            <li> Comb only gets hot intermittently. It&#x27;s not good for straightening natural hair. If you only need a warm comb this would work for you.</li>
            <li> Just started using it and so far its great. I hope it lasts longer then my first one. The little stand is actually pretty nice too</li>
            <li> I like it better than the flat iron</li>
            <li> The comb does not get hot enough, I have natural hair that is fine and curly. Thought this would be a great product, looking into buying another brand.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse hair and this comb didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me. It&#x27;s nice but just not for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It shipped early and has no problems with it. I love that it has a holder so I won&#x27;t burn my counter.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hot comb. ....I previously had the older model for about 6/ 7 years and it finally gave out and this upgrade is just what I need</li>
            <li> This hot comb is heavier that i expected it to be, but it really got my 4C kinky hair straight.  I would recommend this to anyone who like a good balance with their combs.  Stayed hot and did not pull my hair.  The teeth spacing is  exactly perfect</li>
            <li> Fantastic hot comb, and does everything that it advertises to do.</li>
            <li> This is a good tool for me to manage my coarse hair. It will not straighten it, but it will straighten it to a point where my hair is soft and easy to style. And that is what I want.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get hot; but MUCH better on your hair than using a hot comb</li>
            <li> I love using this product.  It doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair too much or too little.  I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Amazing for a great price.</li>
            <li> Work very well sonce the first day of usage.</li>
            <li> My old...and I do mean old hot comb died on me. This one is great, effective, and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have coily ,kinky natural hair and this straightening comb does the job.It has a nice heating range.It straightens my hair nicely.I highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> I love this hot comb because it&#x27;s easy to use and it has wider teeth than the usual hot combs and It&#x27;s electric!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get my hair straight. Stand broke after one use. Stand was very flimsy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Easy to use and set and unlike most hot combs does not burn hair. I would certainly recomend it to every one. its</li>
            <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t get too hot like many electric combs and damage the hair. My hair is a little &#x27;mixed&#x27; so it can take a lot of heat as long as I use it seldom. This works perfect when I just want straight hair. Recommended.</li>
            <li> A little too cumbersome to use</li>
            <li> So I bought this item to get my African hair straight, it did not but it did give my hair volume and got all of the curls out which my flat iron did not do , so if you have course hair buy this and then flat iron hair your fohair will be so straight and full of volume ,overall it is only for touch ups or you hair to have a flat iron to use both. After I washed my hair I did not have any curls, my hair is now naturaly wavy and bouncer,  with lots of volume.For 3 years I searched for item that could get all my curls out it finally my hair is just how I want it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It&#x27;s definitely a must have or back up tool when you don&#x27;t want to bothered with the traditional pressing comb plus it has control settings so it takes the guess work out of waiting to cool down and/or over burning your hair. I love that it gets my very coarse and thick 4a hair and roots STRAIGHT!!!! It&#x27;s much better a flat iron when u are trying to maintain hair volume. Thanks, Amazon you never cease to amaze me. It&#x27;s also cheaper here than the local beauty store!</li>
            <li> I did not like this curling iron and await a refund or exchange. Be careful when you order and ask for&lt;br /&gt;a refund, you are charged a 15% restocking fee. You do not get the full refund.&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron was too large. I needed a smaller unit, 3/8 of an inch instead of 1 inch.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice, so I am not able to give this product a fair rating.  It is just okay.</li>
            <li> I love this pressing comb and the way you can manipulate the heat setting. my second one I&#x27;ve had in 5-7 years. they last a long time. very convenient to use i can sit on the couch with one . I use this for my outgrowth in between relaxers. I relax only 3 times a year, and I use this on my daughter&#x27;s 4c natural hair when she wants her hair straight.</li>
            <li> Worked very good, really holds the heat, also heats up quickly, does not burn the hairI would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I have been looking for a Professional Hot Comb and was happy to find it here.  I always use it and it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair.  Recommend this product highly</li>
            <li> The comb did get hot, but it had no effect whatsoever on my hair.</li>
            <li> What a great product! Shipping was super fast and thank goodness because I really needed this hot comb. I am now going without chemicals in my hair and it was super super curly and frizzy. The comb is the perfect heat to straighten my hair without burning it. I love it! Thank you Hot Tools!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this works wonders for my natural hair.  I no longer have a perm but still want  that  sleek  look,  and this gets  the job done for me.  Does not burn hair like the pressing combs you would place in a burner.  I like the idea of knowing that I won&#x27;t make the terrible mistake of placing the comb on my hair without letting it cool first.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hot as specified. This is my first hot comb and i m happy with the performance. Thanks.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT . WORKS REALLY WELL WITH MY HAIR (AFRICAN AMERICAN).</li>
            <li> I have just used this pressing comb just once since my purchase but I love it.  It heats and gets hot quickly, retains the heat, easy to use and seems like it will stand the test of time.  I recommend this for the price, Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Bought for my son since he has very short hair and curly  and he wanted to straighten it but did not work well for him. Have not tried it on long hair.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as expected and is odd period when running it through your hair.</li>
            <li> High heat felt like 200 degrees , didn&#x27;t help my thick hair much</li>
            <li> I was happy that it was able to find this hot iron comb and it work great and easy to travel with</li>
