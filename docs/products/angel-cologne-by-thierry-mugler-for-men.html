            <li>It is proudly my signature</li>
            <li>But if used sparingly, it is a great foundation that allows me to smell that way for an extended period.</li>
            <li>and Great Store service.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>

            <li>jean paul or use water or 212 gio alguo bone that smell good</li>
            <li>This scent is very stylish.</li>
            <li>I bought this after months of my Fiance useing Angel for women, and i could not be more happy with it.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the purchase and would buy more.</li>
            <li>I loved the scent, it wasn&#x27;t flowery nor to musky, kind of a mix between.</li>

            <li>my best friend say that I don&#x27;t wear too much, it is just the way that I smell.</li>
            <li>somehow, this is the kind of maculine cologne that follows the feminine path of an assertive scent.</li>
            <li>they are very strong smelling colones as well</li>
            <li>It has a very strong alcohol scent.</li>
            <li>Angel cologne for men is by far the best smelling cologne that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>What kind of cheap scam are you guys pulling here, Amazon?</li>
            <li>I have been using Angel Eau de Toilette for many years.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many designer scents, &amp;#34;Angel for Men&amp;#34; is a distinctive, elegant scent.</li>
            <li>Obviously, I love this scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li>and I love the BMen fragrance as well.</li>
            <li>This is the longest lasting and best smelling cologne on the market.</li>
            <li>the females love the way it smells and with that that can definately strike up a conversation piece.  </li>
            <li>I still enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love Thierry Mugler and A Men.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I listened to my girlfriend on this one.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite eau de toilette, I&#x27;ve been using it for 11 years and all the women loves it</li>
            <li>Have tried many others (Jean Paul Gautier, Kenzo, Giorgio etc).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more in the sugar side, so if you are looking for some wood or floral, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>The refill fit my flask and works as well, and smells as nice, as the refill before it.  </li>
            <li>I gifted my partner this scent</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I stopped using it. :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell and always get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>Purchased from amazon, Product appears to be authentic however 2 bottles arrived both with imprinted code (country of orgin ? ) removed from bottom of box and replaced with a silver sticker to match the box and cover up where numbers had been removed.  </li>
            <li>The Serial numbers on top of the bottles had also been ground off,</li>
            <li>Okay, get you some.</li>
            <li>I love A-Men.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t miss with these fabulous fragrances!  </li>
            <li>Love &#x27;um.</li>
            <li>and I love it to no end</li>
            <li>Decided to get some more and was just as I remembered it.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews of this product on amazon when considering the purchase.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant because many complain that the product is a knock off and that the packaging had been tampered, but I moved forward with the purchase.</li>
            <li>A birthday present gone right,and one very happy husband!</li>
            <li>It is very unique and get compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li>A nice sweet, woody smell.</li>
            <li>and i got it diligently, in good shape, and when i wear it a lot of people ask me the name of the brand, and they are ready to buy it too!</li>
            <li>Thierry Mugler makes many fine types of Cologne, but to me this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;eau de Kenzo (great for the summer), and more classic-style scents, Egoiste (Chanel), Intuiton (Lauder)(that last one being so under-rated)</li>
            <li>this perfume, if you can call it that; smells like damp earth, is too strong, even for the night.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t say for sure but in my opinion, after having worn this fragrance for many many years, what ever is in the bottle I got is NOT the real deal.</li>
            <li>but if you give yourself a little bit time, you and of course your accompaniment will recognize this attractive smell!!!</li>
            <li>The ladies enjoy it, too.</li>
            <li>Great winter cologne and two sprays last all day.</li>
            <li>but their smell is much more greater, and fresher.&lt;br /&gt;Overall If I am spending this much $$$$ on a colone....</li>
            <li>more, I will be very clear about this smells like cheap perfume and to top the smell</li>
            <li>Unique scent.</li>
            <li>Ordering was quick and painless and it arrived quite quickly!  </li>
            <li>However, the unique code inside the box has been removed.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, lasts a long time, and is not over powering.</li>
            <li>Not too loud, the fragrance announces itself in its own unique way</li>
            <li>Nothing was so cool than to hear</li>
            <li>Very woodsy and sexy.  </li>
            <li>Recipient was very pleased!mimwas pleased with the price and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>Smells good, last a while.</li>
            <li>The thing I love about the real Angel is its longevity.</li>
            <li>He smells so sweet</li>
            <li>And, Angel is my absolute favorite for myself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too strong and the smell isn&#x27;t as great.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was as fresh and unique as ever........</li>
            <li>Dont expect anything mild and humdrum.</li>
            <li>She wear it just about everyday and it smells pretty good!</li>
            <li>Saks Fifth Avenue offered a monogrammed metal flask when it was first launched at a special price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not cheap but it doesn&#x27;t require a lot to unleash its great scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my favorites, along with B Angel (Mugler also), Lolita Lempika (about the same kind of scent)</li>
            <li>I have to say that it is worth the money</li>
            <li>I’m the only one who wants people asking me what I’m wearing and telling me I smell so good.</li>
            <li>This is a really sweet and &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; smell, Females really turn their heads or compliment this fragrance.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely not the same quality that I experienced when I received my first bottle of Angel For Men as a gift years ago.</li>
            <li>Exactly the product I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this fragrance in 1996 when Saks Fifth Avenue had it as an exclusive.</li>
            <li>Wore it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Females were touching me more than they usually do ;)</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing various men fragrances for years on top of years, but I have never ever smelled anything quite like Angel for Men.  </li>
            <li>The first two I purchased from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This was the first time buying it online.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly where it&#x27;s going too...</li>
            <li>It has always been a favorite for the last 8 years.. . .</li>
            <li>But the first thing I noticed was the item was rewrapped in Thierry Mugler paper.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Angel has been a staple for me since I bought my first bottle.</li>
            <li>It now contains more synthetic fragrance instead of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I will contact the manufacturer on Monday to see if they have a logical explanation for this.</li>
            <li>The communion of different scents makes for a very unique product.</li>
            <li>I bought it and it was a smart move.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to any man as it is very attracting to women.</li>
            <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t so much the issue in my opinion.</li>
            <li>So much for saving time and money buying online.</li>
            <li>the difference in color is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Im very unsatisfied and</li>
            <li>The pricing was very competitive and shipping was always fast with Prime.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a light, but leasing fragrance, definitely not femine,but</li>
            <li>He loves this cologne and said it was the real deal.</li>
            <li>I love the availability that Amazon gives me to find this cologne at a reasonable price, and the convenience of not having to go to multiple big boxes searching.</li>
            <li>I already purchased a new bottle from Macy&#x27;s and thankfully it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this particular scent for a few years now, but love it just as much as I did before.</li>
            <li>i have been using the particular product close to 10</li>
            <li>When I got my second bottle from Macy&#x27;s, I sampled it first.</li>
            <li>It smelled different from my first bottle.</li>
            <li>It may be a little strong for some people.</li>
            <li>A little bit strong at the beginning</li>
            <li>This crap I got from Amazon smelled more like the first bottle I got so many years ago.</li>
            <li>Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma...</li>
            <li>Its not as blue as the real Angel.</li>
            <li>It is a spicy, masculine vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find this fragrance on Amazon.</li>
            <li>In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener &amp; some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries.  </li>
            <li>Last long in your body and its very ellegant.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Thierry Mugler&#x27;s clothing so it was only natural that I would be open to trying his scent.</li>
            <li>This is an unknown classic that will always draw compliments when worn.</li>

            <li> Thierry Mugler makes many fine types of Cologne, but to me this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;eau de Kenzo (great for the summer), and more classic-style scents, Egoiste (Chanel), Intuiton (Lauder)(that last one being so under-rated)</li>
            <li> this perfume, if you can call it that; smells like damp earth, is too strong, even for the night.</li>

            <li> Great winter cologne and two sprays last all day.</li>
            <li> but their smell is much more greater, and fresher.&lt;br /&gt;Overall If I am spending this much $$$$ on a colone....</li>
            <li> more, I will be very clear about this smells like cheap perfume and to top the smell</li>
            <li> Unique scent.</li>
            <li> Ordering was quick and painless and it arrived quite quickly!  </li>
            <li> However, the unique code inside the box has been removed.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, lasts a long time, and is not over powering.</li>
            <li> Not too loud, the fragrance announces itself in its own unique way</li>
            <li> Nothing was so cool than to hear</li>
            <li> Very woodsy and sexy.  </li>
            <li> Recipient was very pleased!mimwas pleased with the price and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Smells good, last a while.</li>
            <li> The thing I love about the real Angel is its longevity.</li>
            <li> He smells so sweet</li>
            <li> And, Angel is my absolute favorite for myself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too strong and the smell isn&#x27;t as great.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was as fresh and unique as ever........</li>
            <li> Dont expect anything mild and humdrum.</li>
            <li> She wear it just about everyday and it smells pretty good!</li>
            <li> Saks Fifth Avenue offered a monogrammed metal flask when it was first launched at a special price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not cheap but it doesn&#x27;t require a lot to unleash its great scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my favorites, along with B Angel (Mugler also), Lolita Lempika (about the same kind of scent)</li>
            <li> I have to say that it is worth the money</li>
            <li> I’m the only one who wants people asking me what I’m wearing and telling me I smell so good.</li>
            <li> This is a really sweet and &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; smell, Females really turn their heads or compliment this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not the same quality that I experienced when I received my first bottle of Angel For Men as a gift years ago.</li>
            <li> Exactly the product I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this fragrance in 1996 when Saks Fifth Avenue had it as an exclusive.</li>
            <li> Wore it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Females were touching me more than they usually do ;)</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing various men fragrances for years on top of years, but I have never ever smelled anything quite like Angel for Men.  </li>
            <li> The first two I purchased from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This was the first time buying it online.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly where it&#x27;s going too...</li>
            <li> It has always been a favorite for the last 8 years.. . .</li>
            <li> But the first thing I noticed was the item was rewrapped in Thierry Mugler paper.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Angel has been a staple for me since I bought my first bottle.</li>
            <li> It now contains more synthetic fragrance instead of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I will contact the manufacturer on Monday to see if they have a logical explanation for this.</li>
            <li> The communion of different scents makes for a very unique product.</li>
            <li> I bought it and it was a smart move.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to any man as it is very attracting to women.</li>
            <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t so much the issue in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So much for saving time and money buying online.</li>
            <li> the difference in color is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Im very unsatisfied and</li>
            <li> The pricing was very competitive and shipping was always fast with Prime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a light, but leasing fragrance, definitely not femine,but</li>
            <li> He loves this cologne and said it was the real deal.</li>
            <li> I love the availability that Amazon gives me to find this cologne at a reasonable price, and the convenience of not having to go to multiple big boxes searching.</li>
            <li> I already purchased a new bottle from Macy&#x27;s and thankfully it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this particular scent for a few years now, but love it just as much as I did before.</li>
            <li> i have been using the particular product close to 10</li>
            <li> When I got my second bottle from Macy&#x27;s, I sampled it first.</li>
            <li> It smelled different from my first bottle.</li>
            <li> It may be a little strong for some people.</li>
            <li> A little bit strong at the beginning</li>
            <li> This crap I got from Amazon smelled more like the first bottle I got so many years ago.</li>
            <li> Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma...</li>
            <li> Its not as blue as the real Angel.</li>
            <li> It is a spicy, masculine vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find this fragrance on Amazon.</li>
            <li> In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener &amp; some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries.  </li>
            <li> Last long in your body and its very ellegant.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Thierry Mugler&#x27;s clothing so it was only natural that I would be open to trying his scent.</li>
            <li> This is an unknown classic that will always draw compliments when worn.</li>
            <li> I originally started wearing Angel years ago and never experienced anything like this.  </li>
            <li> He has been wearing for about 5 years and has tried many other expensive brands but always comes back to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Compliments all day long.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase along with several other men&#x27;s colognes and started experiencing a rash/bumps on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I had a sample of this from way back and decided to try it the other day.  </li>
            <li> Some other buyers expressed the same concern so lots of sellers seemed to be doing this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is old and very little scent.</li>
            <li> What puzzles me is that the skin tight nylon wrap was sealing the box properly.</li>
            <li> The serial # was scratched and unreadable for some reason unknown to me.</li>
            <li> I was sent a new bottle after compiling and it was a bad as the first.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using this particular bottle of Angel and have not experienced any problems since.  </li>
            <li> It has  always come in a black box sealed in plastic from other vendors.  </li>
            <li> it smells like crap, they must have change the fragrance because it used to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> Watered down.</li>
            <li> But it was an exclusive for over a decade and a half</li>
            <li> The sales person told me Thierry Mugler changed it slightly.</li>
            <li> I held it up to another bottle of previously purchased Angel and</li>
            <li> This stuff I purchased started to fade in less than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had used it previously but had run out of it some time ago.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this item a month ago...and was a little desappointed.</li>
            <li> Is just not worth it!</li>
            <li> I feel I wasted my money whith this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past if I were to put this on in the morning, I can still smell it in the afternoon both on me and in the air in my house.</li>
            <li> Even putting a small amount on lasts all day at work and until I shower at home in the evening.</li>
            <li> If there is anything disappointing, after overall a decade of being sold at exclusive shops like Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman-Marcus, etc.</li>
            <li> I mean NOTHING) like this bottle of rubbish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Why would I pay less if this is a fake?</li>
            <li> I have been using since it came out and am a die hard fan!</li>
            <li> For the first time I tried in website and it turned out be worst product that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I combine it with Khiels Coconut Body Lotion (unfortunately Khiels no longer makes coconut lotion, however, one of their body lotions have a coconut scent that works almost as wsell).</li>
            <li> A STOCK CANCELLATION EMAIL WITH A FAKE APOLOGY DOES NOT MAKE UP FOR WASTING A WEEK OF MY TIME</li>
            <li> WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS \\&quot;SELLER\\&quot; THAT THEY CAN&#x27;T SUPPLY AN ITEM THEY SOLD?  </li>
            <li> If you are searching for cologne that will work in any occasion, this one will give you individuality and uniqueness in the masses of disturbing scents now out there.</li>
            <li> sorry!</li>
            <li> What a suprise to find a refill for this collectible container!  </li>
            <li> Therefore making it impossible to authenticate.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27; be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but in my opinion, it&#x27;s crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was sealed with plastic wrap but I opened up the box and the serial code to register it on their website had been cut out...What kind of cheap scam are you guys pulling here, Amazon? I&#x27;ve never had this happen before.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase along with several other men&#x27;s colognes and started experiencing a rash/bumps on my neck.  I had to stop wearing a gold chain that I had not taken off in years.  After months of only using one fragrance at a time, I determined that the Angel Refill was causing my skin problems.  I have stopped using this particular bottle of Angel and have not experienced any problems since.  I originally started wearing Angel years ago and never experienced anything like this.  This product is definitely not the same quality that I experienced when I received my first bottle of Angel For Men as a gift years ago.</li>
            <li> Discolored liquid, almost no fragrance. Would not order any cologne from Amozan again. Told I could not return. I saw no disclaimer on the order form.</li>
            <li> I have been using Angel Eau de Toilette for many years.  I keep on buying it because I feel good when using it.</li>
            <li> Exactly the product I wanted.  The scent is excellent, and I think it&#x27;s just a delicious scent.  The ladies enjoy it, too.</li>
            <li> In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener &amp; some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries.  Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma...</li>
            <li> Awesome&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Ryan</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this fragrance in 1996 when Saks Fifth Avenue had it as an exclusive. I am a fan of Thierry Mugler&#x27;s clothing so it was only natural that I would be open to trying his scent. Unlike many designer scents, &amp;#34;Angel for Men&amp;#34; is a distinctive, elegant scent. Sensual is a term that comes to mind also. The communion of different scents makes for a very unique product. I combine it with Khiels Coconut Body Lotion (unfortunately Khiels no longer makes coconut lotion, however, one of their body lotions have a coconut scent that works almost as wsell). Saks Fifth Avenue offered a monogrammed metal flask when it was first launched at a special price. I bought it and it was a smart move. It is proudly my signature fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It has become my signature scent. Nothing was so cool than to hear my best friend say that I don&#x27;t wear too much, it is just the way that I smell. I have tried the Body Creme which is made for women. But if used sparingly, it is a great foundation that allows me to smell that way for an extended period. I also have used the body wash/shampoo. Obviously, I love this scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is not cheap but it doesn&#x27;t require a lot to unleash its great scents.&lt;br /&gt;Angel Men has gotten me a lot of compliments from women so men looking for that approval won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough about Angel for Men. If there is anything disappointing, after overall a decade of being sold at exclusive shops like Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman-Marcus, etc. Walgreens has begun carrying it. But it was an exclusive for over a decade and a half so I guess mass merchandising had to kick in.&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s no big deal. It takes nothing away from this being a winning scent!</li>
            <li> This scent is very stylish. It smells beautifully and never gets too overpowering. Dont expect anything mild and humdrum. .. somehow, this is the kind of maculine cologne that follows the feminine path of an assertive scent. Not your regular type. It&#x27;s one my favorites, along with B Angel (Mugler also), Lolita Lempika (about the same kind of scent) L&#x27;eau de Kenzo (great for the summer), and more classic-style scents, Egoiste (Chanel), Intuiton (Lauder)(that last one being so under-rated)</li>
            <li> This is my husbands only cologne! He gets compliments where ever he goes. It may be a little strong for some people. Very woodsy and sexy.  Stays on all day.  He has been wearing for about 5 years and has tried many other expensive brands but always comes back to this.</li>
            <li> Unique scent. A nice sweet, woody smell. Wore it for the first time today. Females were touching me more than they usually do ;) Perfect to wear on a summer night out</li>
            <li> Angel cologne for men is by far the best smelling cologne that I&#x27;ve ever had. I would suggest this to any man as it is very attracting to women.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances and I love the BMen fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> 5-Star service and products.  I will forever order this product for years to come.  This is the longest lasting and best smelling cologne on the market.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing various men fragrances for years on top of years, but I have never ever smelled anything quite like Angel for Men.  I have to say that it is worth the money and then some.  Everytime I wear it I get an over welming response from women that makes any man feel good. Men....take it from me....the females love the way it smells and with that that can definately strike up a conversation piece.  It is definately the very best.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift. Recipient was very pleased!mimwas pleased with the price and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Brilliant!! and Great Store service. All good!</li>
            <li> Just purchased this item a month ago...and was a little desappointed. It&#x27;s a little too strong and the smell isn&#x27;t as great. I am currently using Jean Paul Gauthier (Le Male) and Pasha (Cartier) they are very strong smelling colones as well but their smell is much more greater, and fresher.&lt;br /&gt;Overall If I am spending this much $$$$ on a colone....I am raising my expectations and Amen just didn&#x27;t meet them...sorry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this product for a long time. This is my third bottle. The first two I purchased from Macy&#x27;s. This was the first time buying it online. Now I can&#x27;t say for sure but in my opinion, after having worn this fragrance for many many years, what ever is in the bottle I got is NOT the real deal. When I got my second bottle from Macy&#x27;s, I sampled it first. It smelled different from my first bottle. The sales person told me Thierry Mugler changed it slightly. I still enjoyed it. This crap I got from Amazon smelled more like the first bottle I got so many years ago. The fragrance isn&#x27;t so much the issue in my opinion. The problem is that it only lasts minutes. Literally. In the past if I were to put this on in the morning, I can still smell it in the afternoon both on me and in the air in my house. Compliments all day long. This stuff here is gone before I make it to work. It also doesn&#x27;t feel the same when spraying on my neck after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what is in this bottle but in my opinion, it&#x27;s crap. I already purchased a new bottle from Macy&#x27;s and thankfully it&#x27;s the real deal. Nothing (and I mean NOTHING) like this bottle of rubbish. That&#x27;s exactly where it&#x27;s going too... in the rubbish. So much for saving time and money buying online. When it comes to fragrances, stick to the department stores!</li>
            <li> What a suprise to find a refill for this collectible container!  Ordering was quick and painless and it arrived quite quickly!  The fragrance was as fresh and unique as ever........</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  I wear it for all occasions and am often asked what I&#x27;m wearing.  Additionally, it is the only toilette spray that I can get to last all day.  It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great price, exellent quality.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is exceptional! A little bit strong at the beginning but if you give yourself a little bit time, you and of course your accompaniment will recognize this attractive smell!!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this (and so do I) so I bought it for him for Christmas. Good price on Amazon compared to the department stores.</li>
            <li> Para empezar es un perfume algo fuerte no es para diario ni para dias calurosos en cambio en el invierno es algo buena, unos pocos sprays y es sufuciente. Es uno de esos perfumes que a muchas personas no les gusta y otros les encanta. Me he encontrado mujeres usando este perfume en la oficina y me dejan mareado.</li>
            <li> I love Thierry Mugler and A Men. The fragrance is simply amazing. I have been using since it came out and am a die hard fan!</li>
            <li> All I know to say is amen to A-Men.  This stuff smells so good!!!!!!!!!!!!  My woman cant keep her hands off me!!!!  Please someone help!!!!!!  I need to do some sleeping at night too!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> thats the product i wanted. whe i ordered it, it was shipped to me in no time and i got it diligently, in good shape, and when i wear it a lot of people ask me the name of the brand, and they are ready to buy it too!</li>
            <li> Smells good, last a while. Would buy from seller again after buying an adulterated version from another seller.</li>
            <li> it smells like crap, they must have change the fragrance because it used to be my favorite. The title says it all \\&quot;Toilette Spray\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Ladies: Get this after shave for you man. You won&#x27; be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A STOCK CANCELLATION EMAIL WITH A FAKE APOLOGY DOES NOT MAKE UP FOR WASTING A WEEK OF MY TIME WAITING FOR A PRODUCT YOU NEVER HAD.  THIS WAS TO BE A GIFT!  WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS \\&quot;SELLER\\&quot; THAT THEY CAN&#x27;T SUPPLY AN ITEM THEY SOLD?  DO NOT ORDER IF YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY BUY SOMETHING.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this fragrance. It has always been a favorite for the last 8 years.. . .</li>
            <li> This is a really sweet and &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; smell, Females really turn their heads or compliment this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Received item in a timely manner. But the first thing I noticed was the item was rewrapped in Thierry Mugler paper. When I opened the wrap the box said \\&quot; tester\\&quot; . Ive ordered this product a minimum of 5 xs and never seen it wrapped. It has  always come in a black box sealed in plastic from other vendors.  Then I looked at the color. Its not as blue as the real Angel. I held it up to another bottle of previously purchased Angel and the difference in color is very noticeable. Now the scent. Watered down. The thing I love about the real Angel is its longevity. This stuff I purchased started to fade in less than 20 minutes. Im very unsatisfied and now I know to purchase from my reliable vendor for Angel. Thought I was getting a deal but got hosed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this for my husband for this twice...every time he wears it, I feel the urge to stuff my face into his neck and inhale deeply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly recommend purchasing this cologne...</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, and my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I listened to my girlfriend on this one. Great winter cologne and two sprays last all day. It is a spicy, masculine vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite eau de toilette, I&#x27;ve been using it for 11 years and all the women loves it</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my man and he absolutely loved it! Smells so good on him too. Win-win situation. ;)</li>
            <li> This my prefered colony. Have tried many others (Jean Paul Gautier, Kenzo, Giorgio etc). This colony has a great parfum, and a great personality. It&#x27;s more in the sugar side, so if you are looking for some wood or floral, this is not for you. Last long in your body and its very ellegant.</li>
            <li> never buy in website.For the first time I tried in website and it turned out be worst product that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> The refill fit my flask and works as well, and smells as nice, as the refill before it.  The end.</li>
            <li> The best cologne ever - my husband loves it and the women perfume it&#x27;s as wonderful as the men  !</li>
            <li> I gifted my partner this scent and she loves it.  She wear it just about everyday and it smells pretty good!</li>
            <li> Angel has been a staple for me since I bought my first bottle. Thierry Mugler makes many fine types of Cologne, but to me this is my favorite. This is an unknown classic that will always draw compliments when worn. The pricing was very competitive and shipping was always fast with Prime. I love the availability that Amazon gives me to find this cologne at a reasonable price, and the convenience of not having to go to multiple big boxes searching. If you are searching for cologne that will work in any occasion, this one will give you individuality and uniqueness in the masses of disturbing scents now out there.</li>
            <li> This is old and very little scent. It has a very strong alcohol scent. I was sent a new bottle after compiling and it was a bad as the first. This is definitely not the Angel you buy in a department store. Do no buy!!</li>
            <li> At some point they changed their formula.  It now contains more synthetic fragrance instead of essential oils.  Loved this stuff until that point.</li>
            <li> I just received this and was looking to register it with circle.mugler.com. However, the unique code inside the box has been removed.  I have never had this issue purchasing in a store so I have to wonder where this product is coming from.</li>
            <li> After coming across my silver re-fill holder for this cologne, I immediately went and ordered this.  I haven&#x27;t used this particular scent for a few years now, but love it just as much as I did before. It is very unique and get compliments on it all the time. Even putting a small amount on lasts all day at work and until I shower at home in the evening. I don&#x27;t know why I stopped using it. :)</li>
            <li> this perfume, if you can call it that; smells like damp earth, is too strong, even for the night. I feel I wasted my money whith this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; jean paul or use water or 212 gio alguo bone that smell good, not this garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is more, I will be very clear about this smells like cheap perfume and to top the smell lasts until it hurts your head</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find this fragrance on Amazon. I have been wearing angel for quite some time now. I love the smell and always get lots of compliments. and Amazon had a great price so it was a win win situation.</li>
            <li> As a wearer of the womens Angel for over 15 years... I finally pulled the trigger and got this for my man.  He smells so sweet I just want to eat him up in this!!</li>
            <li> Purchased from amazon, Product appears to be authentic however 2 bottles arrived both with imprinted code (country of orgin ? ) removed from bottom of box and replaced with a silver sticker to match the box and cover up where numbers had been removed.  The Serial numbers on top of the bottles had also been ground off, Therefore making it impossible to authenticate.  Caveat emptor.....</li>
            <li> Do not buy this. I’m the only one who wants people asking me what I’m wearing and telling me I smell so good. Okay, get you some. I love A-Men.</li>
            <li> i have been using the particular product close to 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;It is a light, but leasing fragrance, definitely not femine,but&lt;br /&gt;frequently comented on by the opposite sex.&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey, but what the heck!&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> Love it...it compliments the Angel fragrance for women. Not too loud, the fragrance announces itself in its own unique way</li>
            <li> Amen by Thierry Mugler is the best.  Have purchased it for years for my husband.  And, Angel is my absolute favorite for myself.  Can&#x27;t miss with these fabulous fragrances!  Love &#x27;um.</li>
            <li> angel for men is the best  I have been using angel for quite a while now and I love it to no end</li>
            <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorites for me to wear. I had used it previously but had run out of it some time ago. Decided to get some more and was just as I remembered it.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this from way back and decided to try it the other day.  I loved the scent, it wasn&#x27;t flowery nor to musky, kind of a mix between.</li>
            <li> The serial # was scratched and unreadable for some reason unknown to me. What puzzles me is that the skin tight nylon wrap was sealing the box properly. I will contact the manufacturer on Monday to see if they have a logical explanation for this. Some other buyers expressed the same concern so lots of sellers seemed to be doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would I pay less if this is a fake? Is just not worth it! I feel deceived by Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this after months of my Fiance useing Angel for women, and i could not be more happy with it. It smells great, lasts a long time, and is not over powering. My fiance loves how it smells on me and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne that I like for my man to wear....so I already knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews of this product on amazon when considering the purchase. I was hesitant because many complain that the product is a knock off and that the packaging had been tampered, but I moved forward with the purchase. I ordered from Amazon directly (no third party seller). Product arrived on time. Husband was absolutely pleased! He loves this cologne and said it was the real deal. One squirt and he smelled like a dream all day and into the next morning. I am happy with the purchase and would buy more. A birthday present gone right,and one very happy husband! Thank you, amazon!</li>
