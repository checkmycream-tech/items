            <li>This is very light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily and my skin gets oily with most creams or lotions.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I read so many reviews on this before I bought it, keeping in mind the &amp;#34;shimmer problem&amp;#34; some people seem to have.</li>
            <li>The consistency of it is really interesting too.</li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this gel cream for daytime use, it&#x27;s lite &amp; feels breathable, almost like there&#x27;s nothing on my skin.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this in my birchbox and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>so I really thought this would be a great product.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish it smelled better but not a dealbreaker</li>
            <li>one of my favorites of the many products of philosopy...</li>
            <li>Yea, I love it.</li>
            <li>This has been hands-down my favorite.</li>
            <li>Like when you take a deep breath (perfect product name!)</li>
            <li>I have been a philosophy girl for years now and love many many of their products but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li>I realized it is working better</li>
            <li>Second UPDATE: Still using this as my night time face moisturizer and still very happy with it!</li>
            <li>I really love this cream/gel.  </li>
            <li>Makeup went on better.  </li>
            <li>Disappoint  LOVE this one also.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for something lightweight and refreshing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and goes on nicely.</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love that Amazon sells Philosophy, will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>Love all the Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, but light and gives your face a nice healthy look.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that Amazon has this product</li>
            <li>It is the best moisturizer I have ever used, skin feels soft, hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love love the moisturizer</li>
            <li>; you think it&#x27;s fully absorbed and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>I am finished looking for my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of great reviews about this product and really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li>The product is nice and light and feels almost cool on the skin, which was nice in the summer.  </li>
            <li>It does not break me out and goes on nice and cool.</li>
            <li>Nice cool gel is soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>I use Aquaphor on my skin at night because of extremely dry skin &amp; this seems to be the perfect combination.</li>
            <li>My skin has a never looked so smooth or refreshed, and I am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>and I just hope it is available for many years to come.</li>
            <li>The reasons I give them 4 star is they cames in a jar, is not hygiene and ted to get rancid easily like my clinique superdefense (they came in a jar too)</li>
            <li>Works very quickly and does not leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li>When first putting it on it feels really nice and light, but i dont know if its just winter time or my face or the lotion</li>
            <li>I got this as a sample somewhere and loved it so much I bought the full size.  </li>
            <li>For some skin types it probably works fine.</li>
            <li>I love that it is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The light blue tint and the great, light clean smell to it is just a bonus!  </li>
            <li>This goes on smooth and is light-weight and does not make my face greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Light gel-like feel.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels lightweight and smooth on my skin, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily finish.  </li>
            <li>I have combination light skin, prone to acne.  </li>
            <li>I have been using oil free water based creams as my face moisturizer and this one compared to</li>
            <li>I use this during the day for a light moisturizer and have had fantastic results.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth, but not shiny or greasy.</li>
            <li>This lightweight moisturizer doesn&#x27;t do either, which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Light yet moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is light absorbs well and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and the tone is even.</li>
            <li>I have been using maracula oil underneath it at night sometimes and the combination of the two feel fabulous.</li>
            <li>think we&#x27;ve all experienced the following: you put lotion or sunscreen on your face</li>
            <li>So light so fresh!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very light, not greasy, and is the first moisturizer I have tried that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this does a wonderful job at making/keeping my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much that I just bought the full-size product!</li>
            <li>Woke up with smooth, cool, even-toned skin.  </li>
            <li>With all the great reviews and the high price tag I had equally high hopes for this.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that true at all, a small dab each morning covers my face perfectly.</li>
            <li>I used to use Hope in a Jar and thought that was great (which it is) but had read the description for this one and figured I would give it a try because my face was still a bit dry.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best facial moisturizer I have used to date.</li>
            <li>It is also good for the day because it is really lite, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like too much on my skin before I put on my foundation.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite moisturizer!</li>
            <li>And I always needed to put more moisturizer on certain spots.</li>
            <li>This is a cool gel</li>
            <li>It really is like a gel-cream, and I love it.</li>
            <li>it rehydrates your thirsty skin a definite good product.</li>
            <li>I had to buy the full size when I ran out of the sample and</li>
            <li>I bought this for the quick absorption.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HYDRATION IS SHORT-LIVED: doesn&#x27;t keep your face hydrated, it just dries off quickly</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with Take a Deep Breath gel moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job of keeping my skin hydrated all day long.  </li>
            <li>This little magic potion feeds my face with antioxidants and cool refreshing fast absorbing happiness.  </li>
            <li>There are some great things about this cream; it doesn&#x27;t make an oil slick on your face, it soaks in quickly, and it smells clean.</li>
            <li>I got the moisture I really needed in some areas, but (since it is Oil Free), not a greasy feeling at all.  </li>
            <li>your skin feels like a fresh breath of air......</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, but rarely break out anymore.</li>
            <li>It IS like a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>It lasts quite a while as well, so for me, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good value for the price, and though it may seem a little pricey, it is well worth it!</li>
            <li>Not as good as other products.</li>
            <li>Gives me just the right amount of moisture and doesn&#x27;t make me greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I also liked Hope in a Jar, but I wanted to switch to something oil-free and lightweight, plus that one had a strange fish smell.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy and provides your skin with an amazing kind of smoothness that no other big name product lines have thus far.</li>
            <li>I just use good old neutrogena with salicylic acid for daily acne prevention and cleansing and place this under my makeup.</li>
            <li>This is supposed to help sensitive skin, but it turned my face bright red within seconds.  </li>
            <li>The texture of my skin was greatly enhanced and the tones evened out in such a way as to make my skin look well rested and properly hydrated.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, which is really important to me because I really dislike face products with any sort of fragrance to them.</li>
            <li>I place this under my eyes very gently and they wakeup, feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance that is not strong, and absorbs almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of this brand but not too much on this particular face cream.</li>
            <li>I find that it does leave some sparkles on my skin, so it may not be appropriate for male users, or for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to sparkle in the sun.</li>
            <li>have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li>First moisturizer for my face that doesn&#x27;t make my face oily.</li>
            <li>When you put it on your face, at first it feels like a soap or something that should be washed off.</li>
            <li>Upon rubbing it in gently, it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>, you really don&#x27;t need a lot of product!)</li>
            <li>I wish I would have saved the money or tried it in a store first.  </li>
            <li>I really like this face lotion at hydrating and keeping my appearance fresh.</li>
            <li>Many white heads r on my face now.</li>
            <li>My makeup applies funny if I use it in the morning.</li>
            <li>I first tried this moisturizer from a sample I received from Philosophy&#x27;s Facebook page.  </li>
            <li>BUT, as soon as that hot summer sun hits your face, it gets greasy and your skin starts to sweat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I have needed and been looking for all along.</li>
            <li>when I first put it on, even when my face isn&#x27;t greasy, I feel that it makes my face look shiny.  </li>
            <li>This product is just right for my combo/ sensitive skin and feels almost cool when applied</li>
            <li>Not the kind that causes acne, or other skin conditions.</li>
            <li>I use the Clean &amp; Clear - Morning Burst Fruit Infusions Hydrating cleanser (Pineapple) cleanser</li>
            <li>It just had a soft, clean feel to it and not a blemish in sight.  </li>
            <li>It definitely hydrates well (better than Hope), but it makes my face greasy and the Hope didn&#x27;t really do that.  </li>
            <li>Hope in a jar for dry skin worked better.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin that is acme prone, even at 44.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying this - but will switch to olay total effects to help with fine lines at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age: 40</li>
            <li>I liked miracle worker, but found it a little too greasy for me.  </li>
            <li>A very soothing gel to put on your skin...</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Works very well with my skin</li>
            <li>I really think this lotion is like skin vegetables.  </li>
            <li>I think the Lancome one was still not really oil-free, but this one for sure is.</li>
            <li>Then, Philosophy offered a free sample of Take A Deep Breath.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>but i do find that my skin needs either a reapplication by the end of the day or its just really ready for the night time products i use.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey for the amount you receive, but it doesn&#x27;t take much and it you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>However, it really does not moisturize.</li>
            <li>in fact, it dried my skin out so much it burned and gave my face a warm feeling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving this a try if your skin has just been feeling dull, lackluster or you&#x27;re looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If you have really dry skin that doesn&#x27;t get greasy easily</li>
            <li>in my mid 30 i still have very oily acne prone skin, I can only use very light moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin that is prone to break outs if over moisturized.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend for anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and will be using it again.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something lighter than the clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel or the neutrogena sensitive skin oil free lotion I normally use (first in AM, second in PM), and this was much, much heavier feeling on my face than both.</li>
            <li>and I find it appropriate for year round weather.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine subscribes to a few of those Birchboxes, Glambags, etc &amp; always give me her non-make up items which I gladly take.</li>
            <li>I will be able to use this one year round.</li>
            <li>I am also a makeup artist and a very busy lady who hardly has any time for her own skin.</li>
            <li>It feels rather cool when I apply it but afterwards makes my skin feel dry and taunt.</li>
            <li>I also do the Microdelivery Peel (the new 12 week one) once a week.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily but rather leaves it soft &amp; nourished!</li>
            <li>I used it and it felt ok for a minute or two, then it felt like I was developing an oil slick.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  Put it on as night cream.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for about a week and then resigned to buying a new moisturizer (hope in a jar, an old trusted standby- should have never branched out).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Its my solution to forty year old skin that can not take any oil on it.  </li>
            <li>I look really young for my age, but I know those lines are trying to form.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I can completely give up my HIAJ, but I&#x27;m thinking of using TADB in the summer, and HIAJ in the winter.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and suffer from rosacea, but I had no problems with this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My face is so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>(I have fairly sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product because it does hydrate really really well.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>30 minutes after putting it on, I felt a very familiar overall dryness to my skin and could actually feel a rough patch on my chin.</li>
            <li>There is not much of a smell and it smells WAY BETTER than the other facial moisturizers by Philosophy.</li>
            <li>Just three days, I feel my pores are getting smaller, and it&#x27;s a lot easier to clean my black heads now.</li>
            <li>2 oz is really not that much product.</li>
            <li>I have normal to slightly dry skin</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be combination, a little dry and very oily in certain parts of my face.</li>
            <li>Some other people have stated that it doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture during the winter, which could be true, but I have very dry skin</li>
            <li>Felt a little tacky at first</li>
            <li>I now changed back to bare minerals and will not change!</li>
            <li>I had been using bare minerals moisturizer and decided to give Philosophy&#x27;s Take a deep breath Oil-free Energizing Oxygen Gel cream</li>
            <li>Due to the super humid summer it was making my face a greasy mess.</li>
            <li>I am 49 years old and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I really really wanted to like this cream, after all its Philosophy brand and its also a little pricey</li>
            <li>Only need a little to cover your whole face and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is very light and non greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily and my skin gets oily with most creams or lotions.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews on this before I bought it, keeping in mind the &amp;#34;shimmer problem&amp;#34; some people seem to have.</li>
            <li> The consistency of it is really interesting too.</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this gel cream for daytime use, it&#x27;s lite &amp; feels breathable, almost like there&#x27;s nothing on my skin.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in my birchbox and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> so I really thought this would be a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish it smelled better but not a dealbreaker</li>
            <li> one of my favorites of the many products of philosopy...</li>
            <li> Yea, I love it.</li>
            <li> This has been hands-down my favorite.</li>
            <li> Like when you take a deep breath (perfect product name!)</li>
            <li> I have been a philosophy girl for years now and love many many of their products but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> I realized it is working better</li>
            <li> Second UPDATE: Still using this as my night time face moisturizer and still very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream/gel.  </li>
            <li> Makeup went on better.  </li>
            <li> Disappoint  LOVE this one also.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for something lightweight and refreshing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy more.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love that Amazon sells Philosophy, will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Love all the Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, but light and gives your face a nice healthy look.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that Amazon has this product</li>
            <li> It is the best moisturizer I have ever used, skin feels soft, hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love love the moisturizer</li>
            <li> ; you think it&#x27;s fully absorbed and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I am finished looking for my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of great reviews about this product and really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> The product is nice and light and feels almost cool on the skin, which was nice in the summer.  </li>
            <li> It does not break me out and goes on nice and cool.</li>
            <li> Nice cool gel is soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> I use Aquaphor on my skin at night because of extremely dry skin &amp; this seems to be the perfect combination.</li>
            <li> My skin has a never looked so smooth or refreshed, and I am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> and I just hope it is available for many years to come.</li>
            <li> The reasons I give them 4 star is they cames in a jar, is not hygiene and ted to get rancid easily like my clinique superdefense (they came in a jar too)</li>
            <li> Works very quickly and does not leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> When first putting it on it feels really nice and light, but i dont know if its just winter time or my face or the lotion</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample somewhere and loved it so much I bought the full size.  </li>
            <li> For some skin types it probably works fine.</li>
            <li> I love that it is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The light blue tint and the great, light clean smell to it is just a bonus!  </li>
            <li> This goes on smooth and is light-weight and does not make my face greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> Light gel-like feel.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> It feels lightweight and smooth on my skin, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily finish.  </li>
            <li> I have combination light skin, prone to acne.  </li>
            <li> I have been using oil free water based creams as my face moisturizer and this one compared to</li>
            <li> I use this during the day for a light moisturizer and have had fantastic results.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face smooth, but not shiny or greasy.</li>
            <li> This lightweight moisturizer doesn&#x27;t do either, which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Light yet moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is light absorbs well and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and the tone is even.</li>
            <li> I have been using maracula oil underneath it at night sometimes and the combination of the two feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> think we&#x27;ve all experienced the following: you put lotion or sunscreen on your face</li>
            <li> So light so fresh!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very light, not greasy, and is the first moisturizer I have tried that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this does a wonderful job at making/keeping my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much that I just bought the full-size product!</li>
            <li> Woke up with smooth, cool, even-toned skin.  </li>
            <li> With all the great reviews and the high price tag I had equally high hopes for this.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that true at all, a small dab each morning covers my face perfectly.</li>
            <li> I used to use Hope in a Jar and thought that was great (which it is) but had read the description for this one and figured I would give it a try because my face was still a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial moisturizer I have used to date.</li>
            <li> It is also good for the day because it is really lite, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like too much on my skin before I put on my foundation.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite moisturizer!</li>
            <li> And I always needed to put more moisturizer on certain spots.</li>
            <li> This is a cool gel</li>
            <li> It really is like a gel-cream, and I love it.</li>
            <li> it rehydrates your thirsty skin a definite good product.</li>
            <li> I had to buy the full size when I ran out of the sample and</li>
            <li> I bought this for the quick absorption.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HYDRATION IS SHORT-LIVED: doesn&#x27;t keep your face hydrated, it just dries off quickly</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with Take a Deep Breath gel moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it does a good job of keeping my skin hydrated all day long.  </li>
            <li> This little magic potion feeds my face with antioxidants and cool refreshing fast absorbing happiness.  </li>
            <li> There are some great things about this cream; it doesn&#x27;t make an oil slick on your face, it soaks in quickly, and it smells clean.</li>
            <li> I got the moisture I really needed in some areas, but (since it is Oil Free), not a greasy feeling at all.  </li>
            <li> your skin feels like a fresh breath of air......</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, but rarely break out anymore.</li>
            <li> It IS like a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a while as well, so for me, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good value for the price, and though it may seem a little pricey, it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Not as good as other products.</li>
            <li> Gives me just the right amount of moisture and doesn&#x27;t make me greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I also liked Hope in a Jar, but I wanted to switch to something oil-free and lightweight, plus that one had a strange fish smell.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy and provides your skin with an amazing kind of smoothness that no other big name product lines have thus far.</li>
            <li> I just use good old neutrogena with salicylic acid for daily acne prevention and cleansing and place this under my makeup.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to help sensitive skin, but it turned my face bright red within seconds.  </li>
            <li> The texture of my skin was greatly enhanced and the tones evened out in such a way as to make my skin look well rested and properly hydrated.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, which is really important to me because I really dislike face products with any sort of fragrance to them.</li>
            <li> I place this under my eyes very gently and they wakeup, feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant fragrance that is not strong, and absorbs almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this brand but not too much on this particular face cream.</li>
            <li> I find that it does leave some sparkles on my skin, so it may not be appropriate for male users, or for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to sparkle in the sun.</li>
            <li> have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li> First moisturizer for my face that doesn&#x27;t make my face oily.</li>
            <li> When you put it on your face, at first it feels like a soap or something that should be washed off.</li>
            <li> Upon rubbing it in gently, it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and fresh all day.</li>
            <li> , you really don&#x27;t need a lot of product!)</li>
            <li> I wish I would have saved the money or tried it in a store first.  </li>
            <li> I really like this face lotion at hydrating and keeping my appearance fresh.</li>
            <li> Many white heads r on my face now.</li>
            <li> My makeup applies funny if I use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> I first tried this moisturizer from a sample I received from Philosophy&#x27;s Facebook page.  </li>
            <li> BUT, as soon as that hot summer sun hits your face, it gets greasy and your skin starts to sweat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I have needed and been looking for all along.</li>
            <li> when I first put it on, even when my face isn&#x27;t greasy, I feel that it makes my face look shiny.  </li>
            <li> This product is just right for my combo/ sensitive skin and feels almost cool when applied</li>
            <li> Not the kind that causes acne, or other skin conditions.</li>
            <li> I use the Clean &amp; Clear - Morning Burst Fruit Infusions Hydrating cleanser (Pineapple) cleanser</li>
            <li> It just had a soft, clean feel to it and not a blemish in sight.  </li>
            <li> It definitely hydrates well (better than Hope), but it makes my face greasy and the Hope didn&#x27;t really do that.  </li>
            <li> Hope in a jar for dry skin worked better.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that is acme prone, even at 44.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying this - but will switch to olay total effects to help with fine lines at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age: 40</li>
            <li> I liked miracle worker, but found it a little too greasy for me.  </li>
            <li> A very soothing gel to put on your skin...</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Works very well with my skin</li>
            <li> I really think this lotion is like skin vegetables.  </li>
            <li> I think the Lancome one was still not really oil-free, but this one for sure is.</li>
            <li> Then, Philosophy offered a free sample of Take A Deep Breath.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> but i do find that my skin needs either a reapplication by the end of the day or its just really ready for the night time products i use.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey for the amount you receive, but it doesn&#x27;t take much and it you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> However, it really does not moisturize.</li>
            <li> in fact, it dried my skin out so much it burned and gave my face a warm feeling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this a try if your skin has just been feeling dull, lackluster or you&#x27;re looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin that doesn&#x27;t get greasy easily</li>
            <li> in my mid 30 i still have very oily acne prone skin, I can only use very light moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin that is prone to break outs if over moisturized.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend for anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and will be using it again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something lighter than the clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel or the neutrogena sensitive skin oil free lotion I normally use (first in AM, second in PM), and this was much, much heavier feeling on my face than both.</li>
            <li> and I find it appropriate for year round weather.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine subscribes to a few of those Birchboxes, Glambags, etc &amp; always give me her non-make up items which I gladly take.</li>
            <li> I will be able to use this one year round.</li>
            <li> I am also a makeup artist and a very busy lady who hardly has any time for her own skin.</li>
            <li> It feels rather cool when I apply it but afterwards makes my skin feel dry and taunt.</li>
            <li> I also do the Microdelivery Peel (the new 12 week one) once a week.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily but rather leaves it soft &amp; nourished!</li>
            <li> I used it and it felt ok for a minute or two, then it felt like I was developing an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  Put it on as night cream.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for about a week and then resigned to buying a new moisturizer (hope in a jar, an old trusted standby- should have never branched out).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Its my solution to forty year old skin that can not take any oil on it.  </li>
            <li> I look really young for my age, but I know those lines are trying to form.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can completely give up my HIAJ, but I&#x27;m thinking of using TADB in the summer, and HIAJ in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and suffer from rosacea, but I had no problems with this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My face is so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> (I have fairly sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product because it does hydrate really really well.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> 30 minutes after putting it on, I felt a very familiar overall dryness to my skin and could actually feel a rough patch on my chin.</li>
            <li> There is not much of a smell and it smells WAY BETTER than the other facial moisturizers by Philosophy.</li>
            <li> Just three days, I feel my pores are getting smaller, and it&#x27;s a lot easier to clean my black heads now.</li>
            <li> 2 oz is really not that much product.</li>
            <li> I have normal to slightly dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be combination, a little dry and very oily in certain parts of my face.</li>
            <li> Some other people have stated that it doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture during the winter, which could be true, but I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Felt a little tacky at first</li>
            <li> I now changed back to bare minerals and will not change!</li>
            <li> I had been using bare minerals moisturizer and decided to give Philosophy&#x27;s Take a deep breath Oil-free Energizing Oxygen Gel cream</li>
            <li> Due to the super humid summer it was making my face a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I am 49 years old and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to like this cream, after all its Philosophy brand and its also a little pricey</li>
            <li> Only need a little to cover your whole face and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily</li>
            <li> This moisturize is a bit pricey, but a little product goes a very long way like most Philosophy products, and I noticed that Amazon has it listed a few dollars cheaper than on any other site, so this is definitely a pick up must!  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a teeny tiny bit so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I feel Philosophy charges too much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sensitive skin: doesn&#x27;t mess with my sensitive skin at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results</li>
            <li> It left a film on my skin after application that I could rub off later on in the day when I realized it had not absorbed.  </li>
            <li> If you are not sensitive to smell, then you can try it out..</li>
            <li> I had to go back to regular hope in a jar - though I feel that mixture is slightly oily.</li>
            <li> I have oily and dry skin....</li>
            <li> I also use this on my hands because they are always so dry</li>
            <li> but it gets my face really dry which I dont like</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with patches of dry skin over my face.</li>
            <li> I hope they never discontinue this because I will be using it for a very very long time!</li>
            <li> After I apply Cetaphil cream over my body, I get a dime size (actually it&#x27;s probably less than that</li>
            <li> I suspect they put Hydrogen Peroxide in it, which is not good for the skin, yes, it kills bacteria, but the WRONG KIND.</li>
            <li> I always knew their products were of high quality, but I&#x27;m always afraid of trying new moisturizers for fear of breaking out</li>
            <li> I usually use this moisturizer after I was my face with Purity Made Simple facial cleanser, and I also use the Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Since this is quick-drying, I wouldn&#x27;t say &#x27;a little goes a long way&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It takes very little product to be enough.</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 other Philosophy moisturizers and they both broke me out.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin which is normally extremely dry, but my forehead and nose can get a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is a subtle green color, not clear or white, so just realize the film is slightly tinted.</li>
            <li> Feeling clogged and icky recently this winter.  </li>
            <li> But idk ill give it a try when winter is over when my face goes back to being oily not dry.</li>
            <li> Not super moisturizing either.</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily skin in winter in the T Zone .This</li>
            <li> the  Lancome aqua is less hydrating, and generally a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> A little mascara</li>
            <li> like I said, even people with dry skin need moisturized but matte skin--nobody wants greasy skin from a bad moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you could save a few bucks rather than store bought</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin but isn&#x27;t heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like moisturizers that are so heavy that you feel like your skin can&#x27;t breathe.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a million moisturizers but often end up having dried out or oily skin.</li>
            <li> This has no smell, so if you&#x27;re only gripe with Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar was the unpleasant smell, I recommend trying this Take a Deep Breath moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin, but even my skin can look greasy with a bad, nonabsorbent lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used cream with oil f a long time, which made my oily skin worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the lotion itself that leaves the oil slick, or if the lotion isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I need</li>
            <li> In fact, I found it made my skin softer than my usual Aveeno moisturizer.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> When this cream came out, my skin was feeling dull and lacking a glow.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hardly noticeable unless you stare at your face a foot away from the mirror, so you run no risk of looking like a disco ball.</li>
            <li> I would bypass this product, at least just try and obtain a sample instead of buying the jar.</li>
            <li> this contains (very small, sparse, almost invisible) flecks of micro-shimmer, but it&#x27;s not visible when you use it on</li>
            <li> It made my skin dry out and break out with horrible white heads.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and do not struggle with acne, so this was a very unpleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> A lil disappointed in the moisturizer in this facial cream..</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to toss it in the trash.  </li>
            <li> I only used it for a week and my skin took a turn for the worst.</li>
            <li> I have difficult skin</li>
            <li> I will be sticking to my trusted Ponds cold cream.</li>
            <li> I like how this one doesnt smell as bad as the hope in a jar one does.</li>
            <li> I tend to get oily during the day &amp; it&#x27;s not as bad with this cream.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize well, but it ended up making me break out badly.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that I didn&#x27;t break out.  </li>
            <li> When I use the wrong cleansers and moisturizers I break out in terrible painful zits.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> Plus I hate retinols.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in this product so purchase with confidence!</li>
            <li> It BURNED TERRIBLY.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes your face feel and look great! Refresh your skin</li>
            <li> By far my favorite moisturizer! I have oily/acne prone skin and this stuff does wonders for me. Gives me just the right amount of moisture and doesn&#x27;t make me greasy at all. I wish Philosophy would make this in a bigger size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of it.  It left a film on my skin after application that I could rub off later on in the day when I realized it had not absorbed.  I like the Philosophy brand but I would not purchase this again.  It is a subtle green color, not clear or white, so just realize the film is slightly tinted.</li>
            <li> There are some great things about this cream; it doesn&#x27;t make an oil slick on your face, it soaks in quickly, and it smells clean. I bought this for the quick absorption. However, I do not have acne prone skin and it did not moisturizer well enough - in fact, it dried my skin out so much it burned and gave my face a warm feeling. I had to go back to regular hope in a jar - though I feel that mixture is slightly oily.</li>
            <li> As an acne sufferer for most of my life, I have found this lotion to be very nice and calming. I find that it does leave some sparkles on my skin, so it may not be appropriate for male users, or for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to sparkle in the sun. This lotion does leave me too greasy for daytime use, so I use it only at night. I&#x27;m not sure if it is the lotion itself that leaves the oil slick, or if the lotion isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I need so my skin starts producing extra oil to compensate. It does not break me out and goes on nice and cool.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s not oily and my skin gets oily with most creams or lotions. This is a cool gel and it&#x27;s weightless. Love it!</li>
            <li> Where to begin with facial moisturizers?  I have tried them all.  After starting with Miracle Worker moisturizer and Purity face wash I instantly became a philosophy zealot.  I have combination skin which is normally extremely dry, but my forehead and nose can get a little greasy.  I liked miracle worker, but found it a little too greasy for me.  I also liked Hope in a Jar, but I wanted to switch to something oil-free and lightweight, plus that one had a strange fish smell.  Finally I found Take a Deep Breath, and finally took a deep breath.  This goes on smooth and is light-weight and does not make my face greasy at all.  It has a pleasant fragrance that is not strong, and absorbs almost immediately.  Some other people have stated that it doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture during the winter, which could be true, but I have very dry skin and I find it appropriate for year round weather.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have oily and dry skin....this hydrates great without overdoing it! So light so fresh!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I read so many reviews on this before I bought it, keeping in mind the &amp;#34;shimmer problem&amp;#34; some people seem to have. For me I don&#x27;t see any of that shimmer in the cream when it&#x27;s on my face. The consistency of it is really interesting too. It really is like a gel-cream, and I love it. I like how this one doesnt smell as bad as the hope in a jar one does. It doesnt smell good, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty oily skin and this helped control my shine. That&#x27;s why I got this moisturizer over the hope in the jar( cause that one has oil). Philosophy used to have hope in a tube, which was their oil-free version of hope in a jar, but idk, I can&#x27;t find that anywhere now. And I didnt want the oil-free SPF one in a tube. So after some product research I went with this one, and Im so glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now and my skin feels amazing :)</li>
            <li> Love this!  Only need a little to cover your whole face and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in my June 2012 GlamBag and I love it so much that I just bought the full-size product! I put this on in the morning and it makes my skin feel so refreshed. It&#x27;s non-oily, so it doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin break out. It even feels like it takes away the excess oils while still hydrating my face. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of moisturizing. Light gel-like feel.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very quickly, it&#x27;s perfect for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I love this gel cream for daytime use, it&#x27;s lite &amp; feels breathable, almost like there&#x27;s nothing on my skin. I tend to get oily during the day &amp; it&#x27;s not as bad with this cream. It takes very little product to be enough.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in my birchbox and absolutely love it.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so expensive.  I have sensitive skin, this made my skin glow and feel great.</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to like this cream, after all its Philosophy brand and its also a little pricey so I really thought this would be a great product. It does moisturize well, but it ended up making me break out badly. I am in my early 30&#x27;s and do not struggle with acne, so this was a very unpleasant surprise. I will be sticking to my trusted Ponds cold cream.</li>
            <li> Felt like it suffocated my skin rather than allowing it to breathe. Did nothing for me whatsoever</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and neck daily in the mornings after I shower. I love that it is non-greasy and absorbs quickly. It is also good for the day because it is really lite, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like too much on my skin before I put on my foundation. Nice cool gel is soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! First moisturizer for my face that doesn&#x27;t make my face oily. It makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily but rather leaves it soft &amp; nourished!</li>
            <li> A very soothing gel to put on your skin...it rehydrates your thirsty skin a definite good product.</li>
            <li> Felt a little tacky at first but it was because I used my urban decay priming spray underneath. Wish it smelled better but not a dealbreaker</li>
            <li> My go-to moisturizer.  It feels lightweight and smooth on my skin, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily finish.  Great find, worth it!</li>
            <li> Use during the summer in the humid south. Best price I could find.</li>
            <li> your skin feels like a fresh breath of air......one of my favorites of the many products of philosopy...if you shop and fiddle around with amazons deals...you could save a few bucks rather than store bought</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this is works great for my face absolutely love will be ordering more for sure!</li>
            <li> Provides great moisturizing without any greasiness.</li>
            <li> Works very well with my skin and I find it helps with my break outs also. That is a great benefit included for my face.</li>
            <li> Not as good as other products. A lil disappointed in the moisturizer in this facial cream..I&#x27;m a huge fan of this brand but not too much on this particular face cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hope in a jar for quite some time. Due to the super humid summer it was making my face a greasy mess. This is a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin: doesn&#x27;t mess with my sensitive skin at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: keeps my skin moisturized not oily. Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fave: this stuff gives you almost as good a glow as the oxygen facial!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying this - but will switch to olay total effects to help with fine lines at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age: 40</li>
            <li> Does not cause me to break out.  Its my solution to forty year old skin that can not take any oil on it.  Plus I hate retinols.  I just use good old neutrogena with salicylic acid for daily acne prevention and cleansing and place this under my makeup. I look really young for my age, but I know those lines are trying to form.  This little magic potion feeds my face with antioxidants and cool refreshing fast absorbing happiness.  I do not wear makeup under my eyes.  I really think this lotion is like skin vegetables.  I think it helps my skin stay healthier and younger looking.  I place this under my eyes very gently and they wakeup, feel refreshed.  A little mascara and i feel gorgeous.  Yea, I love it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine subscribes to a few of those Birchboxes, Glambags, etc &amp; always give me her non-make up items which I gladly take. This has been hands-down my favorite. I have never tried anything like it. When you put it on your face, at first it feels like a soap or something that should be washed off. Upon rubbing it in gently, it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and fresh all day. I use Aquaphor on my skin at night because of extremely dry skin &amp; this seems to be the perfect combination. I use the Clean &amp; Clear - Morning Burst Fruit Infusions Hydrating cleanser (Pineapple) cleanser and this seems to control my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am a Philosophy Girl &amp; have been for about 9 years now. I started with Purity Made Simple &amp; Hope In A Jar and still use them to this day. When this cream came out, my skin was feeling dull and lacking a glow. I have combination skin, but rarely break out anymore. I bought this and after cleansing with Microdelivery Wash &amp; using the When Hope Is Not Enough Serum, I used it. It literally felt like my skin had been renewed! Like when you take a deep breath (perfect product name!) I now use this in the AM with my Microdelivery Wash, the AM Miracle Worker Pads &amp; my WHINE serum. My skin looks amazing. I alternate between Hope In A Jar &amp; Miracle Worker moisturizers at night. I highly recommend giving this a try if your skin has just been feeling dull, lackluster or you&#x27;re looking for a good moisturizer. It infuses oxygen into the skin and feels wonderful! I also do the Microdelivery Peel (the new 12 week one) once a week. Philosophy changed my skin, let it change yours, my skin looks better now than it did at 20!!</li>
            <li> Philosophy makes wonderful skin care products and this one has now become my new favorite moisturizer. I have sensitive skin, and this does a wonderful job at making/keeping my skin super soft. This has no smell, so if you&#x27;re only gripe with Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar was the unpleasant smell, I recommend trying this Take a Deep Breath moisturizer. I usually use this moisturizer after I was my face with Purity Made Simple facial cleanser, and I also use the Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash a few times a week. I like to apply this moisturizer after my shower. After I apply Cetaphil cream over my body, I get a dime size (actually it&#x27;s probably less than that, you really don&#x27;t need a lot of product!) amount of product in my hands, rub my hands together for a second and apply it to my face (and neck!, never forget the neck.) and rub the remainder in my hands because I have found it works as an excellent hand cream as well! This moisturize is a bit pricey, but a little product goes a very long way like most Philosophy products, and I noticed that Amazon has it listed a few dollars cheaper than on any other site, so this is definitely a pick up must!  My skin has a never looked so smooth or refreshed, and I am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Philosophy has done it again. This product is excellent. I have pretty sensitive skin that is prone to break outs if over moisturized. This product is just right for my combo/ sensitive skin and feels almost cool when applied (don&#x27;t worry this feeling does not last). Just enough to know you&#x27;ve applied everywhere and you almost feel like your skin took a deep breath. Nice!</li>
            <li> This did not work for me.  I have combination light skin, prone to acne.  Beginning to get some wrinkles.  Feeling clogged and icky recently this winter.  With all the great reviews and the high price tag I had equally high hopes for this.  Unfortunately, I had to toss it in the trash.  I used it and it felt ok for a minute or two, then it felt like I was developing an oil slick.  I was looking for something lighter than the clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel or the neutrogena sensitive skin oil free lotion I normally use (first in AM, second in PM), and this was much, much heavier feeling on my face than both. I wish I would have saved the money or tried it in a store first.  Did not work at all for me. I had to wash it off within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been a philosophy girl for years now and love many many of their products but this is not one of them. It made my skin dry out and break out with horrible white heads. I had to apply Murads benzoyl peroxide to my nose and chin where all my white heads and pimple erupted when I used this moisturizer. I only used it for a week and my skin took a turn for the worst. My skin tends to be combination, a little dry and very oily in certain parts of my face. When I use the wrong cleansers and moisturizers I break out in terrible painful zits. I had been using bare minerals moisturizer and decided to give Philosophy&#x27;s Take a deep breath Oil-free Energizing Oxygen Gel cream a try. I now changed back to bare minerals and will not change!</li>
            <li> I am well versed in Philosophy&#x27;s products, worn them for over ten years, in fact, I will NOT wash with anything but Purity. I have a facial problem that is causing skin to peel on my cheek, I thought this would help. It BURNED TERRIBLY. I cannot use it at all. I suspect they put Hydrogen Peroxide in it, which is not good for the skin, yes, it kills bacteria, but the WRONG KIND. Not the kind that causes acne, or other skin conditions. I would bypass this product, at least just try and obtain a sample instead of buying the jar. DeJournett</li>
            <li> This is supposed to help sensitive skin, but it turned my face bright red within seconds.  Not for rosacea! Hope in a jar for dry skin worked better.</li>
            <li> I have been using oil free water based creams as my face moisturizer and this one compared to the  Lancome aqua is less hydrating, and generally a little thicker.  UPDATE: I added one star to this, because after a year of use I realized it is working better that the Lancome one for me. I think the Lancome one was still not really oil-free, but this one for sure is. I am going to continue using this one.  Second UPDATE: Still using this as my night time face moisturizer and still very happy with it! Great light weight and effective product!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream/gel.  Its very light and perfect for the hot summer.  I disagree with some reviewers that you have to use a lot.  I don&#x27;t find that true at all, a small dab each morning covers my face perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  I used to use Hope in a Jar and thought that was great (which it is) but had read the description for this one and figured I would give it a try because my face was still a bit dry.  I bought it and will never switch back!  It moisturizes my skin but isn&#x27;t heavy at all.  It still leaves my face with a weightless clean and bright feeling.  I have difficult skin but this does not irritate it or make it break out.  In fact, I think it has helped my acne.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Put it on as night cream.  Woke up with smooth, cool, even-toned skin.  Makeup went on better.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Good product! My girlfriend really liked it!</li>
            <li> I do not like this product.  It feels rather cool when I apply it but afterwards makes my skin feel dry and taunt.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of great philosophy products and this one did not! Disappoint  LOVE this one also.  Highly reccomend for anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this face lotion at hydrating and keeping my appearance fresh. I think it is a good value for the price, and though it may seem a little pricey, it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Amazing... another hit from philosophy for me! I don&#x27;t know if I can completely give up my HIAJ, but I&#x27;m thinking of using TADB in the summer, and HIAJ in the winter. Feels so good going on, nice and cool, and I love the souffle texture! No scent, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, hydrates and brightens.</li>
            <li> in my mid 30 i still have very oily acne prone skin, I can only use very light moisturizer otherwise my face will be break out!All these years im using clinique dramatically different gel or clinique superdefense for oily skin.I got the sample size from philosophy giveaway on facebook.This is so light,doesnt break out my face and not greasy I can even use it at night.The reasons I give them 4 star is they cames in a jar, is not hygiene and ted to get rancid easily like my clinique superdefense (they came in a jar too) and also they dont have spf.</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 other Philosophy moisturizers and they both broke me out.  Then, Philosophy offered a free sample of Take A Deep Breath.  I was shocked that I didn&#x27;t break out.  The product is nice and light and feels almost cool on the skin, which was nice in the summer.  I don&#x27;t like moisturizers that are so heavy that you feel like your skin can&#x27;t breathe.  Take A Deep Breath is not like that at all.  The only complaint I have is that I feel Philosophy charges too much.  So, I went to amazon.com and found it cheaper!  I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> I simply adore this product. I have super sensitive skin that is acme prone, even at 44. I use this during the day for a light moisturizer and have had fantastic results. I highly recommend it and will be using it again.</li>
            <li> Smells like paste, that I could not bear to put it on my skin. If you are not sensitive to smell, then you can try it out..</li>
            <li> I am in my mid thirties and have oily/combination skin... I am also a makeup artist and a very busy lady who hardly has any time for her own skin. This cream is wonderful as it is light and it goes on cool to the touch. If you are looking for something lightweight and refreshing well here you go ladies!</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin was greatly enhanced and the tones evened out in such a way as to make my skin look well rested and properly hydrated.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
            <li> I broke out in redness and itchiness after using this for a couple of nights. I did not like it at all. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it! This is a very light, yet still moisturizing gel/lotion. It leaves my face smooth, but not shiny or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and suffer from rosacea, but I had no problems with this moisturizer.  In fact, I found it made my skin softer than my usual Aveeno moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial moisturizer I have used to date. It&#x27;s light and goes on nicely. Plus since I have acne prone skin, it is great because it doesn&#x27;t block my pores. I also use this on my hands because they are always so dry and it really helps.</li>
            <li> When first putting it on it feels really nice and light, but i dont know if its just winter time or my face or the lotion but it gets my face really dry which I dont like :/ But idk ill give it a try when winter is over when my face goes back to being oily not dry.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample somewhere and loved it so much I bought the full size.  I use this every morning after I get out of the shower and am really happy with it!  I have normal to slightly dry skin and it does a good job of keeping my skin hydrated all day long.  Works well on it&#x27;s own or using before applying foundation on days when I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause me to breakout.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, which is really important to me because I really dislike face products with any sort of fragrance to them. A bit pricey but I would still repurchase it.</li>
            <li> I broke out. I was disappointed after reading reviews. I thought it would have been great. Ive never found a moisturizer that hasnt caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> Not super moisturizing either. It felt like a film just sitting on my face- I felt like I needed to wash it off every time I used it. And I always needed to put more moisturizer on certain spots. I tried it for about a week and then resigned to buying a new moisturizer (hope in a jar, an old trusted standby- should have never branched out). This now lives on my bedside table as a hand lotion before bed.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with Take a Deep Breath gel moisturizer. I have slightly oily skin in winter in the T Zone .This gel moisturizer gave anice glow without any residue.I will be able to use this one year round.</li>
            <li> It IS like a breath of fresh air. Every night I put this on and just take a moment to inhale deeply. This makes my skin feel great - not oily at all.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful on my skin.  I have never tried Philosophy before, now I am a fan.  Love it and will buy more.</li>
            <li> I have tried a million moisturizers but often end up having dried out or oily skin. This lightweight moisturizer doesn&#x27;t do either, which is fantastic. It lasts quite a while as well, so for me, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used cream with oil f a long time, which made my oily skin worse. Many white heads r on my face now. I tried Garniar gel cream. I felt irritated and not hydrated enough. Then I decided to give it a try of this pricy product, the most expensive I&#x27;ve ever had. But, just amazing!!! Just three days, I feel my pores are getting smaller, and it&#x27;s a lot easier to clean my black heads now. Skin feels hydrated but not that oily. Will keep using it</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! Very smooth &amp; leaves your skin softer than ever. Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Light yet moisturizing. Doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily or make my face shiny. Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Great for night use.  My makeup applies funny if I use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with patches of dry skin over my face. I have to use a moisturizer. This moisturizer is light absorbs well and does not clog my pores. I have used this product for 6 months now. My face feels smooth and the tone is even.</li>
            <li> Love that Amazon sells Philosophy, will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Love all the Philosophy products. This is very light and non greasy. Works great! Loved it! Feels clean and good on your face!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer that I have ever used.  Not greasy, but light and gives your face a nice healthy look.  I am so glad that Amazon has this product and I hope they continue to offer this Philosophy cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sue C.</li>
            <li> This is a good day cream It is light and softens skin but i do find that my skin needs either a reapplication by the end of the day or its just really ready for the night time products i use. I do not get oily from this which is key since i have acne prone skin. I have bought it several times.</li>
            <li> Really nice moisturizer. Works very quickly and does not leave my skin greasy. My forehead always gets greasy and I had heard that gel moisturizer would help which has not really been the case so far but I can&#x27;t blame this moisturizer for that shine. I just wish this had helped with my problem!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have been using this for several weeks. It is the best moisturizer I have ever used, skin feels soft, hydrated and smooth. I have been using maracula oil underneath it at night sometimes and the combination of the two feel fabulous. My face is so soft in the morning. Love love the moisturizer and I use it in the am too under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I first tried this moisturizer from a sample I received from Philosophy&#x27;s Facebook page.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it was and how nice it felt!  I always knew their products were of high quality, but I&#x27;m always afraid of trying new moisturizers for fear of breaking out (I have fairly sensitive skin).  Well, this sample tube lasted about 2 weeks, I used it day and night and not only did I not break out, but my skin improved!!  It just had a soft, clean feel to it and not a blemish in sight.  I have dry/mostly oily skin, and this product couldn&#x27;t be any more perfect for my skin type.  I got the moisture I really needed in some areas, but (since it is Oil Free), not a greasy feeling at all.  Hence no break outs!  The light blue tint and the great, light clean smell to it is just a bonus!  I had to buy the full size when I ran out of the sample and Amazon had the best price imaginable!  I hope they never discontinue this because I will be using it for a very very long time!</li>
            <li> **this contains (very small, sparse, almost invisible) flecks of micro-shimmer, but it&#x27;s not visible when you use it on skin**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we&#x27;ve all experienced the following: you put lotion or sunscreen on your face; you think it&#x27;s fully absorbed and you&#x27;re good to go. BUT, as soon as that hot summer sun hits your face, it gets greasy and your skin starts to sweat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this dry-finishing gel moisturizer, I know that won&#x27;t happen to me ever again. I have dry sensitive skin, but even my skin can look greasy with a bad, nonabsorbent lotion. what&#x27;s great about this is that, although it&#x27;s dry-finishing, it&#x27;s still plenty moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;DRY FINISH: like I said, even people with dry skin need moisturized but matte skin--nobody wants greasy skin from a bad moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;SOOTHING: cream feels nice and chill on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;GENTLE: I&#x27;m prone to eczema, but nothing in this irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;HYDRATION IS SHORT-LIVED: doesn&#x27;t keep your face hydrated, it just dries off quickly and that&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;GLITTER: was NOT expecting that. why would they put flecks of shimmer in here?? it&#x27;s hardly noticeable unless you stare at your face a foot away from the mirror, so you run no risk of looking like a disco ball. Though still unnecessary!&lt;br /&gt;COST: 2 oz is really not that much product. Since this is quick-drying, I wouldn&#x27;t say &#x27;a little goes a long way&#x27;. a few pea-sized dollops every use--if used twice daily or more--can really add up.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very light, not greasy, and is the first moisturizer I have tried that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I have acne prone skin and have not had any break outs using this product. You only need to use a teeny tiny bit so it lasts a long time. There is not much of a smell and it smells WAY BETTER than the other facial moisturizers by Philosophy.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a great moisturizer for years. I have combination skin and in my fourth decade of life. This product is exactly what I have needed and been looking for all along. It is not greasy and provides your skin with an amazing kind of smoothness that no other big name product lines have thus far. I am finished looking for my favorite moisturizer. This is it and I just hope it is available for many years to come. It is a bit pricey for the amount you receive, but it doesn&#x27;t take much and it you get what you pay for. You will not be disappointed in this product so purchase with confidence!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Hope In A Jar for years and decided to try this instead when my last bottle of Hope ran out.  It definitely hydrates well (better than Hope), but it makes my face greasy and the Hope didn&#x27;t really do that.  Ad when I first put it on, even when my face isn&#x27;t greasy, I feel that it makes my face look shiny.  That&#x27;s when my face isn&#x27;t greasy.  I&#x27;ll probably go back to Hope when this runs out.  If you have really dry skin that doesn&#x27;t get greasy easily I would definitely recommend this product because it does hydrate really really well.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!! My skin has never looked and felt so good. It feels like heaven going on. Not greasy at all. My skin feels so soft and hydrated. I have always liked Philosophy products. I do shop around and like to try different brands. I am in love with this stuff! I will keep buying this.</li>
            <li> I am 49 years old and I have very dry skin. I have tried numerous facial creams over the years. I read a lot of great reviews about this product and really wanted to love it. It smells good and does feel great when you put it on. However, it really does not moisturize. 30 minutes after putting it on, I felt a very familiar overall dryness to my skin and could actually feel a rough patch on my chin. For some skin types it probably works fine.</li>
