            <li>The smell was pretty good</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Not overly fragrant, but the grit is perfect for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The soap itself is nice, and I have enjoyed using it, it just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It smells so clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>scent is very mild.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend either of those two soaps.</li>
            <li>Nice sized bar and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>A big bar that stays nice and smooth and produces a good lather.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild, and smells more like lavender to me.</li>
            <li>bar is a nice size, and it lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and silky..</li>
            <li>I love the smell of eucalyptus, it is fresh and it reminds me of a spa.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>Nice, big bars with a great smell and fairly gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing, easy sudsing and easy rinsing, and leaves skin soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is a good soap that really leaves you feeling very good.</li>
            <li>Lathers great &amp; lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge bar and super concentrated.</li>
            <li>So clean feeling,  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Leavea my face feeling clean w/o stripping of essentials..</li>
            <li>Large bar, great smell nice firm soap.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased to have found a manufacturer of a quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Feel super clean after using it and it does not irritate my sensative skin.  </li>
            <li>The scent is definitely mild, but it is there.</li>
            <li>I think it does a perfectly adequate job.</li>
            <li>However, the eucalyptus fragrance is relatively mild.  </li>
            <li>the sent is mild Eucalyptus</li>
            <li>The dead sea mud scent has some sand in it and that one is sooo good too, love the scrubby parts.</li>
            <li>It cleans well enough, but there are many others that smell better and don&#x27;t leave the residue.</li>
            <li>Besides being a very gentle soap, the fragrance is very pleasant and light enough to not join in the daily battle for scent dominance.</li>
            <li>My new favorite soap and I am an expert addict for soap.</li>
            <li>Soaps with the glycerine left in the mix are much nicer to use, more soothing to the skin and clean better than those without.  </li>
            <li>The eucalyptus scent is strong enough to be refreshing in the shower, but does not leave an overpowering scent on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just frugal enough that a five dollar bar of soap, no matter how nice, raises an eyebrow.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll definately get your money&#x27;s worth from this.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so cannot use most soaps.</li>
            <li>it rinses away clean leaving your skin with a soft smooth</li>
            <li>It was cheap, long lasting, great value.</li>
            <li>This soap has a very light scent, and after a few seconds you cannot smell it any more.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle fragrance.</li>
            <li>My family likes it very much as well.</li>
            <li>nice job on dry skin!</li>
            <li>Some people may prefer a more poignant smelling bar.</li>
            <li>After first use, my skin feel soft and the scent is lightly lingering.</li>
            <li>Be aware of this if you buy this soap.</li>
            <li>Smell is great, not over powering and last a long time ?</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my Irish Spring soap has better aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I put lotion on fairly often but after a few weeks use my hand began to crack and bleed.</li>
            <li>Nice soap, I cannot use anymore thou due to allergies.</li>
            <li>Great for tense</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive soaps but these are the best value for the quality.</li>
            <li>the bar itself is large...  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this soap to everyone interested in giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try this at is similarly priced and also has free add-on</li>
            <li>so its sorta like minty and vicks vap-o-rub (we find it very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really said had had to throw both bars away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for this soap.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this as much as the mud variety.</li>
            <li>and I really do like eucalyptus smell.</li>
            <li>I give it as gifts and it&#x27;s very well received.</li>
            <li>Other kinds from the same company are so good too.</li>
            <li>Mild eucalyptus aroma was barely detectable when received - after a week there was no aroma or fragrance whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great big bar, I cut it into smaller chunks for sink, tub and wet room.</li>
            <li>I feel this soap doesnt hold true to its potential.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice real soap made from a palm oil base, not a detergent or sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate, as many bars of soap are.  </li>
            <li>I actually like that the scent is mild and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of liquid shower gells that had eucalyptus as the main scent.</li>
            <li>It is a decent soap, but</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I want an exfoliating bar, sometimes I want a bar with a little more fragrance.</li>
            <li>and this is a little treat to me from me with love.</li>
            <li>of the main differences from the Dead Sea Mud, which I love, is the smoother/non-grainy texture of the soap.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, love the smell</li>
            <li>it is ok except that it put a film on your skin which is not smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true hard-milled soap, and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay, lathers well and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Feels great on the skin, stays hard after wet</li>
            <li>/&gt;life is short ..  spoil yourself in simple ways... and enjoy</li>
            <li>Nice Solid Heavy Bar !</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming since it isn&#x27;t filled with chemicals and artificial fragrances.</li>
            <li>The Eucalyptus helps to clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li>I like that it is a big bar, and the lather is very creamy.  </li>
            <li>and it what worse than the dry cheap soap at a cheap motel.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does not dry out my skin too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this soap, as it was one of only a few all-natural soaps available on the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; program.</li>
            <li>The aroma is apparent but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the naturally occurring glycerine from the soap making process was left in the soap or removed as part of the soap making process.  </li>
            <li>Their not only all natural but even the smallest piece stills lathers.</li>
            <li>these are very large bars- not huge but not normal size soap bars, they do not shrink up right away when you use them and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Soap is not hard on the skin and a bar last for a long time.</li>
            <li>One bar of soap lasts a long time; I use it daily in the shower and it lasts about 3 weeks until I have to replace it with a new one.</li>
            <li>Lathers up with VERY LITTLE amount which proves to be quality product.</li>
            <li>We live in a very dry climate and this soap does not add to the dryness.</li>
            <li>would say that if you have dry or delicate skin, this soap might be a bit strong.</li>

            <li> and I am pleased to have found a manufacturer of a quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Feel super clean after using it and it does not irritate my sensative skin.  </li>
            <li> The scent is definitely mild, but it is there.</li>
            <li> I think it does a perfectly adequate job.</li>
            <li> However, the eucalyptus fragrance is relatively mild.  </li>
            <li> the sent is mild Eucalyptus</li>
            <li> The dead sea mud scent has some sand in it and that one is sooo good too, love the scrubby parts.</li>
            <li> It cleans well enough, but there are many others that smell better and don&#x27;t leave the residue.</li>
            <li> Besides being a very gentle soap, the fragrance is very pleasant and light enough to not join in the daily battle for scent dominance.</li>
            <li> My new favorite soap and I am an expert addict for soap.</li>
            <li> Soaps with the glycerine left in the mix are much nicer to use, more soothing to the skin and clean better than those without.  </li>
            <li> The eucalyptus scent is strong enough to be refreshing in the shower, but does not leave an overpowering scent on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just frugal enough that a five dollar bar of soap, no matter how nice, raises an eyebrow.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definately get your money&#x27;s worth from this.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so cannot use most soaps.</li>
            <li> it rinses away clean leaving your skin with a soft smooth</li>
            <li> It was cheap, long lasting, great value.</li>
            <li> This soap has a very light scent, and after a few seconds you cannot smell it any more.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle fragrance.</li>
            <li> My family likes it very much as well.</li>
            <li> nice job on dry skin!</li>
            <li> Some people may prefer a more poignant smelling bar.</li>
            <li> After first use, my skin feel soft and the scent is lightly lingering.</li>
            <li> Be aware of this if you buy this soap.</li>
            <li> Smell is great, not over powering and last a long time ?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my Irish Spring soap has better aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I put lotion on fairly often but after a few weeks use my hand began to crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> Nice soap, I cannot use anymore thou due to allergies.</li>
            <li> Great for tense</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive soaps but these are the best value for the quality.</li>
            <li> the bar itself is large...  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this soap to everyone interested in giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try this at is similarly priced and also has free add-on</li>
            <li> so its sorta like minty and vicks vap-o-rub (we find it very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really said had had to throw both bars away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this soap.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this as much as the mud variety.</li>
            <li> and I really do like eucalyptus smell.</li>
            <li> I give it as gifts and it&#x27;s very well received.</li>
            <li> Other kinds from the same company are so good too.</li>
            <li> Mild eucalyptus aroma was barely detectable when received - after a week there was no aroma or fragrance whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great big bar, I cut it into smaller chunks for sink, tub and wet room.</li>
            <li> I feel this soap doesnt hold true to its potential.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice real soap made from a palm oil base, not a detergent or sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate, as many bars of soap are.  </li>
            <li> I actually like that the scent is mild and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of liquid shower gells that had eucalyptus as the main scent.</li>
            <li> It is a decent soap, but</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I want an exfoliating bar, sometimes I want a bar with a little more fragrance.</li>
            <li> and this is a little treat to me from me with love.</li>
            <li> of the main differences from the Dead Sea Mud, which I love, is the smoother/non-grainy texture of the soap.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, love the smell</li>
            <li> it is ok except that it put a film on your skin which is not smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a true hard-milled soap, and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, lathers well and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin, stays hard after wet</li>
            <li> /&gt;life is short ..  spoil yourself in simple ways... and enjoy</li>
            <li> Nice Solid Heavy Bar !</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming since it isn&#x27;t filled with chemicals and artificial fragrances.</li>
            <li> The Eucalyptus helps to clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a big bar, and the lather is very creamy.  </li>
            <li> and it what worse than the dry cheap soap at a cheap motel.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not dry out my skin too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this soap, as it was one of only a few all-natural soaps available on the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; program.</li>
            <li> The aroma is apparent but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the naturally occurring glycerine from the soap making process was left in the soap or removed as part of the soap making process.  </li>
            <li> Their not only all natural but even the smallest piece stills lathers.</li>
            <li> these are very large bars- not huge but not normal size soap bars, they do not shrink up right away when you use them and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Soap is not hard on the skin and a bar last for a long time.</li>
            <li> One bar of soap lasts a long time; I use it daily in the shower and it lasts about 3 weeks until I have to replace it with a new one.</li>
            <li> Lathers up with VERY LITTLE amount which proves to be quality product.</li>
            <li> We live in a very dry climate and this soap does not add to the dryness.</li>
            <li> would say that if you have dry or delicate skin, this soap might be a bit strong.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> a long lasting soap..  </li>
            <li> Last long.</li>
            <li> last long time!</li>
            <li> This thing will last a long time and their products never irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> Pointing it out, as at least for my bar, I would not consider it an exfoliating bar, and overall it is very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really last a long long time</li>
            <li> Forba soap claiming to make skin soft this is not true.</li>
            <li> The size of the soap is very generous and it&#x27;s about half way down</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and cleans well.</li>
            <li> and then my skin was so dry it flaked off after my shower.</li>
            <li> AND IT DOESN&#x27;T DRY MY HANDS OUT</li>
            <li> Arrived with several dents and scrapes on the actual bar, but a few washings smoothed them out..  </li>
            <li> , only complaint is that it by the time you are done with your shower, the smell is completely gone off your body.</li>
            <li> I tend to use unscented items whenever possible to tone down the clash.</li>
            <li> It is a little rough, but I actually like that.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the Dead Sea Mud for it grainy exfoliating properties, but this bar of soap is still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> In addition, the bottom side that stays wet tends to fall apart.</li>
            <li> Heavily scented soap tends to clash with other fragrances like fabric softener, deodorant, cologne, shampoo and conditioner, adding to a cacophony of fragrance on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> other bars of soap makes my skin feel softer and cleaner then other soap</li>
            <li> I did however also order the plain dead sea soap...and if it has the same qualities as this bar it will get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have what I would call a &amp;#34;eucalyptus smell&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> If you like a strong scent with lots of eucalyptus that makes your skin tingle, you might be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> we are about half way through it...  </li>
            <li> but sometimes you deserve a little treat</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not dry it out that bad.</li>
            <li> B000MVYJ0O One With Nature Dead Sea Mud Dead Sea Minerals Soap]] for over a year.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud offered no scent at all, whereas this bar does have a Eucalyptus scent.</li>
            <li> I think I will be keeping both this bar and a Dead Sea Mud bar in my shower at all times depending on the mood I am in.</li>
            <li> Skin did not feel dried out afterwards.</li>
            <li> Eucalyptus is not easy to find in a bath bar</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the &amp;#34;Dead Sea minerals&amp;#34; would make it scratchy, but it isn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s very slightly exfoliating, not scratchy or abrasive at all.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, egzema or psoriasis this soap will make your skin worse</li>
            <li> I hope the company takes this review serious.</li>
            <li> I think it is a little expensive</li>
            <li> I was sad to say this soap just is not for me.</li>
            <li> All it did was leave her face with dry patches,she was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This soap was dry and horrible for my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it for that, so it is not too disappointing for me.  </li>
            <li> Dried​ my skin badly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was disappointed to see the price increased from three-plus dollars to five-plus dollars per bar after my order arrived.  </li>
            <li> Totally disappointed :(  </li>
            <li> Just terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it. get you some</li>
            <li> Long lasting, love the smell</li>
            <li> I have been using the [[ASIN:B000MVYJ0O One With Nature Dead Sea Mud Dead Sea Minerals Soap]] for over a year. It was cheap, long lasting, great value. I decided to try this at is similarly priced and also has free add-on shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the main differences from the Dead Sea Mud, which I love, is the smoother/non-grainy texture of the soap. I personally prefer the Dead Sea Mud for it grainy exfoliating properties, but this bar of soap is still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dead Sea Mud offered no scent at all, whereas this bar does have a Eucalyptus scent. The scent is definitely mild, but it is there. Some people may prefer a more poignant smelling bar. I actually like that the scent is mild and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of cleaning properties I think it does a perfectly adequate job. I think I will be keeping both this bar and a Dead Sea Mud bar in my shower at all times depending on the mood I am in. Sometimes I want an exfoliating bar, sometimes I want a bar with a little more fragrance. Both are of the same quality and same value. I strongly recommend either of those two soaps.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice,  long-lasting bath soap.  The aroma is apparent but not overpowering.  Lathers well.  Eucalyptus is not easy to find in a bath bar and I am pleased to have found a manufacturer of a quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> After first use, my skin feel soft and the scent is lightly lingering. great buy.</li>
            <li> This is very nice soap, smells and feels good, seems pretty sexy.</li>
            <li> I regularly use Eucalyptus soap and decided to try something different from what I currently use, so I ordered this.  I like that it is a big bar, and the lather is very creamy.  However, the eucalyptus fragrance is relatively mild.  If you like a strong scent with lots of eucalyptus that makes your skin tingle, you might be disappointed.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Love the soap. It is a little rough, but I actually like that. Lasts a long time and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing soap. Skin feels and looks 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smell any eucalyptus in this soap. It lathers well, but when I buy something that is supposed to have eucalyptus and doesn&#x27;t, I am dissappointed. I&#x27;ve used a number of liquid shower gells that had eucalyptus as the main scent.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Smells good and lathers up real good.</li>
            <li> Nice soap, I cannot use anymore thou due to allergies.</li>
            <li> nice job on dry skin! last long time!</li>
            <li> Good.  Lathers up well with wash cloth.  Feel super clean after using it and it does not irritate my sensative skin.  Has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> I put lotion on fairly often but after a few weeks use my hand began to crack and bleed. My wife tried it and had the same results. Be aware of this if you buy this soap.</li>
            <li> Substantial. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> wonderful ...  the bar itself is large...  we are about half way through it...  the sent is mild Eucalyptus so its sorta like minty and vicks vap-o-rub (we find it very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It a long lasting soap..  the bar does not dissolve away so you get a good value,  it rinses away clean leaving your skin with a soft smooth feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a soap snobs (we always have 4 different bars in the shower to choose from) - this will be a regular product in our rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;life is short ..  spoil yourself in simple ways... and enjoy</li>
            <li> Outstanding soap. Great scent. Great for your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice real soap made from a palm oil base, not a detergent or sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate, as many bars of soap are.  I don&#x27;t know if the naturally occurring glycerine from the soap making process was left in the soap or removed as part of the soap making process.  Sometimes soap makers do remove the glycerine and sell it separately.  Soaps with the glycerine left in the mix are much nicer to use, more soothing to the skin and clean better than those without.  These bars are a good bath size, and do have a nice but not overpowering eucalyptus scent.  Don&#x27;t know how the &amp;#34;Dead Sea Mineral Salts&amp;#34; add to the feel of the lather or results -- I suspect those were simply added as a selling point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed to see the price increased from three-plus dollars to five-plus dollars per bar after my order arrived.  I guess I won&#x27;t be reordering unless the price drops again when I run out.  I&#x27;m just frugal enough that a five dollar bar of soap, no matter how nice, raises an eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Should have a stronger smell for Eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definately get your money&#x27;s worth from this. It&#x27;s a huge bar and super concentrated.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more eucalyptus smell and this soap is very light.  The soap itself is nice, and I have enjoyed using it, it just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for.  I was hoping for a nice smell to help me wake up in the morning, this is not that soap.</li>
            <li> love its smell  and it last longer then  other bars of soap makes my skin feel softer and cleaner then other soap</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant but doesn&#x27;t work well in exfoliating or keeping my skin smooth even though it contains argan oil and shea butter. The size of the soap is very generous and it&#x27;s about half way down (I bought this in October of last year).</li>
            <li> I was sad to say this soap just is not for me. I leave honest reviews and unfortunatley this is a review that is not the greatest. I feel this soap doesnt hold true to its potential. This soap was dry and horrible for my skin. Forba soap claiming to make skin soft this is not true. I usedbit once and it what worse than the dry cheap soap at a cheap motel. I hope the company takes this review serious. In a soap that claims to keepbyour skin great there should be non drying properies this soap. I felt it stripped every bit of moisture from my skin and then my skin was so dry it flaked off after my shower. Just terrible. I am really said had had to throw both bars away. If you have dry skin, egzema or psoriasis this soap will make your skin worse</li>
            <li> it is ok except that it put a film on your skin which is not smooth and it does not smell good.</li>
            <li> This product was not quite what I was looking for.  I have sensitive skin, so cannot use most soaps. I like the eucalyptus smell, as it helps me wake up.  This soap has a very light scent, and after a few seconds you cannot smell it any more.  I wish it was stronger, and lasted a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot how this soap scratches the skin. It was over a week before I even felt anything that was for exfoliating. It was one tiny spot. I didn&#x27;t buy it for that, so it is not too disappointing for me.  Pointing it out, as at least for my bar, I would not consider it an exfoliating bar, and overall it is very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar is a nice size, and it lathers really well.  It did not irritate my skin at all.  It is a decent soap, but not quite what I was looking for in regards to a stronger scent that wakes you up.</li>
            <li> Dried​ my skin badly.</li>
            <li> I just love it. My skin is so smooth and silky..</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of the best soaps I have ever used. I love the smell of eucalyptus, it is fresh and it reminds me of a spa. I have sensitive skin and it does not dry it out that bad. One bar of soap lasts a long time; I use it daily in the shower and it lasts about 3 weeks until I have to replace it with a new one. The soap washes great; it gets all odors off skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this soap to everyone interested in giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Smells fresh.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans great, gets all odors off skin.&lt;br /&gt;- I have sensitive skin and it does not dry out my skin too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- None that I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country of Origin: Made in USA</li>
            <li> Er my Gawd. Love this soap. My new favorite soap and I am an expert addict for soap. Other kinds from the same company are so good too. Good for both men and women. The dead sea mud scent has some sand in it and that one is sooo good too, love the scrubby parts. Also- these are very large bars- not huge but not normal size soap bars, they do not shrink up right away when you use them and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I prefer the one with mud, this is more drying for my skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this soap.  The scent is almost undetectable because it is so light, and it leaves behind a white residue on my skin.  It cleans well enough, but there are many others that smell better and don&#x27;t leave the residue.</li>
            <li> Nice Smell !! great Soap I love this brand they are all good !!! Great as a gift too ! Nice Solid Heavy Bar !</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for someone. They said they loved it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this as much as the mud variety. The smell was pretty good and it worked well.</li>
            <li> If I was rating this on solely on its eucalyptus scent it would get a 1.  I don&#x27;t want to get out of the shower smelling like vicks or anything, however the the amount of eucalyptus scent in this soap is almost non-existent. It is a nice size bar and has a nice lather and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a tacky feeling, which are all great, but I ordered it for the eucalyptus scent.  Definitely won&#x27;t be reordering this.  I did however also order the plain dead sea soap...and if it has the same qualities as this bar it will get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I realy love this soap. Smell is great, not over powering and last a long time ?betty</li>
            <li> I love this brand, I love what they stand for and I love the size of this **** bar.  This thing will last a long time and their products never irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> If there are bars of soap in Heaven, this one will be there.  So clean feeling,  great scent - this will make you look forward to your showers even more!</li>
            <li> GETS ONION SMELL OFF MY HANDS, LOVE THE SMELL AND IT DOESN&#x27;T DRY MY HANDS OUT</li>
            <li> My wife loves this soap</li>
            <li> Beautifully scented soap that I and my mother enjoy.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this soap, as it was one of only a few all-natural soaps available on the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; program. I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s a true hard-milled soap, and lasts a really long time. The bar is a generous size. I was concerned that the &amp;#34;Dead Sea minerals&amp;#34; would make it scratchy, but it isn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s very slightly exfoliating, not scratchy or abrasive at all. The eucalyptus scent is strong enough to be refreshing in the shower, but does not leave an overpowering scent on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that if you have dry or delicate skin, this soap might be a bit strong. It&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome! Really enjoyed using this soap! Skin did not feel dried out afterwards. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I like this soap quite well and I really do like eucalyptus smell. It smells so clean and refreshing. I think it is a little expensive but sometimes you deserve a little treat and this is a little treat to me from me with love. Seriously, this is a good soap that really leaves you feeling very good.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell as srongly as I was hoping</li>
            <li> These soaps are awesome! Their not only all natural but even the smallest piece stills lathers. I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive soaps but these are the best value for the quality. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming since it isn&#x27;t filled with chemicals and artificial fragrances. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like Eucalyptus at all! Totally disappointed :(  The only reason why I bought it was to spoil myself with the aroma of Eucalyptus in the bath. Unfortunately my Irish Spring soap has better aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Great Scent! Last long. I would recommend this soap for sure.</li>
            <li> Very gentle fragrance. Heavily scented soap tends to clash with other fragrances like fabric softener, deodorant, cologne, shampoo and conditioner, adding to a cacophony of fragrance on a daily basis. I tend to use unscented items whenever possible to tone down the clash. Besides being a very gentle soap, the fragrance is very pleasant and light enough to not join in the daily battle for scent dominance. My family likes it very much as well. Lathers well without drying out our skin. We live in a very dry climate and this soap does not add to the dryness. Nice sized bar and the price is very reasonable. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my grandmother&#x27;s face because one of the reviews said it helped eczematic conditions.All it did was leave her face with dry patches,she was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Yummy!  Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but didn&#x27;t smell like eucalyptus</li>
            <li> This really works! Great for tense muscles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very mild. Enjoyed this soap!</li>
            <li> Love the soap and plan to have on hand from now on.Soap is not hard on the skin and a bar last for a long time.</li>
            <li> very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Smells Amazing! Lathers great &amp; lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> Nice, big bars with a great smell and fairly gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t quite smell the scent of eucalyptus in the soap lather</li>
            <li> Large bar, great smell nice firm soap.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Lathers well. I will be trying out different scents.</li>
            <li> Not overly fragrant, but the grit is perfect for my dry skin.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Probably their best soap. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Arrived with several dents and scrapes on the actual bar, but a few washings smoothed them out..  Mild eucalyptus aroma was barely detectable when received - after a week there was no aroma or fragrance whatsoever.  As a soap it&#x27;s okay, lathers well and long lasting.  However, I ordered for the eucalyptus scent - would not order again.</li>
            <li> Makes you smell so good.</li>
            <li> Great refreshing smell, only complaint is that it by the time you are done with your shower, the smell is completely gone off your body.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing, easy sudsing and easy rinsing, and leaves skin soft and fresh. I give it as gifts and it&#x27;s very well received. It&#x27;s a great big bar, I cut it into smaller chunks for sink, tub and wet room.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Love it.</li>
            <li> this may be the best eucalyptus soap out there !</li>
            <li> Good suds, good scent, good rectangular soap bar-like shape.  What more is there to say about soap?</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  It lasts a long time and smells wonderful.  The Eucalyptus helps to clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin smooth.  I like the fact that it does not have any fragrance.  It really last a long long time</li>
            <li> Leavea my face feeling clean w/o stripping of essentials.. Lathers up with VERY LITTLE amount which proves to be quality product. Best soap ive used on my face im years!</li>
            <li> A big bar that stays nice and smooth and produces a good lather. As a soap I like it a lot. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have what I would call a &amp;#34;eucalyptus smell&amp;#34;.  The fragrance is mild, and smells more like lavender to me.</li>
            <li> used it to try and help with my acne works good but still have but i can notice a big difference in my face.</li>
            <li> I like the soap but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough. In addition, the bottom side that stays wet tends to fall apart.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin, stays hard after wet</li>
