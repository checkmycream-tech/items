            <li>This is a very good and inexpensive conditioner for a dry and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine...  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Awesome stuff right here.</li>
            <li>It feels nice, smells good but hasn&#x27;t made a big difference in my scalp condition as I&#x27;m still having to rely on topical lotions to manage the inflammation several times a day.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that has eliminated all itch and flaky skin.</li>
            <li>Really the only thing that has helped me with my stress dandruff. :)</li>
            <li>If left on for long enough there is a very pleasant cooling sensation to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis on my scalp, and this really helps with itching and scaling.  </li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t say I seen much of a difference in my scalp because I don&#x27;t wash my hair very often</li>
            <li>But this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>and it just seems so much healthier than it was before.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>He uses two fingers of the cream, massages it in his hair, lets sit for about 3 mins as he washes himself, and rinses really well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to try nearly  anything and hoped this would do the trick.</li>
            <li>I have use this product ONE time and my scalp was like new!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s kind of awkward to scoop out the product and then try to get the cap on enough so that water doesn&#x27;t get into it before you can fully screw the top on.</li>
            <li>Bought this for our son, and WOW!  </li>
            <li>His hair has shine and so soft!  </li>
            <li>If you need an efficient product at a modest price, give this a try.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This solved my 15 years old flakes and itchy scalp problem.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a thick cream.  </li>

            <li> I would eve recommend this to someone who doesn&#x27;t have dry scalp problems, as your scalp can never be to moisturized.</li>

            <li> helped with dry itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from a dry, flaky scalp for about 2 months now, not sure what the problem was, maybe just wasn&#x27;t getting enough moisture up there.</li>
            <li> It leaves a residue which was much harder to rinse out than other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Like other moisturizers you can feel the softness as you rinse.  </li>
            <li> The product got all over the inside of the box and the other four items.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, leave the hype about organic/ natural conditioners behind and stick with what works.  </li>
            <li> and this does not weigh down my curls or make my hair look limp or greasy (which some conditioners and moisture treatments</li>
            <li> Hate the fact that they don&#x27;t have this product readily available in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This works well for me to hell with the itchy scalp which gets dried out from the shampoo I use for the dandruff/seborrhea</li>
            <li> I bought six Head and Sholders Conditioners and two of them were broken open.</li>
            <li> I hope none of them are broken open.</li>
            <li> I have tried going all natural, but some of those &amp;#34;all natural/ organic conditioners&amp;#34; just don&#x27;t have enough slip, and I will end up taking excessively long showers and almost crying because of how time consuming, frustrating and painful detangling can be.  </li>
            <li> It left a white residue that looks worse than the bad dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This product does just that, I can easily detangle even the worst knots in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really dandruff, just always red/inflamed and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I am unable to count the number of different products I&#x27;ve used in the past that have failed me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I use this product along with the Head and Shoulders Shampoo and I absolutely love both products.</li>
            <li> I got this with a coupon, so for $2 I thought why not?  I use this after Head and Shoulders shampoo.  It&#x27;s thick, so you can scoop it up with your fingers easily and it&#x27;s easy to rub into your scalp and into your hair.  After a couple of minutes, you can feel a nice tingle and then rinse it out.  Like other moisturizers you can feel the softness as you rinse.  It leaves my hair very soft, and it has a nice clean smell.  I have psoriasis on my scalp, and this really helps with itching and scaling.  Also, I have very long, curly hair and this does not weigh down my curls or make my hair look limp or greasy (which some conditioners and moisture treatments do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that I wish it came in a pump or a bottle.  It&#x27;s kind of awkward to scoop out the product and then try to get the cap on enough so that water doesn&#x27;t get into it before you can fully screw the top on.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> this is awesome stuff,no more dandruff.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine...  Lather it in, let it sit and remove.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t get the smell and tingle of the original product, but seems to work fine....</li>
            <li> Works like a charm for my husband. Been looking for a good product for months. This is it!</li>
            <li> I have SEVERE dry scalp problems all year long. I am unable to count the number of different products I&#x27;ve used in the past that have failed me. This is the first product that has eliminated all itch and flaky skin. Please note- follow the directions, and use it each time you wash your hair- consistency is KEY. This will not work if you use it sporadically- trust me, I tested that.</li>
            <li> If your just desperate for some relief it may work. It left a white residue that looks worse than the bad dry scalp. Plus it didn&#x27;t seem to work that well. I will pass.</li>
            <li> Hate the fact that they don&#x27;t have this product readily available in stores anymore. Love the fact that it&#x27;s available on Amazon. I Love this! It feels amazing when I use it, and it leaves my hair very soft. Really the only thing that has helped me with my stress dandruff. :)</li>
            <li> The whole time I was itching and dryness of the scalp , since I use the product has been reduced significantly. It is an excellent product , when applied to the scalp burns but then feel your hair clean and dandruff . I am very happy is my second purchase.</li>
            <li> Massage it into scalp,and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I like it. But I can&#x27;t say I seen much of a difference in my scalp because I don&#x27;t wash my hair very often and plus I have different oils on my scalp to keep it motorized.</li>
            <li> This works well for me to hell with the itchy scalp which gets dried out from the shampoo I use for the dandruff/seborrhea</li>
            <li> This is a great detangler. I have very long curly hair and I need a product that will ease the detangling process, so that it is quick and painless.  This product does just that, I can easily detangle even the worst knots in a few minutes. I have tried going all natural, but some of those &amp;#34;all natural/ organic conditioners&amp;#34; just don&#x27;t have enough slip, and I will end up taking excessively long showers and almost crying because of how time consuming, frustrating and painful detangling can be.

            <li> I had a terrible dry scalp for years. I decided to try this. After the first use my scalp felt so much better. It leaves a nice cool and tingly sensation on your scalp. I use this product twice a week. I no longer have a dry or itchy scalp. I use this and brush my hair with a copper brush. I thought id never solve my scalp problem. But this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, and use it several times a week.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel silky smooth &amp; smells great too! my scalp has been slightly less itchy, but only time will tell if it has a lasting effect</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very greasy, not sure why.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing leave-in treatment.  I use this even though I don&#x27;t have dry scalp.  It does give a tingle feeling when you use it.</li>
            <li> Splendid product. This solved my 15 years old flakes and itchy scalp problem. The effects are scintillating from the very first use. I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;KC</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic! I&#x27;ve been suffering from a dry, flaky scalp for about 2 months now, not sure what the problem was, maybe just wasn&#x27;t getting enough moisture up there. I have use this product ONE time and my scalp was like new! I don&#x27;t have any flakes anymore and it just seems so much healthier than it was before. A happy scalp leads to happy hair! Great product. I would eve recommend this to someone who doesn&#x27;t have dry scalp problems, as your scalp can never be to moisturized.</li>
            <li> Doc told me I have an allergy- to something.  Didn&#x27;t test for it...&lt;br /&gt;But it gives me itchy scalp, (and it was my eyelids and ears too).  eyelids and ears are better, scalp not.  So I&#x27;ve been trying different itchy scalp products.&lt;br /&gt;He did give me a rx anti itch cream.  Which works and works well.  But that really is only masking the problem...&lt;br /&gt;Trying to find a shampoo and conditioner that will actually stop the problem.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a gel it&#x27;s more like a thick cream.  And smells pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it&#x27;s the answer I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I have a horrible chronic problem with an irritated scalp. It&#x27;s not really dandruff, just always red/inflamed and uncomfortable. I&#x27;m willing to try nearly  anything and hoped this would do the trick. It feels nice, smells good but hasn&#x27;t made a big difference in my scalp condition as I&#x27;m still having to rely on topical lotions to manage the inflammation several times a day. Other reviewers indicated this made a big difference in their scalp, but it&#x27;s not a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> Gives lots of moisture back into my hair and give a lil tingly feeling while its working</li>
            <li> It leaves a residue which was much harder to rinse out than other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Use only one time since purchase</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has helped with my itch and dandruff, not enough to cure it completely but after using it my head does feel less itchy which I really appreciate!! Decent product</li>
            <li> This is a very good and inexpensive conditioner for a dry and itchy scalp. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> A 5 star only if your hair and scalp are VERY dry.  Perfect for processed hair that is damaged.  I use it once or twice a week and that seems to be enough.  I use a milder moisturizer on alternate days.  All in all, it is the best I&#x27;ve found to treat extreme dryness, and it also leaves my hair quite shiny.</li>
            <li> If this wasn&#x27;t such a GREAT product I would be very upset! I bought six Head and Sholders Conditioners and two of them were broken open. The product got all over the inside of the box and the other four items. Next time I order I hope none of them are broken open. Besides that, I love this stuff and it&#x27;s great for all hair types!</li>
            <li> Used once and immediately  saw a difference in my scalp!!</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference within a minute of putting it on and I can feel the difference.  It was a great addition to the 2 in 1 shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps me accountable to the notion of moisturizing after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have dry scalp issues in the winter and this stuff has cured it.  Not the greatest smell, but my scalp is no longer itchy and my hair is still shiny.</li>
            <li> Does not work all that well...</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product.  I have the worst dry scalp and I needed something to help condition my hair and scalp after using their almond oil shampoo.  I am able to wear black again! That is high praise for sure!</li>
            <li> Bought this for our son, and WOW!  His hair has shine and so soft!  He uses two fingers of the cream, massages it in his hair, lets sit for about 3 mins as he washes himself, and rinses really well.  No sticky residue or greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome stuff right here.</li>
            <li> helped with dry itchy scalp</li>
            <li> Works so well. Great product and helps keep my hair nice and conditioned. I will be buying it again in the near future,</li>
