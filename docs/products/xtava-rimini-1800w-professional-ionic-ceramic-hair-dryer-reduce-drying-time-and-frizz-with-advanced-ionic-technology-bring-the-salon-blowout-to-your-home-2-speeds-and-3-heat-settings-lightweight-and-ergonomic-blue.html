            <li>I love the sleek design, and color of this hair dryer for starters, but I had one I loved more.</li>
            <li>In order to have that kind of hair, a good blow dryer is an important requirement.</li>

            <li>Great product, price, and customer service, all in a pretty package</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this hair dryer is very light weight.</li>
            <li>FEELS VERY CHEAP.  </li>

            <li>This a very light blow dryer unlike others that I have owned.</li>
            <li>The ionic technology really plays a role in hair dryers, helping maintain, a healthy, beautiful shine.  </li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is quitter than most, but its still a hair dryer, so its going to be noisy.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the dryer, and it&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>

            <li>I was excited to get this blow dryer to review on my blog.</li>
            <li>so I was so excited to get this product in the mail.</li>
            <li>It has a long cord which is great and also an emergency s</li>
            <li>Xtava Blue Professional Hair Dryer is awesome.</li>
            <li>I use a great shampoo and conditioner along with a blow dry primer for my hair</li>
            <li>I kept looking at the Rimini 1800W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic on Amazon -- it was the color that caught my eye first -- that beautiful blue.  </li>
            <li>Super light.</li>
            <li>Also this hair dryer is great because it has a cool switch, a button you can press to get a quick shot of cool air occasionally.</li>

            <li>So far I am loving this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>now that I&#x27;ve used it a week or so, I know it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use and believe will be good.</li>
            <li>Very nice, lightweight, seems to dry hair quickly without frying it.</li>
            <li>I love how you can customize what kind of blow dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me about 4 minutes to dry my hair with my Xtava hair dryer, which is amazing for me!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The amount of air blowing out was just perfect, and using the attachment enabled me to center in on certain portions of my hair and style using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the bright blue color, it&#x27;s made very sturdy, and the cord is very flexible while</li>
            <li>my hair SO quickly, yet made it bouncy and beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It completes the drying process quickly and doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise.  </li>

            <li>Iconic Hair Dryer will get the job done faster, and will leave your hair straighter, and feeling much healthier, and looking much shinier too!</li>
            <li>It comes with a control nozzle that fits very well and is easy to get off and</li>
            <li>and it is aesthetically pretty too!  </li>
            <li>Another great thing about this hair is that it really does dry your faster.</li>
            <li>Great little dryer.</li>
            <li>It was great for a little while and</li>
            <li>Straight out of the box I noticed that it was light weight and had a sleek design.</li>
            <li>I have not found a product that I haven&#x27;t completely feel in love with by this company..</li>
            <li>I got the blue -  nice color.  </li>
            <li>powerful and adjustable</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>liked a big frizz ball after drying it but with this hair dryer my hair</li>
            <li>It dried my hair so fast without ripping it all around and it was incredible.</li>
            <li>I was glad my old blow dryer stopped working</li>
            <li>Most dryers that have the ceramic ionic feature have it clearly marked.  </li>
            <li>I love the way that it curves ensuring that the heat is going directly where it needs to go.</li>
            <li>right where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>The concentrator nozzle is just the right size.</li>
            <li>It is such a beautiful shade of blue.</li>
            <li>and this is so light weight and has such a strong kick in power.</li>
            <li>you need; sometimes, I need a pretty powerful one if I&#x27;m rushing to go to work in the morning</li>
            <li>I told Lucile I wished it had come with a diffuser, and she said there should be a new diffuser coming out in March that will fit that barrel.</li>
            <li>My former blow dryer only had the hot setting, so this is a great advantage for me.</li>
            <li>im waitint still, other than that very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>so it was also a good excuse to get a new one.)</li>
            <li>Mine stopped having hot air after 3 months.....  </li>
            <li>I gave this hair dryer two stars (instead of one) because it turned on and blew out hot air.</li>
            <li>– Reduce drying time and get ready faster with Rimini’s salon grade powerful 1500 W motor.</li>
            <li>Because when the weather is hot, I don&#x27;t always want to feel a hot breeze in my face.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this dryer--and the fun color is a plus, too!</li>
            <li>The color is pretty too.</li>
            <li>After about 4 months of using it 2x week, it stopped blowing out hot air.</li>
            <li>I received the dryer, took it out of the box, plugged it in and it was blowing hot air.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with this hair dryer and would recommend this hair dryer to any of my friends or family.</li>
            <li>also love that this hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle so I can deliver lots of heat to one specific area.</li>
            <li>I love this one so much better than the way more expensive hair dryer</li>
            <li>Trust me for the price this is a great hair dryer and so much nicer than my way way more expensive one is</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is exactly what you expect.</li>
            <li>Went back and found a compact dryer that will suit me better.</li>
            <li>Like many others stated this comes loose in the package, it is looks like it won&#x27;t last for more than 6 months</li>
            <li>After drying is complete, I like to set my hair with the cool option.</li>
            <li>The Blowdryer can well packaged with a attachment for a more focused dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to let my hair air-dry, but sometimes even after 24 hours, my hair isn&#x27;t fully dry.</li>
            <li>I was able to blow dry my hair with this dryer in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>You can also remove the screen on the back of the hairdryer for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The dryer comes with a control nozzle which helps you to focus on certain areas.</li>
            <li>The very first thing I noticed when I opened the box before even using this product, is that the Rimini 1500W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer by XTAVA is one of the lightest blow dryers that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer not only dries my hair very quickly but it gives it a lot of volume that I really need.</li>
            <li>Third, it is light and the handle makes it so easy to use and to reach the different control buttons while you are still drying.  </li>
            <li>but I tend to be pretty particular about it being</li>
            <li>so far very nice, but time will tell how long it will last.</li>
            <li>This one has a strong blow and because it didn&#x27;t hurt my arms to hold for such extended periods of time I was able to completely dry my hair in 25 minutes!!!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like that.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li>That makes drying much easier, since I can move the dryer through my hair without worrying about sudden-onset baldness and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not  expecting much when it came, floating in the box with nothing holding it in place.</li>
            <li>Now with Rimini dryer it takes me 10 mins and Im ready to go out.</li>
            <li>It also came in the nick of time as my much cheaper hair dryer had just went out.</li>
            <li>Thought it was all BS about the ionic, tourmaline and ceramic features really having that much of an effect.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely stunned by the drying time.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What really sets it apart is XTAVA customer service.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>or maybe I wasn&#x27;t really awake, but</li>
            <li>Secondly, it is powerful which is probably why it says professional in the name</li>
            <li>She has very nappy hair.</li>
            <li>And I was blown away (pun intended) by how smooth it left my hair.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Very lightweight.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer made my hair work so much easier And painless.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I am really amazed by how fast it dries your hair and does not leave you with a frizzy head.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like the way it dries my long fine hair.</li>
            <li>I know hairdryers aren&#x27;t forever, but I certainly expected it to last more than 7 weeks!</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I picked it up when I first opened the package.</li>
            <li>previous dryer had way more W and blew harder.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I like the hair dryer because it doesn&#x27;t cause the frizz that I was experiencing with my older dryer.</li>
            <li>Super lightweight, and surprisingly quiet for the size!</li>
            <li>It is lighter than my current one and more quiet.</li>
            <li>I recommend this hair dryer to anyone looking for a new replacement because it work really well and is high quality for your money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this dryer to everyone.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this dryer to everyone.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like to start out on high heat all over</li>
            <li>so I could finally get a nice, modern looking one (gray and black).</li>
            <li>I liked the way the dryer angled down, the controls looked high enough up</li>
            <li>Dries fast and isn&#x27;t too loud.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full-sized, powerful, quiet, and my fingers don&#x27;t continually change the settings.  </li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>but I can honestly say that out hair dries in less than ten minutes!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t put out a ton of air and it doesn&#x27;t feel very hot, but it somehow gets my hair dry as fast as my old hair dryer, and that&#x27;s all I care about.</li>
            <li>She then offered to send it to me when it comes out (also, they will soon have a new dryer on te market that will ship with a diffuser attachment)&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was on the hunt for a new one.</li>
            <li>I only gave it two stars because it turned on and blew out hot air.</li>
            <li>Looks like a professional job!</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty short</li>
            <li>There is also a button for a cool burst of air to set your style so you can have minimal frizz.</li>
            <li>You can dry it slower if you like, but I read somewhere awhile back that it&#x27;s better to dry on a higher speed and higher temp, and get the heat off your hair as quickly as possible, so</li>
            <li>I am actually upset I ever spent that much on a blow dryer when I could have originally just ordered the Rimini.</li>
            <li>Loved the hair dryer when I first received, but stopped blowing hot air, only cool after just a few months, not sure if this is a typical problem, but very dissappointed with quality, would expect a hair dryer to last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised with this dryer so far!</li>
            <li>Other times, like when I go out on weekends, I like to use medium settings and use the cool button to set my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I plugged in this dryer and used it the first time, I was absolutely amazed with how quickly it dried my hair, how well it straightened my naturally wavy hair, and how much shinier and healthier it made my hair look when I was done</li>
            <li>Wow!  First and foremost, if you have long hair this is the Hair Dryer for you!  </li>
            <li>Sure, air-drying is less time-consuming and I&#x27;m able to do other things while my hair dries, but NOW I know what I was missing when I didn&#x27;t need a hair</li>
            <li>I was afraid it would work great</li>
            <li>It feels natural in my hands, and again, this is after not handling one in over three years.</li>
            <li>We used this hair dryer for 1 month then the heat completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair faster than others and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>With my old hair dryer my hair looked</li>
            <li>hair is soft and semi</li>
            <li>have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>and I leave myself barely enough time to get ready and get out the door to make it to work.</li>
            <li>This dryer is a complete game-changer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am so surprised by this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on more powerful expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I only tried this blow dryer because I wasn&#x27;t gonna spend good money on some features that probably are false.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a little large, but it works perfectly fine and is comfortable to hold and does not tire my hand or wrist out since it takes a little time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 4 minutes to completely dry my shoulder-length, straight hair, and that&#x27;s at medium heat, high power.  </li>
            <li>I always use this button when I&#x27;m done to give my hair a cool down and to lock in my hairstyle.</li>
            <li>Weighting only 1.3 lbs and equipped with an ergonomic handle designed to suit left or right handed users&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blow dryer also comes with a concentrator nozzle that allows you to focus the heat to the exact area you want to dry without blowing the rest of your hair all around, although I didn&#x27;t find the need to use this feature</li>
            <li>The blow dryer also comes with a concentrator nozzle that allows you to focus the heat to the exact area you want to dry without blowing the rest of your hair all around, although I didn&#x27;t find the need to use this feature</li>
            <li>This is the first time I haven&#x27;t had to  &amp;#34;touchups&amp;#34; with a flatrion after I blow dry her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and cuts down the frizz a bit, but nothing out of this world.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t always dry my hair this way until recently, but I&#x27;ve found it really dries your hair so much</li>
            <li>The slight downward tilt is actually genius as it is more ergonomic than regular dryers.  </li>
            <li>The heat can be set to low, medium, or high depending on your preference.</li>
            <li>And low, med and high also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s force from the air, or from moving the dryer around, but it&#x27;s not quite as secure as it could be.</li>
            <li>I also just purchased the Diffuser as well, I picked the Hot Pink</li>
            <li>( no more waking my son up when I am getting ready, score!!! )</li>
            <li>Just starting to use my new XTAVA hair dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair is super long and super thick and usually takes 7 minutes at the fastest, especially when my hair is still pretty wet because I pretty much just got out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I have because it will dry the hair fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not too loud, and it&#x27;s definitely quieter than my old dryer.</li>
            <li>Her stylist has noticed a major shift in her hair growth and health, and I feel like I have Rimini blow dryer to thank.</li>
            <li>have very thick and healthy hair.</li>
            <li>dried, I then blasted my hair with the cool setting, which worked really great and really made my hair less frizzy and gave it instant shine and made it look healthier</li>
            <li>I was using a lesser power one before, and wow, no comparison!&lt;br /&gt;Dried</li>
            <li>Not hard to use, simple basic dryer,</li>
            <li>It dries my hair fairly quickly maybe because the temperature seems a little hotter than my last dryer.</li>
            <li>I had it on the hottest setting and on high, didn&#x27;t seem like it to any time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is soooo light and can dry my medium to heavy hair in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Or you can hold it down to dry your hair with cool hair.</li>
            <li>As soon as I walk out the door, but my hair has been surprisingly tame this week, I think in thanks to my new Xtava Blowdryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I noticed that at the highest heat that the air is not super strong like some other hair dryers out there,but it definitely dries your hair in record time!</li>
            <li>It normally takes me 45 minutes to dry my hair completely with my previous hair dryer which is a high end salon brand.</li>
            <li>The little ones gave it a thumbs up because it doesn’t get too hot on their head when used on the lower heat</li>
            <li>And actually in my opinion, it&#x27;s better than my super expensive dryer, because it dries my hair in nearly HALF the time!</li>
            <li>And actually in my opinion, it&#x27;s better than my super expensive dryer, because it dries my hair in nearly HALF the time!</li>
            <li>It smelled like plastic, which is often expected with a new hair dryer and did not bother me.</li>
            <li>and I blow dry it frequently without any issues.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair that usually takes forever to dry, even with a dryer, but this one is nice and light and doesn&#x27;t make my arm feel like it&#x27;s going to snap off after holding it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>The other one is for the heat setting to low medium and high heat.</li>
            <li>Other pluses to this are that it has a long cord that didn&#x27;t tangle on me which was very convenient.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>My wife likes it very much; keep in mind that it is a big dryer so a small person may find it a bit big.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that it is kind of large and difficult to store, but besides that, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>

            <li> Products are as picture, every thing works nicely.</li>
            <li> received the Rimini dryer in exchange of my honest opinion but it didnt affect my thought.</li>
            <li> got this product for purpose of review,all claims and views are 100 percent my own.</li>
            <li> Another feature that comes in handy is the concentrator nozzle.</li>
            <li> I was sent this to review for my blog, GlamRiver and to be honest I have never used a Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer before</li>
            <li> has nice settings and will not burn the scalp like my pricey hair dryer does .</li>
            <li> I had a blow dryer that I really liked</li>
            <li> The cool shot button is great.</li>
            <li> I love the sleek design, and color of this hair dryer for starters, but I had one I loved more.</li>
            <li> In order to have that kind of hair, a good blow dryer is an important requirement.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this blow dryer is so cheap price wise.</li>
            <li> I am very happy so far with this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love that I got the opportunity to test this hairdryer in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this blow dryer based on ALL the great reviews I read on Amazon and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty impressive, quick and doesn&#x27;t feel like my hair is being brutalized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, price, and customer service, all in a pretty package</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this hair dryer is very light weight.</li>
            <li> FEELS VERY CHEAP.  </li>
            <li> Some people described this as being very light.</li>
            <li> This a very light blow dryer unlike others that I have owned.</li>
            <li> The ionic technology really plays a role in hair dryers, helping maintain, a healthy, beautiful shine.  </li>
            <li> received this product in exchange for my honest review - and I&#x27;m the lucky one here!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> To me their products are top notch but at a affordable price.  </li>
            <li> but they liked that it had adjustable settings for heat and that it was light</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So glad I got to try this in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> No return or exchange was able to be made</li>
            <li> Okay hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Works well, satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> 100% satisfied with this dryer.</li>
            <li> ; my hair and this attachment is a must to be able to achieve this style.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure about all the hype.  </li>
            <li> Seriously LOVE this hair dryer</li>
            <li> Love the lightweight design.</li>
            <li> I was able to do things to my hair that I never have before because of it.</li>
            <li> So in love.</li>
            <li> I would say about 12 minutes the most * depending on what setting I use.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy and I have never been happier.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is quitter than most, but its still a hair dryer, so its going to be noisy.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the dryer, and it&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t satisfied and the dryers died out</li>
            <li> Love this dryer...for the two levels of intensity no matter what heat level.</li>
            <li> My hair dries faster and it feels more healthy.</li>
            <li> I will be returning this dryer and looking for a better one that indeed has the features bragged about.</li>

            <li> The product is light and quieter than most dryers I have owned.  </li>

            <li> First off it is so chic looking and very appealing on my vanity stand.</li>
            <li> Great so far.</li>
            <li> On the whole a good buy.</li>
            <li> They are easy to press and easy to remember where they are when the blow dryer is up in the air against my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is easy to manage for me.</li>
            <li> The controls are easy to manipulate, even while drying and styling.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has 3 heat settings and a cool shot that is really cool (not just warm).  </li>
            <li> THANK YOU so much for introducing me to such an awesome Hair Dryer!! :)</li>
            <li> Love it, has 3 settings and cool, warm and hot for drying hair.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> This is light and works perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li> It fits perfectly in my hand and it&#x27;s just the right angle to dry my hair without twisting my hand.</li>
            <li> They were all accurate.</li>
            <li> Use with a boar bristle round brush for best results.</li>
            <li> This dryer is so light weight</li>
            <li> Advanced ionic technology reduces frizz for smoother, shinier hair</li>
            <li> – The Rimini hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow control to the area you are targeting&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that it is light weight.</li>
            <li> the duckbill-looking thing that concentrates air) will occasionally fly off in the middle of drying.</li>
            <li> Fortunately there were no issues, it made it to me without breakage  </li>
            <li> Even me going cheap worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, enjoy.  </li>
            <li> on to precisely aim the air</li>
            <li> It is light and well balanced.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is easy to hold on to whilst drying your hair and has a good vent on the back as to not clog up easily.</li>
            <li> Its blue and I love it!!</li>
            <li> Super light and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> A wet curl doesn&#x27;t look good on anybody!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this blow dryer to review on my blog.</li>
            <li> so I was so excited to get this product in the mail.</li>
            <li> It has a long cord which is great and also an emergency s</li>
            <li> Xtava Blue Professional Hair Dryer is awesome.</li>
            <li> I use a great shampoo and conditioner along with a blow dry primer for my hair</li>
            <li> I kept looking at the Rimini 1800W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic on Amazon -- it was the color that caught my eye first -- that beautiful blue.  </li>
            <li> Super light.</li>
            <li> Also this hair dryer is great because it has a cool switch, a button you can press to get a quick shot of cool air occasionally.</li>
            <li> Nothing too special here.  </li>
            <li> , I think it will look really cool with the bright blue!  </li>
            <li> You have the cool blast button, the degree of heat button, and the force of air button.</li>
            <li> I really truly love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I like that this dryer has the cool shot button.</li>
            <li> OMG it is so true.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to use cool burst all over head after drying as well.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how light it was, it makes blow drying my hair fun and not a chore.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> now that I&#x27;ve used it a week or so, I know it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use and believe will be good.</li>
            <li> Very nice, lightweight, seems to dry hair quickly without frying it.</li>
            <li> I love how you can customize what kind of blow dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about 4 minutes to dry my hair with my Xtava hair dryer, which is amazing for me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The amount of air blowing out was just perfect, and using the attachment enabled me to center in on certain portions of my hair and style using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the bright blue color, it&#x27;s made very sturdy, and the cord is very flexible while</li>
            <li> my hair SO quickly, yet made it bouncy and beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It completes the drying process quickly and doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise.  </li>
            <li> so I needed to find a quick replacement.</li>
            <li> 1st of all I love the decent packaging.</li>
            <li> super quick.</li>
            <li> Light weight and dries my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> got this a few days ago and LOVE LOVE LOVE it.</li>
            <li> great product exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Iconic Hair Dryer will get the job done faster, and will leave your hair straighter, and feeling much healthier, and looking much shinier too!</li>
            <li> Iconic Hair Dryer will get the job done faster, and will leave your hair straighter, and feeling much healthier, and looking much shinier too!</li>
            <li> It comes with a control nozzle that fits very well and is easy to get off and</li>
            <li> and it is aesthetically pretty too!  </li>
            <li> Another great thing about this hair is that it really does dry your faster.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer.</li>
            <li> It was great for a little while and</li>
            <li> Straight out of the box I noticed that it was light weight and had a sleek design.</li>
            <li> I have not found a product that I haven&#x27;t completely feel in love with by this company..</li>
            <li> I got the blue -  nice color.  </li>
            <li> powerful and adjustable</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> liked a big frizz ball after drying it but with this hair dryer my hair</li>
            <li> It dried my hair so fast without ripping it all around and it was incredible.</li>
            <li> I was glad my old blow dryer stopped working</li>
            <li> Most dryers that have the ceramic ionic feature have it clearly marked.  </li>
            <li> I love the way that it curves ensuring that the heat is going directly where it needs to go.</li>
            <li> right where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> The concentrator nozzle is just the right size.</li>
            <li> It is such a beautiful shade of blue.</li>
            <li> and this is so light weight and has such a strong kick in power.</li>
            <li> you need; sometimes, I need a pretty powerful one if I&#x27;m rushing to go to work in the morning</li>
            <li> I told Lucile I wished it had come with a diffuser, and she said there should be a new diffuser coming out in March that will fit that barrel.</li>
            <li> My former blow dryer only had the hot setting, so this is a great advantage for me.</li>
            <li> im waitint still, other than that very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> so it was also a good excuse to get a new one.)</li>
            <li> Mine stopped having hot air after 3 months.....  </li>
            <li> I gave this hair dryer two stars (instead of one) because it turned on and blew out hot air.</li>
            <li> – Reduce drying time and get ready faster with Rimini’s salon grade powerful 1500 W motor.</li>
            <li> Because when the weather is hot, I don&#x27;t always want to feel a hot breeze in my face.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this dryer--and the fun color is a plus, too!</li>
            <li> The color is pretty too.</li>
            <li> After about 4 months of using it 2x week, it stopped blowing out hot air.</li>
            <li> I received the dryer, took it out of the box, plugged it in and it was blowing hot air.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with this hair dryer and would recommend this hair dryer to any of my friends or family.</li>
            <li> also love that this hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle so I can deliver lots of heat to one specific area.</li>
            <li> I love this one so much better than the way more expensive hair dryer</li>
            <li> Trust me for the price this is a great hair dryer and so much nicer than my way way more expensive one is</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is exactly what you expect.</li>
            <li> Went back and found a compact dryer that will suit me better.</li>
            <li> Like many others stated this comes loose in the package, it is looks like it won&#x27;t last for more than 6 months</li>
            <li> After drying is complete, I like to set my hair with the cool option.</li>
            <li> The Blowdryer can well packaged with a attachment for a more focused dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to let my hair air-dry, but sometimes even after 24 hours, my hair isn&#x27;t fully dry.</li>
            <li> I was able to blow dry my hair with this dryer in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> You can also remove the screen on the back of the hairdryer for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dryer comes with a control nozzle which helps you to focus on certain areas.</li>
            <li> The very first thing I noticed when I opened the box before even using this product, is that the Rimini 1500W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer by XTAVA is one of the lightest blow dryers that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer not only dries my hair very quickly but it gives it a lot of volume that I really need.</li>
            <li> Third, it is light and the handle makes it so easy to use and to reach the different control buttons while you are still drying.  </li>
            <li> but I tend to be pretty particular about it being</li>
            <li> so far very nice, but time will tell how long it will last.</li>
            <li> This one has a strong blow and because it didn&#x27;t hurt my arms to hold for such extended periods of time I was able to completely dry my hair in 25 minutes!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like that.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> That makes drying much easier, since I can move the dryer through my hair without worrying about sudden-onset baldness and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not  expecting much when it came, floating in the box with nothing holding it in place.</li>
            <li> Now with Rimini dryer it takes me 10 mins and Im ready to go out.</li>
            <li> It also came in the nick of time as my much cheaper hair dryer had just went out.</li>
            <li> Thought it was all BS about the ionic, tourmaline and ceramic features really having that much of an effect.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely stunned by the drying time.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What really sets it apart is XTAVA customer service.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> or maybe I wasn&#x27;t really awake, but</li>
            <li> Secondly, it is powerful which is probably why it says professional in the name</li>
            <li> She has very nappy hair.</li>
            <li> And I was blown away (pun intended) by how smooth it left my hair.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Very lightweight.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer made my hair work so much easier And painless.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am really amazed by how fast it dries your hair and does not leave you with a frizzy head.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the way it dries my long fine hair.</li>
            <li> I know hairdryers aren&#x27;t forever, but I certainly expected it to last more than 7 weeks!</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I picked it up when I first opened the package.</li>
            <li> previous dryer had way more W and blew harder.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer because it doesn&#x27;t cause the frizz that I was experiencing with my older dryer.</li>
            <li> Super lightweight, and surprisingly quiet for the size!</li>
            <li> It is lighter than my current one and more quiet.</li>
            <li> I recommend this hair dryer to anyone looking for a new replacement because it work really well and is high quality for your money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this dryer to everyone.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this dryer to everyone.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like to start out on high heat all over</li>
            <li> so I could finally get a nice, modern looking one (gray and black).</li>
            <li> I liked the way the dryer angled down, the controls looked high enough up</li>
            <li> Dries fast and isn&#x27;t too loud.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full-sized, powerful, quiet, and my fingers don&#x27;t continually change the settings.  </li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> but I can honestly say that out hair dries in less than ten minutes!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t put out a ton of air and it doesn&#x27;t feel very hot, but it somehow gets my hair dry as fast as my old hair dryer, and that&#x27;s all I care about.</li>
            <li> She then offered to send it to me when it comes out (also, they will soon have a new dryer on te market that will ship with a diffuser attachment)&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was on the hunt for a new one.</li>
            <li> I only gave it two stars because it turned on and blew out hot air.</li>
            <li> Looks like a professional job!</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty short</li>
            <li> There is also a button for a cool burst of air to set your style so you can have minimal frizz.</li>
            <li> You can dry it slower if you like, but I read somewhere awhile back that it&#x27;s better to dry on a higher speed and higher temp, and get the heat off your hair as quickly as possible, so</li>
            <li> I am actually upset I ever spent that much on a blow dryer when I could have originally just ordered the Rimini.</li>
            <li> Loved the hair dryer when I first received, but stopped blowing hot air, only cool after just a few months, not sure if this is a typical problem, but very dissappointed with quality, would expect a hair dryer to last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised with this dryer so far!</li>
            <li> Other times, like when I go out on weekends, I like to use medium settings and use the cool button to set my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I plugged in this dryer and used it the first time, I was absolutely amazed with how quickly it dried my hair, how well it straightened my naturally wavy hair, and how much shinier and healthier it made my hair look when I was done</li>
            <li> Wow!  First and foremost, if you have long hair this is the Hair Dryer for you!  </li>
            <li> Sure, air-drying is less time-consuming and I&#x27;m able to do other things while my hair dries, but NOW I know what I was missing when I didn&#x27;t need a hair</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would work great</li>
            <li> It feels natural in my hands, and again, this is after not handling one in over three years.</li>
            <li> We used this hair dryer for 1 month then the heat completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair faster than others and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> With my old hair dryer my hair looked</li>
            <li> hair is soft and semi</li>
            <li> have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> and I leave myself barely enough time to get ready and get out the door to make it to work.</li>
            <li> This dryer is a complete game-changer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am so surprised by this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on more powerful expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I only tried this blow dryer because I wasn&#x27;t gonna spend good money on some features that probably are false.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little large, but it works perfectly fine and is comfortable to hold and does not tire my hand or wrist out since it takes a little time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It takes me about 4 minutes to completely dry my shoulder-length, straight hair, and that&#x27;s at medium heat, high power.  </li>
            <li> I always use this button when I&#x27;m done to give my hair a cool down and to lock in my hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Weighting only 1.3 lbs and equipped with an ergonomic handle designed to suit left or right handed users&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blow dryer also comes with a concentrator nozzle that allows you to focus the heat to the exact area you want to dry without blowing the rest of your hair all around, although I didn&#x27;t find the need to use this feature</li>
            <li> The blow dryer also comes with a concentrator nozzle that allows you to focus the heat to the exact area you want to dry without blowing the rest of your hair all around, although I didn&#x27;t find the need to use this feature</li>
            <li> This is the first time I haven&#x27;t had to  &amp;#34;touchups&amp;#34; with a flatrion after I blow dry her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and cuts down the frizz a bit, but nothing out of this world.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t always dry my hair this way until recently, but I&#x27;ve found it really dries your hair so much</li>
            <li> The slight downward tilt is actually genius as it is more ergonomic than regular dryers.  </li>
            <li> The heat can be set to low, medium, or high depending on your preference.</li>
            <li> And low, med and high also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s force from the air, or from moving the dryer around, but it&#x27;s not quite as secure as it could be.</li>
            <li> I also just purchased the Diffuser as well, I picked the Hot Pink</li>
            <li> ( no more waking my son up when I am getting ready, score!!! )</li>
            <li> Just starting to use my new XTAVA hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair is super long and super thick and usually takes 7 minutes at the fastest, especially when my hair is still pretty wet because I pretty much just got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have because it will dry the hair fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not too loud, and it&#x27;s definitely quieter than my old dryer.</li>
            <li> Her stylist has noticed a major shift in her hair growth and health, and I feel like I have Rimini blow dryer to thank.</li>
            <li> have very thick and healthy hair.</li>
            <li> dried, I then blasted my hair with the cool setting, which worked really great and really made my hair less frizzy and gave it instant shine and made it look healthier</li>
            <li> I was using a lesser power one before, and wow, no comparison!&lt;br /&gt;Dried</li>
            <li> Not hard to use, simple basic dryer,</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fairly quickly maybe because the temperature seems a little hotter than my last dryer.</li>
            <li> I had it on the hottest setting and on high, didn&#x27;t seem like it to any time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is soooo light and can dry my medium to heavy hair in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Or you can hold it down to dry your hair with cool hair.</li>
            <li> As soon as I walk out the door, but my hair has been surprisingly tame this week, I think in thanks to my new Xtava Blowdryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I noticed that at the highest heat that the air is not super strong like some other hair dryers out there,but it definitely dries your hair in record time!</li>
            <li> It normally takes me 45 minutes to dry my hair completely with my previous hair dryer which is a high end salon brand.</li>
            <li> The little ones gave it a thumbs up because it doesn’t get too hot on their head when used on the lower heat</li>
            <li> And actually in my opinion, it&#x27;s better than my super expensive dryer, because it dries my hair in nearly HALF the time!</li>
            <li> And actually in my opinion, it&#x27;s better than my super expensive dryer, because it dries my hair in nearly HALF the time!</li>
            <li> It smelled like plastic, which is often expected with a new hair dryer and did not bother me.</li>
            <li> and I blow dry it frequently without any issues.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that usually takes forever to dry, even with a dryer, but this one is nice and light and doesn&#x27;t make my arm feel like it&#x27;s going to snap off after holding it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The other one is for the heat setting to low medium and high heat.</li>
            <li> Other pluses to this are that it has a long cord that didn&#x27;t tangle on me which was very convenient.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it very much; keep in mind that it is a big dryer so a small person may find it a bit big.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is kind of large and difficult to store, but besides that, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can actually use the high speed and not make a mess of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair, not thick or thin</li>
            <li> My older dryer&#x27;s handle got so greasy after few use.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer not only has the cold press button, but also high heat, low heat, and cool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this is the first blow dryer I&#x27;ve owned and used since late 2011, I give it two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> This dryer is great for heavy, thick, long and even short and thin hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a five star.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing an ionic hair dryer, I used a high end, ordinary dryer.</li>
            <li> However, it took forever to dry my hair and the result was a big frizz ball by the end.</li>
            <li> Broke after less than 10 uses and before it died completely it would overheat in minutes.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair daily</li>
            <li> Continue with each section until your hair is dry, and then finish off the final style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hairdryers tend to be either too hot or too powerful, and a combination of both yields only atrocious results.</li>
            <li> Love that it has a cold shot button to help &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, sometimes frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;ve had mine a long time</li>
            <li> Now, three years later, my hair is super thick and well past my shoulders again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While using this dryer the last week, I have also noticed my hair has been much less frizzier too, especially for this time of year!</li>
            <li> Because it used to take ne really long time to dry them.</li>
            <li> I love that you can hold it on your hair for several minutes and never get that tired, dead arm, from holding a heavy blowdryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I WISH I would&#x27;ve started using one a LONG time ago!  </li>
            <li> Saved me an extra 20 to style my hair with other tools.</li>
            <li> and oh SO quiet compared to all the other hair dryers I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> With this blow dryer, I can quickly dry my all my hair or just a section because it comes with a concentrated air flow attachment.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is 1500 watts which means it can dry your hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair and constantly fight with the air intake valve on my other hair dryers as they suck up my hair and it gets tangled up inside!  </li>
            <li> My hair comes down to my lower back.</li>
            <li> In fact, it dried my hair faster than my much more expensive dryer I&#x27;ve been using for the last few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is quieter and lighter than my previous blow dryer although somewhat larger.</li>
            <li> My previous dryer was packed in a combination of cardboard and plastic which you open once</li>
            <li> Most hairdryers offer heat with the option of the cold button that you have to hold down.</li>
            <li> hair is extra coarse, dry, frizzy and THICK.</li>
            <li> then about 4 days ago something went wrong - it suddenly has markedly less power while simultaneously running INCREDIBLY hot, and there&#x27;s a strange melting plastic smell....  </li>
            <li> , I can guarantee my curled hair will be wet.</li>
            <li> Not the drying power expected</li>
            <li> and I am extremely careful on what I use on it.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is that the nozzle (is that what it&#x27;s called?</li>
            <li> It typically takes 20 to 25 minutes to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to bleach my hair a whopping 7 times in the past 4 months; although it&#x27;s surprisingly not really damaged, it takes a long time for my hair to dry.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer dries my hair in about 10 minutes with minimal frizz!</li>
            <li> and the cord is extremely short.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and my running friends razz me about my finish line photos due to the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t get messed up.</li>
            <li> It is extremely affordable, reliable, and customizable.</li>
            <li> Found it&#x27;s design to be too long and somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li> I messed with all the settings, unplugged it and plugged it back in, moved it to different plugs, only COLD air.</li>
            <li> , just average..</li>
            <li> Drying one section at a time, hold the hair taut with a brush while pointing the hair dryer nozzle down toward the hair.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair takes about 25 minutes to blow dry and with this</li>
            <li> It usually takes about 20 minutes to completely dry my hair and with this one it took about 12 minutes.  </li>
            <li> black end cap piece keeps falling off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this hairdryer for less than two months.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick kinky hair that takes a long time to get dry.  </li>
            <li> only complaint about this dryer is I wish the cord was a little bit longer, but that&#x27;s just because I move around the bathroom a lot doing stuff while drying my hair because I have ADD in the bathroom and can&#x27;t sit still just doing my hair!</li>
            <li> only complaint about this dryer is I wish the cord was a little bit longer, but that&#x27;s just because I move around the bathroom a lot doing stuff while drying my hair because I have ADD in the bathroom and can&#x27;t sit still just doing my hair!</li>
            <li> The girls that have longer thick hair thought this product took a little longer to dry their hair</li>
            <li> Nowhere on the box or in the included papers did it include the words &amp;#34;ceramic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34;... after using this dryer I have trouble believing it is ceramic or ionic.</li>
            <li> I like to use a round brush to make the ends of my hair curl under sometimes while blow drying......</li>
            <li> I realize now how lousy my old dryer is.</li>
            <li> Only worked for a few months, it now ONLY blows cold air.</li>
            <li> It includes a diffuser to keep your hair from getting too overheated and dried out plus it has a reset and test button on the plug in.</li>
            <li> Used few times.</li>
            <li> thats just how I&#x27;ve always dried my hair.</li>
            <li> NOT COMFORTABLE TO HOLD.  </li>
            <li> So you don&#x27;t have to hold down the cold button because the cool button is cold enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m completely obsessed with this blowdryer, especially since it will only cost you $29 on Amazon, and completely rivals the uber expensive hair dryers on the market!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m completely obsessed with this blowdryer, especially since it will only cost you $29 on Amazon, and completely rivals the uber expensive hair dryers on the market!</li>
            <li> Probably the smartest part of the design is the honeycomb pattern over the back--it&#x27;s pretty much impossible for my hair to get through it and get stuck in the blades.</li>
            <li> Cut drying time in half!</li>
            <li> Like my older conair dryer it has cold air button too.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> The package said &amp;#34;iconic&amp;#34; (with a c) instead of &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; - I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a typo or an intentional part of the name.</li>
            <li> My Revlon hair dryer started sparking and died in January, a few days after the one-year warranty expired (yay!</li>
            <li> cause it was past the return date.</li>
            <li> It seems to get my hair dryer faster than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and my arms get tired with some blow dryers.  </li>
            <li> hair usually takes 40 minutes plus With no brushing, which makes it take way</li>
            <li> I usually look like Lion King after blow drying my hair because I don&#x27;t brush it while drying</li>
            <li> WISH I RETURNED IT WHEN I FIRST GOT IT. :(</li>
            <li> and I was not satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> get that tired, dead arm, from holding a heavy blowdryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a problem on my wrist And usually have a hard time drying/styling my hair.</li>
            <li> Especially in winter I get sick when I go out with wet hair.</li>
            <li> Seriously ladies, stop wasting the big bucks on expensive hair dryers, this Xtava Rimini 1500W</li>
            <li> Seriously ladies, stop wasting the big bucks on expensive hair dryers, this Xtava Rimini 1500W</li>
            <li> and it would only blow cold air.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> but with this dryer my hair looks like if I used a straightener and a thick curling iron for the ends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cold and dry here, my hair usually goes POOF!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the heat element went out in my dryer less than one year into owning it.  </li>
            <li> I can use the Cold Shot to dry the spray without flattening my hair.</li>
            <li> It blew air unevenly and I had random patches of dampness.</li>
            <li> I replaced a very expensive hair dryer that I had a long time</li>
            <li> No warm setting!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with any hair product</li>
            <li> I literally gave away my expensive ( $179 blow dryer after using this).</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with the way this dryer worked on my thick, wavy hair and will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I used the cold setting to set my hair.  </li>
            <li> Moreover the cold air option also helps to to keep the style in place.</li>
            <li> I was afraid there would be &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> and it made me cynical about how well the product worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another feature that I like on the Rimini hair dryer is the Cold Shot Button.</li>
            <li> but it does have 3 heat settings and yes, I use them all during one drying and it has 2 speed settings plus the cold shot button.  </li>
            <li> It is salon quality and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I used to hate taking shower in the morning and drying afterwards.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Mine stopped having hot air after 3 months.....  Can&#x27;t return to Amazon and there&#x27;s no warranty info inside the box....</li>
            <li> Excellent! I have long, sometimes frizzy hair. This hairdryer dries my hair in about 10 minutes with minimal frizz! I love it. Use with a boar bristle round brush for best results.</li>
            <li> I have to five star this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got this a few days ago and LOVE LOVE LOVE it. I was using a lesser power one before, and wow, no comparison!&lt;br /&gt;Dried my hair SO quickly, yet made it bouncy and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of air blowing out was just perfect, and using the attachment enabled me to center in on certain portions of my hair and style using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the bright blue color, it&#x27;s made very sturdy, and the cord is very flexible while styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer. It completes the drying process quickly and doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise.  It is light weight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and I blow dry it frequently without any issues. I gave this hair dryer two stars (instead of one) because it turned on and blew out hot air. It smelled like plastic, which is often expected with a new hair dryer and did not bother me. However, it took forever to dry my hair and the result was a big frizz ball by the end. The concentrator kept falling off. It blew air unevenly and I had random patches of dampness. The package said &amp;#34;iconic&amp;#34; (with a c) instead of &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; - I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a typo or an intentional part of the name. Nowhere on the box or in the included papers did it include the words &amp;#34;ceramic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34;... after using this dryer I have trouble believing it is ceramic or ionic. I was very unhappy with the way this dryer worked on my thick, wavy hair and will be returning it. I only gave it two stars because it turned on and blew out hot air.</li>
            <li> I have not found a product that I haven&#x27;t completely feel in love with by this company.. To me their products are top notch but at a affordable price.  The Blowdryer can well packaged with a attachment for a more focused dry.  It has three settings and two speeds.  I have very thick kinky hair that takes a long time to get dry.  I had it on the hottest setting and on high, didn&#x27;t seem like it to any time to dry my hair. After I styled it I used the cold setting to set my hair.  This dryer is so light weight I was afraid it would work great but this hair dryer made a fool out me lol.</li>
            <li> Like many others stated this comes loose in the package, it is looks like it won&#x27;t last for more than 6 months and the cord is extremely short.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the way it dries my long fine hair. I am returning to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned a blow dryer in over three years. I chopped off all my hair (I had about 1/2&amp;#34; of hair left) to go chemical-free. Now, three years later, my hair is super thick and well past my shoulders again. I&#x27;m able to let my hair air-dry, but sometimes even after 24 hours, my hair isn&#x27;t fully dry. I was excited to get this blow dryer to review on my blog. Sure, air-drying is less time-consuming and I&#x27;m able to do other things while my hair dries, but NOW I know what I was missing when I didn&#x27;t need a hair dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have my hair styled and I get in the shower, I can guarantee my curled hair will be wet. A wet curl doesn&#x27;t look good on anybody! With this blow dryer, I can quickly dry my all my hair or just a section because it comes with a concentrated air flow attachment. The buttons are self-explanatory. You have the cool blast button, the degree of heat button, and the force of air button. They are easy to press and easy to remember where they are when the blow dryer is up in the air against my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is the first blow dryer I&#x27;ve owned and used since late 2011, I give it two thumbs up. It&#x27;s a great blow dryer for the price you pay. It feels natural in my hands, and again, this is after not handling one in over three years. (Christmas 2015 will be my 4th year.)</li>
            <li> With a houseful of divas we go through hair dryers! Recently we received a tourmaline ionic hair dryer by Rimini and have had mixed opinions on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it but I also have shorter, shoulder length hair that does not require a lot of work. The girls that have longer thick hair thought this product took a little longer to dry their hair but they liked that it had adjustable settings for heat and that it was light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the packaging, this product is known for being:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POWERFUL – Reduce drying time and get ready faster with Rimini’s salon grade powerful 1500 W motor. Advanced ionic technology reduces frizz for smoother, shinier hair&lt;br /&gt;PRECISE – The Rimini hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow control to the area you are targeting&lt;br /&gt;ADJUSTABLE – With three heat levels and two power levels, achieve complete control of your styling and lock in your perfect look with the cool shot button&lt;br /&gt;LIGHT WEIGHT – Weighting only 1.3 lbs and equipped with an ergonomic handle designed to suit left or right handed users&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we give this a thumbs up on quality and ease of use. The variety of settings allow us to use this for not only drying but also styling smaller areas. The little ones gave it a thumbs up because it doesn’t get too hot on their head when used on the lower heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was purchase with a promotional coupon or discount.</li>
            <li> Just starting to use my new XTAVA hair dryer. I like that it is light weight. It might be balanced a bit better for the hand, but it can&#x27;t be beat for good value. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Awesome blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer because it doesn&#x27;t cause the frizz that I was experiencing with my older dryer. Moreover the cold air option also helps to to keep the style in place. On the whole a good buy. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a five star.</li>
            <li> Not the drying power expected</li>
            <li> I like that it has 3 heat settings and a cool shot that is really cool (not just warm).  It is quieter and lighter than my previous blow dryer although somewhat larger. Good price.  I got the blue -  nice color.  I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Xtava Blue Professional Hair Dryer is awesome. I have used it several times this week and I am super thrilled with it. The heat can be set to low, medium, or high depending on your preference. I really like that. Because when the weather is hot, I don&#x27;t always want to feel a hot breeze in my face. I prefer it to be medium or else I start sweating. My former blow dryer only had the hot setting, so this is a great advantage for me. Also this hair dryer is great because it has a cool switch, a button you can press to get a quick shot of cool air occasionally. I love that it has a wind controlling cone that can be added to the dryer for styling! I like to use a round brush to make the ends of my hair curl under sometimes while blow drying......but I don&#x27;t want my hair blowing every which way lol. So this is just perfect. I really truly love this hair dryer. So happy with it. Works very well. Runs great. Makes my hair look beautiful. Mission accomplished. So glad I got to try this in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> I got all things i ordered but one, im waitint still, other than that very satisfied with my purchase. Products are as picture, every thing works nicely.</li>
            <li> My Revlon hair dryer started sparking and died in January, a few days after the one-year warranty expired (yay! not.) so I needed to find a quick replacement. I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised with this dryer so far! I have very thick hair that usually takes forever to dry, even with a dryer, but this one is nice and light and doesn&#x27;t make my arm feel like it&#x27;s going to snap off after holding it for a few minutes. Probably the smartest part of the design is the honeycomb pattern over the back--it&#x27;s pretty much impossible for my hair to get through it and get stuck in the blades. That makes drying much easier, since I can move the dryer through my hair without worrying about sudden-onset baldness and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too loud, and it&#x27;s definitely quieter than my old dryer. My only minor complaint is that the nozzle (is that what it&#x27;s called? the duckbill-looking thing that concentrates air) will occasionally fly off in the middle of drying. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s force from the air, or from moving the dryer around, but it&#x27;s not quite as secure as it could be. Other than that, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this dryer--and the fun color is a plus, too!</li>
            <li> Had this blow dryer for 3 months and it broke. No return or exchange was able to be made cause it was past the return date. Not happy</li>
            <li> Work so well we bought two!</li>
            <li> I rate the product 4 stars. It dries quickly and cuts down the frizz a bit, but nothing out of this world. However, I just interacted with customer service for a problem, and I was very impressed with how the company handled the situation. The product definitely deserves an extra star for customer service!</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend, and he loves it! I kinda got jealous when we opened the box, because it&#x27;s actually better than the dryer I have! Super lightweight, and surprisingly quiet for the size! I think I might just sell the one I have (Isopro) to get me a Rimini!</li>
            <li> Nothing too special here.  Okay hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Very nice, lightweight, seems to dry hair quickly without frying it. so far very nice, but time will tell how long it will last. great value so far.</li>
            <li> A great hairdryer. It seems to get my hair dryer faster than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. The color is pretty too.</li>
            <li> powerful and adjustable</li>
            <li> Works well, satisfied.</li>
            <li> We used this hair dryer for 1 month then the heat completely stopped working.  It had a funky smell every time we used it before it broke.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it.  Works just as reviews stated.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was not  expecting much when it came, floating in the box with nothing holding it in place. I was afraid there would be &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34;.  Fortunately there were no issues, it made it to me without breakage  and I&#x27;m very pleased with the hair dryer.  I have long thick hair and my arms get tired with some blow dryers.  This is light and works perfectly fine.  I replaced a very expensive hair dryer that I had a long time, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot and this was a  good purchase and great  price!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this hair dryer is very light weight. I have long hair so it&#x27;s perfect for me to dry my hair with it. Thank you for allowing me the chance to use it for a review.</li>
            <li> After about 4 months of using it 2x week, it stopped blowing out hot air. Trashed it.</li>
            <li> I received the dryer, took it out of the box, plugged it in and it was blowing hot air. The next morning I got out of the shower, plugged it in and it would only blow cold air. I messed with all the settings, unplugged it and plugged it back in, moved it to different plugs, only COLD air. I returned it the next day.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. It dries my hair faster than others and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Great dryer.... Cut drying time in half! Looks like a professional job!</li>
            <li> Love this.  Light weight and dries my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> 1st of all I love the decent packaging. It comes in a box. My previous dryer was packed in a combination of cardboard and plastic which you open once and thats it. You have to throw the packaging and there is no placd to put the dryer back. But this dryer comes in a box and you can put back in the box.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer comes with a control nozzle which helps you to focus on certain areas. I have very thick hair and I used to hate taking shower in the morning and drying afterwards. Because it used to take ne really long time to dry them. Now with Rimini dryer it takes me 10 mins and Im ready to go out. Especially in winter I get sick when I go out with wet hair. Rimini dryer has saved my life, time, and energy.&lt;br /&gt; This dryer is great for heavy, thick, long and even short and thin hair. Ut works great and helps you style your hair. Like my older conair dryer it has cold air button too. It has different levels of air pressure. The handle is great to grip on. My older dryer&#x27;s handle got so greasy after few use. This dryer is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Im 100% satisfied with this dryer. I would highly recommend it. This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Rimini dryer in exchange of my honest opinion but it didnt affect my thought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that uses this thing. It&#x27;s pretty impressive, quick and doesn&#x27;t feel like my hair is being brutalized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had never heard of this brand before but it is a great product.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is great. I bought it because we recently moved and I couldn&#x27;t find my hairdryer in the sea of boxes. ( I&#x27;ve had mine a long time so it was also a good excuse to get a new one.) I have fine thin hair. This hairdryer not only dries my hair very quickly but it gives it a lot of volume that I really need. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I realize now how lousy my old dryer is.</li>
            <li> black end cap piece keeps falling off</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the heat element went out in my dryer less than one year into owning it.  The product is light and quieter than most dryers I have owned.  Definitely made my hair softer.  Still would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this hairdryer for less than two months.  It was great for a little while and then about 4 days ago something went wrong - it suddenly has markedly less power while simultaneously running INCREDIBLY hot, and there&#x27;s a strange melting plastic smell....  I know hairdryers aren&#x27;t forever, but I certainly expected it to last more than 7 weeks!</li>
            <li> Broke after less than 10 uses and before it died completely it would overheat in minutes.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> No warm setting! Can&#x27;t use!</li>
            <li> Only worked for a few months, it now ONLY blows cold air. I will amend this review if the company works with me to replace or repair it.</li>
            <li> Wow,this dryer came in and I was so happy with the design and color of it.It also came in the nick of time as my much cheaper hair dryer had just went out.Believe me when I say this hair dryer is top of the line! Straight out of the box I noticed that it was light weight and had a sleek design.Upon use of this product I seen that it had several different settings as to get the desired drying time you&#x27;d like.It includes a diffuser to keep your hair from getting too overheated and dried out plus it has a reset and test button on the plug in.When I used this hair dryer I noticed that at the highest heat that the air is not super strong like some other hair dryers out there,but it definitely dries your hair in record time! This hair dryer is easy to hold on to whilst drying your hair and has a good vent on the back as to not clog up easily.I recommend this hair dryer to anyone looking for a new replacement because it work really well and is high quality for your money.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for purpose of review,all claims and views are 100 percent my own.</li>
            <li> This professional hair dryer came packaged beautifully making it perfect for giving as a gift for anyone who loves to do their hair. I&#x27;m obsessed with any hair product so I was so excited to get this product in the mail. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out! It is such a beautiful shade of blue. This hair dryer is 1500 watts which means it can dry your hair super quick. I have very thick and long hair. My hair comes down to my lower back. I was able to blow dry my hair with this dryer in about 15 minutes. That&#x27;s a pretty good time for my hair. It typically takes 20 to 25 minutes to blow dry my hair. I like that this dryer has the cool shot button. I always use this button when I&#x27;m done to give my hair a cool down and to lock in my hairstyle. The dryer also comes with a button for 3 speeds and 3 heat settings. Another feature that comes in handy is the concentrator nozzle. Occasionally I like to &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34; my hair and this attachment is a must to be able to achieve this style. Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with this hair dryer and would recommend this hair dryer to any of my friends or family.</li>
            <li> Used few times. Only problem is the end part of dryer keeps rotating so I am using without it.</li>
            <li> I was sent this to review for my blog, GlamRiver and to be honest I have never used a Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer before and I wasn&#x27;t sure about all the hype.  Well, I WISH I would&#x27;ve started using one a LONG time ago!  What a difference this hair dryer made!  With my old hair dryer my hair looked liked a big frizz ball after drying it but with this hair dryer my hair was TONS more smooth and not frizzy at all.  It was like magic!!  Seriously LOVE this hair dryer and I will never again go back! I also just purchased the Diffuser as well, I picked the Hot Pink, I think it will look really cool with the bright blue!  THANK YOU so much for introducing me to such an awesome Hair Dryer!! :)</li>
            <li> Love the lightweight design. Works great</li>
            <li> Can not enough about. Thought it was all BS about the ionic, tourmaline and ceramic features really having that much of an effect. OMG it is so true. I only tried this blow dryer because I wasn&#x27;t gonna spend good money on some features that probably are false. Even me going cheap worked. Do not waste your money on more powerful expensive brands. This will get the job done. You should never use above 1800W anyhow. Don&#x27;t forget to use cool burst all over head after drying as well. MIRACLE worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair usually takes 40 minutes plus With no brushing, which makes it take way longer.&lt;br /&gt;My previous dryer had way more W and blew harder.&lt;br /&gt;This dryer takes my hair 10-15 minutes (maybe) with brushing it out.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft and semi sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is extra coarse, dry, frizzy and THICK. This dryer made my hair wonderful. I was able to do things to my hair that I never have before because of it. So in love.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this blow dryer is so cheap price wise. I literally gave away my expensive ( $179 blow dryer after using this). I am actually upset I ever spent that much on a blow dryer when I could have originally just ordered the Rimini. Let me tell you I am so picky  when it comes to stuff  I use on my hair. My hair is my best feature ( I like to think ) and I am extremely careful on what I use on it.  I could not believe how light it was, it makes blow drying my hair fun and not a chore. Oh and its quite. ( no more waking my son up when I am getting ready, score!!! ) Usually my hair takes about 25 minutes to blow dry and with this I would say about 12 minutes the most * depending on what setting I use.  I use a great shampoo and conditioner along with a blow dry primer for my hair and I am telling you my frizz is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I love love love the cool burst button and please use after you are done because I am telling you your hair will look amazing.My hair looks healthy and I have never been happier. I am getting this as a gift for a hairdresser friend of mine, she used it yesterday and said it blew away the dryer she uses at her upscale salon.</li>
            <li> When I plugged in this dryer and used it the first time, I was absolutely amazed with how quickly it dried my hair, how well it straightened my naturally wavy hair, and how much shinier and healthier it made my hair look when I was done too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 4 minutes to dry my hair with my Xtava hair dryer, which is amazing for me! My hair is super long and super thick and usually takes 7 minutes at the fastest, especially when my hair is still pretty wet because I pretty much just got out of the shower. I was absolutely stunned by the drying time. In fact, it dried my hair faster than my much more expensive dryer I&#x27;ve been using for the last few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on the highest heat setting and and speed setting. You can dry it slower if you like, but I read somewhere awhile back that it&#x27;s better to dry on a higher speed and higher temp, and get the heat off your hair as quickly as possible, so thats just how I&#x27;ve always dried my hair. Plus I&#x27;m usually in a big hurry so this works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once dried, I then blasted my hair with the cool setting, which worked really great and really made my hair less frizzy and gave it instant shine and made it look healthier too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using this dryer the last week, I have also noticed my hair has been much less frizzier too, especially for this time of year! It&#x27;s so cold and dry here, my hair usually goes POOF! As soon as I walk out the door, but my hair has been surprisingly tame this week, I think in thanks to my new Xtava Blowdryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle so I can deliver lots of heat to one specific area. I didn&#x27;t always dry my hair this way until recently, but I&#x27;ve found it really dries your hair so much faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is also quite noticeably lightweight! I was surprised when I picked it up when I first opened the package. I love that you can hold it on your hair for several minutes and never get that tired, dead arm, from holding a heavy blowdryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this dryer is I wish the cord was a little bit longer, but that&#x27;s just because I move around the bathroom a lot doing stuff while drying my hair because I have ADD in the bathroom and can&#x27;t sit still just doing my hair! Otherwise, it has perfect reach for standing in front of the mirror and bending over to blast underneath your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely obsessed with this blowdryer, especially since it will only cost you $29 on Amazon, and completely rivals the uber expensive hair dryers on the market! And actually in my opinion, it&#x27;s better than my super expensive dryer, because it dries my hair in nearly HALF the time! Absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this dryer to everyone. Seriously ladies, stop wasting the big bucks on expensive hair dryers, this Xtava Rimini 1500W Iconic Hair Dryer will get the job done faster, and will leave your hair straighter, and feeling much healthier, and looking much shinier too! I&#x27;m completely impressed with this hair dryer and will be using it for many years to come!r get that tired, dead arm, from holding a heavy blowdryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this dryer is I wish the cord was a little bit longer, but that&#x27;s just because I move around the bathroom a lot doing stuff while drying my hair because I have ADD in the bathroom and can&#x27;t sit still just doing my hair!

            <li> Wonderful hair dryer thats a fantastic price. I love this one so much better than the way more expensive hair dryer I have because it will dry the hair fast has nice settings and will not burn the scalp like my pricey hair dryer does . This one is very easy to use and comes with a concentrator nozzle that you can use or not use its detaches easily. Trust me for the price this is a great hair dryer and so much nicer than my way way more expensive one is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Super light and easy to handle.  Dries fast and isn&#x27;t too loud.  A+++++</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is exactly what you expect. What really sets it apart is XTAVA customer service. I received follow- up emails making sure I am happy with the hair dryer.  I told Lucile I wished it had come with a diffuser, and she said there should be a new diffuser coming out in March that will fit that barrel. She then offered to send it to me when it comes out (also, they will soon have a new dryer on te market that will ship with a diffuser attachment)&lt;br /&gt;So, enjoy.  Great product, price, and customer service, all in a pretty package</li>
            <li> I love the sleek design, and color of this hair dryer for starters, but I had one I loved more. So, I gave this one to my mom. The ionic technology really plays a role in hair dryers, helping maintain, a healthy, beautiful shine.  No frizz, or elongated drying times here.  Three settings are perfect for drying, the shot of cool hair is wonderful as well. Or you can hold it down to dry your hair with cool hair. Perfect for setting curls.  This hair dryer is quitter than most, but its still a hair dryer, so its going to be noisy.  I really like it, the swivel cord makes it easier, so your not getting tangled in your own cord!  Product received for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this hair dryer. I like the design, it&#x27;s a little large, but it works perfectly fine and is comfortable to hold and does not tire my hand or wrist out since it takes a little time to dry my hair. It has a detachable nozzle which you can add on a diffuser if you have one. There are two switches at the bottom one is for the speed and turning on and off. The other one is for the heat setting to low medium and high heat. There is also a button for a cool burst of air to set your style so you can have minimal frizz. I have very long hair and it is easy to manage for me. It has a long cord which is great and also an emergency s*** off that pop if needed. I was sent this for review, however it does not affect my thoughts and unbiased opinions.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife and she loves it.  No complaints</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is soooo light and can dry my medium to heavy hair in about 5 minutes.  The only negative is that it is kind of large and difficult to store, but besides that, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The very first thing I noticed when I opened the box before even using this product, is that the Rimini 1500W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer by XTAVA is one of the lightest blow dryers that I have ever used. While the description stated &amp;#34;ultra lightweight,” I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to feel like a toy and it made me cynical about how well the product worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  This hair dryer is a great product for me.  I&#x27;m one of those people who isn&#x27;t a big fan of mornings and I leave myself barely enough time to get ready and get out the door to make it to work. Basically, my routine is to throw product on my hair, scramble around the house getting my breakfast and lunch together, grab some clothes and hope they match/fit, and then go back to the bathroom to finish up with my hair. My hair is pretty short but I tend to be pretty particular about it being a beauty school drop out and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends tease me about my &amp;#34;perfect hair&amp;#34; and my running friends razz me about my finish line photos due to the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t get messed up. In order to have that kind of hair, a good blow dryer is an important requirement. I had a blow dryer that I really liked so I was thinking that this one was just going to go in the extra guest bathroom for occasional use....... and then I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blow dryer has three heat levels and two power levels. It dried my hair so fast without ripping it all around and it was incredible. I couldn&#x27;t believe it and thought maybe it was a fluke or maybe I wasn&#x27;t really awake, but now that I&#x27;ve used it a week or so, I know it&#x27;s true.  This blow dryer ROCKS!  The &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; blow dryer went to the guest bathroom, and this one has replaced it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature that I like on the Rimini hair dryer is the Cold Shot Button. This is a great option for after I spray on the &amp;#34;freeze and shine&amp;#34; hairspray. I can use the Cold Shot to dry the spray without flattening my hair. The blow dryer also comes with a concentrator nozzle that allows you to focus the heat to the exact area you want to dry without blowing the rest of your hair all around, although I didn&#x27;t find the need to use this feature myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review - and I&#x27;m the lucky one here!dry the spray without flattening my hair. The blow dryer also comes with a concentrator nozzle that allows you to focus the heat to the exact area you want to dry without blowing the rest of your hair all around, although I didn&#x27;t find the need to use this feature myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review - and I&#x27;m the lucky one here!</li>
            <li> LOVING this Rimini Hair Dryer!! First off it is so chic looking and very appealing on my vanity stand. I blow dry my hair daily and this is so light weight and has such a strong kick in power. It normally takes me 45 minutes to dry my hair completely with my previous hair dryer which is a high end salon brand. This one has a strong blow and because it didn&#x27;t hurt my arms to hold for such extended periods of time I was able to completely dry my hair in 25 minutes!!! Saved me an extra 20 to style my hair with other tools. I recommend this Rimini dryer because of the great quality and light weight. It is salon quality and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Other pluses to this are that it has a long cord that didn&#x27;t tangle on me which was very convenient.</li>
            <li> Wow!  First and foremost, if you have long hair this is the Hair Dryer for you!  I have long hair and constantly fight with the air intake valve on my other hair dryers as they suck up my hair and it gets tangled up inside!  The Rimini by XTAVA  has mesh like metal over the air intake valve and cannot suck my hair into it. Secondly, it is powerful which is probably why it says professional in the name and oh SO quiet compared to all the other hair dryers I have used.  Third, it is light and the handle makes it so easy to use and to reach the different control buttons while you are still drying.  Love that it has a cold shot button to help &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my hair.  It comes with a control nozzle that fits very well and is easy to get off and on to precisely aim the air right where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I will tell you this is the best hair dryer that I have ever owned and it is aesthetically pretty too!  I won&#x27;t get into all the specs because you can read them above but it does have 3 heat settings and yes, I use them all during one drying and it has 2 speed settings plus the cold shot button.  It usually takes about 20 minutes to completely dry my hair and with this one it took about 12 minutes.  I did receive this to try in exchange for my honest review and I will honestly tell you that this hair dryer is awesome!</li>
            <li> great product exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I am very happy so far with this dryer.  The controls are easy to manipulate, even while drying and styling.  The slight downward tilt is actually genius as it is more ergonomic than regular dryers.  And the company, XTAVA, has reached out to me, expressing their desire that I am happy with their product and to please let them know if I have questions.  I find this very refreshing and impressive.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it very much; keep in mind that it is a big dryer so a small person may find it a bit big. Quick delivery; very good product.</li>
            <li> Loved the hair dryer when I first received, but stopped blowing hot air, only cool after just a few months, not sure if this is a typical problem, but very dissappointed with quality, would expect a hair dryer to last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 hair dryers at local stores and returned all three -- just not what I wanted.  I kept looking at the Rimini 1800W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic on Amazon -- it was the color that caught my eye first -- that beautiful blue.  After I returned the third dryer, I came back to the Rimini 1800W.  I liked the way the dryer angled down, the controls looked high enough up so I wouldn&#x27;t be changing the settings, and I especially loved the color!  Well, don&#x27;t let the color sway you.  I ordered the dryer, and it&#x27;s fabulous!  It&#x27;s full-sized, powerful, quiet, and my fingers don&#x27;t continually change the settings.  It takes me about 4 minutes to completely dry my shoulder-length, straight hair, and that&#x27;s at medium heat, high power.  I&#x27;m so pleased with this hair dryer, and did I mention that I love the beautiful blue color?</li>
            <li> I use this Rimini 1500W Tourmaline Ionic blow dryer for my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has very nappy hair. This dryer is a complete game-changer. Not only is the drying time cut in half (or less...), but it leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair super shiny and bouncy. This is the first time I haven&#x27;t had to  &amp;#34;touchups&amp;#34; with a flatrion after I blow dry her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re regularly blowing drying your hair, be it after a wash, or for the sake of blowing it out, you need this tool. Her stylist has noticed a major shift in her hair growth and health, and I feel like I have Rimini blow dryer to thank. If you&#x27;re on the fence, GET IT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I use it: Start by sectioning her hair into manageable sections with the Hold Me clips. Drying one section at a time, hold the hair taut with a brush while pointing the hair dryer nozzle down toward the hair. Continue with each section until your hair is dry, and then finish off the final style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use and believe will be good.</li>
            <li> I was glad my old blow dryer stopped working so I could finally get a nice, modern looking one (gray and black). However I ended up buying this basic blue one because of the reviews. They were all accurate. It dries my hair fairly quickly maybe because the temperature seems a little hotter than my last dryer. And I was blown away (pun intended) by how smooth it left my hair. I have straight hair, not thick or thin, just average.. I usually look like Lion King after blow drying my hair because I don&#x27;t brush it while drying but with this dryer my hair looks like if I used a straightener and a thick curling iron for the ends. I don&#x27;t know how it does it but I love it!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is a lifesaver!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick and healthy hair. I decided to bleach my hair a whopping 7 times in the past 4 months; although it&#x27;s surprisingly not really damaged, it takes a long time for my hair to dry. Hairdryers tend to be either too hot or too powerful, and a combination of both yields only atrocious results. I used Vidal Sassoon for a while but I wasn&#x27;t satisfied and the dryers died out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rimini 1500W is perfect. I love how you can customize what kind of blow dry you need; sometimes, I need a pretty powerful one if I&#x27;m rushing to go to work in the morning and it&#x27;s freezing outside. Other times, like when I go out on weekends, I like to use medium settings and use the cool button to set my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am so surprised by this blow dryer. It is extremely affordable, reliable, and customizable.</li>
            <li> Works well, I like combination of heat and speeds.</li>
            <li> Great so far. Very lightweight. Not hard to use, simple basic dryer,</li>
            <li> Super light. I have a problem on my wrist And usually have a hard time drying/styling my hair. This blow dryer made my hair work so much easier And painless. The power is great too! I would reccomend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer...for the two levels of intensity no matter what heat level.</li>
            <li> Pros: It is light and well balanced. If you are taller it might be a good dryer for you,    Cons: For the vertically challenged (I am 5&#x27;1\\&quot;) my arms were simply too short to use this dryer. Went back and found a compact dryer that will suit me better. Returning this one.</li>
            <li> Found it&#x27;s design to be too long and somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li> Great item.  Lightweight.  Very effective at drying the hair.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> FEELS VERY CHEAP.  THE NOZZLE CONSTANTLY FALLS OFF HAD TO TAPE IT.&lt;br /&gt;THE CORD IS VERY SHORT!! NOT COMFORTABLE TO HOLD.  WISH I RETURNED IT WHEN I FIRST GOT IT. :(</li>
            <li> Love it, has 3 settings and cool, warm and hot for drying hair. Works very nice. And low, med and high also.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing an ionic hair dryer, I used a high end, ordinary dryer. This ionic dryer suited my hair drying experince with phenominal results. My hair dries faster and it feels more healthy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this blow dryer based on ALL the great reviews I read on Amazon and the price was right.  I absolutely hate this blow dryer.  It is cumbersome to hold, it does NOT have all the bells and whistles that were talked about in the reviews.  Most dryers that have the ceramic ionic feature have it clearly marked.  One has to just assume that this dryer has it as there is no button or dial.  There was NO difference in my hair between this Rimini and a 12.00 cheapie I picked up as an inbetween dryer.  I will be returning this dryer and looking for a better one that indeed has the features bragged about.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer! It is lighter than my current one and more quiet. The cool shot button is great. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase! Thanks.</li>
            <li> Some people described this as being very light. I would say it&#x27;s normal. It doesn&#x27;t put out a ton of air and it doesn&#x27;t feel very hot, but it somehow gets my hair dry as fast as my old hair dryer, and that&#x27;s all I care about.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair very quickly and is very light weight.  Great hair dryer!</li>
            <li> This a very light blow dryer unlike others that I have owned. I love the way that it curves ensuring that the heat is going directly where it needs to go. I have a lot of hair and so does my daughter and its a hassle trying to get it done but I can honestly say that out hair dries in less than ten minutes!! im highly impressed and cant wait to try out more products from this company and let us not forget the color of this dryer!!! Its blue and I love it!! Packaging is lovely as well</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this hairdryer. My hairdryer gave out recently so I was on the hunt for a new one. I purchased one in the store for double this price and I was not satisfied with it. It left my hair frizzy. One of my favorite things about this hairdryer is the slanted handle. It fits perfectly in my hand and it&#x27;s just the right angle to dry my hair without twisting my hand. Another great thing about this hair is that it really does dry your faster. I am really amazed by how fast it dries your hair and does not leave you with a frizzy head. I can actually use the high speed and not make a mess of my hair. I love the 3 temperatures. Most hairdryers offer heat with the option of the cold button that you have to hold down. This hairdryer not only has the cold press button, but also high heat, low heat, and cool. So you don&#x27;t have to hold down the cold button because the cool button is cold enough. I like to start out on high heat all over then I divide my hair and use low heat. After drying is complete, I like to set my hair with the cool option. The concentrator nozzle is just the right size. You can also remove the screen on the back of the hairdryer for easy cleaning. This is an amazing hairdryer. I love that I got the opportunity to test this hairdryer in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I would definitely recommend this hairdryer!</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Good value.</li>
