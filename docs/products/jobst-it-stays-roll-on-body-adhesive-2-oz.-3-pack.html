            <li>Glad i bought this product.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to buying more.</li>
            <li>Great product to hold thigh high compression stockings in place!  </li>
            <li>I love it &amp; would recommend anyone needing a safe body adhesive to use this for their thigh highs, knee highs,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found I need to roll on the adhesive generously to allow the top band to stick to my skin, but it works - most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>The Jobst version is much better.  </li>
            <li>love this .</li>
            <li>have suggested to many.</li>
            <li>My step mother told me about this, and I am sure glad she did.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;It Stays&amp;#34; helps the support hose remain secure!  </li>
            <li>It works great, the garments really stay put and it doesn&#x27;t stain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>learned through trial and error that it is better to apply it on the seam of the leotard rather than the skin because when applied on the skin (and the garment affixed on top of it); it can give the appearance of wetness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this with socks and stockings as well as bandages and am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Not just support hose, but that strap that won&#x27;t stay or that top that that keeps moving to show more that you want.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this stuff, the price here is the part that I love compared to retail</li>
            <li>worked much better than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>sure the garment is where it is supposed to be an not taut.  </li>
            <li>So glad this product is on the market.</li>
            <li>Since I have to wear these forever at age 40 , I decided I better find a solution .</li>
            <li>but it costs more.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works :)</li>
            <li>Works great for holding up my thigh high compression stockings.  </li>
            <li>comes off very easily, we have been using baby wipes to clean the skin after the leotard comes off (when a shower is not immediately possible).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>has worked very well, good price also</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Water soluble for easy cleanup.</li>
            <li>washes off easy.</li>
            <li>and then washes off easily in the shower.</li>
            <li>It holds without pulling and washes away so easily.  </li>
            <li>It easily washes off when wanted.</li>
            <li>All days stocking holds up until I pull it off at night , it washes off easy .</li>
            <li>Washes off easy with water when your done for the day or night.</li>
            <li>so it always slides down), this adhesive is awesome.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me!</li>
            <li>The stain is not permanent but it is highly visible especially on light colors (our first experience was with an orange leotard).&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>but when it flairs up my legs get hugely swollen I can scoot my feet</li>
            <li>This is fantastic for securing a wig.</li>
            <li>The only time it doesn&#x27;t work too great is the summer when my job turns off our air conditioning.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many things, great product glad there is a place to buy it that has realistic pricing unlike the medical stores (DME).</li>
            <li>She wears JOBST special hose and this product keeps hose in place</li>
            <li>I have too wear special compression stocking on both legs &amp; do special mussages to help with the swelling.</li>
            <li>The glue seems to only be good at sticking skin to skin.</li>
            <li>Really glad I found it so reasonably priced on Amazon</li>
            <li>So far I have not been able to test that aspect of the product, but based on what I&#x27;ve said about removal, I&#x27;m pretty sure that could be problematic for some.  </li>
            <li>For me, I needed something quick to apply and held up.</li>
            <li>also seems the applicator mechanism has changed to allow a higher adhesive flow rate, which may be the root cause of the original leakage problem.</li>
            <li>It holds them up very well and comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Kind of expensive on a per bottle basis, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>like that standard kind of toxic glue.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to finally not have to lift straps off my arms all day long or to buy bras that cross over the shoulders but show with the cut of many blouses, dresses and shirts.</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>One full band of adhesive above the knee and one dab at the top of the thigh</li>
            <li>The only good thing was when I notified the company of a leaking bottle in the box, they sent TWO new bottles as replacements.</li>
            <li>I use it each time I wear knee high support hose and find that it keeps most knee high support hose in place.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware this product was available until I found a pharmacy selling knee high support hose and the Jobst Body Adhesive.   </li>
            <li>I use this stuff every single day &amp; it is just amazing my stockings stay in place till I take them off</li>
            <li>Just takes a few seconds to roll on and dries quickly so you can get on to more important things.  </li>
            <li>, I think it works great as long as you use it properly.</li>
            <li>The lowest layer of the wrapping stays exactly where I put</li>
            <li>- I was buying it locally but paying much more per bottle.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is intended to do.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely wonderful for preventing bra straps from slipping down.  </li>
            <li>Keeps stocking ups but runs out pretty fast.</li>
            <li>even tops that show a little more than you want!  </li>
            <li>after one use, every single one of them were swearing by this product and in love.</li>
            <li>They put this in plastic bottles and it leaks to the point you loose most of the product before you get to use it.  </li>
            <li>I figured it would be fine because after all it&#x27;s body adhesive, but I soon noticed red, dot-shaped marks on my skin and washed it off</li>
            <li>Stays\\&quot; a year ago and have been extremely pleased, and still have more than half a bottle left!</li>
            <li>this stuff works really well holds up my compression stockings all day</li>
            <li>Jobst Body Adhesive really  </li>
            <li>When applied liberally it really works.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>It really holds up my knee hight support hose that I must wear.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing the compression hose for awhile and this really helps the thigh highs stay up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have a clue where too buy it or how much it would cost.</li>
            <li>Unless you enjoy reliving your teenage years as it clogs pores overnight.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful since I have to wear medical thigh highs for poor circulation.</li>
            <li>With this product the hose stay up and my legs remain comfortable all day long.  </li>
            <li>Priced this product at several local medical supply stores &amp;amp; other sources &amp;amp; have found here at Amazon the best price.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I had used a similar product, which only worked most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I have to wear thigh high compression stockings at work.</li>
            <li>I use it exclusively to hold up thigh high compression stockings of 30-40 hg and 20-30 hg.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyplace you need a body adhesive.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I can count on it holding the thigh high stockings up every time.  </li>
            <li>If you have to wear compression stockings (mine is a thigh high</li>
            <li>Just be sure you buy the hose with the silicone  band as this won&#x27;t work on plain hose</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t stay up like they did when they were new</li>
            <li>It keeps them up all day and lasts longer than the generic versions due to a better bottle design.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent remedy to an age old issue of suport stockings falling!</li>
            <li>My first set of (doctor) supplied socks constantly slipped and I was hating life.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this as a last effort to keep my pretty costume.  </li>
            <li>The first and only time I tried the glue, I put some on in a sensitive area of my body.</li>
            <li>The adhesive is not messy.  </li>
            <li>some of the dancers expressed concern since they have sensitive skin and were worried about breaking out in a rash, but this never happened.  </li>
            <li>My compression socks are old</li>
            <li>You have to put a lot on in order for it to completely stick</li>
            <li>The picture shows it&#x27;s Jobst in what was an old style bottle.</li>
            <li>They have changed to a completely cylindrical container with frosted sides.</li>
            <li>As a professional Santa with a fake beard I&#x27;m always looking for a good way to attach my beard.</li>
            <li>It is the only way I can wear thigh high compression hose and have them stay up.  </li>
            <li>As a warning, if you stretch the stockings too far and then apply it, it will stick and you&#x27;ll get a welt as the stockings are pulling down and the glue is keeping them right</li>
            <li>I received three of the new containers with labels advertising some company with the same shape and design as Jobst.</li>
            <li>A one day test of the new stuff seemed to work, but I haven&#x27;t finished my last bottle I bought locally</li>
            <li>I am once again a very active outdoor person, hiking 3 to 10 miles every weekend through fields, brush and forest off trail in hot humid South Carolina.  </li>
            <li>Other reviews have mentioned that the adhesive doesn&#x27;t work very well if perspiration is an issue.  </li>
            <li>Having used it daily for a nearly a year, I could not imagine using it for theatrical makeup or effects; maybe on a wig, but</li>
            <li>I never thought to use it for the few things that its meant for &amp; it really does work like a charm!  </li>
            <li>I put a few dabs above my ankles and then right below my knees (front and back) and it does the trick!  </li>
            <li>wear thigh high stockings every day, this eliminates the need for any other support.</li>
            <li>I can now wear thin socks up to the top of the thigh and they don&#x27;t slip or wrinkle all day long.  </li>
            <li>Any residue left behind after removing stocking is easily removed with a dampened washcloth.  </li>
            <li>The only potential problem I am aware of is that sweating heavily could potentially dissolve the adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We use It Stays to keep thigh high support hose from sliding down.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes wear thigh high support hose which inevitably creep down.  </li>

            <li> The stain is not permanent but it is highly visible especially on light colors (our first experience was with an orange leotard).&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> but when it flairs up my legs get hugely swollen I can scoot my feet</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for securing a wig.</li>
            <li> The only time it doesn&#x27;t work too great is the summer when my job turns off our air conditioning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many things, great product glad there is a place to buy it that has realistic pricing unlike the medical stores (DME).</li>
            <li> She wears JOBST special hose and this product keeps hose in place</li>
            <li> I have too wear special compression stocking on both legs &amp; do special mussages to help with the swelling.</li>
            <li> The glue seems to only be good at sticking skin to skin.</li>
            <li> Really glad I found it so reasonably priced on Amazon</li>
            <li> So far I have not been able to test that aspect of the product, but based on what I&#x27;ve said about removal, I&#x27;m pretty sure that could be problematic for some.  </li>
            <li> For me, I needed something quick to apply and held up.</li>
            <li> also seems the applicator mechanism has changed to allow a higher adhesive flow rate, which may be the root cause of the original leakage problem.</li>
            <li> It holds them up very well and comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Kind of expensive on a per bottle basis, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> like that standard kind of toxic glue.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to finally not have to lift straps off my arms all day long or to buy bras that cross over the shoulders but show with the cut of many blouses, dresses and shirts.</li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> One full band of adhesive above the knee and one dab at the top of the thigh</li>
            <li> The only good thing was when I notified the company of a leaking bottle in the box, they sent TWO new bottles as replacements.</li>
            <li> I use it each time I wear knee high support hose and find that it keeps most knee high support hose in place.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware this product was available until I found a pharmacy selling knee high support hose and the Jobst Body Adhesive.   </li>
            <li> I use this stuff every single day &amp; it is just amazing my stockings stay in place till I take them off</li>
            <li> Just takes a few seconds to roll on and dries quickly so you can get on to more important things.  </li>
            <li> , I think it works great as long as you use it properly.</li>
            <li> The lowest layer of the wrapping stays exactly where I put</li>
            <li> - I was buying it locally but paying much more per bottle.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is intended to do.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely wonderful for preventing bra straps from slipping down.  </li>
            <li> Keeps stocking ups but runs out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> even tops that show a little more than you want!  </li>
            <li> after one use, every single one of them were swearing by this product and in love.</li>
            <li> They put this in plastic bottles and it leaks to the point you loose most of the product before you get to use it.  </li>
            <li> I figured it would be fine because after all it&#x27;s body adhesive, but I soon noticed red, dot-shaped marks on my skin and washed it off</li>
            <li> Stays\\&quot; a year ago and have been extremely pleased, and still have more than half a bottle left!</li>
            <li> this stuff works really well holds up my compression stockings all day</li>
            <li> Jobst Body Adhesive really  </li>
            <li> When applied liberally it really works.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> It really holds up my knee hight support hose that I must wear.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing the compression hose for awhile and this really helps the thigh highs stay up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have a clue where too buy it or how much it would cost.</li>
            <li> Unless you enjoy reliving your teenage years as it clogs pores overnight.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful since I have to wear medical thigh highs for poor circulation.</li>
            <li> With this product the hose stay up and my legs remain comfortable all day long.  </li>
            <li> Priced this product at several local medical supply stores &amp;amp; other sources &amp;amp; have found here at Amazon the best price.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I had used a similar product, which only worked most of the time.  </li>
            <li> I have to wear thigh high compression stockings at work.</li>
            <li> I use it exclusively to hold up thigh high compression stockings of 30-40 hg and 20-30 hg.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyplace you need a body adhesive.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can count on it holding the thigh high stockings up every time.  </li>
            <li> If you have to wear compression stockings (mine is a thigh high</li>
            <li> Just be sure you buy the hose with the silicone  band as this won&#x27;t work on plain hose</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t stay up like they did when they were new</li>
            <li> It keeps them up all day and lasts longer than the generic versions due to a better bottle design.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent remedy to an age old issue of suport stockings falling!</li>
            <li> My first set of (doctor) supplied socks constantly slipped and I was hating life.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this as a last effort to keep my pretty costume.  </li>
            <li> The first and only time I tried the glue, I put some on in a sensitive area of my body.</li>
            <li> The adhesive is not messy.  </li>
            <li> some of the dancers expressed concern since they have sensitive skin and were worried about breaking out in a rash, but this never happened.  </li>
            <li> My compression socks are old</li>
            <li> You have to put a lot on in order for it to completely stick</li>
            <li> The picture shows it&#x27;s Jobst in what was an old style bottle.</li>
            <li> They have changed to a completely cylindrical container with frosted sides.</li>
            <li> As a professional Santa with a fake beard I&#x27;m always looking for a good way to attach my beard.</li>
            <li> It is the only way I can wear thigh high compression hose and have them stay up.  </li>
            <li> As a warning, if you stretch the stockings too far and then apply it, it will stick and you&#x27;ll get a welt as the stockings are pulling down and the glue is keeping them right</li>
            <li> I received three of the new containers with labels advertising some company with the same shape and design as Jobst.</li>
            <li> A one day test of the new stuff seemed to work, but I haven&#x27;t finished my last bottle I bought locally</li>
            <li> I am once again a very active outdoor person, hiking 3 to 10 miles every weekend through fields, brush and forest off trail in hot humid South Carolina.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews have mentioned that the adhesive doesn&#x27;t work very well if perspiration is an issue.  </li>
            <li> Having used it daily for a nearly a year, I could not imagine using it for theatrical makeup or effects; maybe on a wig, but</li>
            <li> I never thought to use it for the few things that its meant for &amp; it really does work like a charm!  </li>
            <li> I put a few dabs above my ankles and then right below my knees (front and back) and it does the trick!  </li>
            <li> wear thigh high stockings every day, this eliminates the need for any other support.</li>
            <li> I can now wear thin socks up to the top of the thigh and they don&#x27;t slip or wrinkle all day long.  </li>
            <li> Any residue left behind after removing stocking is easily removed with a dampened washcloth.  </li>
            <li> The only potential problem I am aware of is that sweating heavily could potentially dissolve the adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We use It Stays to keep thigh high support hose from sliding down.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes wear thigh high support hose which inevitably creep down.  </li>
            <li> I ordered several at a time, which last a long time for me &amp;amp; save a bundle.</li>
            <li> There is a slight removal twinge -  somewhat like taking off a band-aid, but not uncomfortable at all, and well worth the uncomfortable feeling of having your knee high hose roll down your leg.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking the roll on application would make it easy, and it did, unfortunately the product was not tacky enough to attach the beard.</li>
            <li> my husband works outside all day in the heat in florida sweats and this still keeps his comprestion stocking from slipping off his leg</li>
            <li> Keeps my Mom&#x27;s stockings up all day long.</li>
            <li> I will keep ordering this on here as long as they have it</li>
            <li> Before this product I was ready to give up the support hose even though the doctor wanted me to wear them because the hose would roll down my leg cutting off my blood supply in my leg and causing more trouble than I could handle.  </li>
            <li> By their nature they want to slip down and there is only one point of adhesion, the rubber strip put on the sock at the upper thigh.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is with the new container.  </li>
            <li> closed toe couldn&#x27;t keep the top of them from sliding down my leg which again is uncomfortable &amp; will cut your circulation off.</li>
            <li> (If it happens I just wash the cap and bottle in running water, dry with a paper towel, and store upright when not in use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it regularly to keep my compression stockings from rolling or sliding down.  </li>
            <li> The most miserable I&#x27;ve been was when walking back into the hospital for a checkup, from the end of the parking lot where the sock started slipping, through the large lobby where my leg was swelling up, up the elevator where I could not adjust the sock and then desperately looking for a bathroom close enough to the doctor&#x27;s office such that I could pull it back up and the sock wouldn&#x27;t slip much before I found a chair to sit in.  </li>
            <li> Before trying this product bandages would slide down my large calves to my narrow ankles in a few hours of exercise.</li>
            <li> Generally only a little bit is required.</li>
            <li> it is great, but this brand is terrible.  </li>
            <li> I was bandaging my legs every few hours, but now have to do it only two or three times a day.</li>
            <li> It works just as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with falling bra straps due to the shape of my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I have to wear compression stockings due to a circulation problem.</li>
            <li> the glue had already burned into my skin (within 15 minutes of use) and left small dot-shaped cuts that have still not fully healed.</li>
            <li> I have to wear a compression sock due to DVT.  </li>
            <li> The breast form won&#x27;t stick to my chest but my fingers stick to each other.</li>
            <li> It comes off skin without effort and washes out of bandaged, socks, stockings, and other clothes without residue, stains, or discoloration.</li>
            <li> I have also used it for other clothing &amp;#34;fixes&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Would order again and recommend to other people.</li>
            <li> loss of adhesion due to sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy peel off when you want to take the stockings off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For years, I \\&quot;fought\\&quot; with knee high hose \\&quot;roll-down\\&quot;!  (not a pleasant feeling)!  </li>
            <li> I was having a problem with the stockings rolling or sliding down my leg.</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my compression socks from sliding down my leg.</li>
            <li> Holds my hose up and don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling down.</li>
            <li> I even had a skirt that insisted on sliding down in front</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t roll or slip down into shoes.</li>
            <li> The issue of stockings sliding down is solved with this Jobst product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep them down on my feet</li>
            <li> Makes a mess.</li>
            <li> I roll a little on under the bra strap and it stays in place all day.  </li>
            <li> It leaks and gets all sticky down the sides, even to the bottom where it sits!  </li>
            <li> The roll-on part can be a bit messy</li>
            <li> Jobst body adhesive lets me wear a breathable thin compression sock turned inside out such that the rubber strip doesn&#x27;t rub the skin.  </li>
            <li> After 11 months of use three times a day I have barely broken into my third bottle.</li>
            <li> I walk for 7 hours a day and by hour 5 it has to be adjusted a few times an hour.</li>
            <li> that is what i found out the hard way when they rolled down.</li>
            <li> SLOPPY &amp; DIDN&#x27;T STICK VERY LONG</li>
            <li> prior to using this product I was unable to keep my compression sock up for even an hour after putting it on.</li>
            <li> I should give a 4 star for the shady label, but I think it&#x27;s just a marketing gimmick and not some knockoff.</li>
            <li> I have very few issues with it.</li>
            <li> but it was too late-</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible in my opinion and although you might not have any problems with it, be very careful about putting it in a sensitive area.</li>
            <li> One swipe on my shoulder with &amp;#34;It Stays&amp;#34; and the strap never slips down, which I find extremely annoying.</li>
            <li> This product keeps them where I want them so they don&#x27;t bunch up and get uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this glue working for me.</li>
            <li> If you get it somewhere it will show, it will will hold onto lint and dirt and leave a dirty spot.  </li>
            <li> they keep pushing up toward my heal which is then very uncomfortable &amp; will cut off circulation when I got</li>
            <li> It smells really bad-</li>
            <li> it was awful!</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s not an outrageous price.</li>
            <li> Product sent, Compression brand is terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this stuff works really well holds up my compression stockings all day</li>
            <li> I love this product. I wear support stockings to work because of the flooring. This product keeps them where I want them so they don&#x27;t bunch up and get uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Great item and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Keeps stocking ups but runs out pretty fast. Wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Glad i bought this product. Works just like it says. Looking forward to buying more.</li>
            <li> SLOPPY &amp; DIDN&#x27;T STICK VERY LONG</li>
            <li> I have to wear thigh high compression stockings at work. This stuff keeps them up all day on a 12 hour shift.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the stockings without this stuff.</li>
            <li> The bottle did not have the brand name of Jobst. It had a generic &amp;#34;it stays&amp;#34; logo. I believe I was mislead as the website showed the brand name bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product to hold thigh high compression stockings in place!  Just takes a few seconds to roll on and dries quickly so you can get on to more important things.  Any residue left behind after removing stocking is easily removed with a dampened washcloth.  Other reviews have mentioned that the adhesive doesn&#x27;t work very well if perspiration is an issue.  So far I have not been able to test that aspect of the product, but based on what I&#x27;ve said about removal, I&#x27;m pretty sure that could be problematic for some.  (Thus the 4 rather than 5 stars)</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a totally strapless silicone bra that I had purchased in case the self-adhesive wore off with use.  This stuff is AWESOME &amp; can be used for SO MUCH MORE!  I never thought to use it for the few things that its meant for &amp; it really does work like a charm!  I love it &amp; would recommend anyone needing a safe body adhesive to use this for their thigh highs, knee highs, even tops that show a little more than you want!  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware this product was available until I found a pharmacy selling knee high support hose and the Jobst Body Adhesive.   For years, I \\&quot;fought\\&quot; with knee high hose \\&quot;roll-down\\&quot;!  (not a pleasant feeling)!  After using the product, I became a \\&quot;believer\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve found I need to roll on the adhesive generously to allow the top band to stick to my skin, but it works - most of the time.  I use it each time I wear knee high support hose and find that it keeps most knee high support hose in place.  There is a slight removal twinge -  somewhat like taking off a band-aid, but not uncomfortable at all, and well worth the uncomfortable feeling of having your knee high hose roll down your leg.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom.  She loves it for holding up her stockings.  I kept one for myself.  It truly does the job.  The roll-on part can be a bit messy but the hold is in place until you peel off your socks.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with falling bra straps due to the shape of my shoulders.  I roll a little on under the bra strap and it stays in place all day.  I also use it to keep Peds shoe liner socks in place at the heel area.  This stuff is amazing.  It cleans up with water and does not stain fabric</li>
            <li> They put this in plastic bottles and it leaks to the point you loose most of the product before you get to use it.  The old glass bottles were the best and did not leak.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time now, and have a bit of experience with it.  I use it exclusively to hold up thigh high compression stockings of 30-40 hg and 20-30 hg.  It works well.  I have very few issues with it. Since it is water soluble, if you sweat a lot it may not hold well.  If you don&#x27;t use enough, it may not hold through the day (exacerbated by sweating).  If you get it somewhere it will show, it will will hold onto lint and dirt and leave a dirty spot.  And very occasionally I get a bottle that seeps a bit and will make the cap and threads sticky.  (If it happens I just wash the cap and bottle in running water, dry with a paper towel, and store upright when not in use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried body tape and it does not work as well as this roll on adhesive.The best price I have found is here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive on a per bottle basis, but it works great.  I have thigh-high compression stockings which would not stay up. I tried various clips and belts, but nothing would work. Even though I do a lot of walking, this stuff keeps them on.  I&#x27;ve used it for a month and am halfway through a bottle.</li>
            <li> speedy delivery...as advertised</li>
            <li> As a professional Santa with a fake beard I&#x27;m always looking for a good way to attach my beard. I bought this thinking the roll on application would make it easy, and it did, unfortunately the product was not tacky enough to attach the beard. For me, I needed something quick to apply and held up. This did not work out for me at all.</li>
            <li> Every thing as advertised. Excellent speed in getting product to us. Been using It Stays for years and this was a good find for price and service.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on compression stockings.  It keeps them up all day and lasts longer than the generic versions due to a better bottle design.</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY WITH IT!  Easy to apply and easy to remove. Remains effective all day and evening.  I have used the glue for over 5 years</li>
            <li> Better then body tape!</li>
            <li> I have to wear compression stockings due to a circulation problem. Jobst It Stays Roll-on Body Adhesive is great for keeping the stocking where they need to be. I was having a problem with the stockings rolling or sliding down my leg. Not any more. I have suggested this product to several others and they all seem to like it as well. Two thumbs up for It Stays!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product and it works as advertised.  Water soluble for easy cleanup. Great for venous support devices.  Highly recommended for anyplace you need a body adhesive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to find a body/skin adhesive that I could experiment with putting on my skin and holding my skin in place. The first and only time I tried the glue, I put some on in a sensitive area of my body. I figured it would be fine because after all it&#x27;s body adhesive, but I soon noticed red, dot-shaped marks on my skin and washed it off but it was too late- the glue had already burned into my skin (within 15 minutes of use) and left small dot-shaped cuts that have still not fully healed. It began bleeding and eventually started scabbing- it was awful! This was 2 weeks ago and I am still waiting for the cuts to heal. This stuff is horrible in my opinion and although you might not have any problems with it, be very careful about putting it in a sensitive area. I would not buy it and look for something hypoallergenic instead. I should have judged it by the smell it has, before I put it on. It smells really bad- like that standard kind of toxic glue. Trust me, do not buy it!</li>
            <li> It works but is time consuming to use every day.</li>
            <li> Jobst Body Adhesive really  works.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 3  so that I can have it for travel, home and work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diana</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my compression socks from sliding down my leg. It works perfectly. It is water soluble. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We use It Stays to keep thigh high support hose from sliding down.  When applied liberally it really works. thanks</li>
            <li> I had used a similar product, which only worked most of the time.  The Jobst version is much better.  I can count on it holding the thigh high stockings up every time.  As another reviewer mentioned it is also good for holding bras in place.  I would definitely buy this again.  It removes easily with just warm water.</li>
            <li> love this . wear thigh high stockings every day, this eliminates the need for any other support. washes off easy. have suggested to many.</li>
            <li> I use this product because I have rounded shoulders and straps do not stay up - bras, slips or camisoles. But they sure do if I use this product!  It is wonderful to finally not have to lift straps off my arms all day long or to buy bras that cross over the shoulders but show with the cut of many blouses, dresses and shirts.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says.  I use it to hold my bra straps in place.  Couldn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> My step mother told me about this, and I am sure glad she did.  &amp;#34;It Stays&amp;#34; helps the support hose remain secure!  The adhesive is not messy.  I will continue to order this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent remedy to an age old issue of suport stockings falling!</li>
            <li> I have to wear a compression sock due to DVT.  Thigh length compression socks are a pain.  By their nature they want to slip down and there is only one point of adhesion, the rubber strip put on the sock at the upper thigh.  My first set of (doctor) supplied socks constantly slipped and I was hating life.  The most miserable I&#x27;ve been was when walking back into the hospital for a checkup, from the end of the parking lot where the sock started slipping, through the large lobby where my leg was swelling up, up the elevator where I could not adjust the sock and then desperately looking for a bathroom close enough to the doctor&#x27;s office such that I could pull it back up and the sock wouldn&#x27;t slip much before I found a chair to sit in.  Jobst body adhesive has been a life(style) saver.  I can now wear thin socks up to the top of the thigh and they don&#x27;t slip or wrinkle all day long.  I am once again a very active outdoor person, hiking 3 to 10 miles every weekend through fields, brush and forest off trail in hot humid South Carolina.  Jobst body adhesive lets me wear a breathable thin compression sock turned inside out such that the rubber strip doesn&#x27;t rub the skin.  One full band of adhesive above the knee and one dab at the top of the thigh and I am off.  I thank God for this product.  I am happy again.</li>
            <li> The glue seems to only be good at sticking skin to skin. The breast form won&#x27;t stick to my chest but my fingers stick to each other. The only good thing was when I notified the company of a leaking bottle in the box, they sent TWO new bottles as replacements. Very nice of them. Lucky for me! I now have four bottles of glue to stick my fingers together!</li>
            <li> My daughter is a rhythmic gymnast and I bought this glue hoping that it would keep her leotard bottoms in place during contortions and acrobatics. It works great, the garments really stay put and it doesn&#x27;t stain.&lt;br /&gt;I learned through trial and error that it is better to apply it on the seam of the leotard rather than the skin because when applied on the skin (and the garment affixed on top of it); it can give the appearance of wetness. The stain is not permanent but it is highly visible especially on light colors (our first experience was with an orange leotard).&lt;br /&gt;It comes off very easily, we have been using baby wipes to clean the skin after the leotard comes off (when a shower is not immediately possible).&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product, I think it works great as long as you use it properly.</li>
            <li> Beats the price at the Pharmancy</li>
            <li> my husband works outside all day in the heat in florida sweats and this still keeps his comprestion stocking from slipping off his leg he is very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It is absolutely wonderful for preventing bra straps from slipping down.  One swipe on my shoulder with &amp;#34;It Stays&amp;#34; and the strap never slips down, which I find extremely annoying.</li>
            <li> I must wrap my legs with compression bandages every day. Before trying this product bandages would slide down my large calves to my narrow ankles in a few hours of exercise. I bought three bottles of \\&quot;It Stays\\&quot; a year ago and have been extremely pleased, and still have more than half a bottle left! I was bandaging my legs every few hours, but now have to do it only two or three times a day. The lowest layer of the wrapping stays exactly where I put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adhesive is water soluble. It comes off skin without effort and washes out of bandaged, socks, stockings, and other clothes without residue, stains, or discoloration. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it pulling on hair or skin. The roll-on applicator works like a charm. The only potential problem I am aware of is that sweating heavily could potentially dissolve the adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this with socks and stockings as well as bandages and am extremely pleased with the results. Generally only a little bit is required. After 11 months of use three times a day I have barely broken into my third bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used It Stays for years and it works well for me, but all three bottles leaked in transit, losing about 10 % in volume.&lt;br /&gt;It also seems the applicator mechanism has changed to allow a higher adhesive flow rate, which may be the root cause of the original leakage problem.</li>
            <li> The product works well.  My only complaint is with the new container.  It leaks and gets all sticky down the sides, even to the bottom where it sits!  Yuck!  Makes a mess.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It is the only way I can wear thigh high compression hose and have them stay up.  Just be sure you buy the hose with the silicone  band as this won&#x27;t work on plain hose</li>
            <li> This is a great product for holding clothing in place. Not just support hose, but that strap that won&#x27;t stay or that top that that keeps moving to show more that you want. My wife loves this stuff, the price here is the part that I love compared to retail</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for using with compression stockings.  It holds them up very well and comfortably.  Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend</li>
            <li> I order this from this seller all of the time. The price is the best ive seen for the quantity you receive. Will order again soon .</li>
            <li> I sometimes wear thigh high support hose which inevitably creep down.  This adhesive prevents that and then washes off easily in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works Great, excellent Product</li>
            <li> ALWAYS DOES THE JOB RIGHT</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for the dancers in our spring dance concert for their leotards and dance trunks. after one use, every single one of them were swearing by this product and in love. even after reapplying for costume changes for subsequent dances, it held.  some of the dancers expressed concern since they have sensitive skin and were worried about breaking out in a rash, but this never happened.  i will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> worked much better than I anticipated.  keeps my compression sock in place all day.  prior to using this product I was unable to keep my compression sock up for even an hour after putting it on.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this glue working for me. I work in a factory where you never stop moving and sweat is an every day thing, I did not think this glue would help my compression stockings stay put since it is water dissolvable. But it has done a great job keeping them in place. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for securing a wig. It washes off with water and takes the worry of losing my wig away.</li>
            <li> Holds my hose up and don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling down.Also can be used to hold bra straps in place.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  Our gymnasts leos seem to ride up on all our girls and with this it doesn&#x27;t!!!!!</li>
            <li> This adhesive works. I use it for support stockings.  As a warning, if you stretch the stockings too far and then apply it, it will stick and you&#x27;ll get a welt as the stockings are pulling down and the glue is keeping them right where you thought you wanted them to be.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years and it has always worked!</li>
            <li> My compression socks are old so they don&#x27;t stay up like they did when they were new so I tried  the Jobst it stays and it works great. I am allergic to some achieves, so I did know if I could use it, but it is great. If you have problems with anything to stay were you what it try this.  IT DOES WORK.</li>
            <li> Product works well at keeping thigh-high support stockings in place throughout the day.  Washes out of socks and off thighs easily with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> This is a great Adhesive, the stockings stay in place day and night.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this - it works wonders on holding up my knee-hi compression hose.  I put a few dabs above my ankles and then right below my knees (front and back) and it does the trick!  It holds without pulling and washes away so easily.  Really glad I found it so reasonably priced on Amazon - I was buying it locally but paying much more per bottle.</li>
            <li> I have to wear surgical stocking because of vericose veins in both of my legs &amp;amp; knew of this product from when I was in the medical field. Can not recommend this product enough for those who must wear stockings &amp;amp; have problems with them staying up. I do a lot outdoors &amp;amp; walking with my dog &amp;amp; couldn&#x27;t get thru any of it without this adhesive. Priced this product at several local medical supply stores &amp;amp; other sources &amp;amp; have found here at Amazon the best price. I ordered several at a time, which last a long time for me &amp;amp; save a bundle.</li>
            <li> It worked like it was meant to</li>
            <li> I use it regularly to keep my compression stockings from rolling or sliding down.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin or the material.  I have also used it for other clothing &amp;#34;fixes&amp;#34;  Hold bra straps in place, keeps tube tops up.  I even had a skirt that insisted on sliding down in front and I glued it in place. I gave it as a stocking stuffer at Christmas to my female relatives one year.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works just as I expected. Would order again and recommend to other people. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a dance number because my leotard kept creeping up and exposing my rear and on one occasion exposed my \\&quot;kitty.\\&quot;  So I bought this as a last effort to keep my pretty costume.  It worked amazing.  Everything stayed in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Use it about an inch under the area you wish to keep covered.  For me this meant gluing the leotard to my butt cheek to keep it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.make sure the garment is where it is supposed to be an not taut.  ie. don&#x27;t try to stretch the fabric and hope this will hold it because it won&#x27;t hold that well.</li>
            <li> It easily washes off when wanted. This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve used for 20 years. Don&#x27;t know of alternatives to compare to.</li>
            <li> has worked very well, good price also</li>
            <li> Keeps my Mom&#x27;s stockings up all day long.</li>
            <li> It really holds up my knee hight support hose that I must wear.  Before this product I was ready to give up the support hose even though the doctor wanted me to wear them because the hose would roll down my leg cutting off my blood supply in my leg and causing more trouble than I could handle.  With this product the hose stay up and my legs remain comfortable all day long.  So glad this product is on the market.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the compression hose for awhile and this really helps the thigh highs stay up.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> use this to keep husbands socks up when wearing his work boots. also use when I wear support socks so they don&#x27;t roll or slip down into shoes.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Couldn&#x27;t wear my compression stockings without it</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many things, great product glad there is a place to buy it that has realistic pricing unlike the medical stores (DME).</li>
            <li> Product does what it was designed for.  My wife had problems with veins in her legs. She wears JOBST special hose and this product keeps hose in place</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful since I have to wear medical thigh highs for poor circulation. You have to put a lot on in order for it to completely stick that is what i found out the hard way when they rolled down.</li>
            <li> If you need to wear compression stocking you must buy this now . Every day all day I was pulling mine up . Since I have to wear these forever at age 40 , I decided I better find a solution . I read reviews and went with this . All days stocking holds up until I pull it off at night , it washes off easy . The 3 pack lasted a year with 5 dAy a week use .</li>
            <li> used this brand before, excellent product</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, good quality, good price, good shipping.</li>
            <li> I wear compression stockings for circulatory issue in the legs.  The issue of stockings sliding down is solved with this Jobst product.  Washes out simply with water.  Life saver for me.</li>
            <li> I have lymphedema in my legs. I don&#x27;t know how too explain what it is but when it flairs up my legs get hugely swollen I can scoot my feet but I can&#x27;t pick them up too walk. I have too wear special compression stocking on both legs &amp; do special mussages to help with the swelling. If I get open toe stockings I can&#x27;t keep them down on my feet they keep pushing up toward my heal which is then very uncomfortable &amp; will cut off circulation when I got closed toe couldn&#x27;t keep the top of them from sliding down my leg which again is uncomfortable &amp; will cut your circulation off. The lymphedema therapist told me too try garment glue. Didn&#x27;t have a clue where too buy it or how much it would cost. I seen this on here I tried it &amp; it helps. I use this stuff every single day &amp; it is just amazing my stockings stay in place till I take them off &amp; it doesn&#x27;t hurt or stay sticky when I take them off. I will keep ordering this on here as long as they have it &amp; it&#x27;s not an outrageous price. You can too the Jobst site too get this too but it costs more.</li>
            <li> Not Jobst it stays as advertised.  Product sent, Compression brand is terrible.  I have used Jobst It Stays for 16 years and it is great, but this brand is terrible.  It smells, and doesn&#x27;t hold the stocking up as well as the Jobst Brand. Jobst should not be advertised as the product unless it is the actual product being sold.</li>
            <li> Never used a product like this before, but a girlfriend from work recommended it.  So great!!!! Couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works :)</li>
            <li> The picture shows it&#x27;s Jobst in what was an old style bottle. They have changed to a completely cylindrical container with frosted sides. I received three of the new containers with labels advertising some company with the same shape and design as Jobst. A one day test of the new stuff seemed to work, but I haven&#x27;t finished my last bottle I bought locally so I have yet to use further. I should give a 4 star for the shady label, but I think it&#x27;s just a marketing gimmick and not some knockoff. If you have to wear compression stockings (mine is a thigh high so it always slides down), this adhesive is awesome. The only time it doesn&#x27;t work too great is the summer when my job turns off our air conditioning. I walk for 7 hours a day and by hour 5 it has to be adjusted a few times an hour. It&#x27;s still night and day compared to no glue at all. Having used it daily for a nearly a year, I could not imagine using it for theatrical makeup or effects; maybe on a wig, but the minute sweat hits it, it starts to breakdown. Also wash it off thoroughly with lots of water before bed. Unless you enjoy reliving your teenage years as it clogs pores overnight.</li>
            <li> realy works .i have lymphedema and my stocking would&#x27;nt stay up. I was to my end and I save this a shot  it keeps them up .</li>
            <li> This body adhesive in a roll-on is just what I needed to keep my Jobst support stockings from creeping and needing adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minimal loss of adhesion due to sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy peel off when you want to take the stockings off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how it works but it is a wonderful product.  Does exactly what it is intended to do.  It is used to keep suppression hose thigh hi slippery, slidey, baggy hose in place.  It does the job!</li>
            <li> Works great for holding up my thigh high compression stockings.  Washes off easy with water when your done for the day or night.</li>
