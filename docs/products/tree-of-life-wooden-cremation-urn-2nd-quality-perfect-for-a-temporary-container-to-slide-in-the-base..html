            <li> There was plenty of room inside (average sized adult).  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I needed the first one for my son who died unexpectedly.  </li>
            <li> , feels hand-planed, the wood is dry and there are nail holes in the edges of the &amp;#34;tree&amp;#34; side.  </li>
            <li> Urn is poor quality and you really have to struggle with the bottom to get it open.</li>
            <li> In total it took about one week to ship - it would be nice if there was an option to ship faster, but that was not an option and the shipping company could not make the item get here faster, which was annoying.</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> I recommend trying the other company that sells a comparable Tree of Life Urn.  </li>
            <li> Only a suggestion get engraving in black otherwise hard to see.</li>
            <li> After ordering this Tree of Life urn, I was nervous knowing it was being shipped because I was afraid of how much sadness would surround it&#x27;s arrival.  </li>
            <li> It is uneven</li>
            <li> I had to leave it outdoors for a few weeks to get rid of some of the odor.</li>
            <li> I do not have the time or inclination to mess with returning the urn and this is what happens when you choose the less expensive option.  </li>
            <li> trying to sound gruesome here</li>
            <li> : Shipping was a bit slow, the urn came 2 days before the funeral.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so sorry you&#x27;re in the position to being shopping for something like this~such a hard time.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this piece.</li>

            <li> This wooden urn met my expectations.  It was made of wood, had a lovely tree of life carving on one side, and it was large enough to fit the plastic urn containing the family member&#x27;s ashes.  It was also very reasonably priced and it arrived farily quicly.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I like this urn very much although I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it yet. I see it as more of a temporary condominium than a resting place however.&lt;br /&gt;When the time comes I shall use it to carry my cremains to their final resting place and then who ever wants it can do what they wish with it. Change the way it opens and you&#x27;ve got a decent and an attractive storrage box.&lt;br /&gt;Not trying to sound gruesome here but the cremains do come in a plastic container which fits inside this box/urn.&lt;br /&gt;This urn is supposed to be safe to fly on aircraft also. Not that I&#x27;ll notice of course but just sayin&#x27; is all.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for something you&#x27;ll only use or need for a short time..</li>

            <li> It is a beautiful box and my dads ashes fit perfectly.  It is solidly made and makes a lovely presentation.  I added a brass engraved plaque to the front and sat it in a circular flower arrangement at the funeral.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just as described. Fit and finish exceeds expectations , especially at this price point. I think Mom would be pleased.</li>

            <li> It was not an easy task but when my uncle passed we needed an urn. I turned to Amazon of course because they are reliable. I found this urn from the Urn Co. and showed it to my family. They all loved the design and it was at a reasonable price. When the urn arrived it was more beautiful than the picture. My mother and family all felt this was the right urn for my uncle. I am very happy with my purchase and would buy again if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Shipping was a bit slow, the urn came 2 days before the funeral. In total it took about one week to ship - it would be nice if there was an option to ship faster, but that was not an option and the shipping company could not make the item get here faster, which was annoying. But it did get here in time for the funeral.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this urn it is beautiful, I&#x27;m hoping it is air travel worthy because I&#x27;m planning a trip and I would like to take it with me.</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected. Packed well. Urns (we ordered 2) are beautiful, quality workmanship and plenty big enough for adult remains. All-in-all, a good purchase and we are very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It exceeded my expectations ... My husband passed and I was looking for the perfect container.  I was thrilled to see the possibility offered.  The urn arrived and quadruple wowowowow it was magnificent!  My beloved is on my mantel: honored and admired!  I sincerely thank you for offering the product ...</li>
            <li> Choosing something like an Urn can an incredibly overwhelming responsibility. The unexpected deaths of both of my parents has devastated me to my core and I&#x27;ve waited a very long time to begin the search for the perfect resting place for the most important people in my life.  I am so grateful The Urn Co. is affiliated with Amazon. Their product line offers so many beautiful and tasteful choices. After ordering this Tree of Life urn, I was nervous knowing it was being shipped because I was afraid of how much sadness would surround it&#x27;s arrival.  Amazingly, the opposite happened. I received the urn yesterday and as I unwrapped it, a sense of peace washed over me. The urn is truly exquisite and I knew instantly I made the perfect choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so sorry you&#x27;re in the position to being shopping for something like this~such a hard time. ;-(  Please know that your experience with The Urn Co will be seamless from start to finish.  They contacted me after ordering via email and I was able to communicate directly with the owner.  The process turned something really emotionally draining into this. I never write reviews but am so appreciative that I really wanted to express my gratitude and share my experience with others. Good luck in your search for the perfect urn. Peace &amp; Blessings!</li>
            <li> Beautiful carving. Elegant &amp; respectful.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace the one I bought for my mother last year after she was diagnosed with lung cancer.  Sadly, I needed the first one for my son who died unexpectedly.  The replacement was just as beautiful and well made as the first one.  Mom passed away recently and when I gave it to the funeral home, the director was impressed with the quality of this box. (believe me, she thoroughly inspected it) I plan to purchase two more of these boxes for me and my wonderful spouse.</li>
            <li> The urn arrived on time and was very lovely. A beautiful place for mom to rest before we scatter her cremanes.</li>
            <li> was very nice for the price</li>
            <li> This is a very handsome box with a cheerful, laser-cut, tree design on the front.  I am not entirely sure what other reviewers mean by &amp;#34;plastic container&amp;#34;; the funeral home returned our loved one&#x27;s ashes in a plastic bag inside of a cardboard box, inside of a paper-, department store type bag.  I moved the ashes, still in the plastic bag into this box.  There was plenty of room inside (average sized adult).  I like this much better than one of the more familiar metal canisters, but that is a personal opinion.  PS -- Sorry for your loss.</li>
            <li> Nice looking urn. Just hope I don&#x27;t have to use it for awhile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected Love it!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and Dad&#x27;s ashes fit perfectly.  Thank you.  God bless you.</li>
            <li> This was an unbelievable quick delivery. Everything was as stated and at an incredible price. Kudos to The UrnCo!!!</li>
            <li> We are so very pleased with this purchase from this seller.  I was expecting shipping to take more than a week, and instead it arrived in 2 days.  The design is lovely, and we see nothing but first quality workmanship.  I am thrilled to be able to place my sister&#x27;s remains in something so special and well done, and to have been fiscally responsible at the same time.  For the price, this can&#x27;t be beat and we are, as I said, delighted with this purchase.  I recommend the product and the seller without reservation,  Thank you to all of you at The Urn Company.</li>
            <li> Great company thank you beautiful plaque and urn the plastic urn from mortuary fit perfectly. The carving is beautiful along with the wood.  Only a suggestion get engraving in black otherwise hard to see.</li>
            <li> Wooden Cremation Urn - Adult Size - Tree of Life was just the right size and the details are Bueatiful. My son and sister will rest nicely in them. I bought Two of them.</li>
            <li> The circumstance under which one needs this product are never good but I am grateful to have found it. We didn&#x27;t want an urn that looked like a traditional urn. This one is simple yet absolutely beautiful. The carving is very meaningful to us as we try to see death as part of the cycle of life and having it made of wood adds to that symbology. Everyone has commented on how lovely it is. And the delivery was very fast and efficient. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Urn is poor quality and you really have to struggle with the bottom to get it open. It is uneven, feels hand-planed, the wood is dry and there are nail holes in the edges of the &amp;#34;tree&amp;#34; side.  I do not have the time or inclination to mess with returning the urn and this is what happens when you choose the less expensive option.  They did send a very sweet package of wildflower seeds to spread with the ashes.  I recommend trying the other company that sells a comparable Tree of Life Urn.  It came quickly via USPS.</li>
            <li> This box is of exceptional quality for the price, the shipping was fast, and the remembrance of wild flower seeds inside the carton, was very touching.  Highly recommend this urn</li>
            <li> The large box will accommodate the cremains of several Labrador Retrievers.  They lived together, and now will rest together.</li>
            <li> This urn is just beautiful, the perfect one for our beloved daughter.  I  am very pleased with it and happy that it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece--exactly what I wanted.  Order was handled promptly and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what it is intended. I like the Tree of Life carving on the box. I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the smell. I had to leave it outdoors for a few weeks to get rid of some of the odor.</li>
