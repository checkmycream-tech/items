            <li>It is cuter on me with just a swipe for a hint of shimmer but its too light for me when I try to get the color to show up a bit more.</li>

            <li>and Im glad I did goes on easy very natural soft on the lips</li>
            <li>Its a very pretty color in all but putting it on for the first time  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel like wax on lips, and adds right amount of color gloss and shine.</li>
            <li>Pretty lipstick, and a gorgeous shade of pink.  </li>
            <li>very cheaply made case, not worth more than the $2 I spent on it, honestly.</li>
            <li>It is not a purplish pink, but a delightful lovely pink that seems to last all day.  </li>
            <li>- it has evidently been discontinued so I have to get it here.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy!</li>
            <li>Lasts long time, prob longer than most.</li>
            <li>Its a very pretty light pink with lots of shimmer.</li>
            <li>Ok well let me start off by saying this lipstick is nothing that I expected, although I did like how fast I got it though.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is so very moist and it stays on my lips</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing on your lips like a lip balm and also has shimmer.</li>
            <li>If you like to mix colors, this blends very well.  </li>
            <li>its just a nice lip gloss unless you go heavy on it</li>
            <li>I was really exited at first about this lipstick until I actually got the product in my hands.</li>
            <li>If you like to wear red lipstick but don&#x27;t won&#x27;t the red to standout too strong...</li>
            <li>color is lovely, case is so flimsy, can&#x27;t be thrown into purse, afraid the top will come off and lipstick will get all over everything.  </li>
            <li>I put this lipstick under my red lipstick and it just makes the color so pretty.</li>
            <li>But when I put on my clothes for the day fixed my hair and then put it on it</li>
            <li>This lipstick really surprised me</li>
            <li>then it comes out as a pretty pink pout shimmer</li>
            <li>Texture is super slick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Color was so much lighter than expected, so I usually only wear around house when I don&#x27;t want bare lips.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite lipstick color it was my signature and to hear that the whole line is discontinued made my heart sink :(</li>

            <li> Pretty pale pink, not ridiculously bright bubble gum but a pretty color.</li>
            <li> Compliments all day long</li>
            <li> but it still brings me out, even though it&#x27;s a really sheer pink.</li>
            <li> does anyone know of a pink freeze replica or know where to still buy it stores</li>
            <li> pink</li>

            <li> , just probably won&#x27;t buy another due to the safety seal situation.</li>
            <li> It just brings my skin and complexion out when I wear it alone or under one of my other lipsticks color.</li>
            <li> Average staying power.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and dry,</li>

            <li> I love this lip stick! Beautiful color, lots of staying power. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Ok well let me start off by saying this lipstick is nothing that I expected, although I did like how fast I got it though. I was really exited at first about this lipstick until I actually got the product in my hands. Its a very pretty color in all but putting it on for the first time  I was like ahhhh its horrible. But when I put on my clothes for the day fixed my hair and then put it on it was actually pretty cute. I got a couple of comment on this lipstick so I&#x27;m  just gonna stick with it. To be honest I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this item never again but however i would probably purchase it in another color, like brown burgundy or red.</li>
            <li> love the color.  don&#x27;t feel like wax on lips, and adds right amount of color gloss and shine. Lasts long time, prob longer than most.</li>
            <li> Idk I like it but sometimes in pictures it looks so fake like I have barbie lips I dont hate but its not my fave</li>
            <li> This lipstick really surprised me I LOVE pink so  I gave it a try and Im glad I did goes on easy very natural soft on the lips must have ladies trust me ....</li>
            <li> I like it! This purchase was good for me! I like maybelline products, this products are smooth and good colors!</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Color Sensational High Shine Lipcolor, Pink Freeze 805 - nice summer lipgloss for every blonde!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> This came as described! The only thing I was concerned about was it didn&#x27;t have a safety seal. I sanitized it and it&#x27;s a beautiful color, just probably won&#x27;t buy another due to the safety seal situation.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s like glitter lip balm with a pink color. It&#x27;s beautiful. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I was wearing this colour for over a year and then Maybelline discontinued it. It is such a wonderful colour that I had to get more. Why do companies change their colours when people want them?</li>
            <li> OK, nothing special.  Color was so much lighter than expected, so I usually only wear around house when I don&#x27;t want bare lips.  I prefer more color.  Average staying power.</li>
            <li> Pretty pale pink, not ridiculously bright bubble gum but a pretty color. Texture is super slick and moisturizing. I&#x27;m fair skinned with brown eyes and hair and a big fan of this color</li>
            <li> Poor quality and dry,</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my niece in the Philippines, they got my package last week and I&#x27;m glad she really like it. I want to thank the seller also for being so kind coz she gave me another one for free. Shipment was good because I got it before the estimated day.</li>
            <li> color is lovely, case is so flimsy, can&#x27;t be thrown into purse, afraid the top will come off and lipstick will get all over everything.  very cheaply made case, not worth more than the $2 I spent on it, honestly.</li>
            <li> Love pink love this color! Smooth not sticky lasts a while. Whats not to love about the price too! If you are a pink girl this color is for you.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the color, and the packaging is too cute. I just wish there was more lipstick, this lasts around 30 minutes on your lips so if you love the color like me, you might run through it fast. It is very moisturizing on your lips like a lip balm and also has shimmer. Depending on how much you put on your lips, the more shimmer. Nice for all skin tones.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite lipstick in the world; very glossy and perfect shade for me; feels nice and moisturizing. - it has evidently been discontinued so I have to get it here.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful shade of pink that is so popular right now.  It is not a purplish pink, but a delightful lovely pink that seems to last all day.  It is very creamy!</li>
            <li> its just a nice lip gloss unless you go heavy on it then it comes out as a pretty pink pout shimmer</li>
            <li> I like it I just cannot wear it often.Its a very pretty light pink with lots of shimmer. It is cuter on me with just a swipe for a hint of shimmer but its too light for me when I try to get the color to show up a bit more. Love how these feel and of course the mirror tube is great.</li>
            <li> I originally fell in love with this lipstick by buying it a my local Dirt Cheap Store. I realized this is something i will need to repurchase online..couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores locally. I put this lipstick under my red lipstick and it just makes the color so pretty. It&#x27;ll give you a sheer look that&#x27;s not too shiny, which I like. It just brings my skin and complexion out when I wear it alone or under one of my other lipsticks color. If you like to mix colors, this blends very well.  If you like to wear red lipstick but don&#x27;t won&#x27;t the red to standout too strong...this would be excellent to blend it with. I&#x27;m tanned colored but it still brings me out, even though it&#x27;s a really sheer pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great color that looks good on anyone</li>
            <li> Pretty lipstick, and a gorgeous shade of pink.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a matte lipstick girl but this color is gorgeous!</li>
