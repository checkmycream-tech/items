    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was really impressed with this hair serum.  </li>
            <li>But it does a very good job.</li>
            <li>and it was beautifully packaged.  </li>
            <li>Great for keeping hair moisturizer when golfing.</li>
            <li>In addition, the price is great.  </li>
            <li>and it still works great.  </li>
            <li>Works great at smoothing and controlling frizz.  </li>
            <li>My hair is already in good condition</li>
            <li>This company has good quality products obviously.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t good, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all.</li>
            <li>So the Christophe serum would appear to be a good deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was especially impressed that it doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly either.  </li>
            <li>It is very good at taming frizz -- important in the summer heat and humidity.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this hair serum.</li>
            <li>(not the good kind of puffy).  </li>
            <li>I found this product to be just as comparable and effective as John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz ease or Loreal.  </li>
            <li>The combination of the two did bring me compliments though and my hair does feel nice (not oily etc).</li>
            <li>I really liked the effect it had on my hair.</li>
            <li>I believe this product does a nice job to subdue the frizz</li>
            <li>Which is nice since the scent of some hair products can overwhelm your perfume.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is neutral and it is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>What truly impressed me, though, was how it kept my naturally curly hair from tangling.  </li>
            <li>and I end up wearing it in a nice, controlled bun on most days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the hair serum has a very light smell, so it does not conflict or compete with my perfume.</li>
            <li>I thought this was just okay.</li>
            <li>She says her hair feels softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling great for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li>I probably could have used no hair products at all and had better results.</li>
            <li>I donâ€™t even like to brush it because that just makes it more frizzy and puffy</li>
            <li>This serum works very well, it tames frizzes and fly away hair leaving the hair smooth and silky feeling.  </li>
            <li>For me, the serum worked best when applied to damp, combed hair as opposed to wet hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She seems to really like this hair serum, and says that it makes her hair softer, thicker and gives her hair more body, and my wife can be kind of picky about the products she uses on her skin and hair, so if she give this a rave review, I&#x27;ll agree.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit strong in that it has a tendency to clump hairs together.  </li>
            <li>but, again, it&#x27;s too strong for me</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I found that it took more than a dimes worth to get the coverage I want, but that&#x27;s not unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER</li>
            <li>it look smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>My choice is to find a product that will smooth out the frizz or cut off my beautiful, long auburn locks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still feeling it out in terms of how much I want to use at any one time though, so it may get a bit better for me if I use more than the recommended amount.</li>
            <li>My hair air dries to a silky and smooth finish, with still a lot of its original body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>John Frieda Full Repair</li>
            <li>Using too much will most defiantly leave your hair feeling oily.</li>
            <li>I used this after trying Frederic Fekkai Apple Cider Shampoo (and Tigi Bed Head conditioner, in the interest of full disclosure).</li>
            <li>It worked great -- my hair was transformed from comical to polite and pretty in just a few moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perfect Ends Deep Infusion, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]] or [[ASIN:B0007X74E0</li>
            <li>But if you are trying to get pregnant, you might want to read up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t quite as sticky or viscous as Frizz Ease, but seems to do a better job of taming fly aways, which I have a serious problem</li>
            <li>Well worth the price tag.  </li>
            <li>But it truly is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have been quite pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>Works good alone, but works even better when combined SPARINGLY with other similar hair care products.  </li>
            <li>I would expect more obvious results from an &amp;#34;EXTRA STRENGTH PROFESSIONAL&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>I was given Christophe extra strength hair serum as a trial product and have thoroughly enjoyed the affects that the product has on my hair.  </li>
            <li>and you need to use more of it if you want the same effect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually been using slightly more than the recommended amount</li>
            <li>You definitely need more than the suggested dime-sized amount if your hair is longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li>and I am pretty picky.  </li>
            <li>This product did make my hair feel very soft and smooth, but does not help the frizziness, which is my main issue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Two dime-size drops smoothed into my hair, a second setting with hot rollers, ten minutes to write a review, take out the curlers...and the resulting curls/waves are smooth and silky for an important evening out!</li>
            <li>It works well, has a pleasant scent, and lasts a long time even for a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>The Cristophe serum does seem more effective than most which means you can probably use a smaller quantity than the competition but the fact that you are limited to half the amount of most other products prevents this from being a 5 star product.</li>
            <li>Even though my hair is still thin and fine, it is shiny, lays nicely</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find where this did a whole lot to improve it.</li>
            <li>Even with how much she has</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>After the shampoo, conditioner, rinse, Toni &amp; Guy conditioner (another Vine find), blow-dry, setting the hair, I was ready for the Cristophe, which coincidentally arrived at that</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Nothing much works very well</li>
            <li>The Cristophe Professional Extra Strength Hair Serum is just okay.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect; a balm or creme would be more effective.</li>
            <li>I think it works okay, but not to the lengths I would like it to or like other salon products do....</li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this serum which is equal to any oily shiny glossing material you can put on your hair.</li>
            <li>This is a clear odorless serum and if used correctly will leave you with fantastic results.it absorbs into hair instantly and seems to be very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>A decent product but for my thinning hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;--there was a big, super sticky shipping label over the ingredients, so looked online to see what they might be.  </li>
            <li>mainly frizziness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I believe the claim that it makes your hair stronger, but it will probably reduce breakage, and that&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing makes problem hair like mine thick and lush, but this is one of those rare products that has made the most of what I have.</li>
            <li>The other thing I noticed was that is has no scent which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>I have to say I can&#x27;t really tell an immediate difference in hair &amp;#34;shininess,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;frizz-taming,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;conditioning.&amp;#34; My hair is not very frizzy to begin with, and in fact I thought my hair got frizzier after using the serum for the first time!</li>
            <li>Most of the other serums I have purchased were close to double this size.  </li>
            <li>Smooth Down Heat Glide Protective Smoother Unisex Smoother by Redken, 5 Ounce]].  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy having the option of wearing it down now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;But since I have been using this hair serum, I have been able to wear my hair down sometimes and actually like what I see in the mirror!  </li>
            <li>This Cristophe Hair Serum gives the same sort of shine at more than half the price.  </li>
            <li>The Cristophe Professional Extra Strength Hair Serum works very well at softening hair.  </li>
            <li>So far I have used it a couple of times.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that frizzes with humidity.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky soft, smooths out the frizzy, damaged hair, and leaves</li>
            <li>A real emergency, since there was no time to jump back in the shower and start over.</li>
            <li>The frizz was nearly gone</li>
            <li>Cristophe Professional Extra Strength Hair Serum is great for giving my hair a shiny, finished look without being over-the-top &amp;#34;producty&amp;#34; or greasy.  </li>
            <li>do think that people with thick hair will like this product even more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many serums and hair protectants over the years, some good and some very bad.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really about all you need if you are flat ironing your hair in sections.</li>
            <li>I found this serum to be a little bit thicker than the ones I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a pump bottle which dispenses the right amount.... which is about a dime sized drop.</li>
            <li>and I really do not have to use very much.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, somewhat wavy hair that is fairly easy to style.</li>
            <li>what hair styles he (or she?) creates, but apparently my wife knows and does, so I picked this up for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Christophe Professional Extra Strength Hair Serum did not deliver what it promised.</li>
            <li>the time it was tremendously expensive, but I liked the shine it gave my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is thin, fine, naturally wavy, and highlighted.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really add body but it tames the wild frizzy look while adding a little strength.</li>
            <li>And she loves this one just as much as the other one.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and I prefer it to other products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The gel is pretty thick, but once you rub it in your palms, it goes on smooth on your hair as you run your figners through it when you hair is wet (after you towel dry it).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and full.  </li>
            <li>When I woke up, I was late to go somewhere and had a head of super frizzy clown hair.</li>
            <li>I have waist-length hair that is thin, wispy and fine.  </li>

            <li> That&#x27;s really about all you need if you are flat ironing your hair in sections.</li>
            <li> I found this serum to be a little bit thicker than the ones I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a pump bottle which dispenses the right amount.... which is about a dime sized drop.</li>
            <li> and I really do not have to use very much.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, somewhat wavy hair that is fairly easy to style.</li>
            <li> what hair styles he (or she?) creates, but apparently my wife knows and does, so I picked this up for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Christophe Professional Extra Strength Hair Serum did not deliver what it promised.</li>
            <li> the time it was tremendously expensive, but I liked the shine it gave my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, fine, naturally wavy, and highlighted.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really add body but it tames the wild frizzy look while adding a little strength.</li>
            <li> And she loves this one just as much as the other one.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and I prefer it to other products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The gel is pretty thick, but once you rub it in your palms, it goes on smooth on your hair as you run your figners through it when you hair is wet (after you towel dry it).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and full.  </li>
            <li> When I woke up, I was late to go somewhere and had a head of super frizzy clown hair.</li>
            <li> I have waist-length hair that is thin, wispy and fine.  </li>
            <li> It protects the hair during styling, if you use too much it will your hair will be like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> No worse, but also no better.</li>
            <li> I have long, medium-thick, coarse hair that is prone to frizzies.</li>
            <li> So Iâ€™m always on the lookout for a product that will get rid of the frizz but not leave my hair flat on my head.  </li>
            <li> I really find it hard to believe that this product is Extra Strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as this serum goes, my wife has long dark hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long and thick and this product did help me manage and style my hair.</li>
            <li> Therefore, when I first sampled this hair serum, I thought that it would be too heavy and weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> The only thing I changed what that I used this new hair serum instead of my usual hair serum.</li>
            <li> This is another product that really helps with hard to mange, brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mostly combed it into damp hair just after a shower, but the other day, I washed my hair with a very expensive new shampoo and then fell asleep with wet hair.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount left my hair soft and shiny without frizz.  </li>
            <li> We are going to continue on using it until it&#x27;s gone hoping for some long term benefits, but it did nothing for the frizz in the humidity here on the Virginia coast.  </li>
            <li> my long hair</li>
            <li> The Cristophe Hair Serum adds shine and makes my long hair easier to brush and comb.</li>
            <li> I have used other products similar.  </li>
            <li> I grabbed this serum, pumped a quarter-sized dollop into the palm of my hand, rubbed my hands together and then ran them though my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Using too much gives that greasy look, which is not good.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount, even with hair down to the middle of the back like mine</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can use this on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> is, it only took less than a quarter size to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I used this on wet, damp, and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am having trouble finding this product in stores and recently ordered it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Also, there is really no scent to the product that I could detect.  </li>
            <li> I mean, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily or greasy, but it didn&#x27;t combat the tiny bit of frizz that happens with my hair if its somewhat humid outside.  </li>
            <li> This is no miracle, but it does make my hair sleek, tame and there is a hint of substance (as long as I use it on the ponytail section and not near the scalp).  </li>
            <li> It also does not make my hair look flat or limp.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that has been processed several times.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Anther advantage of the product is that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, combined with other products.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers who say that this serum is on par with other drugstore hair serums.  </li>
            <li> I use Pantene 2-in-1 as a shampoo/conditioner, and I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> My hair looked dry, wiry and fluffy, like a lion&#x27;s mane.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of hair products, especially smoothing serums for flyaway and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or make it greasy.</li>
            <li> The bottle says that a small amount of additional serum can also be used on dry hair to combat frizz.</li>
            <li> I typically use gel.  </li>
            <li> and I still have about half a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Per the instructions, put a dime-sized amount of serum on the palm of your hand, rub between your hands and then apply to wet or damp hair then style as usual.</li>
            <li> It does come in a neat little pump bottle and Does impart some shine to my platinum blond hair, but no more or less than any other drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> also couldn&#x27;t detect a fragrance - a plus for those who hate strong, competing scents from their products.</li>
            <li> It is also a little bit curly and tends to frizz.  </li>

            <li> I tried this product before blow-drying my hair, and I tried it after my hair was dried, using the amounts indicated on the product.</li>

            <li> This is less oily and gooey than that stuff was, but just as mediocre.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and, although it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;thicken&amp;#34; it, I feel that it gives my hair a healthier shine and manageability.  </li>

            <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It was not the same product I had used before.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a different product.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Christophe in a beauty salon before.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping hair moisturizer when golfing.</li>
            <li> I have no clue who Cristophe is, or what hair styles he (or she?) creates, but apparently my wife knows and does, so I picked this up for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She seems to really like this hair serum, and says that it makes her hair softer, thicker and gives her hair more body, and my wife can be kind of picky about the products she uses on her skin and hair, so if she give this a rave review, I&#x27;ll agree.</li>
            <li> The Cristophe Professional Extra Strength Hair Serum works very well at softening hair.  The fragrance is neutral and it is very easy to apply.  The downside to this product is that it comes in a very small quantity.  Most of the other serums I have purchased were close to double this size.  The Cristophe serum does seem more effective than most which means you can probably use a smaller quantity than the competition but the fact that you are limited to half the amount of most other products prevents this from being a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I thought this was just okay. My hair is already in good condition and I don&#x27;t put a lot of product on it. I didn&#x27;t find where this did a whole lot to improve it. It didn&#x27;t seem to harm it any, but I didn&#x27;t get any benefit of added shine or frizz control. It&#x27;s not something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is another product that really helps with hard to mange, brittle hair. It doesn&#x27;t really add body but it tames the wild frizzy look while adding a little strength.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this hair serum.  Just a small amount left my hair soft and shiny without frizz.  What truly impressed me, though, was how it kept my naturally curly hair from tangling.  In addition, the price is great.  I will definitely be buying this in the future.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this hair serum. A little goes a long way. Per the instructions, put a dime-sized amount of serum on the palm of your hand, rub between your hands and then apply to wet or damp hair then style as usual. I have long, medium-thick, coarse hair that is prone to frizzies. I found that I needed double  the dime size amount of product. For me, the serum worked best when applied to damp, combed hair as opposed to wet hair. I work it in for about three minutes, finger combing the serum through my hair. My hair air dries to a silky and smooth finish, with still a lot of its original body.&lt;br /&gt;I also couldn&#x27;t detect a fragrance - a plus for those who hate strong, competing scents from their products.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I had never used a product from this company before, therefore, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this hair serum. So far I have used it a couple of times. The gel is pretty thick, but once you rub it in your palms, it goes on smooth on your hair as you run your figners through it when you hair is wet (after you towel dry it).  The other thing I noticed was that is has no scent which is fine with me. The pump feels pretty sturdy and the bottle is small enough to take it with you when you travel. My hair is pretty long and thick and this product did help me manage and style my hair. It left my hair soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price tag.  This is the second Cristophe product my wife has tried.  And she loves this one just as much as the other one.  This company has good quality products obviously.&lt;br /&gt;As far as this serum goes, my wife has long dark hair.  It&#x27;s thick and full.  Even with how much she has though she doesn&#x27;t have to use a lot of it and it still works great.  She says her hair feels softer and more manageable.  She was especially impressed that it doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly either.  It leaves your hair feeling great for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Sure it may be in a small bottle.  But it truly is worth the money.  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product for several years.  I have very thin hair and, although it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;thicken&amp;#34; it, I feel that it gives my hair a healthier shine and manageability.  I am having trouble finding this product in stores and recently ordered it on Amazon.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of hair products, especially smoothing serums for flyaway and thick hair.  I have to use it after washing or my hair looks like straw.  I found this product to be just as comparable and effective as John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz ease or Loreal.  It works well, has a pleasant scent, and lasts a long time even for a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used other products similar.  The consistency is a little thicker, like a weak gel. It protects the hair during styling, if you use too much it will your hair will be like an oil slick.  Just a dime size amount.  This serum seals ends and fights frizz.</li>
            <li> Works good alone, but works even better when combined SPARINGLY with other similar hair care products.  I have combined it with [[ASIN:B004DK4CH0 John Frieda Full Repair Perfect Ends Deep Infusion, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]] or [[ASIN:B0007X74E0 Smooth Down Heat Glide Protective Smoother Unisex Smoother by Redken, 5 Ounce]].  A little goes a long way.  Using too much gives that greasy look, which is not good.  Works great at smoothing and controlling frizz.  I will continue to use it, combined with other products.</li>
            <li> Christophe Professional Extra Strength Hair Serum did not deliver what it promised. I have thick, somewhat wavy hair that is fairly easy to style. This product did not do anything to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used this product, I washed and dried my hair like I usually do. The only thing I changed what that I used this new hair serum instead of my usual hair serum. Well, I looked like a lion after I finished blow drying my hair. My hair looked dry, wiry and fluffy, like a lion&#x27;s mane. The bottle says that a small amount of additional serum can also be used on dry hair to combat frizz. I tried this and all that happened was the my hair felt oily. It still looked terrible. I really find it hard to believe that this product is Extra Strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with this product. I probably could have used no hair products at all and had better results.</li>
            <li> The Cristophe Professional Extra Strength Hair Serum is just okay.  I mean, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily or greasy, but it didn&#x27;t combat the tiny bit of frizz that happens with my hair if its somewhat humid outside.  It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling extra shiny either.  I agree with other reviewers who say that this serum is on par with other drugstore hair serums.  No worse, but also no better.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that frizzes with humidity.  I typically use gel.  This product did make my hair feel very soft and smooth, but does not help the frizziness, which is my main issue.  I end up using a bit of gel after to tame the frizzies.  The combination of the two did bring me compliments though and my hair does feel nice (not oily etc). I think it might be almost like a conditioner I sometimes straighten my hair (but not in the summer), so I have not yet tried it for that.  I will try to update when the weather cools and I try it for straightening.</li>
            <li> We have used this a few times and have not noticed any difference in the styling  of my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  We are going to continue on using it until it&#x27;s gone hoping for some long term benefits, but it did nothing for the frizz in the humidity here on the Virginia coast.  I&#x27;ll update this later if we find it works for strengthening and overall hair health.</li>
            <li> A decent product but for my thinning hair it&#x27;s a bit strong in that it has a tendency to clump hairs together.  Sometimes that&#x27;s what men want or need, but, again, it&#x27;s too strong for me and I prefer the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; style after-showering conditioners or holders.</li>
            <li> This serum works very well, it tames frizzes and fly away hair leaving the hair smooth and silky feeling.  I really liked the effect it had on my hair.</li>
            <li> Using this is the same as not using anything at all. I&#x27;ve used many serums and hair protectants over the years, some good and some very bad. This product isn&#x27;t bad. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or make it greasy. It just isn&#x27;t good, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all. After using this product, my hair was the same as it is without product. Same amount of frizz, same texture, same everything. I would expect more obvious results from an &amp;#34;EXTRA STRENGTH PROFESSIONAL&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> I like this hair serum. It makes my hair shiny and easier to comb.  I&#x27;m not sure I believe the claim that it makes your hair stronger, but it will probably reduce breakage, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my long hair I found that it took more than a dimes worth to get the coverage I want, but that&#x27;s not unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER NOTES&lt;br /&gt;--there was a big, super sticky shipping label over the ingredients, so looked online to see what they might be.  The EWG website mentions: CYCLOTETRASILOXANE, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, PHENYL TRIMETHICONE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL....  (I&#x27;ll put a link in the comments)  The overall hazard is LOW.  But if you are trying to get pregnant, you might want to read up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I thought this product was affordable.  Last year I reviewed this product:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CHJDSUG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time it was tremendously expensive, but I liked the shine it gave my hair and it was beautifully packaged.  Currently it&#x27;s about 1/3 of last year&#x27;s price and you get 3.4 oz.  This Cristophe Hair Serum gives the same sort of shine at more than half the price.  So the Christophe serum would appear to be a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;Really like this product.  The Cristophe Hair Serum adds shine and makes my long hair easier to brush and comb.</li>
            <li> I was given Christophe extra strength hair serum as a trial product and have thoroughly enjoyed the affects that the product has on my hair.  I have long, thick hair that has been processed several times.  My choice is to find a product that will smooth out the frizz or cut off my beautiful, long auburn locks.  I believe this product does a nice job to subdue the frizz and I really do not have to use very much.  It leaves my hair silky soft, smooths out the frizzy, damaged hair, and leaves it look smooth and shiny. The price is reasonable and I prefer it to other products that I have tried.  I would rate it a 5-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracey</li>
            <li> I have one that I purchased in a drug store (which is almost out) so I decided to buy one on-line.  The texture is definitely different as I did a side by side comparison and the online version is thinner and you need to use more of it if you want the same effect.  I don&#x27;t know if perhaps the formula has changed, but if it did - I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out for me on this product. I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or oily looking like a lot of serums. However, I don&#x27;t feel like it does a lot to help me fight the problems I like a serum to combat.....hair quality and appearance...mainly frizziness. I want this to help my hair recover from flat-ironing and make it look nicer on days I don&#x27;t heat treat. I think it works okay, but not to the lengths I would like it to or like other salon products do....like a hair milk mist I would use from Bioflage for a similar purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still feeling it out in terms of how much I want to use at any one time though, so it may get a bit better for me if I use more than the recommended amount.</li>
            <li> I found this serum to be a little bit thicker than the ones I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a pump bottle which dispenses the right amount.... which is about a dime sized drop. That&#x27;s really about all you need if you are flat ironing your hair in sections. Using too much will most defiantly leave your hair feeling oily. This is a clear odorless serum and if used correctly will leave you with fantastic results.it absorbs into hair instantly and seems to be very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, fine, naturally wavy, and highlighted. Therefore, when I first sampled this hair serum, I thought that it would be too heavy and weigh my hair down. That turned out to be wrong! I have used this product almost daily for about a month. It is very good at taming frizz -- important in the summer heat and humidity. It also does not make my hair look flat or limp. Instead, it is easier to style. Also, the hair serum has a very light smell, so it does not conflict or compete with my perfume. Anther advantage of the product is that a little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve actually been using slightly more than the recommended amount and I still have about half a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this on wet or dry hair. I&#x27;ve mostly combed it into damp hair just after a shower, but the other day, I washed my hair with a very expensive new shampoo and then fell asleep with wet hair. When I woke up, I was late to go somewhere and had a head of super frizzy clown hair. A real emergency, since there was no time to jump back in the shower and start over. I grabbed this serum, pumped a quarter-sized dollop into the palm of my hand, rubbed my hands together and then ran them though my dry hair. It worked great -- my hair was transformed from comical to polite and pretty in just a few moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that people with thick hair will like this product even more.</li>
            <li> I tried this product before blow-drying my hair, and I tried it after my hair was dried, using the amounts indicated on the product. I alternated between using the serum and not using it for a few weeks. I have thick black hair, shoulder length. I use Pantene 2-in-1 as a shampoo/conditioner, and I wash my hair every other day. I have to say I can&#x27;t really tell an immediate difference in hair &amp;#34;shininess,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;frizz-taming,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;conditioning.&amp;#34; My hair is not very frizzy to begin with, and in fact I thought my hair got frizzier after using the serum for the first time! My hair doesn&#x27;t seem healthier or unhealthier with the serum. I guess I&#x27;m indifferent to the product. But because the serum&#x27;s usefulness is not that noticeable to me, I&#x27;m not going to dedicate the extra minute of my morning routine to using it or my pocketbook for buying it after it runs out.</li>
            <li> I used this after trying Frederic Fekkai Apple Cider Shampoo (and Tigi Bed Head conditioner, in the interest of full disclosure). After the shampoo, conditioner, rinse, Toni &amp; Guy conditioner (another Vine find), blow-dry, setting the hair, I was ready for the Cristophe, which coincidentally arrived at that juncture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two dime-size drops smoothed into my hair, a second setting with hot rollers, ten minutes to write a review, take out the curlers...and the resulting curls/waves are smooth and silky for an important evening out!</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this serum which is equal to any oily shiny glossing material you can put on your hair. It does come in a neat little pump bottle and Does impart some shine to my platinum blond hair, but no more or less than any other drugstore brands. Years ago we used brilliantine. This is less oily and gooey than that stuff was, but just as mediocre.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and frizzy.  I donâ€™t even like to brush it because that just makes it more frizzy and puffy (not the good kind of puffy).  So Iâ€™m always on the lookout for a product that will get rid of the frizz but not leave my hair flat on my head.  This worked wonders on my hair.  You only need a small amount, even with hair down to the middle of the back like mine is, it only took less than a quarter size to notice a difference.  The frizz was nearly gone and I wasn&#x27;t afraid to brush my hair!  Also, there is really no scent to the product that I could detect.  Which is nice since the scent of some hair products can overwhelm your perfume.</li>
            <li> I used this on wet, damp, and dry hair. All times it did its job. You definitely need more than the suggested dime-sized amount if your hair is longer than shoulder length. This product isn&#x27;t quite as sticky or viscous as Frizz Ease, but seems to do a better job of taming fly aways, which I have a serious problem with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect; a balm or creme would be more effective. But it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Cristophe Professional Extra Strength Hair Serum is great for giving my hair a shiny, finished look without being over-the-top &amp;#34;producty&amp;#34; or greasy.  I like the texture, the scent, and the ease of use!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I am pretty picky.  I have waist-length hair that is thin, wispy and fine.  It is also a little bit curly and tends to frizz.  Nothing much works very well and I end up wearing it in a nice, controlled bun on most days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since I have been using this hair serum, I have been able to wear my hair down sometimes and actually like what I see in the mirror!  This is no miracle, but it does make my hair sleek, tame and there is a hint of substance (as long as I use it on the ponytail section and not near the scalp).  I have been quite pleased so far.  Even though my hair is still thin and fine, it is shiny, lays nicely and I enjoy having the option of wearing it down now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing makes problem hair like mine thick and lush, but this is one of those rare products that has made the most of what I have.</li>
