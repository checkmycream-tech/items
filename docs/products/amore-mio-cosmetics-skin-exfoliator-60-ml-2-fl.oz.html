    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product, my skin looks and feels smoother after just one use!  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST exfoliator I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>I ordered immediately and it is as awesome as it was before.  </li>
            <li>This exfoliator does work well, but it isn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>but after that is works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>This is the greatest exfoliater ever.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, great price and excellent service.</li>
            <li>its a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great product</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked this good.</li>
            <li>The price is exceptional, I just ordered another bottle since I plan to use it on my throat and hands too.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to work just like Orogold... Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It was amazing.  </li>
            <li>it worked fine!</li>
            <li>The product seems ok</li>
            <li>but as many have mentioned, the pump does not always work.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this stuff almost immediately.</li>
            <li>After receiving I ordered two more for friends.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and more!</li>
            <li>and I have access to acids for peels and honestly this stuff is so gentle</li>
            <li>I originally purchase this product in Las Vegas at a kiosk set up in a shopping area of our hotel/casino.  </li>
            <li>Magic in a pretty bottle.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it more than twice a week, or else it&#x27;d too much on the skin.</li>
            <li>I loved it, and it lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>Was pressured into buying this by a very loud and charismatic man shilling it from an orogold cart.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, my skin was so soft and looked awesome.  </li>
            <li>Apparently this is a lower level in the Oro Gold line, but the Oro Gold exfoliator is $198 in the store so this is a much better deal and seems to work as well.  </li>
            <li>and it still wouldn&#x27;t work, then I discovered the gold-colored metal top part which looks like it is part of the bottle that doesn&#x27;t come off is actually a screw on cap.  </li>
            <li>Once I unscrewed the top, washed off the end of the tubing and screwed the pump back in</li>
            <li>I too had the problem with the pump working at first.</li>
            <li>If a company is trying to liquidate faulty product, they need to be upright about it so that the customer knows exactly what they are getting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic protect, and works just as good as the oro gold deep peeling, for so much less money, that it&#x27;s deffinetly worth it.</li>
            <li>It is a little more liquified after the peeling action than the Oro Gold...but the $170 savings is well worth that huge gap!</li>
            <li>That said, this is likely the most gentle one I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>It is hands down an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after so much pressure from the person at the store.</li>
            <li>I am not convinced this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I feel it as good if not better than a professional grade peel.</li>
            <li>I occasionally use it on my hands and feet and they are soft and callous free</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different exfoliators and peels trying to find something similar and have not found anything even close.  </li>
            <li>I love Amore Mio exfoliator and was excited to find such a good deal; however, I was disappointed to discover that the pump does not work.  </li>
            <li>Although the pump can be difficult, this amazing price makes it totally worth the purchase...</li>
            <li>I needed something to wash my face after a sunburn and after I used this exfoliator, to my pleasant  surprise, it didn&#x27;t just exfoliate my skin, it removed the burnt and damaged upper layer without hurting the sensitive secondary layers.</li>
            <li>Just wow!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as thick as the deep peeling oro gold, but then again, it works the same, so I am very happy with this purchase, and will deffinetly buy it again, as long as the price stays the same.</li>
            <li>My advise is stay well clear of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the product has a fair pricing now, and its performance is very good, I have to knock off a star because of the shady back alley tactics that Oro Gold employs with their sales, and the overall stupid marketing tactics they use to sell their stuff.</li>
            <li>They still have their sales reps follow after shoppers in the mall even after they installed a permanent store, and that&#x27;s pretty annoying, especially considering that their products are good and generally work.</li>

            <li> I saw other reviews saying the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have fair and sensitive skin, so this exofoliator did wonders in helping me recover from a rather awful sunburn.</li>
            <li> I have not had a problem with the pump, but only a small amount is dispensed.</li>
            <li> I paid no more then $40 for it, all of a sudden it&#x27;s over a $100, so I bought this one.</li>
            <li> This is not a tremendous product.  </li>
            <li> The pump may be a little problematic, but that does not get in the way of its amazingness.</li>
            <li> After the dead skin beads off your skin, you will see your products working,  they will do what they say weather</li>
            <li> It broke within a few uses and if you can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle</li>
            <li> I was given a demonstration and could see the dead skin come off of my hand</li>

            <li> NOt sure why there are complaints about the pump...</li>
            <li> it took longer than usual to prime it</li>
            <li> useless.n product is too thick to pour.  </li>
            <li> I feel this is false advertising.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the very worst thing I have ever bought on line.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ran out of the product and the lowest price I could find online at the time was over $90 per bottle which was out of my price range.  </li>
            <li> The pump is very frustrating, I pumped it over 200 TIMES</li>
            <li> Do not buy this expensive and worthless product.</li>

            <li> If u have not tried this stuff you should. I&#x27;m an esthetician and I have access to acids for peels and honestly this stuff is so gentle and u see immediate results within minutes I feel it as good if not better than a professional grade peel. After the dead skin beads off your skin, you will see your products working,  they will do what they say weather it&#x27;s cleanse trest or moisturize. I will always keep myself stocked up on this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> Although the pump can be difficult, this amazing price makes it totally worth the purchase... Maybe even purchase a few! There&#x27;s no feeling of softness like when using this product. I occasionally use it on my hands and feet and they are soft and callous free</li>
            <li> This is by far the very worst thing I have ever bought on line.My advise is stay well clear of this product.</li>
            <li> The product seems ok but I have an issue with the pump.  It broke within a few uses and if you can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle it&#x27;s useless.n product is too thick to pour.  I saw other reviews saying the same thing.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work just like Orogold... Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST exfoliator I have ever purchased.  I originally purchase this product in Las Vegas at a kiosk set up in a shopping area of our hotel/casino.  I was given a demonstration and could see the dead skin come off of my hand, so I thought I would try it.  It did the same for my face.  It was amazing.  After a few uses, my skin was so soft and looked awesome.  Unfortunately, I ran out of the product and the lowest price I could find online at the time was over $90 per bottle which was out of my price range.  I have tried so many different exfoliators and peels trying to find something similar and have not found anything even close.  I decided to check online and the product IS NOW affordable!  Praised God!  I ordered immediately and it is as awesome as it was before.  I have not had a problem with the pump, but only a small amount is dispensed.</li>
            <li> the pump does stick a bit but you can just unscrew it. it works well and is not 190.00 dollars so what is the problem?</li>
            <li> Was pressured into buying this by a very loud and charismatic man shilling it from an orogold cart. He showed me a web post that listed the item of upwards 100 dollars but was selling it to customers for 40. This exfoliator does work well, but it isn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve used. That said, this is likely the most gentle one I&#x27;ve ever seen. I needed something to wash my face after a sunburn and after I used this exfoliator, to my pleasant  surprise, it didn&#x27;t just exfoliate my skin, it removed the burnt and damaged upper layer without hurting the sensitive secondary layers. I have fair and sensitive skin, so this exofoliator did wonders in helping me recover from a rather awful sunburn. I don&#x27;t know if the gold has anything to do with it, I doubt it does but its a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product has a fair pricing now, and its performance is very good, I have to knock off a star because of the shady back alley tactics that Oro Gold employs with their sales, and the overall stupid marketing tactics they use to sell their stuff. They still have their sales reps follow after shoppers in the mall even after they installed a permanent store, and that&#x27;s pretty annoying, especially considering that their products are good and generally work.</li>
            <li> I use to buy the deep peeling oro gold, when it was affordable on here. I loved it, and it lasted a long time. I paid no more then $40 for it, all of a sudden it&#x27;s over a $100, so I bought this one. Yes, the pump does not work, but who cares? I unscrewed it, and put it in my hands. It&#x27;s a fantastic protect, and works just as good as the oro gold deep peeling, for so much less money, that it&#x27;s deffinetly worth it. It&#x27;s not as thick as the deep peeling oro gold, but then again, it works the same, so I am very happy with this purchase, and will deffinetly buy it again, as long as the price stays the same.</li>
            <li> NOt sure why there are complaints about the pump...it took longer than usual to prime it but after that is works perfectly. THis does the same job as the Oro Gold which sells for $190! It is a little more liquified after the peeling action than the Oro Gold...but the $170 savings is well worth that huge gap! I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my decolletage and anywhere else I can think of! It&#x27;s like a Korean Scrub in a bottle! Awesome!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after so much pressure from the person at the store. This is a crappy product! It has done nothing to my skin, it feels like it is water based, it feels just lime water on my face. Do not buy this expensive and worthless product.</li>
            <li> This is not a tremendous product.  The pump does not work even from just receiving it.  Once you get the product out it does not work anything like OroGold skin exfoliator.  don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It is hands down an amazing product. The pump may be a little problematic, but that does not get in the way of its amazingness. A must buy while supplies last. Worth every penny and more! Magic in a pretty bottle. Just wow! Don&#x27;t use it more than twice a week, or else it&#x27;d too much on the skin.</li>
            <li> great product but as many have mentioned, the pump does not always work. The pump tip is too short to squirt product on fingers</li>
            <li> It replace the orogold! Thx</li>
            <li> I tried the same type of product at a Gold Cosmetics store. I fell in love with this stuff almost immediately. When the lady told me the bottle was close to $200 I was deflated...until I found this! This is the greatest exfoliater ever. My skin has never looked this good. I too had the problem with the pump working at first. I unscrewed the cap to access the product. For some reason the pump started working after that. I will be buying this again!!</li>
            <li> I love Amore Mio exfoliator and was excited to find such a good deal; however, I was disappointed to discover that the pump does not work.  I feel this is false advertising.  If a company is trying to liquidate faulty product, they need to be upright about it so that the customer knows exactly what they are getting.</li>
            <li> I am not convinced this is the real deal. The pump does not work</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, great price and excellent service. After receiving I ordered two more for friends.</li>
