            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cologne.</li>
            <li>Like someone else has said, it was much better from department store.  </li>
            <li>I love the cologne but will never buy through the mail ever again.</li>
            <li>I may just \\&quot;accidently\\&quot; break the bottle so I can buy him something better.</li>
            <li>I prefer more upscale fragrances, but this was a gift, so I wont complain.</li>
            <li>for  sure.  </li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t use the word &#x27;memorable&#x27; per say (the scent I would give 4-stars by itself).</li>
            <li>if you want a fragence that ladies love and wont let go off you</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and always get compliments on it when I wear it.</li>

            <li>The men in my life LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Never had more compliments on a cologne.</li>
            <li>I boight this stray for my boyfriend and couldn&#x27;t smell better.</li>
            <li>If you want girls to like you, try to change yourself to be more appealing.</li>
            <li>honestly most of them make me nauseous.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice clean cologne</li>
            <li>Very clean .</li>
            <li>pretty good price as well.</li>
            <li>It made me feel all the more better about starting my day because it smells so great, but after getting close to running out</li>
            <li>Such a good deal!</li>
            <li>Smells great and love the price....will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>Love it smells great and last all day can&#x27;t beat the $$$</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want anything too strong.</li>
            <li>I have sensitivity to strong perfumes and  Colognes and this one does not trigger.</li>
            <li>I love lucky you for women but for men...</li>
            <li>Have used Lucky Brand Cologne for many years.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite men&#x27;s cologne!  </li>
            <li>It is a huge bottle for very cheap and was completely worth it.</li>
            <li>love it... and received my order FAST!!</li>
            <li>its musky and cheap.</li>
            <li>This is a very clean, fresh scent that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I happen to like this very much, and have been pleased with it&#x27;s staying power.</li>
            <li>Also, ladies love the smell;)</li>
            <li>It has a sweet and lightly musty scent.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my future son-n-law for a Christmas gift and he loved it.  </li>
            <li>It smells sweet</li>
            <li>this stuff has been around for such a.long time and time smells good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad how fast the package came just in time for christmas</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clean, fresh scent that lasts all through the day.</li>
            <li>love love the smell, price and above the women that this scent is attracting.</li>
            <li>Luckily he likes it.</li>
            <li>Lucky  brand,  </li>
            <li>Lucky  you..</li>
            <li>I  have  indeed,  gotten  Lucky.  </li>
            <li>I give Lucky You for Men a 5-star rating not because it&#x27;s scent is particularly jaw-droppingly memorable, but because of it&#x27;s price and versatility.</li>
            <li>The brand isnt call lucky you for no reason.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for and it was a steal for the price!</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Its a suddle fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Nice, but I don&#x27;t wear it daily.  </li>
            <li>the others review say it great, but for me it smells cheap, doesnt last long.</li>
            <li>If I get a compliment for “smelling good” it is usually when I am wearing Lucky Brand.</li>
            <li>$18 on Amazon it is very, very affordable...</li>
            <li>Which in my opinion is a plus, the great fragrance plus the size being big enough to last a really long time equals up to a really great product.</li>
            <li>Great scent - light enough for everyday wear, strong enough to not dissipate quickly.</li>
            <li>I used to really enjoy this for special occasions from 2005-2008 when I used to buy it locally.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat price even if you had to use twice as much!</li>
            <li>first  </li>
            <li>I get compliments on this cologne pretty often.  </li>
            <li>Very decent price.</li>
            <li>Everything turned out fine with receiving the proper cologne</li>
            <li>The real difference is the price, it&#x27;s cheap enough to always have some around and keep buying</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, I bought this for my husband and he wears it everyday.</li>
            <li>So it wasn&#x27;t a loss really.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and on time.</li>
            <li>Colognes are of course by their very nature subjective.</li>
            <li>that  this  was  reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I always enjoy this scent for my daily, just going to work.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite hands down</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean smell, not to strong and not to weak.</li>
            <li>Quite simply, you really can&#x27;t lose with Lucky You.</li>
            <li>but idk, doesnt seem to smell like my other bottle i bought from the store, doesnt seem as strong</li>
            <li>No complaint about the scent.</li>
            <li>Just one of my favorite everyday colognes.</li>
            <li>fresh fragrance for a male.</li>
            <li>My husband just loves this new cologne.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the one I bought in a department store a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>This has been my son&#x27;s favorite for the past 8 years years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 44 years old and for some reason decided it was time to establish a new scent.</li>
            <li>received quickly, quality was as expected, no complaints, would order from this company again</li>
            <li>ive been a BIG fan of Lucky you cologne for men and been using this same product for years and for some reason seems like this cologne doesnt smell as strong as my other ones have and doesn&#x27;t last ???</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good scent - and the reason I say \\&quot;ladies enjoy it - perhaps a little too much\\&quot; is because my house was broken into, and they only took three things in my house for some reason..</li>
            <li>so it makes a fantastic everyday cologne, plus</li>
            <li>but the stuff they scent me completely lacks the masculine scent</li>
            <li>even old spice has.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn cologne on a regular basis since high school.</li>
            <li>It is okay, never a good idea to buy cologne unless you had already had it at one time.</li>
            <li>On time and exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>We usually purchase the small bottle from wal mart but New York Perfumes had a better deal.</li>
            <li>It is the only kind of cologne he wears and my daughter was unable to find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Generally i like basic scents, nothing too fancy.</li>
            <li>The reviews really let me down.</li>
            <li>the  very  least  compliment  you! :)</li>

            <li> I used to really enjoy this for special occasions from 2005-2008 when I used to buy it locally.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat price even if you had to use twice as much!</li>
            <li> first  </li>
            <li> I get compliments on this cologne pretty often.  </li>
            <li> Very decent price.</li>
            <li> Everything turned out fine with receiving the proper cologne</li>
            <li> The real difference is the price, it&#x27;s cheap enough to always have some around and keep buying</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, I bought this for my husband and he wears it everyday.</li>
            <li> So it wasn&#x27;t a loss really.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and on time.</li>
            <li> Colognes are of course by their very nature subjective.</li>
            <li> that  this  was  reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I always enjoy this scent for my daily, just going to work.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite hands down</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean smell, not to strong and not to weak.</li>
            <li> Quite simply, you really can&#x27;t lose with Lucky You.</li>
            <li> but idk, doesnt seem to smell like my other bottle i bought from the store, doesnt seem as strong</li>
            <li> No complaint about the scent.</li>
            <li> Just one of my favorite everyday colognes.</li>
            <li> fresh fragrance for a male.</li>
            <li> My husband just loves this new cologne.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the one I bought in a department store a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> This has been my son&#x27;s favorite for the past 8 years years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 44 years old and for some reason decided it was time to establish a new scent.</li>
            <li> received quickly, quality was as expected, no complaints, would order from this company again</li>
            <li> ive been a BIG fan of Lucky you cologne for men and been using this same product for years and for some reason seems like this cologne doesnt smell as strong as my other ones have and doesn&#x27;t last ???</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good scent - and the reason I say \\&quot;ladies enjoy it - perhaps a little too much\\&quot; is because my house was broken into, and they only took three things in my house for some reason..</li>
            <li> so it makes a fantastic everyday cologne, plus</li>
            <li> but the stuff they scent me completely lacks the masculine scent</li>
            <li> even old spice has.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn cologne on a regular basis since high school.</li>
            <li> It is okay, never a good idea to buy cologne unless you had already had it at one time.</li>
            <li> On time and exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> We usually purchase the small bottle from wal mart but New York Perfumes had a better deal.</li>
            <li> It is the only kind of cologne he wears and my daughter was unable to find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Generally i like basic scents, nothing too fancy.</li>
            <li> The reviews really let me down.</li>
            <li> the  very  least  compliment  you! :)</li>
            <li> I feel like I can wear it with pretty much anything; casual, formal, jeans, khakis, anything.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this everyday since the new year started and</li>
            <li> I HATE most colognes,the are very overpowering to me and</li>
            <li> It smells awesome, not strong like all the other crap out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they sent me the wrong kind or what</li>
            <li> Makes you want to just smell yourself all day long!</li>
            <li> I had a little left from department store bottle and the color and smell was different.  </li>
            <li> I wish it would last a little longer is the only con.</li>
            <li> Dry and Citrus .</li>
            <li> Because  the  last  few  times  </li>
            <li> Product was as expected and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> And when it&#x27;s empty, I&#x27;ll buy another!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it lives up with the hype of all of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I purchased it off other&#x27;s reviews and</li>
            <li> I can say I like it and other people like it as well.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subjective, my wife being the subject, happens to like it</li>
            <li> The spray pumps like to mess up though.</li>
            <li> But nothing wrong with trying a little something subtle to bring my wife closer to me, right?</li>
            <li> Little costly tho.</li>
            <li> They  never  let  me  down!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whats the deal here.</li>
            <li> Not sure if there was a change in the composition or ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if a knock off or what.  </li>
            <li> My jusband likes this was hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> in other words im very disappointing whith it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to buy cologne based on verbal descriptions...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost sorry when I hit the gym at lunch and then have to shower it off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is okay, never a good idea to buy cologne unless you had already had it at one time. But, it did smell good and i like it. So it wasn&#x27;t a loss really.</li>
            <li> All I got to say ..... My girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> Best smelling stuff.  pretty good price as well. Bought it for my dad for Christmas b/c I used all of his. haha</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn cologne on a regular basis since high school. I&#x27;m now 44 years old and for some reason decided it was time to establish a new scent. I didn&#x27;t want anything too strong. I&#x27;m going on 20 years of marriage ... not out looking to attract a lady in heat. But nothing wrong with trying a little something subtle to bring my wife closer to me, right? I tried this brand based on the reviews (and price) and am perfectly satisfied. One spray on my wrist does the trick -- this bottle might last me another 20 years. And when it&#x27;s empty, I&#x27;ll buy another!</li>
            <li> You cannot beat the price. The fragrance is subjective, my wife being the subject, happens to like it so it works for me!</li>
            <li> No complaint about the scent. Doesn&#x27;t last long. Lasts for 2 hours at maximum.</li>
            <li> My jusband likes this was hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Very good cologne for the price! Fresh and clean smell, not to strong and not to weak. The smell gets better when it starts to fad away. Also, ladies love the smell;)</li>
            <li> Very good smelling stuff. Little costly tho. Get what u pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> Not for me. Too Musky. It&#x27;s difficult to buy cologne based on verbal descriptions...</li>
            <li> smells awesome, good everyday cologne</li>
            <li> Very Nice Smell for anytime ! Dry and Citrus . Very clean . You can use it all day . Refreshing</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenager. This was the best price I could find. Thanks and was a great transaction. Now he is smelling good.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat price even if you had to use twice as much!</li>
            <li> Great product. Shipped fast and on time. Two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> this cologne is by far the best I&#x27;ve had! I&#x27;m one of those people that before i go anywhere, even just outside my door, i have to take a shower for the day and smell my best. For a while now I&#x27;ve had a .5fl oz bottle of this one and absolutely loved it! It made me feel all the more better about starting my day because it smells so great, but after getting close to running out i bought this one, and i must say the size is WAY more than a lot! Which in my opinion is a plus, the great fragrance plus the size being big enough to last a really long time equals up to a really great product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Way cheaper to buy it here than at the store. Would have paid double the amount for the big bottle, at say Walmart. Such a good deal!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne. Makes you want to just smell yourself all day long! I&#x27;m almost sorry when I hit the gym at lunch and then have to shower it off. I should probably thrown a bottle in my gym bag, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent. Very decent price. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this cologne. It smells awesome, not strong like all the other crap out there. Its a suddle fresh smell.</li>
            <li> i feel like its counterfeit but idk, doesnt seem to smell like my other bottle i bought from the store, doesnt seem as strong</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for and it was a steal for the price!</li>
            <li> Like someone else has said, it was much better from department store.  I had a little left from department store bottle and the color and smell was different.  I love the cologne but will never buy through the mail ever again.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite hands down</li>
            <li> Nice, very good....Thank You....!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> love love the smell, price and above the women that this scent is attracting. I wouldn&#x27;t change anything about this product</li>
            <li> This does not smell good. I love lucky you for women but for men... its musky and cheap. The reviews really let me down. I Bought it for my husband for v day. Luckily he likes it. I may just \\&quot;accidently\\&quot; break the bottle so I can buy him something better.Lol! Barf..</li>
            <li> Nice, but I don&#x27;t wear it daily.  I prefer more upscale fragrances, but this was a gift, so I wont complain.</li>
            <li> On time and as described</li>
            <li> Colognes are of course by their very nature subjective. What might smell good to me may not to you, and vice versa. I happen to like this very much, and have been pleased with it&#x27;s staying power. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again. Check it out.</li>
            <li> This cologne makes my eyes burn and water. Of course, maybe I have an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li> This  is  a  great  smelling  cologne!  It&#x27;s  one  of  my  all  time  favorites,  for  sure.  I  had  bought  a  smaller  .5  sized  bottle  at  walmart  for  around  $14.  I  thought  that  since  it  was,  after  all  Lucky  brand,  that  this  was  reasonable.  Anyways,  I  ran  out  of  that  stash  a  couple  weeks  ago,  and  began  looking  on  Amazon..They  never  let  me  down!  There  it  was,  only  this  time,  instead  of  getting  a  .5  bottle  for  $14,  I  got  a  3.4  sized  bottle  for  $18.. And  that  included  the  shipping  as  well!  Great  deal...&lt;br /&gt;  So  anyways, this  cologne  since  the  time  I  first  bought  it,  has  been,  living  up  to  it&#x27;s  name!  Lucky  you..Because  the  last  few  times  I&#x27;ve  went  out  wearing  it,  I  have  indeed,  gotten  Lucky.  Give  it  a  try,  I  promise  you  the  women  will  at  the  very  least  compliment  you! :)</li>
            <li> As described for good price</li>
            <li> I give Lucky You for Men a 5-star rating not because it&#x27;s scent is particularly jaw-droppingly memorable, but because of it&#x27;s price and versatility. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the scent is great, it&#x27;s light and very clean smelling, unique but I wouldn&#x27;t use the word &#x27;memorable&#x27; per say (the scent I would give 4-stars by itself). The real difference is the price, it&#x27;s cheap enough to always have some around and keep buying so it makes a fantastic everyday cologne, plus I feel like I can wear it with pretty much anything; casual, formal, jeans, khakis, anything. Quite simply, you really can&#x27;t lose with Lucky You.</li>
            <li> if you want a fragence that ladies love and wont let go off you this is the one.The brand isnt call lucky you for no reason.</li>
            <li> Fanfuckingtastic! Smells great and love the price....will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great price aaaaaaaaaaaa+++++++++++++++¥+¥</li>
            <li> I always enjoy this scent for my daily, just going to work. received quickly, quality was as expected, no complaints, would order from this company again</li>
            <li> Great clean scent and not to overpowering. Since I started wearing this to work I notice the ladies around the office standing and sitting closer to me and flirting.  Even asking me what cologne it is. Gotten a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Great price! The spray pumps like to mess up though.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and always get compliments on it when I wear it. I wish it would last a little longer is the only con.</li>
            <li> Awesome seller! Prompt and this happens to be the best smelling cologne I have yet to try. It has a sweet and lightly musty scent.</li>
            <li> I have used the Lucky You perfume brand but this one is the best I have eves used. You can use it for any occasion. It smells good.</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband and its my favorite mens cologne and its a nice size bottle</li>
            <li> Have used Lucky Brand Cologne for many years. If I get a compliment for “smelling good” it is usually when I am wearing Lucky Brand.</li>
            <li> With all of the good reviews about Lucky you cologne, I figured I would give it a shot. Everything turned out fine with receiving the proper cologne but I don&#x27;t think it lives up with the hype of all of the other reviews. I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything extravagant but I would give it a 3/10.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whats the deal here. Generally i like basic scents, nothing too fancy. I&#x27;m not sure if they sent me the wrong kind or what but the stuff they scent me completely lacks the masculine scent even old spice has. it&#x27;s really bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this everyday since the new year started and I like it&#x27;s clean, fresh scent that lasts all through the day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my future son-n-law for a Christmas gift and he loved it.  It is the only kind of cologne he wears and my daughter was unable to find it anywhere.  Amazon is awesome, with great products and great prices!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for any young man it makes a perfect a gift for them!</li>
            <li> love it... and received my order FAST!!</li>
            <li> This was a great choice by my girlfriend at the time and I wear it even now. It smells sweet but hey, the ladies love it that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Great scent - light enough for everyday wear, strong enough to not dissipate quickly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice clean cologne</li>
            <li> The men in my life LOVE it. It is a beautiful comforting sent and all the ladies in their lives are drawn to it.</li>
            <li> Just one of my favorite everyday colognes. And at an avg. $18 on Amazon it is very, very affordable...</li>
            <li> I love  the smell of this cologne it smells so good this stuff has been around for such a.long time and time smells good.I&#x27;m glad how fast the package came just in time for christmas</li>
            <li> i bought it becuase the others review say it great, but for me it smells cheap, doesnt last long. in other words im very disappointing whith it.</li>
            <li> My husband just loves this new cologne.  I purchased it off other&#x27;s reviews and what a nice scent it was.  The price was excellent for this product.  You will love it!</li>
            <li> Came on time, my husband loves it</li>
            <li> This is a good size for cologne.Its gonna last you a while even if you use it daily. I keep getting compliments on how I smell and I keep getting asked what I wear so I guess overall I can say I like it and other people like it as well.</li>
            <li> Honestly, doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the one I bought in a department store a few years ago.  Not sure if there was a change in the composition or ingredients.  I used to really enjoy this for special occasions from 2005-2008 when I used to buy it locally.  This just smells, close... but off in some way?  Not sure if a knock off or what.  wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone used to buying it from a department store.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it. We usually purchase the small bottle from wal mart but New York Perfumes had a better deal. We will order again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Never had more compliments on a cologne.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, I bought this for my husband and he wears it everyday.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift. Product was as expected and arrived in a timely manner. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time with Prime!!</li>
            <li> I boight this stray for my boyfriend and couldn&#x27;t smell better. It is a huge bottle for very cheap and was completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Girls like smell nice. You smell nice, girls like you. If you want girls to like you, try to change yourself to be more appealing. Cologne is an easier than growing emotionally</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite men&#x27;s cologne!  I HATE most colognes,the are very overpowering to me and honestly most of them make me nauseous.  This is a very clean, fresh scent that lasts all day.  Finally by boyfriend can wear cologne again!</li>
            <li> On time and exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Love it smells great and last all day can&#x27;t beat the $$$</li>
            <li> A very pleasant, not over powering scent is why I keep using Luck You cologne. I have sensitivity to strong perfumes and  Colognes and this one does not trigger.</li>
            <li> ive been a BIG fan of Lucky you cologne for men and been using this same product for years and for some reason seems like this cologne doesnt smell as strong as my other ones have and doesn&#x27;t last ??? please help i tried to return package and it says i can&#x27;t??? Please help asap!!</li>
            <li> This has been my son&#x27;s favorite for the past 8 years years.  (He&#x27;s now age 28)&lt;br /&gt;Lovely fresh fragrance for a male. Not too perfumy.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this cologne pretty often.  It&#x27;s a good scent - and the reason I say \\&quot;ladies enjoy it - perhaps a little too much\\&quot; is because my house was broken into, and they only took three things in my house for some reason.. This cologne was one of them, believe it or not.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my teenage son. It smells great and the price was outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
