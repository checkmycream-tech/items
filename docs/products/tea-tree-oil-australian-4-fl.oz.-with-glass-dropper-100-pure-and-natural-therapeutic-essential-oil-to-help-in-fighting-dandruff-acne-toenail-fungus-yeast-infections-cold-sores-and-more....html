            <li>Tea tree oil is an absolute Godsend and miracle!!</li>
            <li>At a recent satay in as hotel, the air was scented with something amazing...</li>
            <li>Be sure to take some with you when hiking and camping to put directly on insect bites or blisters</li>
            <li>If something is causing illness, insects of other issues, if you have Tea Tree, Aloe or coconut around, chances are your going to be good..</li>
            <li>I also read where you can put a few drops of tea tree oil with 20-40 drops of witch hazel and make your own acne treatment!</li>
            <li>When my children have a skin rash or a bug bite I make sure to add some and sooths instantly.</li>
            <li>First Botany does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>decided to use the First Botany Tea Tree on his toe.</li>
            <li>have to give a 5 star to First Botany and say it will be the brand we grab when it comes to first aid and Tea tree oil</li>
            <li>I found that the mixture is very soothing to me!</li>
            <li>There are so many different remedies you can do uaing tea oil.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to get this high quality, 100% pure Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li>very very strong smell, but other than that it&#x27;s exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li>The only thing i&#x27;m displeased about is how strong the smell is, but i knew about this before i purchased it since i have read some reviews about the smell.</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle of oil and comes with a dropper just like the photograph.</li>
            <li>this has so many high reviews because it was given free to unsuspecting, easily-influenced people without any prior experience with essential oils.</li>
            <li>It is very high quality</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at a reduced rate to review and found it to be a very high quality product.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and will last FOREVER!</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if it could really help with the dandruff that my husband and I have both been experiencing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money for a natural product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tea Tree Oil is very versatile.</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this for the scalp it helps so much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really really like it.</li>
            <li>They said it made the bites not itch so much.</li>
            <li>I have money to buy the things I really need.</li>
            <li>After purchasing this Australian tea tree oil for other uses, I found out its a great natural insect repellant.</li>
            <li>Its powerful enough to clean anything and fresh enough to lift any mood.</li>
            <li>Love tea tree oil, for facials, mani and pedi days and this dropper doesn&#x27;t appear flimsy like other droppers</li>
            <li>It smells better than other Tea Tree oils I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>Bought this oil mainly for my sunburn and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>especially when I can order it in large doses such as this :) Tea tree assists with a variety of ailments, and this company and product provide just that in their tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind especially since i can just mix it with water or other lotions to reduce the strong smell, to me as long as it is effective</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I am still new to the essential oils, but I love learning about all of their different benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As anyone who has read my reviews knows, I am a natural health consultant and I use essential oils in many of my health related applications.</li>
            <li>Rcvd this today smells good but packaging was damaged also the dropper was broken</li>
            <li>We live in Alabama.  </li>
            <li>and I put a small amount on my pulse points of my neck and wrists and top of my foot.  </li>
            <li>First Botany Cosmeceuticals, the company that sells this product, offers a 100% money back guarantee!  </li>
            <li>The bottle is large and will last me quite a while, even at the rate we are using it.</li>
            <li>It and the pure oils are the only thing, I have found that work.</li>
            <li>Let me be clear.  </li>
            <li>We used it for three nights in his epsom salt foot soak and two drops directly on his toe on the infection.</li>
            <li>You can use this product as an all purpose cleaner, just add a few drops to a spray bottle filled with water.</li>
            <li>They were completely pulverized in their packaging.  </li>
            <li>As a woman of color with natural hair</li>
            <li>Also you can use it as a natural way to relieve sunburns.  </li>
            <li>This smells exactly like Pine Sol and is clearly NOT tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend tea tree oil for lots of household and personal uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too harsh to apply directly to skin and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Its great in insect repellent and for fresh feet.</li>
            <li>To keep germs at bay, spray it on high chairs, car seats, and other high traffic spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a major difference in how my hair feels and looks.</li>
            <li>If they had a bottle of real tea tree to compare this to, they&#x27;d realise this is NOT real tea</li>
            <li>Normally, I use tea tree in my nightly face moisturizer (that is DIY) and in some minor scraps and burn treatments.</li>
            <li>thanks for the discount I only spent 10 cents</li>
            <li>and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /</li>

            <li> The only thing i&#x27;m displeased about is how strong the smell is, but i knew about this before i purchased it since i have read some reviews about the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle of oil and comes with a dropper just like the photograph.</li>
            <li> this has so many high reviews because it was given free to unsuspecting, easily-influenced people without any prior experience with essential oils.</li>
            <li> It is very high quality</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a reduced rate to review and found it to be a very high quality product.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and will last FOREVER!</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if it could really help with the dandruff that my husband and I have both been experiencing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money for a natural product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil is very versatile.</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this for the scalp it helps so much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really really like it.</li>
            <li> They said it made the bites not itch so much.</li>
            <li> I have money to buy the things I really need.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this Australian tea tree oil for other uses, I found out its a great natural insect repellant.</li>
            <li> Its powerful enough to clean anything and fresh enough to lift any mood.</li>
            <li> Love tea tree oil, for facials, mani and pedi days and this dropper doesn&#x27;t appear flimsy like other droppers</li>
            <li> It smells better than other Tea Tree oils I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> Bought this oil mainly for my sunburn and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> especially when I can order it in large doses such as this :) Tea tree assists with a variety of ailments, and this company and product provide just that in their tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind especially since i can just mix it with water or other lotions to reduce the strong smell, to me as long as it is effective</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am still new to the essential oils, but I love learning about all of their different benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As anyone who has read my reviews knows, I am a natural health consultant and I use essential oils in many of my health related applications.</li>
            <li> Rcvd this today smells good but packaging was damaged also the dropper was broken</li>
            <li> We live in Alabama.  </li>
            <li> and I put a small amount on my pulse points of my neck and wrists and top of my foot.  </li>
            <li> First Botany Cosmeceuticals, the company that sells this product, offers a 100% money back guarantee!  </li>
            <li> The bottle is large and will last me quite a while, even at the rate we are using it.</li>
            <li> It and the pure oils are the only thing, I have found that work.</li>
            <li> Let me be clear.  </li>
            <li> We used it for three nights in his epsom salt foot soak and two drops directly on his toe on the infection.</li>
            <li> You can use this product as an all purpose cleaner, just add a few drops to a spray bottle filled with water.</li>
            <li> They were completely pulverized in their packaging.  </li>
            <li> As a woman of color with natural hair</li>
            <li> Also you can use it as a natural way to relieve sunburns.  </li>
            <li> This smells exactly like Pine Sol and is clearly NOT tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend tea tree oil for lots of household and personal uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh to apply directly to skin and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Its great in insect repellent and for fresh feet.</li>
            <li> To keep germs at bay, spray it on high chairs, car seats, and other high traffic spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a major difference in how my hair feels and looks.</li>
            <li> If they had a bottle of real tea tree to compare this to, they&#x27;d realise this is NOT real tea</li>
            <li> Normally, I use tea tree in my nightly face moisturizer (that is DIY) and in some minor scraps and burn treatments.</li>
            <li> thanks for the discount I only spent 10 cents</li>
            <li> and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I wash my  face, neck area as deeply and thoroughly as I usually do then combine 4-5 drops of tea tree oil mixed with maybe 2-3 tablespoons of water, shake it up and then put some on a cotton ball,  gently wipe over neck/cheek area avoiding the eyes and my goodness</li>
            <li> this will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is something that I have tried with other tea tree oils in the past, but this is the first time the results were</li>
            <li> So when I had the opportunity to review this particular product for a small discount I jumped at it.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try out Tea Tree Oil because the description promises to help with dandruff and other skin related issues.</li>
            <li> bottle actually spilled a bit in my mother&#x27;s car over the weekend (due to a leaky lid, so there&#x27;s another problem).</li>
            <li> For dandruff and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Also when my skin feels itchy and dry</li>
            <li> I was really tired of having to come inside at an early hour because I was getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.</li>
            <li> The loose skin was just washing out.</li>
            <li> The dropper on mine was broken when I got this batch, but I&#x27;m positive it was after, because it was bubble wrapped and shattered in one place as if someone crunched it..</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try essential oils but was a bit leery and didn&#x27;t want to waste the money.</li>
            <li> Its like milk, bread, shampoo and every other item you would notice if you didn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> Like I say with all the other reviews I do.</li>
            <li> Other tea tree oil products have just about burned my nose hairs off.  </li>
            <li> A few drops go a long way.  </li>
            <li> 15 drops in a quart of water can be an effective insect repellent.</li>
            <li> and her swelling had went down to along with the redness.</li>
            <li> The bottle feels a little heavy and it comes with a glass dropper.</li>
            <li> Due to one family member not wanting to bother with the shampooing, washing, etc, we had them for a freaking MONTH!!  </li>
            <li> Try using a few drops in the bath.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops to dishwasher dispenser, then fill with a green dishwashing soap.</li>
            <li> A few drops added to each load of laundry leave your clothes smelling cleaner.</li>
            <li> Or even read about it, you don&#x27;t know what your missing..</li>
            <li> I have been adding a few drops into a small travel size shampoo bottle along with some water and using it on my hair.</li>
            <li> Add a small amount to shampoo to destroy head lice.</li>
            <li> In the past few days though my husband had a horrible toe infection and there was no way we could get in to see a doctor since most were booked solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A small amount added to your bath can help with persistent body odor.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount.  </li>
            <li> There is no more infection and he has no more pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Putting a few drops in your shampoo can be a lice repellent.  </li>
            <li> But was disappointed when I opened the package to find the glass dropper broken ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> Both dangerous and disappointing.</li>
            <li> She always has hated Pine Sol</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Tea tree oil has so many great uses. I have used it in cleaning products before. I wanted to see if it could really help with the dandruff that my husband and I have both been experiencing. The dropper that comes with this product makes it easy to use, without worrying about getting it on your hands. I have been adding a few drops into a small travel size shampoo bottle along with some water and using it on my hair. I&#x27;ve noticed a major difference in how my hair feels and looks.

ALL OPINIONS EXPRESSED HERE ARE MY OWN.</li>
            <li> Love tea tree oil, for facials, mani and pedi days and this dropper doesn&#x27;t appear flimsy like other droppers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to get this high quality, 100% pure Tea Tree Oil. I&#x27;ve been starting to learn about aromatherapy and using different oils for different purposes. Tea Tree Oil is very versatile. Tea Tree Oil is often called a &amp;#34;medicine cabinet in a bottle&amp;#34;. I have used Tea Tree oil for toenail fungus and for eliminating mold from window frames. I received this item in return for a reduced price in return for an honest reveiw. Here are some uses for Tea Tree Oil and I&#x27;m sure I will use the oil for a lot of them:  20 Great Ways to Use Tea Tree Oil  FOR HEALTH  1. Use a dab to treat acne. 2. An anti-fungal for treating Athleteâ€™s Foot, eczema, various yeast infections, etc. 3. An antiseptic to be used on cuts and burns. 4. An anti-viral: it may lessen the symptoms of colds and flu. Try using a few drops in the bath. 5. Add to a vaporizer to loosen chest congestion. 6. Add a small amount to shampoo to destroy head lice. 7. A small amount added to your bath can help with persistent body odor. 8. Treating sinus infection. 9. For dandruff and dry scalp. 10. In the form of aromatherapy, tea tree oil is used to treat colds, persistent coughs, acne, toothaches, and sunburn.  FOR CLEANING  11. To create an all-purpose cleaner, combine 2 teaspoons of tea tree oil in 2 cups of water in a spray bottle. 12. Another version would be 14 ounces of water with 1 ounce of Murphyâ€™s oil soap and 10 drops of tea tree oil. 13. Mix the above solution with kosher salt to scrub bathtub and bathroom tiles. 14. Add a few drops to dishwasher dispenser, then fill with a green dishwashing soap. 15. A few drops added to each load of laundry leave your clothes smelling cleaner. 16. Control mold with a tea tree oil/water spray. 17. Remove mustiness with that same tea tree oil/water spray. 18. To keep germs at bay, spray it on high chairs, car seats, and other high traffic spots. 19. 15 drops in a quart of water can be an effective insect repellent. 20. Be sure to take some with you when hiking and camping to put directly on insect bites or blisters</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is a product that should be in everyone&#x27;s home, because there are many benefits to using this product. I always make sure to have some in my house. Tea tree like from first botany is one the best ones. Comes in a bottle of 4 oz. this will last you a long time. Comes with a easy to use glass dropper.  This tea tree oil is pure and natural so you know you are getting the best premium quality product. It is concentrated extract that can be used for many things. Some of the ways I use this product are for sun burns. It calms my skin and helps it get better soon.  Also when my skin feels itchy and dry I apply a small amount.  When my children have a skin rash or a bug bite I make sure to add some and sooths instantly. My children like it and they also like the smell. I think it makes them relax. I also use this for my head. When I have dandruff and my scalp itches I apply some. I really do recommend this for the scalp it helps so much.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Bought this oil mainly for my sunburn and it worked really well. I&#x27;ve had this sunburn on my hand for 8 weeks now and hasn&#x27;t fully healed yet but after using it for 2 days the peeling skin on the burn has stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Before i used this oil i have been using body lotion on my burn for almost 2 months and it did almost nothing but after using this oil, i can&#x27;t say how amazing it is in just 2 days, the results are great. The only thing i&#x27;m displeased about is how strong the smell is, but i knew about this before i purchased it since i have read some reviews about the smell. I really don&#x27;t mind especially since i can just mix it with water or other lotions to reduce the strong smell, to me as long as it is effective that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> I love the product. But was disappointed when I opened the package to find the glass dropper broken ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> I got this item to do a product review it is excellent quality as well as the best package d I&#x27;ve seen. It arrived it perfect shape</li>
            <li> First Botany has a very nice tea tree! Its deliciously pine fresh scent is a vacation to the senses. Its powerful enough to clean anything and fresh enough to lift any mood. I was given a discount to review this oil and I do love it. First Botany makes really good tea tree. Its great in insect repellent and for fresh feet. Its wonderful in homemade cleaners. I like the quality of the oil, dropper and bottle. I would recommend this oil to my friends.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m trying this to see if it works on toenail fungus so too soon to tell, but the delivery in 2 days was great!</li>
            <li> Product for review: I love tea tree oil....especially when I can order it in large doses such as this :) Tea tree assists with a variety of ailments, and this company and product provide just that in their tea tree oil. I highly recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li> Great product. Received at a lower price for a review. Product smelled awesome and is good for lots of ailments when mixed with a carrier oil .</li>
            <li> I was really excited when the chance to review this product came up. I had been wanting to try essential oils but was a bit leery and didn&#x27;t want to waste the money. I have only tried it in my home cleaning solution and wool dryer balls but I already love it! It smells so good, I added 7 drops to my dryer ball and it gave just enough that my laundry smelled great without being overpowering. I love using it in my home made cleaner, like the dryer balls it gives just the right amount that my home smells relaxing. I am so happy I was able to review this product and look forward to trying this more!</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is an amazing alternative to Tylenol/IB Profin for migraines. I started using it years ago. First Botany does not disappoint. The product arrived on time and intact. They even sent a follow up email to make sure that I was satisfied. This is a large bottle of oil and comes with a dropper just like the photograph. The packaging is great and the product is better. It is very high quality and you can smell that it does not have any additional chemicals. I would recommend this for its MANY uses. The company is reliable and has a pristine quality product. A discount was given for my review.</li>
            <li> Rcvd this today smells good but packaging was damaged also the dropper was broken</li>
            <li> As anyone who has read my reviews knows, I am a natural health consultant and I use essential oils in many of my health related applications. Normally, I use tea tree in my nightly face moisturizer (that is DIY) and in some minor scraps and burn treatments. In the past few days though my husband had a horrible toe infection and there was no way we could get in to see a doctor since most were booked solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use the First Botany Tea Tree on his toe. We used it for three nights in his epsom salt foot soak and two drops directly on his toe on the infection. It cleared up within 3 days. There is no more infection and he has no more pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something that I have tried with other tea tree oils in the past, but this is the first time the results were so quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give a 5 star to First Botany and say it will be the brand we grab when it comes to first aid and Tea tree oil remedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I need to note that I did receive this bottle from the company to review)</li>
            <li> Have been using it twice daily and can see a difference.  I would highly recommend this product- Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a great oil to have around the house! Lots of uses for just one oil. It&#x27;s great for both antiseptic and anti-fungal treatments. You can use this product as an all purpose cleaner, just add a few drops to a spray bottle filled with water. Use it homemade detergents, deodorants and toothpastes. Great purchase price for such a huge bottle of this amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>

            <li> Since Recieving this tea tree oil I have mixed it in with my shampoo, conditioner, face wash, body wash, and moisturizer. If you can&#x27;t tell... I love this product. I also mixed in a drop of peppermint oil into all of these products together. I found that the mixture is very soothing to me! I am still new to the essential oils, but I love learning about all of their different benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PROCE FOR MY HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is something every household should have. There are so many different remedies you can do uaing tea oil. The bottlw was a great size. I really really like it. I was impressed with the seller notifing me with my shipping info and especially since I recieved it exactly when stated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this Tea Tree oil to add in a cleaning agent; love the scent and keeps bugs away. Many purposes antibacterial/antifungal and feels helps acne better then anything I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I decided to try out Tea Tree Oil because the description promises to help with dandruff and other skin related issues. My kids all have cradle cap. They&#x27;ve had it all their lives and they are 5, 4 and 2 now. I have tried so many things and nothing has helped. Their dad uses special shampoo for his dandruff so I had just given up. This was my last effort. Well, I was not disappointed. After one day of applying it to the kids&#x27; heads with the handy dropper that comes with the bottle, their cradle cap is already clearing up. The loose skin was just washing out. So cool! Plus, the kids like having it put on. They said it tickles and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it did so well with their cradle cap, I tried it out on their boo boos and bug bites. They said it made the bites not itch so much. The bottle is large and will last me quite a while, even at the rate we are using it. We will definitely be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount on this product to try it out and give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I received this quickly and felt it was worth the price I paid for it. Tea Tree Oil is a fix all in my opinion - every household should have it on hand I love this tea tree oil for treating the fungus under my toenails. It and the pure oils are the only thing, I have found that work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is quality tea tree oil, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  At a recent satay in as hotel, the air was scented with something amazing...clean, beautiful not overpowering scent.  I asked what is was and they told me their housekeeping staff uses it and they thought it was something with tea tree oil.  Well this was nothing like the hotel scent.  The item was packaged well and arrived quickly, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great product. It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil  FOR REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEA TREE OIL IS USED BY MY WIFE FOR MANY THINGS , HAIR SKIN, TOES I THINK ITS USED FOR EVERYTHING IN HER BOOK , SHE COMPLIMENTED ME ON THE PURCHASE A THANK YOU AND WONDER OFF WITH IT</li>
            <li> Never run out of tea tree oil. Its like milk, bread, shampoo and every other item you would notice if you didn&#x27;t have it. If you&#x27;ve never used it.. Or even read about it, you don&#x27;t know what your missing.. But you should.. Like I say with all the other reviews I do. I&#x27;m not going to spout off the same stuff you read above.. I, myself, just learned about this last year, when my granddaughter brought lice (YEAHHH LICE!!!) I had a nightmare with  lice when my own kids when they were in grade school.. Due to one family member not wanting to bother with the shampooing, washing, etc, we had them for a freaking MONTH!!  After spending hundreds of dollars and hours and hours of shampooing, washing, picking ( One 4 hour pick-fest put me in the hospital when my back went out) and fogging, I finally learned that in addition to one of the kids bringing them back in, the others could be getting resistant to the medication (even the prescriptions). I started researching and learned about Mayonnaise.. That did the trick, but I tortured my kids with sleeping with shower caps and greasy handfuls of it on the livingroom floor for 4 days... I was done playing!!! I was just done!! years later, my granddaughter is living with us.. Thank God I have blood that repels mosquitos, fleas, lice, etc, but I have a daughter that is like honey to them.. This time after searching I learned about coconut oil and tea tree oil. I have stocked up and have multiple brands an types of both.. I haven&#x27;t seen anything, besides Aloe Vera, that has so many uses.. If something is causing illness, insects of other issues, if you have Tea Tree, Aloe or coconut around, chances are your going to be good.. The dropper on mine was broken when I got this batch, but I&#x27;m positive it was after, because it was bubble wrapped and shattered in one place as if someone crunched it.. Luckily I&#x27;m so used to using this, I no longer bother with a dropper.. This stuff it like gold..&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;br /&gt;MY No Nonsense Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt; I could copy the description or retell you that you have already read in the description, But you&#x27;ve already read it. I will try and tell you what I see, Smell, hear, what happens, and my opinion as well as I can. So it&#x27;s easier for you decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you&#x27;re wanting to give someone. I have money to buy the things I really need. However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description.&lt;br /&gt;As a frugal shopper that I am, I used a coupon code for this item in order to purchase and review this product. I use coupon codes that I receive before I purchase the items I use and shop on discount site regardless  and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /&gt; I have no connection to this seller and I shop for items I use in my home or give as gifts. I have never been offered anything in return and at times I give no feedback. My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item. I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review and very often I donâ€™t spellcheck or my dyslexia takes over.. But I will do my best to be honest with you.</li>
            <li> good aromatherapy is my favorite and I use it daily</li>
            <li> After purchasing this Australian tea tree oil for other uses, I found out its a great natural insect repellant. I&#x27;ll update when I try that out! I dilute this and use it to treat acne, but I&#x27;m also going to test it out on a family members&#x27; possible foot fungal infection. I&#x27;ll update my review with my results. This oil has so many different uses, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a ton more I don&#x27;t even know about yet! I&#x27;d highly recommend it. It&#x27;s a very useful household product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this during a promotional period. These are my honest opinions.</li>
            <li> Great quality Tea Tree essential oil with a nice pure scent.  Its gonna work great in all my homemade healthcare products.  I also love using it alone for skin problems with and without a carrier oil.  A great anti-bacterial product provided by nature.  Works in my house in place of neosporin.  A must have in any emergency first-aid kit.  I purchased this product at a reduced rate to review and found it to be a very high quality product.</li>
            <li> Let me be clear.  I have no issue at all with the oil itself.  That I&#x27;m very satisfied with.  My issue is with the glass pipette that shipped with the bottle.  I ordered two bottles, and both arrived with shattered pipettes.  They were completely pulverized in their packaging.  Both dangerous and disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great tea tree oil. Not as good as Aura Cacia, but for the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> As a woman of color with natural hair I use tea tree oil in my hair products. This brand is fantastic! Its not diluted, you can smell it through the box. The bottle feels a little heavy and it comes with a glass dropper. I cowash my hair and add this to the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount for my true and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how potent this is. It smells better than other Tea Tree oils I&#x27;ve had before. The bottle is huge and will last FOREVER! I use it for everything from acne to hair care to mixing with cellulite cream and wrapping with it. Pretty sure it would be awesome as a cleaner too! It&#x27;s not too harsh to apply directly to skin and it absorbs quickly. So glad I purchased this one, it&#x27;s like it honestly is &#x27;the best tea tree oil&#x27;!</li>
            <li> We live in Alabama.  If you aren&#x27;t aware the state bird here is the MOSQUITO!  After doing some research I found that tea tree oil helps repel them.  So when I had the opportunity to review this particular product for a small discount I jumped at it.  I was really tired of having to come inside at an early hour because I was getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. Well, last night we put it to the test.  My daughter and I seem to be the most hit by the mosquitoes and I put a small amount on my pulse points of my neck and wrists and top of my foot.  I actually made it!  No bug bites.  I am also a big diy person.  I also read where you can put a few drops of tea tree oil with 20-40 drops of witch hazel and make your own acne treatment! I am trying that as well.  Putting a few drops in your shampoo can be a lice repellent.  Also you can use it as a natural way to relieve sunburns.  Trust me when I tell you this is a great product.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it in so mnay ways!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:4e324eb75610f59f340d969e20e8772]]Another GREAT product ! A perfect NATURAL alternative ! A am extremely pleased I was able to test this Essential Oil..</li>
            <li> The First Botany Cosmeceuticals Best Tea Tree Oil is much better smelling than any other tea tree oil I&#x27;ve smelled before.  Other tea tree oil products have just about burned my nose hairs off.  The First Botany Cosmeceuticals Best Tea Tree Oil is actually so pleasant that I keep opening the bottle to sniff it just to make sure I really received Tea Tree Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to use it in some of my homemade bath and body products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
            <li> Awee my tea tree oil obssession continues!  Man, i keep buying this product over and over and I keep reviewing it! Tea tree oil is an absolute Godsend and miracle!! I wash my  face, neck area as deeply and thoroughly as I usually do then combine 4-5 drops of tea tree oil mixed with maybe 2-3 tablespoons of water, shake it up and then put some on a cotton ball,  gently wipe over neck/cheek area avoiding the eyes and my goodness the amount of dirt/makeup/grime that this removes is remarkable!  Plus the smell is awesome and it has a slight tingle feeling that I LOVE!  I&#x27;d be lost without!</li>
            <li> This smells exactly like Pine Sol and is clearly NOT tea tree oil. I know tea tree oil, and this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle actually spilled a bit in my mother&#x27;s car over the weekend (due to a leaky lid, so there&#x27;s another problem). When I opened her car door, I remarked &amp;#34;ooh, your car smells like Pine Sol!&amp;#34; and she showed me the bottle. She had to air her car out before driving and days later, the chemical scent remains and she has constant headaches. She always has hated Pine Sol so that&#x27;s no surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a chemical &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent that will really last, an ultra concentrated Pine Sol chemical odor... buy this!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for tea tree essential oil... avoid avoid avoid, and do some research before buying one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be frank... this has so many high reviews because it was given free to unsuspecting, easily-influenced people without any prior experience with essential oils. If they had a bottle of real tea tree to compare this to, they&#x27;d realise this is NOT real tea tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this free in return for my review and opinions after use.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I use it to add tea tree oil to my body wash and  my body lotion.  A few drops go a long way.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> very very strong smell, but other than that it&#x27;s exactly what i was looking for</li>
