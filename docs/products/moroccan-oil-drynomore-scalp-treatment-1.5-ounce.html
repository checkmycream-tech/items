            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love MoroccanOil products, but this one did not work for me.</li>
            <li>Love all of them.</li>
            <li>This product is an excellent product for those that have dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>great stuff makes my scalp really healthy and my hair too so glad my hairdresser told me about it last time</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and easy to massage the scalp.</li>
            <li>BUT it has a strong oder.</li>
            <li>Using this product along with the hydrating shampoo and conditioner has significantly improved the dryness of my scalp.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it helps so much with the scalp dryness...</li>
            <li>This is a good product for dry hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>It does not leave hair feeling greasy but just smooth and shiny in a healthy way and scalp is not dry anymore</li>
            <li>I use it when my scalp feels a little itchy and it works great.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other products for a much cheaper price that is equally effective in meeting your hair needs.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy even despite dying ans styling due to having a healthy scalp</li>
            <li>Excellent product for dry weather and dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I used it once or twice per week and why the dry scalp persists, between this and using sulfite free shampoo, it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>later i&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>Lastly, this product has not direct reflection on the seller, who provided great service</li>
            <li>No weird flakes on his sweaters.</li>
            <li>and I guess I have more severe dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s certainly not a dramatic difference.  </li>
            <li>It really helped my daugher with cradle cap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive but works great.</li>
            <li>Every winter he kind of turns into a human snow globe, his scalp starts to produce some very festive &amp;#34;snow.&amp;#34; In the years past he&#x27;s been using dandruff shampoo without much help, so we tried this.</li>
            <li>Then wash your hair normally.</li>
            <li>and it controls my flakes completely.</li>
            <li>I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get the oil off my hair near the roots.</li>
            <li>Seems to last a while (you don&#x27;t need much).</li>
            <li>I think this is only for mild dry scalp</li>
            <li>All you have to do is apply it to dry scalp areas, wait a few minutes, rub it in and wait 10-20 more minutes.</li>
            <li>I was really wanted this product to work because I like all the other Moroccan Oil products like their shampoo and conditioner.</li>

            <li> For those that have dry itchy scalp, knows you must use a product for your scalp condition on a regular basis, by your second or third use, the bottle is done.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for several weeks with no improvement for my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s lasting longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Our hair stylist recommend we try this for dry scalp and itching.  </li>
            <li> I think this has made a difference in the dry scalp I get in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> If you suffer from a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My husband has a VERY dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have used it several times with little effect on my scalp or hair.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not cheap enough for that not to matter.</li>
            <li> but you basically have to use it at least once a week and with such a small bottle it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> This, however, is an expensive product that does not yield much in the way of results.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy oil so be careful not to over use the product or your hair will be \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I wish it cost less though.</li>
            <li> Only use a small amount to problem areas before washing and no more itching or flaking.</li>
            <li> it does help a little</li>
            <li> It also make my hair a little oily which my hair never gets oily.  </li>
            <li> I used this product a few times a week as the instructions told me</li>
            <li> It penetrates the pores, and hair creating a gloss w/ out creating an oily heavy weight look to the hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> no more flakes</li>
            <li> I felt like it left a film and my hair was dirty.  </li>
            <li> I have vicious dry scalp and this definitely helped.</li>
            <li> this is a very small bottle, that is too expensive.</li>
            <li> When I told her how disappointed I was, she stopped telling her clients to use it.  </li>

            <li> I am an African American woman with seborrheic dermatitis. Using this product along with the hydrating shampoo and conditioner has significantly improved the dryness of my scalp.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are great. This, however, is an expensive product that does not yield much in the way of results.</li>
            <li> Our hair stylist recommend we try this for dry scalp and itching.  My husband has a VERY dry scalp.  I rub this in once a month and it has made quite a difference. He sleeps with it in overnight and washes out in the morning. He gets a free head massage out of the deal too! I use it when my scalp feels a little itchy and it works great.</li>
            <li> I think this has made a difference in the dry scalp I get in the winter months.  But as you can tell from the title of my post it&#x27;s certainly not a dramatic difference.  I also seem too need to use a lot of the product to cover my entire scalp.  Considering the size of this tiny bottle I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll go through it in no time.  And it&#x27;s not cheap enough for that not to matter.</li>
            <li> Never worked for my scalp. I found it to be a great pre-treatment for hair though.</li>
            <li> It seems to take quite a bit if you follow the instructions... it does help a little but you basically have to use it at least once a week and with such a small bottle it won&#x27;t last long. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it helps so much with the scalp dryness... I tried dandruff shampoos but I started getting the keratin done and you can use sodium shampoos. I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year now and it controls my flakes completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I have vicious dry scalp and this definitely helped. I wish it cost less though.I used it once or twice per week and why the dry scalp persists, between this and using sulfite free shampoo, it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> I love this item. It really helped my daugher with cradle cap. It was easy to apply and easy to massage the scalp. BUT it has a strong oder. Must wash hair good:)</li>
            <li> For the amount of money you pay for the product, you would expect more results.  I tried this product for several weeks with no improvement for my dry scalp.  My amazing hair dresser recommended this. When I told her how disappointed I was, she stopped telling her clients to use it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for dry weather and dry scalp. I bought it for my husband and he loves it! It relieves the fastidious itching, dryness and &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; we sometimes mistake for dandruff.</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times a week as the instructions told me and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  I think this is only for mild dry scalp and I guess I have more severe dry scalp.  What I didn&#x27;t like about the oil is that no matter how well I washed my hair after I used it I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get the oil off my hair near the roots. I felt like it left a film and my hair was dirty.  It also make my hair a little oily which my hair never gets oily.  I was really wanted this product to work because I like all the other Moroccan Oil products like their shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from a dry scalp. I say try this product. I put it on at night. In the morning wash my hair and.....no more flakes</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent product for those that have dry itchy scalp. It penetrates the pores, and hair creating a gloss w/ out creating an oily heavy weight look to the hair. The reason I gave it 3 stars is b/c this is a very small bottle, that is too expensive. For those that have dry itchy scalp, knows you must use a product for your scalp condition on a regular basis, by your second or third use, the bottle is done. I&#x27;m sure there are other products for a much cheaper price that is equally effective in meeting your hair needs. I hope i have been helpful prior to your purchase. If not, you will provide a not so happy feedback later i&#x27;m sure. Lastly, this product has not direct reflection on the seller, who provided great service, this is solely on the product itself.</li>
            <li> I have used moraccon oil for years and I love it. My hair is healthy even despite dying ans styling due to having a healthy scalp</li>
            <li> I love MoroccanOil products, but this one did not work for me. I have used it several times with little effect on my scalp or hair.</li>
            <li> great stuff makes my scalp really healthy and my hair too so glad my hairdresser told me about it last time I went</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. Every winter he kind of turns into a human snow globe, his scalp starts to produce some very festive &amp;#34;snow.&amp;#34; In the years past he&#x27;s been using dandruff shampoo without much help, so we tried this. He&#x27;s used this once a week for about 3 weeks and he says there is no itch anymore. No weird flakes on his sweaters. Very happy! Seems to last a while (you don&#x27;t need much). Smells great too. His hair doesn&#x27;t seem oily at all after washing, the product has a very light, non-greasy feeling. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again when he runs out.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, especially in the winter. All you have to do is apply it to dry scalp areas, wait a few minutes, rub it in and wait 10-20 more minutes. Then wash your hair normally. It does not leave hair feeling greasy but just smooth and shiny in a healthy way and scalp is not dry anymore</li>
            <li> This is a good product for dry hair and scalp. This is a heavy oil so be careful not to over use the product or your hair will be \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I use this 2 twice a week and works great. Only use a small amount to problem areas before washing and no more itching or flaking. It&#x27;s expensive but works great. I have used 1/2 a bottle in 6 weeks so it&#x27;s lasting longer than expected.</li>
            <li> The whole line of products are awesome! Love all of them. The smell lovely and work like charm!!! Used this one, shampoo, conditioner and moose. All great!</li>
