            <li>I bought this trimmer for my fiance to replace one that he&#x27;d had for a good eight years.  </li>
            <li>Once I got the plastic head on it, I loved using it.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>too they do a good job.</li>
            <li>Good to use it for a change.</li>
            <li>Delivered on time in good condition despite inclement weather.</li>
            <li>Otherwise robust and good value.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as the guard system that contains separate guard combs you attach one at a time.  </li>
            <li>Good quality and I trust this brand of trimmer.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone that needs a good rechargeable mustache &amp;/or beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Good razor.</li>
            <li>i think the battery is good and its have Good shape&lt;</li>
            <li>It also took me a good 10 minutes to figure out how the trimmer guard fits on the unit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of a Rubik&#x27;s cube predicament, but once you figure it out you are good</li>
            <li>It also took me a good 10 minutes to figure out how the trimmer guard fits on the unit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of a Rubik&#x27;s cube predicament, but once you figure it out you are good</li>
            <li>Beard never looked so good.</li>
            <li>Hopefully an improvement over the MB200 which was a good design paired with a wimpy power supply (battery).</li>
            <li>A good value.</li>
            <li>Loved this product and used it sparingly for 10 months.</li>
            <li>Good size, holds a charge, cuts off my face hair.</li>
            <li>Feel free to post any questions in the comments below, I&#x27;ll do my best to answer them.</li>
            <li>If the battery is that good, then it deserves all 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>Also packs a lot of power along with its good design.</li>
            <li>Fits good in my hand.</li>
            <li>but the beard trimmer does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>It probably does a good job for longer beards</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer for my son a couple of years ago and he loved it.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.  </li>
            <li>Good luck in your search if you are like me</li>
            <li>loved, here are the reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Initially, I loved this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t look good on me</li>
            <li>but I could not get the power needed for a good trim.  </li>
            <li>It also worked surprisingly well on the ol&#x27; stache as well.  </li>
            <li>But battery life is good and there have been no pulled hairs.</li>
            <li>So I bought the best trimmer I could find for the price of the cheap trimmers I was buying before.</li>
            <li>This is a good trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Appears to be well made with good trim lines</li>
            <li>Unit also holds a good charge.</li>
            <li>This is a really good beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and the motor works great!</li>
            <li>Excellent product that delivers a close shave and clean lines.</li>
            <li>works great, and come with 3 blades (never had that before) and the guide goes on and off for cleaning very easily.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge great and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Best part is the cost, a true value.</li>
            <li>very easy to use and a very nice cut .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I just have exceptionally stubborn stubble or what,</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t tried the stubble beard before and wasn&#x27;t sure what would be the best tool, but after reading reviews this one was recommended and it works fantastic!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this one especialy since the Wahl would no longer hold a charge for more than a day at most.  </li>
            <li>It looks great, cuts great, and does not feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>Trims real easily but hair does go everywhere.</li>
            <li>While most of the reviews are correct, this is a great beard trimmer for the price, it&#x27;s still on the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; side of the beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this and would recommend it to anyone needing a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Does a great job trimming mustache, love everything about it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great trimmer WAY better than the cheaper Remington.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, long-lasting battery, powerful motor.  </li>
            <li>well, so I am very satisfied</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the trimmer&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall very satisfied with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Happy styling :)  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver, The blades included are great.</li>
            <li>The husband is very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>after searching everywhere ..and reading all the reviews .. I decided on this one..and am so very glad I did..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very safe, never nicks my skin or cuts me.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the way this clipper holds a charge and never seems to lose power.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>He was also impressed with the fact that the trimmer had been been unplugged for three weeks and still had a charge like freshly charged.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, and would have been better it</li>
            <li>This Remington trimmer cuts much better and the trim height setting works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy for sure.</li>
            <li>I used to own a Phillips Norelco which I just loved.</li>
            <li>Good if you are grooming a beard, but it doesn&#x27;t work to keep a nice stubble look.</li>
            <li>interchangeable heads are a nice bonus, good for detail work.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have a good beard trimmer now.</li>
            <li>Best of all the price is right.</li>
            <li>Feels good in my hand, and the combs are very easily adjusted with the roller.  </li>
            <li>Perfect exactly what I need after No shave November.</li>
            <li>They also love it!</li>
            <li>will return to Wisconsin (at my cost) under warrenty to see if another unit performs better (or at all)!</li>
            <li>It is excellent and is exactly what I was wanting to groom my circle beard.</li>
            <li>I have much better hopes for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Remington!</li>
            <li>: Guard doesn&#x27;t always provide the best trim on first couple passes</li>
            <li>I look handsome when I&#x27;m finished!</li>
            <li>So, since using this trimmer for 7 months, it paid for itself, and more!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and excellent battery life.</li>
            <li>You will be pleased!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Had it over a year now and love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>You would have to make sure you could return it with the packaging in pieces!</li>
            <li>i love this thing!</li>
            <li>Love this shaver!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s water proof!  </li>
            <li>Top notch customer service on part of Panasonic!</li>
            <li>Quick and easy review: Great trimmer, Very good attachments.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>This was a very good buy at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Works great, great power, easy to use and easy to adjust the height.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and cuts great...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek, easy to handle and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I put the stubble blade on, set it to the closest setting, and I get a great, easy shave that leaves me with what looks like 1-2 days of stubble growth.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed to see Remington&#x27;s quick and sincere comment on my post.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth feel on my face and trims fairly well.</li>
            <li>Does a great job, fast and easy Very happy with decision.</li>
            <li>Works fine for pubes though, lol</li>
            <li>Very nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Ive have since bought a Phllips BG2040 that is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing battery life.</li>
            <li>For about $30, the Remington MB4040 is a great product.ng you need to enjoy any kind of hair trimming.</li>
            <li>Battery life is absolutely amazing, haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet</li>
            <li>No matter what direction you shave your beard, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing battery life.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job at trimming goatee to a precise length.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Great product, smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>However Amazon was amazing and fix ling this issue with me.</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>He had been wanting another one and then this one became available and he is a happy camper again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has great power and glides across my face smoothly.</li>
            <li>He said it trimmed evenly, it felt great on his face, and gave him a smooth trim.</li>
            <li>Nice design Remington.</li>
            <li>The adjustable mechanism is really handy, sturdy, and easy-to-use.</li>
            <li>My wahl trimmer took many passes and was never as good.  </li>
            <li>It trims very close when you need it to, and the adjustable length attachment works flawlessly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great battery &amp; overall great razor!  </li>
            <li>Im sure some people are happy with this product, but Remington is producing to many defective units.</li>
            <li>It also feels nice in the hand.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable comb is a nice feature, too.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a razor with this kind of power and battery life, together.  </li>
            <li>Nice to see it doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in every day to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Remington are known to be good products, I might get one more for my brother</li>
            <li>It is a nice trimmer &amp; I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Honestly to do the 3 day stubble trim with this thing takes forever and still doesn&#x27;t get everything even.</li>
            <li>nice thing about the MB4040 is it holds a charge seemingly forever.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job of closely trimming my mustache (use it at the lowest level), and maintains the goat effectively at any length I choose..</li>
            <li>Nice design for ease of use.</li>
            <li>adjustment is nice, stays locked in place when using.</li>
            <li>Nice unit.</li>
            <li>For the more afordable clippers out there, the Remington is great, much better than its predecessor.</li>
            <li>like the size/weight of this trimmer--it fits nicely in my hand and feels like it is a quality product.  </li>
            <li>The guard works, but honestly is rather sketchy.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer - wish it had a mode below &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I own 2 of these and use them to shave my head as well as for my beard.</li>
            <li>The height wheel is really nice - at #2 or #3, I get a nice &amp;#34;three day stubble look&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Overall, excellent buy and my wife is happy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>battery life is very impressive, it will not drain much when put on shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li>I own, because its battery is wearing out.</li>
            <li>I have a cheaper shaver that isn&#x27;t as nice</li>
            <li>Really nice razor.</li>
            <li>and I had to go over my beard a good 8 times to make sure nothing was missed.  </li>
            <li>It has plenty of power and trims nice and neat.</li>
            <li>Thanks Remington, for a great product!</li>
            <li>After a good cleaning/oiling, it works better than it did out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shape is kind of awkward&lt;</li>
            <li>But hair will often find its way inside under the blades where they then get stuck in the factory applied grease so that is kind of a pain.</li>
            <li>honestly, you were probably looking at some $200 trimmer, and i&#x27;ve had like 3 of those, and they all break, and</li>
            <li>Kind of a bummer.  </li>
            <li>so I am exited about this being cordless, lighweight and does a nice job of manscaping.</li>
            <li>The heads appear to be well-designed and are nicely finished.</li>
            <li>This trimmer cuts really well, and the accessories and range of trimmer lengths make it an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Nice looking.</li>
            <li>Fits my hand nicely.</li>
            <li>The goatee trimmer is perfect for edges, and the stubble trimmer is very</li>
            <li>Angle it on as you gently push,, and it&#x27;s perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is so neat and effective for trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li>Nice razor.  </li>
            <li>so i assumed this would be just as good with a better battery.  </li>
            <li>He is thrilled with it and wants everyone to know what a wonderful product this is.</li>
            <li>Falling to the floor immediately causes them to spring apart, effectively breaking the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remington - you and others who do this kind of thing need to understand this.</li>
            <li>the 9 length of the trimmer is even more good about it.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I did not like Norelco a lot</li>
            <li>I keep forgetting which is which, so it would be nice if they had some markings to tell the difference; you have to remember which shape does what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it about 3-4 times a week to trim my beard and it keeps everything nice and even.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job taming my beard.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I decided to tempt fate and use the device to detail the sides of my goatee so that they were nice and symmetrical.</li>
            <li>but the goatee blade is nice for precision.</li>
            <li>nice design</li>
            <li>it includes a nice set of blades.</li>
            <li>use at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I like the variety of heads, and the blade guard is effective.</li>
            <li>Nice hum.  </li>
            <li>That kind of hurts.. Would not reccomend</li>
            <li>think this is a nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for the excellent return policy!</li>
            <li>This razor cuts nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another nice feature of the trimmer is the size and shape of it.  </li>
            <li>Handy and works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before this battery situation, I really liked this trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and portable--both lightweight and wireless.</li>
            <li>The guy who used this really liked it.  </li>
            <li>This is just what we were hoping for for a trimmer for my son&#x27;s use, which is to keep his beard at a tidy</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a nice trimmer for a while</li>
            <li>This also has a nice dial for the adjustable hair length comb.</li>
            <li>do their job nicely.  </li>
            <li>The Remington MB4040 does a nice job and the battery seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li>Does need its own storage stand.</li>
            <li>Nice feel, comb does not allow for close shave and trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a Phillips stubble trimmer before this, and really liked it, but</li>
            <li>and it works as great as the first time!!</li>
            <li>It holds a great charge and is very powerful.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not the best designed clipper, but it gets the job done &amp; very nicely.  </li>
            <li>Good quality for a fair amount of money, that&#x27;s disturbingly rare to find nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a great job at trimming body hair with the length setting attachment, but it was originally designed for beards</li>
            <li>I would happy to return the original and replace it..</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for an older model, and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Outstanding battery life and trims easily with great consistency.</li>
            <li>It works great, no pulling, easy to clean and the adjustable comb is perfect for trimming my beard to the right length.  </li>
            <li>Great for those with a full beard.  </li>
            <li>worked great for almost a full year.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is true to the description and makes it a great reliable trimmer.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s pretty incredible that they&#x27;re taking care of their customers this way.  </li>
            <li>With blade factory setting you can get as close as 0.1mm which will give you great edging, and when you zero gap the blade you would get a more precise edging, or closer shave.</li>
            <li>The attachments for stubble is a good, very close cut that does a great job if you&#x27;re looking for the permanent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to work and I am looking good.</li>
            <li>The settings are easy to adjust and has a good grip.</li>
            <li>as always great service and quick shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust and good power.</li>
            <li>I will take more time before being able to give a good review.</li>
            <li>Trimmer is very easy to use and the adjustable head allows an easy change of settings without turning off the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a good charge as well.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for a couple weeks , I think that it is a very nice groomer and works great for what I use it for , and that is trimming after a haircut or goatee trimming , and would work great for other areas .</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to sterilize in between uses since you can just pop the blades out with the press of a button.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it is very easy and the attachments exchange very easy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to maneuver and trims evenly.</li>
            <li>The problem is that the hair gets caught up in the plastic guard AND underneath the trimmer blade itself very easily.</li>
            <li>He thought the instructions to use the trimmer where very easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>The attachments are very easy to remove and install.</li>
            <li>I find it very easy to adjust the length by rolling the adjustable wheel.</li>
            <li>each was better designed and performed better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a number of trimmers over the years and each one was &#x27;ok&#x27;, but honestly this one is the best I&#x27;ve had by far, and it&#x27;s cordless to boot!</li>
            <li>By far the best trimmer I ever owned.</li>
            <li>It has a good feel and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>So far the performance has been excellent and the additional attachments are a welcomed feature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend as a cheap trimmer to hold you over while you save up for something good.</li>
            <li>This has to be the best beard trimmer that I have owned thus far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li>I had another trimmer that I used for many years and one day it started catching my skin and hurting a bit when I shaved.</li>
            <li>So far I am really impressed with trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li>I am impressed by the power of the lithium battery and so far have not found the maximum number of shaves her charge.</li>
            <li>and I have been very happy with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li>And when I go to replace it in the guide, the design of the barrel of the razor and the placement of the guides doesn&#x27;t naturally allow this to happen without stopping and perfectly aligning everything.  </li>
            <li>the battery so far is excellent, which is why i bought this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I am so far very happy with this trimmer!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>The Remington MB4040 was a great priced trimmer, and I found it to be powerful and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>More than that, I also cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>far as trimmers go, this has got to be the best for the price and the performance of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>because its  the best trimmer Ive owned , by far.</li>
            <li>This was the best investment in trimmers I did so far.</li>
            <li>Great product and worth the price.</li>
            <li>It fits well in the hand, easy to use!</li>
            <li>adjustable comb is very innovative and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily too!</li>
            <li>9-27-2014:  Still going strong!</li>
            <li>strong blades!</li>
            <li>This is a powerful trimmer that is very effective at trimming my beard/mustache.</li>
            <li>Awesome shaver, I use it daily and does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed at how well this trimmer works; the rechargeable future is nice as well.</li>
            <li>This has been an excellent replacement for an old trimmer that ran out of being able to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>I has a good, clean cut and seems to hold a charge well.  </li>
            <li>Again, nothing major and nothing&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable in my hand, easy to move around my goatee!</li>
            <li>Very clean cut and the guard is amazing way better and easier to use.</li>
            <li>This was a great buy for something my husband really needed!</li>
            <li>After about a month of twice/week use, I am still pretty happy with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Great product I really like that these clippers can be rinsed off with water!</li>
            <li>Worked great for the first 9 months...</li>
            <li>It works great and the heads are really quick and easy to replace and the charge lasts awhile.</li>
            <li>A fine purchase indeed!</li>
            <li>Very precise cut.</li>
            <li>trims very smoothly</li>
            <li>Very smooth on goatee upkeep.</li>
            <li>This  shaver  is  very  light  </li>
            <li>I got very light use (once a week or so)</li>
            <li>Was pretty happy with this trimmer, but after having it for one year it won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Adjustable length is easy to use and holds position nicely.  </li>
            <li>It took some getting used to, but now that I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile it&#x27;s easy to use and does a nice job.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in the hand and contours easily around the face.  </li>
            <li>The Lithium battery charges quickly and should provide a good ling run time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a strong motor and cuts nicely.</li>
            <li>but when it comes to powering through your beard and giving you a comfortable, quick trim, this is great.  </li>
            <li>I got this trimmer and love how easy and effective it is.</li>
            <li>This is more powerfull, and the design fits very comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily adjustable, easy to clean, and the battery life is really great.  </li>
            <li>So far very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve charged it like twice over the many months</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>Picked this one up and love it.  </li>
            <li>so I would not be able to return or replace it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always well-kept, and I&#x27;m more picky about how my beard looks than my hair.  </li>
            <li>With that said &amp; given the thickness of my beard, I&#x27;m able to charge it once per month...</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I love this beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The razor worked great for one year, and then it very rapidly began to decline.</li>
            <li>It would&#x27;ve been much more practical if you could charge it with a USB cable.</li>
            <li>Skips, regardless of the head used, resulting in the need to make many passes to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>and this takes about 15 minutes at the most.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for months now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about 4 months now, and I&#x27;ve only had to charge it 2 or 3 times, which is impressive</li>
            <li>However, after awhile I noticed that hair had become stuck under the top metal trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li>For a $30 trimmer it probably isn&#x27;t any better than a $15 Wahl trimmer from target or amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does an OK job.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have to go over my face many more times than I did with the Norelco.</li>
            <li>It was perfect size for beard only...  </li>
            <li>This trimmer does what it needs to do, however make sure you keep the guard on it or it will indeed cut you.</li>
            <li>Well pleased with how it works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and feels of good quality.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.  </li>
            <li>It is working much better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I love the wheel where you can set it for the lengh you prefer.</li>
            <li>I bought the MB4040 because of the longer battery life and more features.</li>
            <li>eight more words are needed for this to finish</li>
            <li>I love the long-lasting lithium battery in this unit.  </li>
            <li>I love the lithium battery cause</li>
            <li>and it was OK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through more than 5 beard trimmers over the years, most the rechargeable type and most around $25.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to change the blades, also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this razer for about a year and now won&#x27;t hold a charge for more then 2-4 mins.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this model for many years.</li>
            <li>I had hoped to be able to get more of a stubble look with it.</li>
            <li>more issues</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to turn a one-year wizard beard into something more respectable.  </li>
            <li>Lithium lasts for many years, and this holds a charge for well over an hour.  </li>
            <li>Then the battery would only hold a 5 minute charge, at best.</li>
            <li>I got the upgraded version when I returned, and it is significantly better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always satisfying when a product fully meets your expectations.  </li>
            <li>Battery wouldn&#x27;t charge any more.</li>
            <li>I love it though for the price and the performance despite these drawbacks.</li>
            <li>Each time a use the trimmer it ends up pulling many hairs off my face and it does not cut all of the hairs.</li>
            <li>3 more words</li>
            <li>In reading many trimmer reviews it took me a while to decide what to buy.  </li>
            <li>I am glad this is the trimmer I ended up obtaining.  </li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>The Remington mustache and beard trimmer is great, it&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t pinch and the accessories fit smoothly and work that way as well.</li>
            <li>Along with a charger, it has everything you need to enjoy any kind of hair trimming.</li>
            <li>has many settings ..</li>
            <li>I have use this happilly many times.</li>
            <li>Love mine, would buy another</li>
            <li>If you travel with it, make sure to wrap up any heads that are not attached to the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>My Remington I used before was much more even when it comes to the measurement.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>Charge has lasted more than a month for me.</li>
            <li>well built love the accessory heads.</li>
            <li>I use that the most for trimming my goatee.</li>
            <li>I get a much more &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; trim in that position.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with this trimmer and look forward to many years of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  glad I took a chance on it.</li>
            <li>And I love how it comes with customizable clips.  </li>
            <li>#34;I LOVE that trimmer you got</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an inexpensive trimmer so don&#x27;t expect a lot, but you get a lot for your money for sure.</li>
            <li>Overall, really impressed...</li>
            <li>Couldnt have asked for a better product for the price.</li>
            <li>but I love the brand and it has done me well</li>
            <li>It rips more hair out then it cuts.</li>
            <li>I love this trimming machine.</li>
            <li>they want 11 more words before they will publish this.</li>
            <li>there, are you satisfied?</li>
            <li>Love the trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best you can buy for personal use.</li>
            <li>I wish they just put a better battery in the MB200.</li>
            <li>Its smooth design feels great in my hand and allows for smooth and accurate trimming.  </li>
            <li>love the interchangeable heads.</li>
            <li>It has many settings and makes trimming goatee etc.</li>
            <li>The Remington MB4040 brings variety of accessories, the battery life is ok.</li>
            <li>or you don&#x27;t want to have the battery die after a couple years, make sure you buy a trimmer with a Lithium Ion battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most days, I just use this.</li>
            <li>&#x27;2&#x27; is much more closely cropped than &#x27;3&#x27; .</li>
            <li>wish it came with a stand for storage and for the 3 trimmers it comes with, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, if the packaging is any reflection of the quality of this trimmer, then I&#x27;m sure it will outlast the cockroaches in the event of some nuclear fallout.  </li>
            <li>specifically bought this thing because it had a lithium battery, which tend to have better behavior in their batteries.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of waiting more than 60 days to use this after purchasing it, so basically threw $30 away, but this razer is mega bogus.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d be able to do a-lot more with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard and settings just don&#x27;t cut it LITERALLY.</li>
            <li>Maybe not the most versatile, fancy product ever, but it does what it should for this price.</li>
            <li>After many years using another trimmer, I bought this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for several months now and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Like most devices in this class</li>
            <li>should provide more options for a closer cut (I hope).</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use most of them.  </li>
            <li>Love the razer.</li>
            <li>It is way better than the built in trimmer on my shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the shaver.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver excels at each of those tasks, and much better than the back-of-the-electric-razor style trimmers I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I also love the extended battery life.</li>
            <li>You better buy Wahl Detailor, or Andis T</li>
            <li>Many length</li>
            <li>had to get a better trimmer which is Andis superliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 20/06/2017&lt;</li>
            <li>Cruzer 6 guard is better.</li>
            <li>- Many length settings.</li>
            <li>So in order to make my review more helpful I compared it to another beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>BUT, when I trimmed the hair under my lips the result were OK.</li>
            <li>So, I said why not push more?</li>
            <li>You would try to edge it multiple times, and you still would not get the perfect result.</li>
            <li>Yes, many would like wireless, but the wired ones have the power to edge, and trim with breeze.</li>
            <li>As they edge way better from seeing at YouTube.</li>
            <li>that you can check it out :)  </li>
            <li>are better because they are rigid plastic not flimsy like MB4040 guard.  </li>
            <li>Andis superliner seems that it will serve me for years, will, let&#x27;s hope so :)  </li>
            <li>Or maybe with the collaboration with another razor you would get a stylish beard &amp; mustache.  </li>
            <li>The shaver worked marvelously at keeping my coarse, curly beard orderly for about 3 months.</li>
            <li>I sure wish it had the Lithium battery though.</li>
            <li>I checked the box to make sure I bought a trimmer and not an epilator, then</li>
            <li>/&gt;First and foremost, the blades on this thing are top notch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I do not know if there are any better trimmers out there.</li>
            <li>I am sure not everyone would agree with me</li>
            <li>I have used this 4 times now and have been pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>This unit cuts closer than the top of the line Wahl which my work colleague has, so that trimmer was off</li>
            <li>Really glad I ordered it,</li>
            <li>glad that it is rechargeable and that it works well without the cord.</li>
            <li>I had no idea which brand to buy for a Christmas gift -- now I&#x27;m glad I went with the Remington.  </li>
            <li>Use 3 or more times a week.  </li>
            <li>Ok, but why do I keep buying them?</li>
            <li>I thought it would get better with a couple uses</li>
            <li>The charging cord could be made a lot better.</li>
            <li>but I expect to be a satisfied customer and will buy Remington from Amazon again.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS TO THE MANY</li>
            <li>The battery won&#x27;t even hold a charge for more than 20 seconds before it strains to cut hair.</li>
            <li>Sure I can take the guard off</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to charge it more than 3 times in the time I have owned it.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer and hope I never have to buy another one again now that it&#x27;s using Li-Ion batteries.</li>
            <li>To achieve more evenness, I use longer length setting &amp; back-shave.</li>
            <li>I did not want a trimmer that requires changing the guides, so I was pleased to find this one with an adjustable guide.</li>
            <li>Hogs shelf space and not the most convenient for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Heavy</li>
            <li>This may get better as I use the trimmer more and learn to avoid positioning it so this pulling takes place.  </li>
            <li>While this trimmer is ok, the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow blade is more like a 5am blade.</li>
            <li>and learn then stick with what you love.</li>
            <li>But my favorite feature is its battery.</li>
            <li>I guess five years or maybe more</li>
            <li>Once fully charged, he said he can use it for more than week without recharging.  </li>
            <li>Glad that it also has a lithium battery</li>
            <li>But for maintaining stubble or edging your facial hair, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It would be better if the attachment pieces that make the trimmer vibrate were made of metal instead of plastic.</li>
            <li>Holds charge for a week or more.</li>
            <li>This thing is definitely on the best trimmers I have had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was able to use it still 2 days after I returned without needing to charge.</li>
            <li>I have read many of the reviews and the one point that stood out was</li>
            <li>Recommend to any guy who wants a great trim.</li>
            <li>I love this.. just spin a wheel and get the depth of cut that I want..</li>
            <li>The power button could be recessed to help even more in preventing it from turning on when packed into luggage.  </li>
            <li>Read many reviews and considered a number of products.  </li>
            <li>More attachments than I can use.  </li>
            <li>The different heads made this perfect no matter if you&#x27;re rocking a beard, stache, goatee, or whatever else.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the trimmer itself is comfortable on your skin and trims nice and evenly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about 1/2 the price and does the job 100% better.  </li>
            <li>Wish there was one more shorter&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to go to the barber shop any more.</li>
            <li>as if it&#x27;s built well, has a quality feel for plastic and the blades snap in nicely and feel secure.  </li>
            <li>I was much more pleased with the Philips Norelco than the Remington.</li>
            <li>No nicks or cuts this time, so I was well pleased.</li>
            <li>me, the Philips won out, but for others the Remington might work better.  </li>
            <li>Had to read reviews to figure out to place cover on top to get the trim installation to work.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s ok, but nothing more.</li>
            <li>Oh - they&#x27;re still stuck into the top of the package.</li>
            <li>Interesting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been most pleased with the Remington MB4040.  </li>
            <li>Would be even better if it had some case or pouch to carry all the accessories</li>
            <li>Item just as described, shipping on time, and satisfied.</li>
            <li>I phreakin LOVE this trimmer.</li>
            <li>i love the adjustable option in it.</li>
            <li>but i just love it and the battery lasts for more than a month once you charge it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a convenient cordless trimmer with a Li-Ion battery pack that allows it to perform better for a longer period of time versus the cheaper NiCd trimmers.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get the improved version of the md200 with better battery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the better groomers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I do need to make a lot of passes, but when I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;ve always been satisfied with length and even-ness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There might be better out there</li>
            <li>and , it is ok.  </li>
            <li>Spend $10 more and get a competitor that has a better blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Have thoroughly enjoyed this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Without the guard, this works great at trimming hair very close to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this a month ago, mostly because of the Lithium Ion battery,  I try to stay away from the NiCads.  </li>
            <li>My hustband has had several trimmers over the years and has decided that this one is the one that this is the one that he like the best.</li>
            <li>but I expect something of this nature to be more durable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this machine.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it</li>
            <li>(Love their return policy.)    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>This one is so much better.</li>
            <li>Second, the close but not too close shave head is awesome.  </li>
            <li>What he loves most about this trimmer is the battery life.</li>
            <li>This trimmer has plenty of power and holds a charge for many uses.</li>
            <li>I love the adjustable length trimmer that is built on to the device.</li>
            <li>I always lost the clip on guards so this was refreshing to know that it is adjustable.</li>
            <li>It is a solid beard trimmer, it does the job great!</li>
            <li>thats for sure, but</li>
            <li>he seems very happy with it much more efficient than his last one</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>The blades are not as awesome as they appear and they do not have the ability to shave close enough even without the length guide.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t any better than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase another wahl g-whiz trimmer because it is a much better trimmer than this Remington.</li>
            <li>everything works as it should, I love the lithium power</li>
            <li>Good variety of attachments and easy to clean too</li>
            <li>I love it&amp;#34;, isn&#x27;t an over reach</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this because he loves this.  </li>
            <li>Not a lot of attachments but the 9 adjustable lengths and 2 added blade combinations is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li>I have used many razors and many price points.</li>
            <li>It uses a Li-ion battery which is supposed to get better recharge value.  </li>
            <li>Most would want to save that battery power for travel.  </li>
            <li>A pop-out trimmer attachment on the side would have been much better.  </li>
            <li>I feel as if there could have been one more setting to bring that trimmer closer to the face.  </li>
            <li>I feel as if there could have been one more setting to bring that trimmer closer to the face.  </li>
            <li>i love this Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li>and i think is one of the best trimmer you can get at its low price</li>
            <li>MB40 was ok.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is so much better.</li>
            <li>and he is pleased with it -</li>
            <li>Much better design imo.</li>
            <li>after about three months it started loosing charge quickly barely able to finish one beard trim.  </li>
            <li>I think it is by far the best available (the recipient agrees).</li>
            <li>Hoping for better life from this one&#x27;s Lithium battery.</li>
            <li>Love the way the length adjust works.</li>
            <li>The Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer is everything I had enjoyed for so many years and more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Worked OK for about 6 months then stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I love this Remington trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a beard any more, so I can&#x27;t comment on the beard trimming aspect, but I do still have a mustache that needs</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having the adjuster built in is a more sturdy design.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Flipped the on/off switch many times but that didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It met my requirements and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>and i love having a beard</li>
            <li>Works great although it does not like really thick/long hair.</li>
            <li>(maybe 3.5 would be more fair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure if I&#x27;ll buy another one, though.</li>
            <li>I bought a cheaper trimmer from a Walgreens, it was OK.</li>
            <li>Again, it was just OK.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;m keeping it as it performs much better than the cheaper beard trimmers out there.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>Worked better than  advertised.</li>
            <li>Love the power and sharpness of the blades.  </li>
            <li>His mustache is now not all over his top lips</li>
            <li>In fact he has had so many compliments about his trimmed bread that he now wonders where this trimmer has been all these months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an excellent mustache and beard trimmer, and it has two separate attachment cutters for different uses.</li>
            <li>My son research several items online and decided this was the best.</li>
            <li>DOESNT GET BETTER THAN THIS</li>
            <li>I have been using the trimmer for more than two months now, using it about thrice a week, and I HAVE RECHARGED IT</li>
            <li>I have had many, many trimmers since I tried shaving as a kid.</li>
            <li>Works better than I thought it would</li>
            <li>Plastic guard looks kind of cheap, but hey it works.  </li>
            <li>gotta say watch what setting you use, i thought setting two was going to leave more</li>
            <li>For example, I needed to trim around my teens ears for his ROTC regulation haircut which requires no hair touching the ear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>of my favorite features is the adjustable guard.</li>
            <li>Never was able to charge up the battery, so never got a chance to use it.</li>
            <li>Much better than a handful of clip-ons.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more responsive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about Remington but the user manual is great, as is the warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the battery life of this charger.  </li>
            <li>After having owned trimmers before, I like this trimmer better than anything I have owned.</li>
            <li>love all the settings but stoped being able to hole a charge after about 2 months</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am particularly pleased that the trimmer is powered by an ion lithium battery that provides up to two-hours of usage time without requiring a recharge.  </li>
            <li>I have been quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I needed a trimmer to cut the very short hair on my head, and this was perfect answer.</li>
            <li>The technology has obviously improved and I&#x27;m very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>so the unit could be stored safely in a drawer or to travel with?</li>
            <li>It has a powerful motor and the battery life seems to be good.  </li>
            <li>It performed flawlessly until one day, it suddenly wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  </li>
            <li>Combs are easy to use and the settings for depth also very easy to set and change.</li>
            <li>This one has very good battery life, it trims evenly and is very user friendly.</li>
            <li>Price is right and holds the charge for a good while.</li>
            <li>but so far so good!</li>
            <li>So in general it is a great beard trimmer with amazing battery life.</li>
            <li>So yeah great battery compared to older models of this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I think this is a wise purchase, especially if you&#x27;re looking for a nice Christmas/Hannukah gift for a man in your life!</li>
            <li>It got 3 stars because the plastic to adjust the length of your hair trim is cheap and breaks very easily..</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the attachments are very easy to pop in and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best one I have bought so far, the best thing about it is the battery, I can&#x27;t believe how long the battery last, it&#x27;s easy to use and clean, I have no problem trimming  my beard and mustache, I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Cuts great, very powerful, stayed charged for over three weeks before first recharge.</li>
            <li>Its light, it shaves nicely and the heads pop off easy.</li>
            <li>Great battery strength, quick charging, and a powerful motor.  </li>
            <li>Works perfect and comes with 3 different, easily removable trimming heads.</li>
            <li>It works great and does a great looking job in less time than I am accustomed to.</li>
            <li>Gives a very smooth shave and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Lasts forever on a single charge, works great and quite a good value</li>
            <li>course, you can spend many times more on a professional trimmer like the ones used in salons, but this is a great at-home alternative.</li>
            <li>Battery life is great but no attachments like WAHL products normally include.</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job, but it can also scratch you pretty good when using it without</li>
            <li>The best thing is how long the battery lasts.</li>
            <li>First, let me state that these clippers are good, but I wanted something that I can have a ONE OVER and get a shadow look, and they cut too close.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s works pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>1 star durability, 3 star quality (it was pretty good while it lasted) &#x3D; 2 stars.</li>
            <li>That is pretty dang good if you ask me.</li>
            <li>I have found the lithium battery technology in my power drills to be long lived and quite impressive.  </li>
            <li>charging LED will shut off to indicate a full charge, which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>Worked so good the first time, my beard never got out of line again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how easily it trims and how close of a shave I get when doing the sides of my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped many a razors into the sink and never had one break on me so easily.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with it and like the removable adjustable guide, which makes cleaning easy.</li>
            <li>Great quality at a fair price as expected from Remington.</li>
            <li>The MB4040 has many length settings, so you should be able to find the precise length that you want.  </li>
            <li>Nice sleek design and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that there is anything better available, but that doesn&#x27;t make this piece of junk any better.</li>
            <li>I also think the different attachments are a win, and that this should be handy for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Also it is very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>As a positive, it seems like it does a good job at the detail of my goatee in that it looks neat and</li>
            <li>What I like best is that loose hairs do not stick to the handle</li>
            <li>head).&lt;br /&gt;It is very light, which feels cheap.</li>
            <li>I damaged one but was able to repair it and it works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has the remarkable ability to rip nearly as many hairs from my previously tender flesh as it successfully cuts.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it several years ago, choosing it because it had the best reviews.</li>
            <li>but the charge last forever and for the money it is a very good deal.</li>
            <li>The actual trimming blade is very good at what it does.  </li>
            <li>As for actually trimming, it does a very good job.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li>Perfect, Quick, Easy, and ready to go right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>The stubble blade works great on my head and neck, and it trims much shorter than my last one ever did and this is great for me because I prefer to trim rather than shave those areas, 2)</li>
            <li>That fact alone would be enough for me to love this trimmer, but its precise settings and versatility make it an ideal companion for any hairy chested or bearded man.</li>
            <li>This one replaced an old Remington that worked great for years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve contacted the company and they are replacing with a better model for free.</li>
            <li>So I chose the next best thing, the same trimmer without that feature, and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer for the cost - its basically as close as you can get to professional grade without paying for pro grade prices.</li>
            <li>built to last the battery life is incredible.</li>
            <li>A bit loud but still a great product.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about what I use to shave and trim my beard with, out of the many I have been through this is the best I have had so far.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful glide throug my rough scruff.</li>
            <li>the distribution of the weight more towards the trimmer head makes this trimmer comfortable to hold and control during trimming.</li>
            <li>This one has a cheap plastic housing, a cheap plastic trimmer guard, and when I use it the hair gets pinched between the guard and the unit, and pulls!</li>
            <li>The lithium ion battery is holding it&#x27;s charge for over a month so far and is working great.</li>
            <li>But it was better designed for detailed trimming.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer offers excellent value, with two extra trim heads, sensible design and good battery life.</li>
            <li>Stubble trimmer is fantastic for when I don&#x27;t feel like shaving (most of the time).  </li>
            <li>Good product in reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My Norelco shaver is good, but the trimmer does not trim very close.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the power is good, and it keeps charge very well.</li>
            <li>quality unit - meaning good weight, thicker plastic, blades titanium or something, feels much stronger.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the good service.  </li>
            <li>a good product, battery lasts a long time and the trim tool things are good too.</li>
            <li>Well, this Remington MB4040 does not make that sound, and the cut hair seems to stay mostly in the plastic guard (easily emptied when you are done).  </li>
            <li>Great battery life, charges quickly, trims very well.</li>
            <li>And certainly one of the best trimmers for numerous reasons:  Lithium batteries are simply the best.  </li>
            <li>The interchangeable heads just pop right on and off without any screwdriver or anything like it kind of looks like.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome razor, it is well made and it just feels sturdy compared to some of the other razors I looked at.  </li>
            <li>totally more than worth the price!</li>
            <li>Other than that i think is a excellent choice.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty outstanding!</li>
            <li>He has used other shavers but he said this one is one of the best he has ever used.</li>
            <li>I still wish the original battery had worked better.</li>
            <li>was concerned about nicks &amp; cuts based on other reviews, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any (yet) and hopefully won&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>The this trimmer has got the best battery compared to other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>thing I like the best is that since the guard adjustment is in the trimmer itself, it is extremely sturdy and there is no way it will slip out of your desired guard number.</li>
            <li>So far so good, dad is happy with this new trimmer.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use this in an environment easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>Easy to switch out the 3 blades.  </li>
            <li>Cuts like it should and easy to use.</li>
            <li>lightweight and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>I need to go over many times and even then it doesn&#x27;t look evenly cut or that clean.</li>
            <li>The guard system is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Simple functions and great results, just how most men prefer it.</li>
            <li>Once I have used the comb it easily slides off</li>
            <li>easily reachargaeble ..easy cleaning</li>
            <li>Also, this razor can easily turn on inside your luggage.</li>
            <li>When the guard is removed, it is easy to shave all hair off and trim your mustache.</li>
            <li>The adjustments in length are easy to make.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Adjustable head is easy to use and blades interchange easily.</li>
            <li>Easily adjustable</li>
            <li>Versatile and easily handled.</li>
            <li>The design makes switching out and cleaning the trimmer heads very quick and easy.</li>
            <li>The blades are easy to change but may be easy to damage.</li>
            <li>Would easily recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Clicks on easily</li>
            <li>So easy...</li>
            <li>The interchangeable heads are easy to change.</li>
            <li>I was content with this product until it started to lose charge very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can go a month in between charges using this shaver a couple of times per week, easily.</li>
            <li>Easy blades removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- Easy blades removal.</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust the length guard.</li>
            <li>I like the easy way to adjust the trim level</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The length guide is easily adjusted or removed.</li>
            <li>easy adjustment of lengh.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and adjust.</li>
            <li>To take it out you push a button and pull it out to easily replace it with</li>
            <li>Relatively easy head changes</li>
            <li>Easy attachment removal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slim design is easy to handle and control.</li>
            <li>I must say, this trimmer works very well, over the years I had purchased a number of trimmers and by far this one is the best yet.</li>
            <li>They swap out do easily with a button on the front just below the blade.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is so easy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>Can trim and shape easily</li>

            <li>I never saw it on the shelf, obviously, but I&#x27;m sure the package looked great, with the razor and attachments gleaming through plastic clamshell for passers-by to inspect.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I found the plastic head and the beard adjustment to be easy and intuitive.  </li>
            <li>On the sides he wanted a more rugged look (but clean) and in the front he wanted to keep his length.</li>
            <li>With the guard in place, the clipped portion of the hairs VERY quickly build up on the blade head.</li>
            <li>Add to that the easily adjustable depth gauge (just one</li>
            <li>I had a Remington for many years prior to this and was quite happy with it.</li>

            <li>I like this one even better because it&#x27;s more powerful.  </li>
            <li>I loved the trimmer but really liked the stand charger that came with my last Remmington trimmer.</li>
            <li>The motor is strong and blades are sharpe.</li>
            <li>I use for two minutes twice per day - every day and has been going strong for years</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>and it is almost another 6 months and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>I have had this thing for 2 years and its still working strong.</li>
            <li>The motor is strong and well made.  </li>
            <li>It has good power and the smaller blades come in handy for shaping.</li>
            <li>Strong battery that holds the charge.</li>
            <li>i ordered this trimmer about a month ago, i charged it, and it&#x27;s still is going strong.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is working strong.</li>
            <li>It has to be charged maybe once every four months and is still running strong.</li>
            <li>Good for all facial hair and trimming to your own specification.</li>
            <li>Trimmer is pretty sweet, it has a really good system for changing trimmer blades and for changing the head length.</li>
            <li>Still going strong.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t charged it for a while and still going strong.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>The blade changes are quick and easy also making for easy clean up, the whole things feels great and very solid in hand, it&#x27;s not so light as to feel inferior, the battery life is also great, in my opinion this is probably one of the better things that Amazon sells......</li>
            <li>in all I am very satisfied with my purchase, and would recommend this product to anybody out there looking for a well-functioning and quality-made trimmer for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The battery on this is pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>works very well, very satisfied</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great general purpose purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to my electronics and health products, so it says something that I am very pleased with this</li>
            <li>So at first I was loving the thing.</li>
            <li>and so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this product for more full beard trimming.</li>
            <li>Sure, the shiny plastic looks cool, but this is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>If the battery was as good as other reviews say, then this would be a good trimmer, as it is mine is not useable.</li>
            <li>Some reviews have said that you have to go over the area many times to get your whole trim done is very true!</li>
            <li>The trim head was easy to replace, the trimmer length was easy to set, and it was light yet sturdy.</li>
            <li>Perfect to use on the other &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; in my life!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good quality cutter but be prepared to buy a new one about every two years.  </li>
            <li>In fairness the new machine may have a superior battery</li>
            <li>Regardless, it worked fine during the 6 weeks the battery lasted.</li>
            <li>Light, and easy to  maneuver.  </li>
            <li>All-in-all a fine</li>
            <li>it might be fine for some  one else</li>
            <li>I used this trimmer for about 9 months and it did the job fine during this time.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for one year.</li>
            <li>This is a fine trimmer.</li>
            <li>Still works fine.</li>
            <li>The wider blades that this model have work fine.</li>
            <li>For $30, this is a fine razor.  </li>
            <li>Still, even after low usage, I&#x27;m still impressed that I haven&#x27;t had to charge it at all since the first charge after a year of usage and a lot of dormancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have one plastic attachment that works fine to adjust beard length.</li>
            <li>A fine product.</li>
            <li>When I was using Cruzer 6 the trimmer head wasn&#x27;t easy to use it to do precise trimming.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going just fine</li>
            <li>Mine was fine</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>This trimmer/groomer is light weight  and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>In order to do that fine a trim, I need to pull the comb off the head all the way</li>
            <li>This adjustable clipper is working well, it charges fine and cuts well</li>
            <li>The comb easily adjusts using the thumb wheel and it locks securely in the selected setting.</li>
            <li>with the Norelco every trim was so fine and polished.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light, easy to carry.</li>
            <li>Now i bought another one and its working totally fine.</li>
            <li>Probably, either trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is fine, however, I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>It helps to have a fine (..manual..) comb to assist with the straightening duties.</li>
            <li>Even trimmed my hair with it and worked fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but somehow a couple of the teeth broke off on the trimming head</li>
            <li>The light weight and slender shape make the shaver easy for me to handle.</li>
            <li>products that already work just fine?</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and can be used for many days before another charge.</li>
            <li>Quick Charge!</li>
            <li>From the very first use, this trimmer pulled as many hairs as it cut.</li>
            <li>(With that long name, it has to be perfect right?).</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust, easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, Easy to clean,.</li>
            <li>Solidly built, easily adjusted, and great results.</li>
            <li>It powers through beard hair easily and is really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for reaching tight places and cleaning up the neck line.</li>
            <li>and it is as powerful as Remington claims and trimming is very precise indeed.</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust and secure length setting and easy to clean with the included brush.</li>
            <li>If you plan of trimming your beard every day, you might want to invest in something a little better, but it&#x27;s very good quality.</li>
            <li>This has a smooth and powerful motor and cuts very precisely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Should I run across any trimmer claimng to be better than this Remington or claiming to be better than any trimmer available, then I would certainly try it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Should I run across any trimmer claimng to be better than this Remington or claiming to be better than any trimmer available, then I would certainly try it.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying the four stars have nothing to do with the performance of the trimmer, it cuts FANTASTIC its smooth and perfectly contoured for fitment in hand and the blades are super sharp.</li>
            <li>but it was a huge dust collector on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>Cuts well, length adjusts accurately and quickly.wordy rating is a pain.</li>
            <li>Huge improvement over what I had.</li>
            <li>The reviews I read were accurate about battery power.</li>
            <li>A huge design flaw.</li>
            <li>It works great as a body trimmer also, I use it for my stomach and chest on a short setting as well.</li>
            <li>Charge light indicates it is charged but it runs for about 5 min &amp; stops.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Works very well and the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s powerful enough to not pull your hair out, and the shortest length setting does a great job of trimming most of the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and is well built.</li>
            <li>gave great cut&#x27;s til the very end of it&#x27;s life same model no reason to not get the same quality very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li>Charged for over 30 hours and notice battery indicator light was not on.</li>
            <li>comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>burn no matter what and has a blade that leaves it feeling smooth and feels comfortable and does not cut during use.</li>
            <li>The cut is smooth and i like the ability to adjust the height of the shave as well.  </li>
            <li>Also, for some reason I find I have to go over my face many more times to get all the hairs that used to stand up better, and therefore get trimmed with fewer passes, using the old guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels solid and does a great job.</li>
            <li>plastic guard seems cheap and gives an inconsistent setting.</li>
            <li>Great price and quality, extra heads work great for different beard styles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few weeks since it arrived, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>The trimmer does very well, and keeps everything tidy.  </li>
            <li>I use clippers because I don&#x27;t like torturing my face, so pinching and yanking hairs rather than smoothly trimming them is a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I won&#x27;t be buying another cheap Remington product again.</li>
            <li>It felt cheap and not well made.</li>
            <li>Great product overall.</li>
            <li>razor is so cheap that it almost makes no sense in trying to find another attachment comb.  </li>
            <li>Works great initially.</li>
            <li>Great performance and various length options.</li>
            <li>If shaping is important, this is not the clippers for you.</li>
            <li>But it feels cheap to me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Severally easy to set up and clean plus this trimmer is made from quality material.</li>
            <li>It is easy to keep clean, and has a rotary dial to adjust the length of cut.</li>
            <li>The adjustable attachment ensures that trimming is smooth and my beard trims evenly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>Only requires one pass to trim your beard, which is a great time</li>
            <li>but I primarily use the beard blade with the zoom wheel to lock in the length setting.  </li>
            <li>thing is , the charger didn&#x27;t fit to my country</li>
            <li>The battery life is amazing and it works very well.</li>
            <li>LED indicator light turns off when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light weight</li>
            <li>Great for the guys who have coarse hair.</li>
            <li>fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great trimmer especially for the price.</li>
            <li>and they would replace it free of charge.  </li>
            <li>and so if vacuuming the hairs is important then this isn&#x27;t the product for</li>
            <li>My cheap one I had to charge every 2 days.</li>
            <li>but it works great and is solid.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean also.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the cordless function.</li>
            <li>Great to get short stubble without any razor burn.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Will not give precise</li>
            <li>- Trimming using the guard isn&#x27;t precise.</li>
            <li>- Easy to clean the trimmer.</li>
            <li>The guard will not give you a smooth accurate length of hair.</li>
            <li>They have great trimmers, especially those wired ones.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily to trim my mustache, eyebrows and neck hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean too.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Cuts smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li>No replacement available.</li>
            <li>I also liked that it didnt come with a whole bunch of combs and things</li>
            <li>Had the potential to be a great item though.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and adjust.</li>
            <li>I keep my beard light and find that I don&#x27;t need any adjustment at all to the depth  level adjustment feature.</li>
            <li>This thing literally fell about (cheaply glued together) when taking it out of the box.  </li>
            <li>The battery last forever and the trimmer works great.</li>
            <li>There is a grooming comb that can fit over any of the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery system on this is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and this isn&#x27;t particularly smooth or efficient.  </li>
            <li>With the overall quality and the price, this razor is a great bargain.</li>
            <li>I guess will fit almost anyone needs, from the ZZ Tops out-there to the Indiana Jones.</li>
            <li>Ah, and I haven&#x27;t tried to maintain \\&quot;The Mighty El Insecto\\</li>
            <li>the adjustable comb gives you the precise  length you prefer.</li>
            <li>the light comes on like it&#x27;s charging then goes off after a couple hours.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because of a fantastic experiences with my ancient Remington beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I would reccommend for a cheap trimmer performs well.</li>
            <li>to the long-lasting battery and my being too cheap to replace it, I will get to enjoy its hair-rending talents for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, ow.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is great for trimming my short beard, on a 3 setting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is great for beards and such but the hairs get caught in the guard and start to gum it up.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy a closer cut on your beard then this is not for you.  </li>
            <li>As a long-time user of beard-trimming devices, I&#x27;ve learned it&#x27;s the emitted sound that reveals their quality.</li>
            <li>Cuts smoothly, doesn&#x27;t bite.  </li>
            <li>It looked like I had used a cheap electric razor.</li>
            <li>: hubby says the plastic casing feels cheap.</li>
            <li>The Remington MB4040 Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer produces a really smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The dial to select a size is nice because it really keeps your setting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer is inexpensive, sturdy, well made, easy to clean and battery is just</li>
            <li>I always used cheap trimmers $15-$20 price range.  </li>
            <li>and  feels  cheaply  built.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and to switch out the headers with no muss or fuss.  </li>
            <li>Problem is that one of the plastic pieces that goes over the blade has chipped off and I am not feeling comfortable depending on this.</li>
            <li>having had several beard trimmers over the years, i can state confidently that this is, by far, the best.  </li>
            <li>a huge improvement over the cheap wahl i used before.</li>
            <li>He has a goatee and has had trouble keeping it trimmed, but found this product to work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is great and he would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t pull any hair and give a smooth trimming.</li>
            <li>It slides off to clean and the blades come out easily</li>
            <li>guard itself is sturdy, but has some give and has smooth edges.</li>
            <li>The trimmer attachments, adjustments, and etc are easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li>It is simple and does a great job.</li>
            <li>the light weight of the trimmer, not having to use an electric cord, and the specialized uses of the blades included with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This was a great trimmer (especially for the price) but after just over a year, it died.  </li>
            <li>The plastic guard thing is more of a gimmick than actually useful though.</li>
            <li>The stubble blade is excellent for more delicate areas.  </li>
            <li>So far so good as this shaver is doing what I expect to in shaving my goatee.  </li>
            <li>I made a good charger out of a 5 volt adapter I had in the parts bin and cut the old charger cord to get the Remington plug.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the trimmer worked from the charger for those occasions when you might have a discharged or own out battery, but the manual says the charger only charges the battery and can&#x27;t be used to run the trimmer.</li>
            <li>works good so far...</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>This gives me about a days growth look which is hip and at 57 years old, hip is good.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>Battery life is good so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve followed videos online to make sure that I am putting the trimmer back together, but the device is fairly fool-proof.</li>
            <li>If you plan to adjust precisions frequently, there&#x27;s a good chance that this might wear out after awhile.</li>
            <li>So far so good for tending to my goatee/moustach.</li>
            <li>Battery seems good so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>With so many men&#x27;s grooming devices available now it has become more difficult to choose &#x27;the best&#x27; amongst the many.</li>
            <li>With so many men&#x27;s grooming devices available now it has become more difficult to choose &#x27;the best&#x27; amongst the many.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning of the product was pretty easy as well since it is able to be rinsed off.</li>
            <li>Perfect for grooming/trimming, not so great for cutting significant length.</li>
            <li>Takes a little work to clean but otherwise works wonderful.</li>
            <li>ANyhow, no complaints and works well, what more can you ask for, right?</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t do the fine trimming like I do, you still need to pull the comb off to fully clean the razor</li>
            <li>It allows for an incredible amount of detail, straight lines, and clean professional look.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and cuts close to the face with the guard is not used.</li>
            <li>I also sounds very powerful when running.</li>
            <li>very powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also learned to use it so that I very rarely have missed hairs anymore.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also learned to use it so that I very rarely have missed hairs anymore.  </li>
            <li>Seems very powerful, well designed and time will tell about blade integrity.  </li>
            <li>It is very powerful and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Very nice and simple to use.  </li>
            <li>the detail blade makes it much easier to get the details nice and clean,</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it moves smoothly and effortlessly, and it gives me a comfortable, clean look.</li>
            <li>Works great, I use on my cat that has fine long hair, that gets matted close to her skin.</li>
            <li>IS AMAZING and the ultra long lasting lithium batteries and self sharpening blades make this the best pick out there!  </li>
            <li>This is my first cordless trimmer and it makes a huge difference not having to deal with the chord, a lot better this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>it is fairly minor, is if you plan to do detailed trimming, it is not that great.  </li>
            <li>One move and super easy.  </li>
            <li>Great battery life - only needs a full charge every week or two depending on your usage</li>
            <li>I have not tried the smaller beard trimmer or stubble blade, but the main blade works great and is very easy to adjust the guard.</li>
            <li>as the headline says, this thing has an outstanding battery life, doesn&#x27;t overcharge, and has very high quality, and easily interchangeable, blade heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, very sharp, stays charged for many uses.  </li>
            <li>As for my needs, this product fulfills them :), and the 5 stars remain :)  If you read this REMINGTON, then please change the guard to a new one, with a rigid structure.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is versatile, easy to use, and generally a good trimmer (especially for the price).</li>
            <li>I used to own the previous Remington Trimmer, which I thought was SO good</li>
            <li>yeah, maybe they are pretty nice, but at somewhere around $30, this thing does the trick quickly and good enough for me.</li>
            <li>so I know I&#x27;m doomed if I don&#x27;t charge it more first.  </li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ve been shaving a loooong time, so I am familiar with how to operate and trim a beard</li>
            <li>At first I questioned the guard setup, but I am quite pleased with quality afterall.  </li>
            <li>Tons of length settings make this trimmer great, the guard doesn&#x27;t slip to a lower setting like a lot of trimmers, stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, my trim time has reduced significantly, while the quality of my beard has increased quite a lot.</li>
            <li>I still have the original trimmer I bought over fifteen years ago</li>
            <li>I was excited to see a Lithium-Ion version</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you are a regular guy, not insanely picky and on a budget, proud of his beard and ready to fight the naysayers anti-facial hair punks on the streets every day, this is the trimmer for you.</li>
            <li>30 years is a long time for a trimmer and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>I use it trim my goatee every week and the original charge has lasted months.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what I need it to do: trim my beard many times without running out of battery.  </li>
            <li>if you buy this product you will love it the first couple of months, after that maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a case of Stockholm</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy and every once in awhile need a razor that can trim arm/leg/chest hair.</li>
            <li>The goatee head allows fine trimming at the lip edges and also cuts quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Originally 1 star review.  </li>
            <li>And it holds a charge for a long time too, which is great.  </li>
            <li>First, I love that this things charge lasts seemingly forever.  </li>
            <li>As it was given as a gift, the higher priced models would have been better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look at the charger first as most transformers work with either voltage.</li>
            <li>The shaver works great and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does a great job and holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I can get about 2 weeks worth of use out of it on one charger!</li>
            <li>It did not hold the original charge, and could not be recharged.</li>
            <li>The guided lock-in settings are great if you grow long beards or (in my case) want to trim your sideburns to a desired length.</li>
            <li>There are two items loosely fit in plastic at the top of the large clamshell.</li>
            <li>Makes cleaning them much easier, all the real fine hair washes right out.</li>
            <li>Great product, sharp blades, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I first purchased the Remington MB4040 and was very excited to give it a try.</li>
            <li>works great and holds a charge very long.</li>
            <li>Cuts hair cleanly without pulling</li>
            <li>Finally stepped up to a Lithium Powered trimmer, and have been very happy with this one for over 9 months so far.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how happy that makes me, especially since it&#x27;s so powerful.  </li>
            <li>Hardheartedly recommend this trimmer for the flexibility of interchangeable blades to the clean cuts it makes.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Pulls unexpectedly now and then, battery last forever, perfect for my beard.</li>
            <li>I have had several trimmers and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>and I have had it for a few months and used it a great many times.</li>
            <li>Although they say it doesn&#x27;t require it, but it is written in the manual that if you clean the blades with water you need to lubricate the blades with oil.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Although they say it doesn&#x27;t require it, but it is written in the manual that if you clean the blades with water you need to lubricate the blades with oil.</li>
            <li>and it is a breeze to clean.</li>
            <li>Powerful and easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li>remove the guide, turn the trimmer over, and you can trim along your lip line, leaving a clean and neat appearance.</li>
            <li>I was buying the really cheap shavers in the drug store and the blades would go quickly and they wouldn&#x27;t stay charged.</li>
            <li>I used this to trim my beard and to keep my hair line clean.</li>
            <li>The quick change trimmer heads is a huge selling point.</li>
            <li>The Norelco seems to have had a more professional cutter, but this one does okay as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I removed the blade once to clean the interior out and since then, the blades do not cut anything anymore.</li>
            <li>Having the ability to keep a clean goatee just got easier.</li>
            <li>I love it and am glad my old one died.</li>
            <li>to clean</li>
            <li>Luckily they are both fairly cheap.</li>
            <li>Made clean up a breeze.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the unit for a couple of weeks, but so far it is excellent.</li>
            <li>wish it could give me a clean shave, but it is just a trimmer.</li>
            <li>The settings are easy and it is powerful.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to return it and get a full refund - thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Worth the price and keeps a strong charge.</li>
            <li>Overall good power and a good product - major upgrade from my Wahl.</li>
            <li>so when I shave my whisker growth is significant, but this trimmer cuts right through, easily.  </li>
            <li>The way the blades change out is super cool and super easy.</li>
            <li>- Edging sideburns is good, because the hair is usually long, so it&#x27;s easy to edge it.</li>
            <li>Beard looks good, trimmer cleans up easily, lasts a long time on a charge.</li>
            <li>Furthermore the trim length selection wheel is easy to accidentally bump while trimming causing it to fly down to the shortest length.</li>
            <li>Love the new Lithium battery, keeps the trimmer running at full speed continuously!</li>
            <li>The adjustable length feature is very handy, and the trimmer holds its charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li>took the unit apart and it has a AA-sized battery inside, but it is welded in place and therefore not replaceable without special tools or without permanently damaging the circuit board.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t seen anything special.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d owned a Remington clipper before that had a special pop up for trimming moustaches, so when it died I searched for another Remington..</li>
            <li>remington special puted in the product box 120 wolt adapter</li>
            <li>Very sharp and my beard has never looked so good!</li>
            <li>This one is okay, but again too much effort to clean it out for what I use it for.</li>
            <li>I love that from my fine head on top, to my coarse hair on my chin, I have never pulled a hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t keep up with my beard much and don&#x27;t do fine detailing but want a nice fast cut when I do trim and this does the job.</li>
            <li>I am super excited with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Works about what I expected, nothing great, doesn&#x27;t  get all of my wiskers</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good razor so far.  </li>
            <li>only used it once, but first impressions this trimmer is great for 30 bucks</li>
            <li>This thing thus far is amazing...  </li>
            <li>I looked around for a good trimmer locally, couldn&#x27;t find anything and shopped Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver, works well and shaves really close to skin.</li>
            <li>The trimmer worked good for one shave, and one shave only.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works very well, trims evenly, don&#x27;t know how you could do better.</li>
            <li>received it, it weighs next to nothing, which depending on your point of view could be considered a good thing.</li>
            <li>Plus it took about 8 hours for a full charge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light in the hand, and the motor is powerful.  </li>
            <li>Powerful and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>, this is a good basic trimmer.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good trimmer for my needs.</li>
            <li>can trim your beard in a couple of minutes as it&#x27;s a full size trimmer.</li>
            <li>But I was pleased really as did not like this shaver.</li>
            <li>It seems to hold a charge much longer ( I am sure the Wahl is NiCad battery).  </li>
            <li>there was also a distinct sound of each hair being cut.  </li>
            <li>All the extra attachments look good</li>
            <li>I use te trimmer directly to my face for a close nice 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li>Nice soft blades.</li>
            <li>I am convinced you can&#x27;t find a better trimmer regardless of how much you spend.</li>
            <li>One full charge will give up to 7-10 trims.</li>
            <li>and it may not be good if we do not have enough hair to trim.</li>
            <li>Still in initial usage, but seems to be good on battery life</li>
            <li>But Battery life was the only issue with it.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t use it unplugged,  but loved the dial-a- length and Ergonomic feel.&lt;br /&gt;Sent</li>
            <li>The adjustable length helps me with all of my needs and it is not painful on the skin.</li>
            <li>Looks better on pic than real life - lots of plastic.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s been a really good investment.</li>
            <li>Cool attachments.</li>
            <li>Incidentally, this is the VERY reason why I use a trimmer instead of a shaver most of the time--because I don&#x27;t like getting nicked, cut, burned, etc.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good for facial hair</li>
            <li>It is used for full body trimming and it does that well.</li>
            <li>everything was good except it didn&#x27;t not come in the box that it shows in the pictures, it just ships in the same box it was packaged in.</li>
            <li>The darn thing couldn&#x27;t hold a battery charge (a common problem if you read the reviews), but darnit, it was the best trimmer</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase</li>
            <li>If you need to get rid of a full beard, this will do the job.</li>
            <li>to the lack of the bag, I would give the unit a 4.5 rating if it were possible; however, it is too good a trimmer to deserve a four star rating.  </li>
            <li>That is until he dropped it in a sink full of water.  </li>
            <li>After just 4 months this device cannot hold a full charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only heard good things about Remingtons.</li>
            <li>you want that 2 day beard or want to groom up the wild beard you rock to keep your face warm or to be the lasted hipster icon.</li>
            <li>I should have purchased a cool trimmer like this years ago.</li>
            <li>I chose this trimmer because it seemed a good balance between quality and low price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good trimmer when it works, but its life is too short.  </li>
            <li>Full charges takes 8 hours, but a use in the morning</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price with all the accssories that come with this product.</li>
            <li>Not a bad performance lifespan for a $25 trimmer.</li>
            <li>Good for facial grooming, notgood for a full a shave.</li>
            <li>I was impressed by how long the charge last on this, and its also easy to switch clips.</li>
            <li>Was a little worried when I took it out of the package, a little light, didn&#x27;t think I was going to be good but works GREAT!</li>
            <li>Easy to dial in the exact length you want.</li>
            <li>It is bigger than some of the other trimmers but the battery life is great, the height adjustment is easy and reliable, and the blades trim the beard/ goatee nicely.</li>
            <li>The plastic comb seems pretty sturdy, and all serviceable pieces are easily removed.  </li>
            <li>but it does cut consistently and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>14 years ago I tried my first Remington with the easy adjustable length (it was a twist adjuster).  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp, I like the built-in adjuster for the trim guard, it really is a great package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Until now, it has been a useful tool and nearly 2 years is pretty good for the price point.</li>
            <li>But, I tried this trimmer from Remington and true to form the beard blade assembly broke the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Works great and has a loooooooong battery life compared to other trimmers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, he says it&#x27;s a good trimmer and just wishes it felt a little more durable.</li>
            <li>operates as it should giving a clean line and fresh look to my son&#x27;s hairline and beard</li>
            <li>Powerful trimmer with no pulling, durable and clean look.</li>
            <li>I had another Remington trimmer where the trimmer blade would pop up easily, but stayed connected on the back side of it to the body of the trimmer, making it very quick and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The too-wide tooth issue is theonly flaw - but a serious one - on an otherwise excellent product.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts a super longtime between charges.</li>
            <li>MB200 has short battery life and doesn&#x27;t look as fancy but cuts more evenly and does a better job.</li>
            <li>Product works very well, adjustable, quiet and works great.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works like a dream and shaves very well, the interchangeable trimmer blades is a nice touch and makes this trimmer very versatile.</li>
            <li>After using it now for a few weeks, I assess its performance, ergonomics, battery, and comfort, to be every bit as good as the Norelco, and, perhaps, even better, since the battery is lithium-ion, (you can read the product description for its benefits), and the cutters self-sharpening titanium.  </li>
            <li>Quickly and even trimmed my beard-</li>
            <li>I finally gave up and figured the Remington looked like the best one and knew I could send it back if I had problems with it.</li>
            <li>Yes, my hair grows in quickly.  </li>
            <li>I use the lowest setting #1 to trim around my mustache and chin area - where the hair tends to get quickly out of control.  </li>
            <li>I love the extra blade options to give you a better shave for the beard.</li>
            <li>You would think I would have stopped after the 4th cut, but no, I went for lucky number 5.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to use on my dogs for quick trims of the feet and around the face on my poodle.</li>
            <li>Charging light would be nice if it would tell you when the battery is about to die, or show what the remaining power is, but for the price, that is no big deal.</li>
            <li>At the beginning, it charged quickly and held a charge for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Quick charge.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m only using the stubble blade, based on others reviews (thanks) and it shaves great with no cuts even without the guard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more about learning how to use it vs my last version.</li>
            <li>It cuts quickly without pulling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;v had a few trimmers, and this one is a good one for sure.</li>
            <li>Very versatile​ and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I had an older, similiarly priced Nolrelco trimmer which cut more &#x27;consistantly&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>6 months in battery is now quick to die.</li>
            <li>My husband is the main user of this trimmer, but as a licensed cosmetologist (hairstylist) who often cuts his hair and helps him trim his beard with it, I am pleased with this product considering it&#x27;s price range.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky now if the run time lasts for 5 minutes on a charge.</li>
            <li>I have brought in the iStubble and have tried it quickly once</li>
            <li>I charge it fully, and it is lucky if it can make it through one trimming of my beard.  </li>
            <li>What he really enjoyed about it was the fact he could set so many different sizes for beard length.</li>
            <li>then the battery life went downhill quickly</li>
            <li>I just finished a quick trim about 20 minutes ago and thought that I should update my review to reflect the additional six months since I began using the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I simply could not be more pleased with the craftsmanship, the ease of use and the results.</li>
            <li>I simply could not be more pleased with the craftsmanship, the ease of use and the results.</li>
            <li>In my case I use it for a 4 setting beard, which I maintain every 3-4 days, and the job is very easy to complete with this machine.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this, being able to easily remove each cutting blade with the push of a button, the trimming guide snapping on easily, and the ergonomics are pretty great.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the rugged construction and high torque this unit produces.  </li>
            <li>Im enjoying the high quality and precision of these trimmers.</li>
            <li>I normally use it without the comb on the end and it is very sharp and does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li>, the plastic sleeve that fits over the top is a bit cumbersome and comes off easily if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>This thing is awesome, love it, very sturdy feels as if it will last a long time!</li>
            <li>It was great at first, but now that I&#x27;m almost at a year I can&#x27;t finish shaving beard on single charge.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very compact and not very expensive, also easy to clean</li>
            <li>Also I noticed that this Remington doesn&#x27;t cut very consistently.</li>
            <li>Had other models, this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>OK, it&#x27;s simply a normal shaver.  </li>
            <li>Sara&#x27;s husband:Great trimmer, finally a suitable replacement for my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied; especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned two other Remington products with great success.  </li>
            <li>Would have given a higher score if not for the cheaply made beard guard.</li>
            <li>With this trimmer, once you get the hang of it  trimming is very quick and easy and the results are amazing (even if half asleep).</li>
            <li>My last Remington lasted over 6 - 8 years, and I&amp;#34;ve always had good luck with them so far - my favorite brand</li>
            <li>Sure you could do better, but you could also do a lot worse, and for this price it&#x27;s about as good as it</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time and the blades are of good quality.</li>
            <li>My Norelco was able to adjust by mm and thus I was able to really zero in on the exact length that I particularly like.</li>
            <li>It cut cleanly and efficiently, far better than any razor I have owned.</li>
            <li>buy beard trimmers exclusively to replace shaving, because I have sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t need to be perfectly clean shaven most of the time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for clipping hair and shaving down to a stubble</li>
            <li>Good trimmer, lots of power, charged right out of the box, but didn&#x27;t take long for a full charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to charge this new one once in about a month, and it still has a healthy charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the new powerfull Motor.  </li>
            <li>I love this new version of the remington trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about three and a half months now, and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great improvement on his previous one.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps a charge and its easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had it long enough to comment on durability or battery life, but useability and function are top-notch.</li>
            <li>Not sure why this product has so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>lots of power, smooth cut, long battery life, NICE trimmer.</li>
            <li>A very nice improvement over the older model i had that recently stopped working.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need it to do!</li>
            <li>Had I written a review last winter, it would have been 4 or 5 stars as I grew my first beard ever and tried various trimmers, and this was the best one I tried that would get close without getting too close (one of the guards on the others resulted in me always nicking myself in an unintended place and my beard-growing efforts would be for naught until I found this).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>It has all the features I was looking for; easy to use, well designed, hope it last many years.</li>
            <li>Sent it back to Amazon, glad they make returns so easy.  </li>
            <li>My only concern is that without a guard in place, the blades can easily &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; you, for example the top of your lip.</li>
            <li>The blades are easy to change, but they come fairly well oiled which makes cleaning somewhat messy because the oil attracts the hair shavings and requires some scrubbing with soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and the adjustment wheel has a nice solid feel to it.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable guard is easy to adjust and is way better than having multiple guards all over the place in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I have used two previous models of this trimmer and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Works great in the tight spots.</li>
            <li>Some units come with a large number of junk accessories, but the Philips has genuinely useful fine trimmers, etc.</li>
            <li>The shave using the blades is not super close but good enough for a good stubble.</li>
            <li>and I like for it to be clean cut with a crisp edge</li>
            <li>Minor issue on an otherwise exceptional product.</li>
            <li>you still need a hand razor for those up-close large areas (cheeks/neck) which this shaver doesn&#x27;t quite make smooth.</li>
            <li>As humans we might press strongly in this spot, and press gently in another spot while trimming, right?</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The most noticebale first impression offered by the Remington MB4040 beard trimmer is that its motor is powerful enough to provide a very clean cut.  </li>
            <li>Here are my thoughts on this handy and stylish little gadget;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Powerful and great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Also want to add that the plastic attachment for trimming you beard to a specified length, the plastic attachment is kind of flimsy and even if you apply just a little more pressure it will trim to a shorter length.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful, hold its charge for a long time and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you want a fast and precise razor, buy this.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts forever and it is light and relatively quiet, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few days, and it is working great.</li>
            <li>there is absolutely zero change in the length, and then when you adjust to a 3 setting it makes a huge jump.</li>
            <li>After trying multiple trimmers, this one is by far the best I have owned so far.</li>
            <li>The few times I got to use it it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, my wife prefers the unshaved look and feel, but not so much the mustache or beard.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t explain why it feels cheap to me, maybe too much plastic.  </li>
            <li>fast, comfortable.</li>
            <li>Was great while it lasted but it broke after a few months of use.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m fully satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>The motor is plenty powerful.</li>
            <li>Nice quiet motor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, and for the ridiculously low price you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find something better.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still as powerful as day one.</li>
            <li>As others have said, the duration of a charged battery is hugely better than the old model that used NiCad batteries.  </li>
            <li>Lithium Ion battery is noticeably more powerful than the old NiCad trimmer I replaced.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the price and even better than more expensive shavers.</li>
            <li>Depending on how you hold the trimmer, you either end up not cutting any hair, or shaving your face bald.</li>
            <li>but I thought it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>have given this 5 stars if it came with a case of some sort to keep the extra heads in, and a brush for cleaning would be nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alos nice to only have one guard to keep track of.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a heavy shaver, probably at most a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for another Remington that was many years old.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably quiet, cuts nicely, recharges well.</li>
            <li>Overall a nice product.</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful, it&#x27;s a nice form factor and the device is obviously well built.  </li>
            <li>But the lithium ion battery is sure an improvement over the old nicads.</li>
            <li>I have been through a few cordless chargers over the years and this one is, by far, the best one I have ever had.</li>
            <li>This is def worth the cost over some of the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>Had this for a few months and this is by far the best trimmer I have ever earned.</li>
            <li>The length gauge is a nice simple dial, just turn it to what you want.</li>
            <li>Powerful.</li>
            <li>There is no bag or stand or anything, so I put all of the external parts in my own bag</li>
            <li>This trimmer is much more powerful than my old Wahl that it is replacing.  </li>
            <li>Nice to finally find a company you can depend on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised to see that so many people gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor get the job</li>
            <li>- Powerful motor compared to Cruzer 6.</li>
            <li>Still full power on its first charge.  </li>
            <li>It is not cutting as well but after 2 years what do you expect.</li>
            <li>He loved it so much that when he accidentally left his at a hotel, he just purchased another one.</li>
            <li>Nice and solid.</li>
            <li>It moves effortlessly through my beard and seems to trim it well, arguably better than the old units.  </li>
            <li>Each head is screwed into a plastic case which easily snaps into the main trimmer device.</li>
            <li>This thing is powerful and cuts my hairy face with ease.  </li>
            <li>Better than my old Remington which I saved for what reason I have no clue.</li>
            <li>I would have liked one lower setting, but it works well enough as is.</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful and trims without pulling or snagging on your beard.  </li>
            <li>The clear plastic used in the adjustable spacer looks like it may be more resilient than the that of</li>
            <li>It does better for the beard but in a pinch can also do a complete haircut.</li>
            <li>im on 2 months on my first full charge.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer had a bunch of attachments, like the Wahl, so it would adapt to many uses.</li>
            <li>the additional blades aren&#x27;t useful to me and have joined my cluttered drawer of attachments and cords i never use, but keep just in case...</li>
            <li>was worth it.</li>
            <li>plenty powerful and well built.</li>
            <li>The older version was strong and versatile.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s certainly worth the money</li>
            <li>the battery is good, does a great cutting too</li>
            <li>I rarely charge it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i like to try to maintain a natural look with my facial hair, and this trimmer has been great for that.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m rather pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Extra shaving heads are a nice plus.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>has a nice solid feel to it.  </li>
            <li>The exchangeable blades are a nice touch, especially at this price point.</li>
            <li>You slide the guard to different preset positions - and there is a handy indicator on the razor telling you what length you&#x27;ve selected.</li>
            <li>But I still believe it surpasses all the others of its kind, so I keep coming back at holiday time!</li>
            <li>Not too noisy as well.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with only 1 adjustable plastic guard with 9 different sizes for custom level of trimming which is a bonus{less pieces laying around}, and 3 different razor heads.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - Very happy with this product, for the price I dont think you can get anything better.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t grumble too  much as the item is such good value for money</li>
            <li>I read the book on them but to be honest, I don&#x27;t know whats different about them.</li>
            <li>well worth the amount paid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite powerful and cuts well.  </li>
            <li>This guy is powerful, and seems well built.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier than the old Norelco, probably because of the better battery.</li>
            <li>, the company was kind enough to send me a replacement blade, complementary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall.. its been fun.  </li>
            <li>For everything this trimmer does and features, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Multiple head are a nice touch.</li>
            <li>The battery performance alone makes trimmer worth buying.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write a review although I purchase often on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>liked the power, sharpness, shape, design, plastic guard, Lithium battery, and especially the thumb roller adjustment for blade height/depth.</li>
            <li>Bought it to upgrade the battery, but I prefer the old one with the nickel cad battery better in terms of shape and ease of use.</li>
            <li>Also liked that it came with the extra shaver heads</li>
            <li>Does the job and apparently holds a great deal of power since it took more than 2 hours to run down</li>
            <li>My wife loved the newly discovered salt and pepper look but wasn&#x27;t a big fan once my stubble went into full Grizzly Adams mode after a week.  </li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer and the battery runs strong and lasts a long time (still working from my initial charge).  </li>
            <li>and it seems to work well and was exactly what he needed (right now he has a full beard and wanted this to trim it).</li>
            <li>It runs long and strong, is stylish and does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li>It also has excellent commercial style blades compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li>And as for irritation, even with the stubble blade the razor pulls hairs, and has nicked me several times, which is very uncommon in my experience with other products.</li>
            <li>The battery charged quickly the first time</li>
            <li>This blade gives me about a one day stubble, which most days is clean enough for me.  </li>
            <li>This mainly would be good for shaving the entire beard.</li>
            <li>I had an older Remington trimmer for years and loved it, but the battery finally died.</li>
            <li>Really holds a charge (much better than my older one).  </li>
            <li>I am still a very pleased user and certainly recommend this trimmer for any man with the slightest facial hair that needs to be tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still a very pleased user and certainly recommend this trimmer for any man with the slightest facial hair that needs to be tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes the stubble one cuts my skin under my chin but other than that good product, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>This is just as good as any other inexpensive trimmer</li>
            <li>The other 2 cutters are good though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He says it makes keeping his beard the right length</li>
            <li>so it chews you right up.  </li>
            <li>I searched for a couple of months to find the right trimmer.</li>
            <li>When I came across this one it had everything I was looking for and the price was right also.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Done everything right.</li>
            <li>Price was right.</li>
            <li>Priced just right.</li>
            <li>It even came charged right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Well then, you&#x27;ve bought the right clipper set.  </li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t matter because I think it cuts just right for the day after shaving look.  </li>
            <li>now I think those other trimmers were not even up to the standards of OK - This guy is quick, easy and rechargable.</li>
            <li>I previously had a very cheap remington that had lived its life after many years of beard trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was great for the first few months and now the battery does not charge</li>
            <li>So I purchased this several months ago, and at first I liked it.</li>
            <li>you still need to clean up with a straight or electric razor.</li>
            <li>MB4040 is easy to hold in your hand, not too heavy, not too light, ergonomically designed to make your life easier while holding it to go over your face with ease while you make yourself handsome.</li>
            <li>The two shaving attachments -- which were more or less stuck to the plastic clamshell that I was trying to pry open -- then fly out of the packaging and onto the floor.</li>
            <li>Would it have cost them so much more to create a small tray of some kind</li>
            <li>Does good job on my mustache and beard, long charge life for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and battery last for ever!</li>
            <li>The different styles allow me to shave down stubble, trim my goatee and mustache, and it all looks perfect when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>Although the different trimmer heads are easy to swap in and out my primary use is to trim my goatee.</li>
            <li>The guard also easily removes for precise trimming around the next line and stray hairs in the cheek area.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light enough to travel easily.</li>
            <li>I have owned probably a half a dozen different brands to this point, this is the best.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, easy to handle, multiple heads and the battery lasts forever.</li>
            <li>I found, however, that it is still easy enough to get a smooth, even trim by using the trimmer without the guard in place...</li>
            <li>Works better than my previous trimmer, a more even trim without having to go over and over and over for  fifteen minutes</li>
            <li>After using a Wahl for many, many years, I needed to upgrade to something that was new, sharp, wouldn&#x27;t grab my mustache hair, and would cut cleanly and thoroughly through my goatee.</li>
            <li>I use this trimmer with absolutely zero cream/moisturizer, and never a painful moment.  </li>
            <li>Though the plastic guard, with more than enough adjustments for the length of whiskers, is nice, I wish I would have made a different purchase.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say that for best battery results it should be completely discharged about once a month and left on the charger for about 24 hours, and I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;m going to have to leave it running until it dies.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say that for best battery results it should be completely discharged about once a month and left on the charger for about 24 hours, and I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;m going to have to leave it running until it dies.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product review I have ever written, but I think this product is worth the time.</li>
            <li>so many users complain that they cut themselves when using this trying to shave their bare skin.</li>
            <li>no problems, battery last forever, easy to clean, and powerful motor.</li>
            <li>Works great, Battery life is unbelievable</li>
            <li>the small detail blade is great for eyebrows and ears too.</li>
            <li>It  it a great beard trimmer the only thing that I could see going wrong is the adjustable part breaking if u drop it or something but all and all a great beard trimmer haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet</li>
            <li>It cut well, and the battery held a nice long charge.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts a long time, it cuts nicely, and seems durable.</li>
            <li>Quick charge: Got to use it right out of the box and fully charged really fast</li>
            <li>Feels solid and holds a strong charge!</li>
            <li>Clippers are sharp, easy to use, could not have made a better purchase.</li>
            <li>It does not offer easily clogged vacuum features, and thus is a good choice for beards that have gotten too long and need a \\&quot;brush cutter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>He said it shaves nice &amp; battery lasts a very very long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>The great thing about this razor is not only that it does the job without pulling your hairs out, but that it comes with three different attachments.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is that it holds a charge, which my old trimmer would no longer do.</li>
            <li>Always used Remington (4th so far) and really not too happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things seemed to be ok, but at some point a few months ago my trimmer stopped being able to hold a charge, so now I can&#x27;t use it at all,</li>
            <li>The quality, fit and finish were better than I expected at even twice the price.  </li>
            <li>really quickly and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I spent way too much time looking for a trimmer for my beard and this one had good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I realize that someone reading this review will probably make fun of me for not being able to figure out how to put this thing back together, but I&#x27;m manning up and admitting it anyway.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, that&#x27;s a great product, but it&#x27;s designed more for your head than for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick review because I don&#x27;t want to spend much time on this</li>
            <li>Works great and cuts low enough that I do not have to use a razor!</li>
            <li>The first charge lasted so long that I honestly don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li>I like the trimmer attachment with the smaller teeth that are closer together, it gives you nice straight edges when outlining, of course you must  take the comb off.  </li>
            <li>It gives appropriately short cuts, seems to hold a charge well and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Been through several Mustache &amp; Beard Trimmers &amp; so happy I finally found one that is to my husband&#x27;s liking!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, especially as the price is great</li>
            <li>That has worked fine, but the battery is pretty old and it&#x27;s not quite as powerful as it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Travel-friendly: it&#x27;s cordless and amazingly lightweight, not heavy like his old Remington.</li>
            <li>Great Trimmer, versatile with the 3 different blades and various setting heights.  </li>
            <li>It as simple to use, easy to clean, and cut evenly.  </li>
            <li>me, I am thrilled with this trimmer because that means the Wolf Man has left the building and in his place is a much cleaner looker hubby.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works as expected and a good reasonably priced replacement piece.  </li>
            <li>I have only used twice, so far so good.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice product -- small, but plenty of power to do the job.</li>
            <li>Long charge life, powerful motor, easy to clean and lots of setting options.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care about battery life so much as its not a very important feat in a trimmer which you will mostly use in you bathroom where you have the ability to keep it charged most of the time.</li>
            <li>Oh, and very accurate trimming heads (you get 3 of them in various sizes).  </li>
            <li>Even a very very close shave is doable without the heads on it.</li>
            <li>I am handling it very gently.</li>
            <li>All that at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This tool at a very reasonable price gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>I spent a few dollars more on this nice Remington and am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Was worried ( as I always am buying a new product to replace the old one) that it would not be as good as my old trimmer (also a Remington).  </li>
            <li>I had an old cheapo Remington cordless that worked fine for trimming my beard and my head, but the rechargeable battery had given up the ghost.</li>
            <li>guess like u just need to get used to... not bad trimmer with some improvements required - mainly concerning plastic combo, its regulation and fabrication material.</li>
            <li>Also good for a little over-the-ear and sideburns trim.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about a new trimmer for my beard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a ton of adjustable settings (multiple heads, lots of length settings), but length adjustments are quick and easy with a dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in kind of an odd position for turning on and off quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, cuts clean, has good adjustment levels and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Nothing huge to report on, as far as that goes.  </li>
            <li>That took some effort, but the battery lasted and it looks pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is kind of strange really</li>
            <li>This is my 10th trimmer and the first Remington; I&#x27;ve always used Phillips.</li>
            <li>Order arrived on time and exactly as advertised, but then I started to use it.</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer, this is my third in the Remington MB line.  </li>
            <li>He was immediately in love with it and still has it a year later</li>
            <li>I am public health doc! :-)</li>
            <li>I had an earlier version of a Remington and this model is very much better.  </li>
            <li>First one died out after 2 months....</li>
            <li>After only 6 months the battery has stopped holding a charge for more than a minute or two so I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband needed and he loves it.</li>
            <li>It turned on when I first opened it.  </li>
            <li>Most guys will want the lowest setting for the trimmer, which only increases the risk of creating bald</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This one feels more substantial than the cheapies I&#x27;ve used and the height settings are solid (don&#x27;t slip).</li>
            <li>I go back and forth wearing a beard, usually more in the winter.</li>
            <li>Trims pretty well.</li>
            <li>Adjustable guides take some practice, but when you use it with the power switch and dial facing away from your face (per the instructions) it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks on the first charge.  </li>
            <li>so this is my first shot at growing a beard</li>
            <li>My first trimmer and it works well.  </li>
            <li>As a first time user the hardest thing for me was to learn to hold the unit perpendicular to the face.  </li>
            <li>If I ran out of battery life while I was trimming, I think I would be a sasquatch, but more likely it is probably for traveling and not taking the charger with you.  </li>
            <li>I liked my old trimmer better,  this one seems to pull a bit &amp; cut uneven.</li>
            <li>word of advice though, be sure to use the stubble trimmer blade as the beard trimmer will make short work of your flesh.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this, it looked like I went swimming with piranhas.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Remington because I&#x27;ve always had a goatee and wanted the smaller blade that came with the set to be able to shape the hair on my face.</li>
            <li>Lithium Ion battery makes a big difference as well as being able to use it with the charger cord in place (using 110v) when needed.</li>
            <li>Long lasting battery, and the adjustable guard level is great.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on the first charge.</li>
            <li>Also the battery  on it last for days with just one charge :)</li>
            <li>Most power bricks of this size can be used globally, but not this one...</li>
            <li>I only used the trimmer once a week at most.</li>
            <li>I will wait till he uses it for the first time.</li>
            <li>This shaver trims much closer and even comes with a blade to leave stubble - which is apparently the latest style.</li>
            <li>The adjustable guard is helpful in keeping my goatee a consistent length.</li>
            <li>At first I was unsure about the lithium ion battery.  </li>
            <li>I modified it by trimming away some of the cover plastic to allow the cover switch to be more recessed and slide further and got it working again.  </li>
            <li>The first time I received this product, the head had popped off the trimmer and the blade assembly had come apart.  </li>
            <li>Having replaced my old trimmer, this product has fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>It is the first lithium one I have ever had, so there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used a Remington trimmer.</li>
            <li>I love that there is only one comb, and length is adjustable.  </li>
            <li>First the battery stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li>The guard also prevents me from trimming my mustache properly (i can&#x27;t bring the blades to the top of the mustache.</li>
            <li>it just doesnt keep a consistent length.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer (a cheap Wahl) would drain in two days just by sitting on my shelf.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut myself a couple times but not since my first week using it.</li>
            <li>The short is: I love it.</li>
            <li>It has not been on the charger since the first night.</li>
            <li>- If your beard or mustache is short, edging results will not be satisfying, but for longer hair like sideburns it would do the job.</li>
            <li>- Better trimming in the neck, but needs several passes.</li>
            <li>Which exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>Despite how hot the bearded model is in the product photos, *</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d done some research and this product was rated among the top five on various sites.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to keep my hair short and it really works great and simple to use.</li>
            <li>and this is my ONLY electronic product that is not compatible with most of the world.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on the first charge.</li>
            <li>[i should have checked this first].</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a thick beard and it works great on it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok looking at the pictures on this amazon product description page I will refer to the 3rd picture from the top in the description.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure when you buy it to follow the directions and FULLY charge it when you open the package.</li>
            <li>If you look at the trimmer with the guard on the guard rests about an inch higher than the blade, not flush on the blade.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what he was wanting.</li>
            <li>I chose another Remington because of the quality of the first</li>
            <li>First: I wish the #1 setting was shorter.  </li>
            <li>I like to trim/finish my beard away from my mouth (a nod to my wife&#x27;s not liking to &amp;#34;kiss beard&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Just something to be aware of in an otherwise well designed grooming aid.</li>
            <li>This is my first beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>It will most likely prove to be a five star trimmer</li>
            <li>This trimmer far exceeds my expectations by light years.</li>
            <li>I usually try to stick with brands with which I have had good success (Panasonic, Braun).</li>
            <li>The height guard delivers a consistent length, even around jawbone and chin.  </li>
            <li>With the Lithium Ion battery that does not maintain a memory, it will last for many years.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s a much better system than having a dozen different attachments, just roll the wheel and it adjusts quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a consistent cut and doesn&#x27;t tug any hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m updating my rating from 1 star to 4 stars, it would have garnered 5 stars had I not had the battery issue on the first unit I received.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first beard</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>me first thank Amazon for their generous return policy.</li>
            <li>It is too flexible and should have been made more rigid without the open edges that can grab at hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer</li>
            <li>This was exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a particularly expensive trimmer</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;something to be aware of:  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is *guaranteed* to nick you (painfully) in multiple places if you shave against the grain like many guys do.  </li>
            <li>This is my first beard trimmer but it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for a couple of months and charged  it once after the first time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Before it started acting up it did do a good job trimming, but be warned that if used without a guard the pointy prongs will catch in your skin and make you bleed if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I hoped for</li>
            <li>Regrettably, this resulted in more of the same: pain and bleeding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it has the interchangeable heads for different shave &amp;#34;projects&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than my last Remington I wore out.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li>The guard is only one piece that is able to be set higher or lower.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor in June 2014 and gave it its first charge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several beard trimmers most of which were junk.</li>
            <li>really powerfull!</li>
            <li>First, the battery.  </li>
            <li>Second, based on its price, I figured I was getting something better than those $15 trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remington brand has done well, the trimmer does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>He was pleased not only with how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>Mission accomplished!</li>
            <li>Battery power and life seem leading edge - I am interested to see how this one ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>was purchased on January 21 and use it for the first time on February 27.</li>
            <li>but with what is supposed to be a higher quality battery.</li>
            <li>If the battery last for a couple of years I would say Remington has the better product in the market.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m completely satisfied and stoked I bought this thing.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what I want it for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t exactly what he wanted, but he kept it anyway.</li>
            <li>First thing I was amazed by was the packaging of the product itself.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope this type of rechargeable battery will last a lot longer and not end up as another \\&quot;disposable\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The beard attachment actually made a better stubble.</li>
            <li>but it does the job and does it pretty well.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t expect to be able to keep your stubble trimmed short.</li>
            <li>: This is the first electronic shaver device I have ever had and since the first use got the results I was looking for</li>
            <li>charger spoild on first day, batt charge for 2 days can use max 10 mins then need to charge.&lt;br /&gt;please check the review before buy.</li>
            <li>The first one only lasted 8 yrs., and you can&#x27;t do better than that.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li>but it did get hot against my skin.  </li>
            <li>Construction is a bit on the light side when compared to my 3 year old Remington titanium trimmer.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted for my beard upstairs and downstairs.</li>
            <li>Another thing you CANT trim/shave on zero level, the blades will cut through your skin (happened to be the first time).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and all that in the first go with the device.</li>
            <li>The first one of these I got worked like a charm for close trims (it was confiscated by TSA</li>
            <li>Thanks, Remington!    </li>
            <li>On time exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>But because I have a short beard, I find myself using the MB-200 more because the plastic guard allows for a closer cut.</li>
            <li>Iuse this shaver not for a beard but for my hair so this review is based upon mostly hair and some facial hiar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is my first experience of shaving at home</li>
            <li>Takes way too many passes over my beard to actually trim it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for everyday shaving</li>
            <li>but as far as trimming goes, it does a good job, just a mess to clean.</li>
            <li>The MB4040 didn&#x27;t require recharging as frequently as my older model, but other than that, I don&#x27;t have much good to say about it.</li>
            <li>far battery life has been great, and it can get a quick charge enough to last through a trim if the battery dies on you</li>
            <li>I have used many Norelco and other brand trimmers in the past, but this might be the best so far.</li>
            <li>but man if ur not careful it cuts pretty easily.</li>
            <li>It seems like it doesn&#x27;t want to charge to begin with as the yellow charging light goes off rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It runs very well and for the time being it is superior to the previous rechargeable I owned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super powerful, holds a VERY long charge, and is pretty precise.  </li>
            <li>My father is now enjoying the new razor &amp; able to shave in half the time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it less than 12 times but I am very pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the battery last a long time, and the handle is nice and shiny, but those 2 aspects have to the only 2 postive factors with this cheaply made Remington trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I have spent far to many hours on line researching clippers, I tried the TRYM11, did not come close to being able to clip my beard, nor did this clipper at the lowest adjustment, where the MB 300 really does</li>
            <li>There are no other attachments that can give you fine detailing options.</li>
            <li>So the 4040 while probably a very suitable clipper just does not clip short enough, and I am not a stubble guy.</li>
            <li>product!a lot worse, and for this price it&#x27;s about as good as it gets!    </li>
            <li>My old $9 trimmer with snap-on guides was far easier to use and also was gave more consistent results.</li>
            <li>I predict this trimmer will far outlast my original too.</li>
            <li>Lots of power, and the blades are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>How could it have taken so long for someone to design such a simple product that works effortlessly and flawlessly</li>
            <li>Love, love the cordless feature and the long lasting battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Only the main trimmer is useful, the fine trimmer and goalie trimmer didn&#x27;t seem useful to me.</li>
            <li>Most reviewers claim that they go very long periods at a time and they haven&#x27;t had to charge it, and I&#x27;m pleased to say that I&#x27;ve had the same experience!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First the pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life has so far been nothing short of amazing</li>
            <li>The trimmer blade must be completely removed frequently to clean it out.</li>
            <li>The plastic, multi-length attachment comes on and off easily, so I can adjust for different lengths on the side and back, then take it off to buzz the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I had a soft bag saved from an old shaver and an able to put all the parts in that, including cleaning brush and comb</li>
            <li>Compared to fancier and more fragile products, this was a real relief.</li>
            <li>The extra blade attachments are going to come in handy where others just have one fixed blade</li>
            <li>I really like is how long the battery holds up (am able to use many times before needing to recharge) and the low price of this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>FYI, pretty much only good for facial trimming, really nothing else</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not good if you want a clean shave, but it is great as far as managing a beard.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I can send it back and get a full refund.</li>
            <li>Have enjoyed it for the past three months and the AC charging unit is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s average at best compared to previous models</li>
            <li>biggest positive is the battery life.  </li>
            <li>It had a decent charge from right out the package.</li>
            <li>Love the lithium ion battery, powerful motor and sharp blades.</li>
            <li>Been at least two months, and I&#x27;m still loving this product!</li>
            <li>have only had the opportunity to use it a few times but so far I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use any pressure, and I just barely touched the hairs as lightly as I could.</li>
            <li>Most pleasing is the long battery life and the built in recharger.</li>
            <li>This trims it exactly the way I like it, and it was reasonable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it pretty much once a week since then.</li>
            <li>You can pretty much set it at any length you want to by the adjusting wheel.</li>
            <li>It appears to be more powerful than other razors I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean....  holds a charge for longer than any other cordless trimmer I have used.  </li>
            <li>I held the trimmer, and it seems well balanced, and his beard looked GREAT after he used it - not too short like it sometimes looked with the other model.</li>
            <li>It would be a good additon to have a small accessories bag with this</li>
            <li>the past fair while--</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give a nice, clean buzz cut, instead it kind of shreds the hair in all directions, so his hair looks messy and &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; so I have to keep going over the same area a few times to get all the hair it missed and smooth it out.</li>
            <li>It came in the mail lightning quick and even had enough charge to do a quick touch up on my beard.</li>
            <li>But the new one works pretty good, just messy.</li>
            <li>The adjustment wheel works as I expected and gives a very fine length adjustment for beard, sideburns and around ears.</li>
            <li>the plus side battery does last a long time (as long as mine was working) and fit and finish is great.</li>
            <li>trimmer operates at a seemingly high RPM which generates more noise than anticipated - would not operate if someone was sleeping in the next room.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>So this beard trimmer seemed to work OK for a while, and the motor was strong enough to cut through thick hair pretty easily.</li>
            <li>The titanium blades are really sharp and very easy to use product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is very easy to use and does its job.</li>
            <li>This is a good economical trimmer which is user friendly and not too expensive either.</li>
            <li>What I just realized about it that makes it amazing is I have not charged it for a year and a half</li>
            <li>The Lithium battery is really pretty amazing, as I&#x27;ll not charge the thing and use it a few times a week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to do more than 2 passes regardless of how lazy I&#x27;ve been, which is a huge improvement over what I had before.</li>
            <li>I like the overall design and easy of use.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is pretty much the whole package.</li>
            <li>This thing will easily make it through a summer sheer session on one charge (I&#x27;d say I have a medium amount of body hair).  </li>
            <li>The adjustable comb attachment fits over the blade easily and has several calibration setting using the numbered zoom wheel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of guy who typically runs things into the ground.</li>
            <li>It also comes with two additional heads for different trimming requirements which are extremely easy to swap out.  </li>
            <li>I concluded that maybe I&#x27;m just getting older and that the recently higher prevalence of grey in my beard gave it a tougher texture, making shaving just suck more than it used to.</li>
            <li>Those saying they can&#x27;t have this happen easily need to watch the instructional video that Remington provides on youtube, it shows how to properly use it.</li>
            <li>but the comb is not as effective, it is harder to clean and I have managed to cut myself twice (something that never occurred with the prior model I used).</li>
            <li>The 9 different easy to select positions</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;ll still yank em out easy enough.  </li>
            <li>Cuts even and easy to adjust the settings, but I have only had it for a week now.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s pretty light and doesn&#x27;t tire your hand if you&#x27;re shaving your neck or back.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of this built-in system instead of the myrid of attachments I previously had for my trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is easily adjustable for facial hair trimming,</li>
            <li>My previous trimmer would not hold a charge so I found this model on-line and liked the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty fantastic, I have only charged it once in a month or so, so</li>
            <li>Solid construction, easy to use for beard and mustache trimming.</li>
            <li>I like that you can adjust the length by dial, and the different trimmers are easy to swap out.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you wash and dry the blade after use.  </li>
            <li>Has 9 different settings so easy to find the setting you desire.</li>
            <li>When I used the trimmer for the first (and only) time, I learned that the guard is made out of cheap flimsy plastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but I would go for a higher quality shaver next time since in this case</li>
            <li>: The trimmer comes with three different blades, really easy to change</li>
            <li>It seems to be that if you try to cut off too much (by letting your hair get too long and then trying to take more than 1/3 of an inch</li>
            <li>I like how they are easily changed by  a simple snapping mechanism.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong after the final trim.</li>
            <li>Now I only use the trimmer 2-3 times per month, but it has held a charge and is running just as strong today as it was the day I charged it.  </li>
            <li>That is the last time I charged this thing, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>This mainly would be good for shaving the entire beard before using a razor blade, line up sideburns, back of head, and over the ears, or if you want a stubble</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 weeks now and it is still running strong from the initial charge.</li>
            <li>lightweight, well made, feels good in the hand and has a long lasting lithium battery.</li>
            <li>and since it is a Remington I expect it to last a good long time.</li>
            <li>Its super cute and havent had a single issue with it so far.</li>
            <li>Very well designed, ergonomic handle, sharp fine blades , easy to clean , low noise and stayed charged for long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery seems very good, and if properly maintained seems like it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea in theory: rather than having a ten detachable plastic combs (one for each length), the one attachment slides over the blades, and a dial on the trimmer moves it up or down to adjust length.</li>
            <li>leaving a large gap in the comb</li>
            <li>For a lithium powered shaver, even the A/C adapter is large and heavy&lt;br /&gt;Limited accessory set.</li>
            <li>so you get what you pay for to a certain extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one ever dies, I will certainly replace it with an identical model.</li>
            <li>shaver  is  large  in  size.  </li>
            <li>It can certainly hold the charge for months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Blades are easy to remove and switch: right now, hubby is only interested in the detail blade for his goatee but likes how easy it is to pop the other blades in</li>
            <li>Solid build, great battery life, and very sharp blades.</li>
            <li>I hoped the product would have quite a bit more longevity, but here I am a year later looking for yet another new beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I had a similar previous version of this trimmer that did a great job while it was running.  </li>
            <li>for cleaning is not as handy as my previous one since you have to remove the whole lid&lt;</li>
            <li>It is far superior to my previous Remington.</li>
            <li>Cut very well with no pull and the different blades makes the job easy.  </li>
            <li>Keeps things nice and tight.</li>
            <li>I like to keep my beard tight to my face and this does it nicely.</li>
            <li>At first I chalked it up to me getting used to a new trimmer, but every time I used it it pulled hairs!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i just use if for clean up of sideburns and general grooming, not</li>
            <li>our experience with this product is a good one, and even though my name is Remington, I stay with Remington because trimmers like this seem to last a real long time.</li>
            <li>our experience with this product is a good one, and even though my name is Remington, I stay with Remington because trimmers like this seem to last a real long time.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that it vibrates a lot now with the fine blade.</li>
            <li>The mess is easy to clean</li>
            <li>The trimmer holds a charge well, and works just fine for regular trimming.  </li>
            <li>However I have found I can use the fine tooth regular cutter to do everything.</li>
            <li>dial in your personal &amp;#34;hey, i didn&#x27;t shave (because i&#x27;m creative/outdoorsy/apathetic/lazy) level for the day and fine tune the areas you do want to refine.</li>
            <li>The blades themselves are fine, but the plastic mounts that hold the blades are apparently fragile.</li>
            <li>Keep a steady hand, or you&#x27;ll alter the landscape in a hurry!</li>
            <li>Nice little tremor trimmer</li>
            <li>The adjustable length attachment on the MB4040 is a nice feature as it just take a little dial to change the height</li>
            <li>Because I have Braun 790, it will clean those small hairs, and would give me a better shave around the edges of my mustache.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp blades, no more pulling out whiskers and does a great job of shaving the back of my neck.</li>
            <li>It was good enough -- cheap and flimsy but got the job done -- when I first started using it, but 8 months later it won&#x27;t hold a charge long enough for even a quick beard trim.</li>
            <li>But the iStubble isn&#x27;t good for hard to reach places like under the nose</li>
            <li>I love the long charge on the battery and the high R.P.M. of the motor that is not even mentioned in the add or instruction sheet that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, thank you.</li>
            <li>Well, a little more than 1 year from purchase date and the charge doesn&#x27;t last more than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>The blades do not make a clean sharp line and they do not cut close to the skin where I want to clean up the edges.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, powerful, easily adjustable, quieter than a lot.</li>
            <li>Powerful, sharp and does the job very quick.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and charges in a few</li>
            <li>Worked great for a month, then the battery would only run for about 2 minutes and died a few weeks after that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid trimmer, with accurate, visible adjustment settings and lots of power.</li>
            <li>The stubble attachment works very well.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really glad I spent the money and purchased this item.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t bother me much because I don&#x27;t need it any shorter than 2.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very aggressive cutter with a lot of power</li>
            <li>bought this trimmer to shave my whole face with.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if not for the quality, for the price!</li>
            <li>Holds a charge really well, but it will tear yore skin up.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely a must have for beard aficionados.</li>
            <li>Beefy.</li>
            <li>Really holds a charge.</li>
            <li>Worked very well for a year, but Battery no longer holds a charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wanted to point out the plastic height adjustment / guard since when I was shopping for this I really had to dig to find info about it.  </li>
            <li>Since the gaps between the teeth are so much narrower</li>
            <li>/&gt;It Trims much closer.</li>
            <li>The stubble blade attachment gets very close.  </li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t trim very well around the curves of the face, under the nose/upper lip, and on the chin.</li>
            <li>The P.N. trims MUCH faster with fewer passes.  </li>
            <li>The battery on this one lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so I cant use a foil or straight razor.</li>
            <li>Turns out that this one doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li>Really like the battery.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to trim it up, and upon initial use, I&#x27;m gonna keep trying, as it evened out my scruff well &amp; worked smoothly...</li>
            <li>Very good..serves u well to maintain stubble.</li>
            <li>In short, it&#x27;s industrial, simple to use, and works great, which keeps things simple for me, just the way I like it!</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for not even a whole year</li>
            <li>and very inexpensive for what you pay for.</li>
            <li>But the real question is ....</li>
            <li>works real well &amp; the battery</li>
            <li>The battery stays charged while unplugged for months a time thanks to it being Lithium Ion.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really fault</li>
            <li>It works really well too.</li>
            <li>I am usually much faster at decisions.  </li>
            <li>Get a dedicated, real stubble trimmer or you&#x27;ll end up wasting a lot of time with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Feels durable and takes a charge really well.</li>
            <li>really well I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for some time</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The blades are well constructed and feel very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>/cheap feel to them, but together the razor functions very well.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is great as well as the compact design, but with the results I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;m not sure how much longer I will be willing to gamble with my facial hair.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s simply not an acceptable lifespan with today&#x27;s available battery technology.</li>
            <li>Cuts very well</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really all I need.</li>
            <li>and it lasted the whole time.</li>
            <li>It also comes out of the box ready to use (including being fully charged).</li>
            <li>I am very fond of this Remington MB4040 trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I would really like Amazon to fix this problem with a replacement charger.</li>
            <li>As i am a regular user of amazon this should be done free of charge.</li>
            <li>This trimmer functions very well, and</li>
            <li>So much for that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;strong blades and cuts very close to the skin.</li>
            <li>the charging light stays on constantly and there is no power getting to it.</li>
            <li>Just too much effort had to buy another trimmer as well.</li>
            <li>Also it is much cleaner to use.</li>
            <li>This clipper is precise enough to shape my moustache.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the MB4040 to replace it because I knew it would be much quieter (which it is).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since returned the MB4040 and am going to try another Remington model which looks promising at it</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it cuts really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>As you might have guessed it, it is very reliable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(realistically it won&#x27;t cost that much anyways).</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>The clippers without one of te size heads on it is very close to the skin where I have nicked it once or twice.</li>
            <li>this does the trick very well.</li>
            <li>wanted a very close shave because I get rashes from using a blade.</li>
            <li>but this thing you can just hear how much faster the blades move.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge real well.</li>
            <li>Throwing it in the garbage at this very moment.</li>
            <li>Holds charge very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely forever.  </li>
            <li>This works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>The 3 heads that come with it make it very flexible to any type of trimming.</li>
            <li>a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic protector feels smooth against my skin as I trim my goatee.</li>
            <li>I do my hair ( I don&#x27;t have much ) and beard with the guide on and the close trimming with the guide off.</li>
            <li>( you cant really see what you are doing)&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>Seems to hold a charge very well</li>
            <li>Second, you can&#x27;t comfortably use the MB4040 without the clipper guard attached.</li>
            <li>Maybe Remington responded to those remarks and stopped sharpening the blades as much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Remington for making my day.  </li>
            <li>Very functional trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Had this for a couple of months now and it really does work well.</li>
            <li>You can leave it plugged in without overcharging, so it is always ready.  </li>
            <li>worked the whole time no recharge.  </li>
            <li>I really lïke the device.</li>
            <li>It trims very close.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I wasnt too concerned as i didnt use them much anyway.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>He really likes the way it trims.</li>
            <li>For the price, I really like it.</li>
            <li>I go at things carefully, slitting the tape on the sides and top with a pocketknife and then pulling the inside packaging</li>
            <li>(the blades get REALLY close to your skin with this head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine came charged and ready out of the box.  </li>
            <li>i have owed it for about six weeks and find it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it</li>
            <li>would like to see a battery life indicator or even a battery getting low light</li>
            <li>Just wanted a stubble trimmer that was simple and cheap.  </li>
            <li>Yes this unit comes with swappable trimmer attachments but who the heck wants to get a screw driver out and swap just to do a moustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used the mb200 for years and years and really like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t grow beards very often, but when I do, I need to keep them well groomed in order to be presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really lasts (I don&#x27;t bother to pack the charger whenever I go on trips).</li>
            <li>The jog dial moves the blade part very, very slightly - I can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s the smoothness of the shaver that I really like and can recommend.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer that you can just buzz over your face without worrying if you&#x27;ll take off to much, i have my doubts if this critter will do it.  </li>
            <li>If Remington were a responsible bunch, they&#x27;d pull this product from the market immediately.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to report it to the CPSC, and I may very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>really?).  </li>
            <li>Charge also holds a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this trimmer.</li>
            <li>.. very sturdy cant beat the price..</li>
            <li>Very sturdy construction.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I fear I&#x27;ve said too much.</li>
            <li>and feel make it a comfortable use and the different heads come in handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those that like their goatee and mustache trimmed very close, the guard does not allow the blade to get \\&quot;close enough.\\</li>
            <li>Lithium holds a charge longer and charges fast when I need it.</li>
            <li>It may work well for longer hair trimming, but if you like to keep your beard cut at the \\&quot;lowest setting\\&quot; then its a real pain in the butt to get this to do the trick.</li>
            <li>Very quiet (compared), and smooth.</li>
            <li>Very unfriendly, so I am returning it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my college-age son for Christmas and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I will be treating it carefully (and making sure to store it at the \\&quot;minimum/</li>
            <li>It was very time consuming.  </li>
            <li>I really like this razor</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>really long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I realize I don&#x27;t have time for my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the length adjustment roller is very sleek.</li>
            <li>It lasts MUCH longer between charges.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>It is very well built.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a well-built, cheap beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>My husband has been complaining about how much work it takes to maintain his goatee.</li>
            <li>After receiving the item, much to my surprise, it appears that I am now one of the picky people.</li>
            <li>it seems like I got what I paid for...not much.</li>
            <li>The battery really lasts a lot.</li>
            <li>This is a well priced cordless trimmer that works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I understand that he wants to grow it out</li>
            <li>Plus since hubby works in retail his appearance matters and having a really shaggy beard (picture the wolf</li>
            <li>but it really helped with cleaning up the front of his beard.</li>
            <li>Plus he says it does it fast so he can keep up with his look even if he doesn&#x27;t have much time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any issues with battery life, and I don&#x27;t charge it very often.</li>
            <li>The real kicker however is the lithium ion battery.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t recharged it since and the battery still continues to drive the blades fast.</li>
            <li>and this one does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t shave on a schedule, so when I&#x27;m shaggy this gets me ready for blade or foil.</li>
            <li>It does the goatee trimming very well.</li>
            <li>It cuts very well.</li>
            <li>I will not say that this Remington brand is the very finest of the bunch but, for me, it has proven to work very well.</li>
            <li>I will not say that this Remington brand is the very finest of the bunch but, for me, it has proven to work very well.</li>
            <li>Much easier to provide shape to my beard or moustache with this beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>whenever the mood strikes without eating into the number of recharges older-style recharables are capable of taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades themselves are also very heavy-duty and feel like they are quality made.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really</li>
            <li>a great&lt;br /&gt;Priced very appropriate&lt;br /&gt;nice</li>
            <li>seem sto be very sturdy.</li>
            <li>In this aspect of the Remington design teams infinite wisdom they really dropped the ball.</li>
            <li>unit works very well, and doesn&#x27;t spread whiskers all over the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Solid construction; doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  </li>
            <li>Does a respectable job, but loud as a lawnmower next to your ear.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a trimmer that got broken recently, and I am very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Nice they offer those, since the unit will likely last for years.  </li>
            <li>and while i able to put them back together, they eventually all completely broke.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it&#x27;s simplicity and long lasting battery.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve only used the regular beard attachment, so I can speak to the goatee or the stubble attachments, but I&#x27;ve had nothing but good results with what I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>It has 3 different heads for trimming different things which is really nice</li>
            <li>good to handle for a hair cut , but to trim a beard is not so good .....is cutting the beard to short !</li>
            <li>, Much better than my ten year old trimmer did.</li>
            <li>So far so good , haven&#x27;t had it long enough to rate it any higher.</li>
            <li>This a good trimmer that I use when I&#x27;m running late</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using beard trimmers for many years, and most have been usable but (a) poorly constructed,</li>
            <li>This is my third trimmer in roughly 10 years, and it will probably be my trimmer-of-choice for a good while to come.</li>
            <li>and they were a nice heavy quality metal.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the right blade attachment though as the blades will &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; a little if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>(unit still contains charge from factory and going strong) - I am simply amazed and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use this every other day and I love the attachments and the ability to trim my beard to a certain length.</li>
            <li>As with most trimmers, trying to find the right method to do your mustache can be more difficult than the rest of your beard</li>
            <li>This unit works exactly as the old trimmers did: with 9 length settings for triming, a simple on/off switch, and a guard that easily comes off for cleaning the unit of cut hair.  </li>
            <li>Great Shaver, very sharp, holds a long charge.</li>
            <li>The attachment give a wide range of cuts and is just the right width for precise trimming.  </li>
            <li>It is, however, very sharp, not at all suitable for trimming borders or shape.  </li>
            <li>The battery life I am not sure about I will have to use it more, but it is comfortable in your hands and is nimble not like my old Norelco!</li>
            <li>The battery seems to last a long time between charges, the blade attachments are nicely sized and function fine, and it&#x27;s a fairly quiet trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer comes with attachments to ensure a consistent length to the beard (a plastic, comb-like cover that goes over the cutter head) and extra cutter heads to get into tight areas or do a good stubble trim.</li>
            <li>My old one was very cheap, didn&#x27;t hold a charge for long and didn&#x27;t cut very well.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought a new Wahl (for half the price) and am once again happy when I trim</li>
            <li>It goes a long time on a charge and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The charger functions well and the battery stays strong for a long time.</li>
            <li>Nice and adjustable, it&#x27;s got a sharp blade and does nearly anything you would want a trimmer to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not good for very short stubble; does not cut as closely as other trimmers (from Wahl and Philips)&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>but it slipped from a the grip of the user and broke on the first fall, which wasn&#x27;t very far.</li>
            <li>It is powerful, it holds a charge and the settings are clear and steady.</li>
            <li>I really like that this is the lithium ion powered trimmer, as the batteries seem to hold a charge much longer than the older nimh or nicad rechargeables.  </li>
            <li>The length knob is very easy to use for multiple lengths on different parts of my beard.  </li>
            <li>This is much better than any other trimmer I have used for my head and face.  </li>
            <li>and it gives me a significantly closer shave, leaving me with stubble only.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge well, able to be used in the shower, metal blades are sharp and there is no tugging.</li>
            <li>THE OTHER TWO PINCH LIKE MOST JUNK TRIMMERSS.OVERWISE</li>
            <li>I originally purchased the MB200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer last year.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The titanium coated blades offer long-lasting sharpness, but many of the other cordless trimmers like the ones from Philips, also feature titanium coated blades.</li>
            <li>This Remington is more functional than other comparable shavers, for the price.  </li>
            <li>I have had Norelco and a couple of other off brands and this one is better than them all.</li>
            <li>My husband says that it is better than any other beard shaver he has had.  </li>
            <li>Most other shavers, the adjuster is a plastic attachment which almost always breaks.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, its OK</li>
            <li>Better than expected !</li>
            <li>I have had it for a couple of months and still have not recharged it, and it does not pull the hair in my beard like so many other trimmers do.</li>
            <li>Then, as experience by many other reviewers who gave the trimmer 1 star, the trimmer stopped holding charge and eventually died.  </li>
            <li>Clean cuts, long battery life - have used it once a week (2 minutes per session) for 3 weeks, still going strong, have yet to charge the battery.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable trimmer guard works fine, a little cumbersome reattaching as there are two groves which must be aligned - not a big issue mildly</li>
            <li>The little wheel in the middle controls the length of the beard guide and is easy to change on the fly, which was extremely helpful between beard trimming and mustache work.</li>
            <li>Gets close enough to keep me looking clean shaven but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>The material it is made of shouldn&#x27;t allow shaved whiskers to stick to it nearly as much as the older Remington unit it replaced.  </li>
            <li>I could never get the older unit really cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Taking it apart to clean it after use is also extremely simple.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is small, effective and very convenient.</li>
            <li>the whole this is a decent trimmer, that gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to clean and like it says, it has self-oiling blades (not sure how that works but</li>
            <li>this works ok, pulled a few beard hairs at first but has stopped since then.</li>
            <li>Because the trimmer guard is FLIMSY, NOT HARD, ISN&#x27;T ENGINEERLY WILL DESIGNED!</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and cuts fast as well as seems to hold a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The battery only takes a short time to charge up but the best part is the charge lasts a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A great example of how something new on the evolutionary tree is WORSE than what it was intended to update.</li>
            <li>I tried shaving over the same areas MANY times and from multiple angles, but this thing just would *not* trim certain areas.</li>
            <li>The strength of the motor is better than any battery charged unit that I&#x27;ve used previously, the blades much, much sharper.</li>
            <li>I really liked that old trimmer, but in typical fashion, I ran it to death.</li>
            <li>Accurate control and long life between charges.</li>
            <li>Has some pretty unique power settings so be careful.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty clearly a quality built piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>For some reason I haven&#x27;t been able to find a trimmer that will trim these stray hairs along with the dark hair.  </li>
            <li>Even with a full charge, I have to try over and over again--turning off and then back on--to get it to start.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve either gotta be going for a very short look or a full beard.</li>
            <li>I have a full beard and only trim twice a week, so I&#x27;m hoping for years of use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t grow a full beard at all so short stubbly</li>
            <li>and it only goes 30 seconds on a full charge.  </li>
            <li>Level adapter does not get properly fixed to the number you select unless you select a higher one (3 in my case) and then go to the lower (2) From 1 to 2</li>
            <li>They said if I send the product back (at my cost) they will issue a full refund.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, this was the first task I tried with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Watch out thought because at first it can cut your neck as you have sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li>Trimmer cuts fairly close to the skin, but the guard is too big, even on the lowest setting, especially if you want a shortly trimmed, but still visible beard</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;mustache trimmer&amp;#34; head that is included is also pretty handy as it is basically a very small (in width) trimmer head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really liked my Remington MB-200, which has lasted me about four years, until recently the clipper assembly has started coming loose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being able to change the head gives it a big advantage to clean it properly and making it last longer.</li>
            <li>With this razor, the ability to ratchet the comb up and down in very small increments using a thumb dial on the body makes this a perfect solution to that</li>
            <li>It is a little bit bigger and noticeably heavier than the Norelco, which makes me think it probably has a more powerful motor  and a higher capacity battery.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I brought this in to use for my shortly kept neat beard, I have an old Remington MB 300 that works fine after</li>
            <li>there are many pieces, all fragile, the money spent on the accessory blades would be better put toward making the primary blades not rip your hair out, and after minimal use it died about a year after later</li>
            <li>If it lasts half as long as my old one I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>SO FAR, which was when I received the product and  had to charge it completely for the first time !</li>
            <li>I would buy this one again if I needed a new one!</li>
            <li>By Friday I had a brand new razor sitting at my door!  </li>
            <li>Really good battery life, but it pretty much ends there  - at least for trimming short beards.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the new exchanging heads feature.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate their responsiveness, and I didn&#x27;t expect a whole new packaged unit, just a battery.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a very long time, cuts well and accurate.</li>
            <li>MUCH better than the inexpensive MB200 I previously purchased.</li>
            <li>one is even better, and sturdier than previous one.&lt;br /&gt;Higly recommended.</li>
            <li>That alone makes it a worthwhile upgrade from previous models.</li>
            <li>I hope they update this and make the plastic guard more like the previous models.</li>
            <li>another trimmer i bought for half the price did better.</li>
            <li>Should make for a decent doorstopper.</li>
            <li>I hope this one will last as many years as the last.</li>
            <li>So far this unit has kept it&#x27;s charge better than expected.</li>
            <li>Trims decently well.</li>
            <li>main drawback is the gray hair.  </li>
            <li>I use bought this because the older model I had battery died.  </li>
            <li>After only a dozen or so battery charges under occasional use the battery will no longer take a charge that lasts more than five minutes.</li>
            <li>I ordered this around Christmas 2012 hoping to find a decent trimmer that I could use around twice a week.</li>
            <li>As an FYI, Remington recommends the Main (not the stubble) blade for the closest cut.  </li>
            <li>I leave the main blade on all the time.  </li>
            <li>sure enough, the SAME THING HAPPENS WITH THIS MODEL.  </li>
            <li>The lithium battery lasts a long time, which is nice to have a long use time without worrying about the battery dying.  </li>
            <li>I use the comb attachment mainly when trimming  and shaping my mustache.  </li>
            <li>I had an older trimmer that fell and broke.</li>
            <li>I replaced an older rechargeable Panasonic beard trimmer that had to be charged before every use.</li>
            <li>I love all of the options you have for such a low price.</li>
            <li>It recommends charging for 24 hours prior to use, but luckily the product was designed for men and ignoring the instructions is taken into account.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of keeping the design similar, the trimming machinery and the guard are completely different and yank many of my hair out instead of trimming them.</li>
            <li>After months of use I can say that it lasts way longer than my older unit with a NiCd battery.  </li>
            <li>When my last hair trimmer (also made by Remington), after many years of reliable use finally died, I started looking for another one.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My wife ordered this to replace an older model because of the longer-life battery.</li>
            <li>I will end up using my older model.</li>
            <li>I end up using the beard trimmer on the outer parts of my beard then using the stubble with no guard at an angle to fade to a decent stubble on the interior.</li>
            <li>I get done and still see patches where it totally missed no matter how many times you go over the same spot.</li>
            <li>Only 110v - loud sound.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on sale at a department store to replace the older [[ASIN:B0009OMU0A Remington MB-200 Beard Trimmer]]</li>
            <li>My beard is older than a lot of people that I work with.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer mainly for the stubble trimmer feature...</li>
            <li>Hols a decent charge.</li>
            <li>, that was one of my main reasons for buying it.  </li>
            <li>My main use is for trimming a goatee beard.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s describe this particular one.</li>
            <li>plus I believe it didn&#x27;t have the L-Ion battery.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for handling this particular product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i keep my van dyke trimmed short, and use my normal razor to shape it while i take care of the rest of my face--and so i use the trimmer the way it came out of the box:  with a blade that goes the full length of the machine, and with a built-in length guide.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I purchased this trimmer was to detail the edges (mainly the sides) of my goatee and to even up the bottom of my mustache.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an older model of this type of clipper and I have to say that they don&#x27;t make em like they used to.</li>
            <li>I’ve used mainly the beard trimmer</li>
            <li>Holds a decent charge</li>
            <li>This purchase was to replace an older model and it is just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent quality trimmer that feels well built.</li>
            <li>After all, there is only so many times you can recharge these batteries before they totally run out of power.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also find the ergonomic angle of the trimming head to be much better than the classic trimmer style, especially when trimming the back of my neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quiet and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the beard trimmer for the main areas and the goatee trimmer to shape the lower lip area.  </li>
            <li>Decent trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an older set of hair clippers, with no guard.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have too many fancy gadgets like some of the more expensive devices have nowadays</li>
            <li>Some were better than shears and a comb and, as the years, they got better but not perfect.</li>
            <li>The MB4040 model replaced my older Remington that I used for 15 years.</li>
            <li>I have an older version MB 85 which has lasted me for years and also has the mustache trimmer which this model lacks.</li>
            <li>I have this and the older (and cheaper) MB-200.  </li>
            <li>It was a replacement for a previous trimmer with older battery technology and it performs 100% better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wide enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like a beard trimmer and does the job quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>and you must either rely on a steady hand and a comb.</li>
            <li>Wish I had bought the older model.</li>
            <li>I like the easy trim-height adjustment with a very solid feedback and nice, solid on/off switch that is not easy to accidently turn off.</li>
            <li>this one sucks without the guard, if you want the stubble look this is not for you, youll cut your face up for sure!</li>
            <li>its got a significant battery life as it takes so long to get a job finished.</li>
            <li>battery wont hold a full charge and wont work plugged in long enough to trim a full beard</li>
            <li>Works well on multiple settings, priced right and delivery was very timely.</li>
            <li>the job, but mannnnnn the motor buzzes at a high</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this trimmer if you are looking for one under $60.</li>
            <li>I have not charged it since my purchase, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>After using this set a few times I must say it works great on my head with no guard &amp;#34;a very close shave&amp;#34; and on my face I would definitely recommend this product to any of you using it for the same reason.</li>
            <li>Looks like a high end product and trims hair well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d replace it with a rechargeable, portable unit that was highly rated.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>can highly recommend this trimmer to any of my fellow bearded</li>
            <li>now after this trimmer I got,  my life has really become easy, it shaves instantly into different styles</li>
            <li>This cutting machine is quite good, I am not disappointed by it.</li>
            <li>And if I use it with the attachment it pulls my hair when it goes between the plastic and the blade, which hurts more than just a little.</li>
            <li>shape of the product is a little more curved than I was expecting, but does not impede any area of clipping, probably helps get under the chin on an upward stroke.</li>
            <li>The adjustment seems to stay put a little bit better than on</li>
            <li>Because of this it does take a little more time to get cleaned up.</li>
            <li>Cots a little more</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned when I read some of the reviews which mentioned how it felt in the hand and pulling of the hair, but he seems 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>I liked it although it really does have serious battery issues.  </li>
            <li>The last Remington I had when the mechanism was locked in, the shaved off hair ended up in the sink, which is far easier to clean when trimming a beard.</li>
            <li>Very good lithium trimmer with built in cutting height adjustment.  </li>
            <li>I like my stubble pretty short and even on the lowest setting on this, it does not cut as close as setting 3 on the older model, so i cannot really get it to the length I want.  </li>
            <li>This item is extremely sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is a little bit cheap and seems to be the first thing that would wear out .</li>
            <li>; It&#x27;s...just as bad as they are saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for one week (like two shaves) and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Everything great but no charge light when plugged in (unless the shaver is fully charged, in which case I dont know how to ytell either way) and the second thing is the stubble cutting length seems to be its weekest feature.</li>
            <li>It has  done the job very well so far.  </li>
            <li>Battery best out, bare razor cuts dangerously close, Plastic Attachment comb is trash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised, by the performance and qualities as it&#x27;s engineer very well.....</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>I like the week old stubble look and while this gets reasonably close, it&#x27;s not close close.  </li>
            <li>I knew it wasn&#x27;t water proof or resistant when I bought it, but I really miss that feature on my old one.  </li>
            <li>Great trimmer that does a great job and doesn&#x27;t crap out after a few uses.</li>
            <li>so far no problems at all,  purchesed about year ago, it really works well and have no complains.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li>Stays charged for much longer than my old trimmer, which ran on NiCad batteries.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not flawless and fantastic like my professional salon quality plug-in trimmer, at times it requires a few extra runs over a spot to get all the hair, and the blades aren&#x27;t AS precise as I&#x27;d like (many of us hairstylists really love a t-blade)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Remington for about two months now, and so far really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a cheaper trimmer for years and this is worth the extra bucks</li>
            <li>I normally trimmed my beard to a 2 or 3 length setting</li>
            <li>It is powerful enough to trim without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did love this razer when I first got it but now looking back if it&#x27;s only going to last a year</li>
            <li>There were too many detachable parts to this, which made it too messy.</li>
            <li>The same holds true for my old Remington beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally go to the barber and have them shave my face</li>
            <li>THE STUBBLE BLADE IS THE ONLY ONE WORTH KEEPING IT</li>
            <li>But it is even better, and the charge last a long time.  </li>
            <li>If I comb my beard first, and straighten out all the hairs in the same direction it really doesn&#x27;t happen much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t seem to kill this battery with normal usage.  </li>
            <li>Been at least two months, and I&#x27;m still loving this</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t seem to kill this battery with normal usage.  </li>
            <li>and it went for a few more months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many shavers in the past, and this one really seems to be the cream of the crop.</li>
            <li>there aren&#x27;t as many visibly stray and messy hairs.</li>
            <li>(you won&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stepped guard and simple design of this trimmer have been useful for quite some time to me.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>The battery and motor seem powerful, and the unit feels solid and substantial.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of mixed success with rechargeable trimmers.</li>
            <li>I can actually complete a full trim without the battery dying mid- stream.  </li>
            <li>Truthfully, out of all the others I wasted money on, this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After dropping the MB-300 more than a few times, I could no longer piece the trimmer together.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer leaves quite a few longer hairs sticking up, and if you want to make sure that all your hairs are even you have to go over your face</li>
            <li>I agree with one of the reviewers that it works better on long hair than short hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement, something that isn&#x27;t made for hair trimming and isn&#x27;t as narrow as most beard and mustache trimmers.</li>
            <li>This sucker is nice.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of the reviews on this and similar products and after a while the old adage that &amp;#34;you can&#x27;t please everybody&amp;#34; seems as true as ever.  </li>
            <li>I tried a couple different methods to see if I could &#x27;restore&#x27; the battery&#x27;s ability to hold a charge, but without success.  </li>
            <li>I looked and looked for a electric trimmer before finally settling on this Remington (which was in many ways similar to my old Norelco that is still being used by my son).  </li>
            <li>I made multiple passes without success.</li>
            <li>Normally I purchase Norelco products, but have always bought Remington trimmers.</li>
            <li>At first, I trimmed my whole face and neck down with the regular blade, which did a pretty good job of getting the hairs down pretty short.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for trimming around beard and also for taking down extra long stubble between extended shaves.</li>
            <li>Zero catching on my skin, it cuts right through my fairly thick facial hair with ease.</li>
            <li>May be fine for other users.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good trimmer and is powerful and sharp enough and should last a while.</li>
            <li>It is one of those cords that will eventually break right near the part tha plugs into the shaver if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s charge a long time, great functionality &amp; good sharp cutting blades.</li>
            <li>Many of them don&#x27;t last very long and some don&#x27;t even work without the charger plugged in.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that traveling with multiple heads, the one that is not attached to the razor can be easily and irreparably damaged.  </li>
            <li>Only small complaint is it&#x27;s shape, but I&#x27;m getting better and more acclimated to it, we will be fine in time.</li>
            <li>My old Remington, that would no longer hold a charge, cost me much less and did a MUCH better job.</li>
            <li>And it has been far better than any purchased previously.</li>
            <li>So far, I have used it for 2 weeks on the first charge (using it every other day) and it is still running at full speed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;n the process of sending it back right now.</li>
            <li>With one right out of the box I&#x27;ve had to go over the same spot 40</li>
            <li>yes that&#x27;s right, one time which was months ago when initially purchased.  </li>
            <li>so you just simply roll a dial to get the right length</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is in its&#x27; initial 24-hour charge right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li>feels substantial in your hand, the three interchangeable blades are of a high quality and it cut through my year old beard with ease!</li>
            <li>The battery on this one is very good and the cutting is fairly good, however I am overall dissatisfied given that after only a year and a half the switch to turn the unit on and off has failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My complaint however has to do with the lack of a proper ABS or some sort of solid plastic holding tray for the cutter and the accessories instead of the card board thing that it came in and the fact that no blade lube was included in the package, that being said I would still recommend the trimmer to anyone that wants a great trimming/shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I really only use the basic tip and plastic guard, but it&#x27;s been good enough for my simple needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MB4040 has nine length settings which give users an excellent range, especially compared to trimmers that only allow one to choose between very short, medium and relatively thick lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is something that should be fairly simple: many of my battery operated devices have a visual representation of how much charge is left, so the technology is anything but new.  </li>
            <li>Shave worked fine for several months and all of a sudden just stopped working.  </li>
            <li>It feels like something is not snug enough to dampen that vibration, but I checked everything (on the blade, cause it only does it with just one of the blades) and it seems fine.</li>
            <li>well (note to self: use only the fine head for trimming, as the regular head can nick corners of nostrils).&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve become familiar with a wide variety of cutters and trimmers and suchlike.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is only about $30 though - but not sure it&#x27;s worth investigating a fix - or just buying a new, better one.    </li>
            <li>I got this model for a few reasons: 1) The adjustment wasn&#x27;t a cheap plastic guard, it uses Li-Ion batteries for long run-time and quick recharge and 3) it was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I&#x27;m now in the market for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;d have to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>New Update</li>
            <li>issue: I live abroad and this is a 220 volt world out here.</li>
            <li>and they sent out a new one</li>
            <li>After three years it seems to be dulling a bit, so I just ordered two new blades online from Remington for $7.99 each.  </li>
            <li>As of this review I have used the new trimmer for about 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>So I decided it&#x27;s time; it&#x27;s time to replace it with a new</li>
            <li>Since I am out of return policy, it seems I am stuck with this and will have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Looking at the new model Norelco products side-by-side with this Remington, the price differential is noteworthy.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll just buy a new one of those instead.</li>
            <li>bought this new in september of 2014.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is no longer an issue and it is still working like it is brand new.  </li>
            <li>I come from New Zealand and ordered this shaver online.</li>
            <li>Like the new design too.</li>
            <li>The new ones do not have this feature which I sorely miss.</li>
            <li>looking for something new.</li>
            <li>When I decided to get a new one I got this one.</li>
            <li>Something in the design of the new head causes it to snag in medium length beards (5 on the dial).  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live with a beard without it.</li>
            <li>Received the new one two days ago.  </li>
            <li>length settings are really good, although when you choose the smaller ones it can be hard to follow the shape of your head and get an even trim.</li>
            <li>Even my grandchildren, ages 2 and 4, commented that my freshly trimmed short beard felt smoother after I trimmed it with the MB4040, a comment they never made after I&#x27;ve used other trimmers that leave my beard feeling \\&quot;scratchy.\\&quot; Using this trimmer results in a neat, clean, fine-grained trim with all the trimmed hairs even in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looked more like a very tightly trimmed beard.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, don&#x27;t share, get your own.</li>
            <li>It does everything that did, but with better batteries and more cutting head options.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with two blades, one more wide for trimming stubble which is what I use it for and one smaller for intricate beard trimming.</li>
            <li>i freely admit, however, that i haven&#x27;t tried to figure out if there&#x27;s a way to do it or not--because i&#x27;m lazy that way ;-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a trimmer this way for many years, and never once have I nicked myself as frequently and predictably as I have while using this product.  </li>
            <li>When my last cheap one broke, I knew it was time to actually drop some money on a trimmer.</li>
            <li>Really, just a reiteration of what I wrote earlier in the year: hands-down, without question and undeniably the very finest beard trimmer that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Yes, I made the foolish mistake of using the standard blade directly on my skin and, yes, I had four distinct wounds and a bit of blood</li>
            <li>Yes, I made the foolish mistake of using the standard blade directly on my skin and, yes, I had four distinct wounds and a bit of blood</li>
            <li>It also charges very fast and the battery last for hours and hours</li>
            <li>only use the full size blade, so I can&#x27;t comment on the smaller blade, but the full size cuts adequately, requiring only the occasional second pass to catch a stray hair or two.  </li>
            <li>So, in the end I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and am going back to buy a new MB-200 instead, as I should have in the first place.</li>
            <li>The different blades interchange easily and I am amazed by how long the battery lasts.</li>
            <li>Its last a long time without being recharged and the blades are still going strong.</li>
            <li>And the guard pops off easily to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; or trim tight around your beard or goatee.  </li>
            <li>It proved less easy to clean, it didn&#x27;t trim nearly as well, as now (after using it for little more than half a year)</li>
            <li>If my past experience with the Remington brand still applies, I&#x27;m sure it will give me years of service.  </li>
            <li>My beard grows a lot faster than most, and I&#x27;m constantly trimming it every other day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a trimmer, it ether works or it does not so the review is pretty simple.</li>
            <li>I wear my beard pretty short and this trimmer has been nothing short of exactly what I wanted and needed.  </li>
            <li>but if I do, then I will come back and give it a higher rating.  </li>
            <li>i charged in back in mid June &amp; use it every 2-3days &amp; it still is on that original charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really interested to see when it will actually run out of power.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely recommend this product for anyone who are interested in this price range.</li>
            <li>A couple days ago (nearly exactly 1 year later)</li>
            <li>Went a week without shaving during a June trip to Yellowstone Park and for the first time, my facial hair came in gray.  </li>
            <li>I keep my beard pretty short.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only charged it twice; once when I first received it, and today (8-30-2013).</li>
            <li>I had a pretty big beard for No Shave November</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer, use it everyday!</li>
            <li>&quot; problem some other people seem to be having; I just have to go over the same area 10 times to be reasonably sure it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Others I have used in the past would not hold a charge for more than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>The first of these I received stopped working (charging) shortly after I received it.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve charged this once when I first got it and have used it literally for about 2 months on the same</li>
            <li>Buy this razor, and see how far the rabbit hole goes!</li>
            <li>Bought it for my husband because his other one finally died after many years.  </li>
            <li>I have had this razor about 2 months and have not had to charge it since the initial charge when I first received it.</li>
            <li>The different trimmer heads is a great idea, however I did make the mistake of using the wrong head to shave without the guard on to get really close to my skin.</li>
            <li>being said, I thought the stubble attachment was the way to go, only it ended up being a pretty close cut indeed</li>
            <li>I charged it on the first day I got it (December 25th) and it still doesn&#x27;t need a charge in mid February.  </li>
            <li>The Remington MB4040 is the first unit that both works well and is built to last.</li>
            <li>thing I should mention is, though it came with 3 trimming heads, I could not differentiate between the \\&quot;beard\\&quot; head and the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; head, both of them looked exactly the same to me.</li>
            <li>This was my first beard trimmer purchase, since I&#x27;ve only had a beard for a two months.  </li>
            <li>I had been trimming my beard with hair clippers at first, and finally decided to try something designed for beard trimming.  </li>
            <li>Even though I can&#x27;t get as specific with the guard length on them, they give an extremely consistent and even trim across my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The regular blades are much to heavy to use for gentle trimming like on top of my bald head.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he&#x27;s only really used it for a month now, but so far he really likes it</li>
            <li>I have been a avid regular razor user sense</li>
            <li>But for the present, I&#x27;m sticking with my Remington.t in the first go with the device.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for my personal grooming needs.</li>
            <li>I have not had this problem with any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned, including my original Remington shaver 14 years ago.  </li>
            <li>It actually cuts pretty close itself.</li>
            <li>With the Phillips I&#x27;d have to go over things several times, but this gets everything the first time.  </li>
            <li>Nice so far only had it for a few weeks ,battery charge an</li>
            <li>Well, they also, FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER, decided, \\&quot;Wow we need to redesign our new trimmer to show off the new fancy battery!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>MB4040 comes with three different trim cutters, a removable guard that can be adjusted to nine different depth levels, and a brush to clean hair out of all the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>Trim my entire beard if it&#x27;s been a week or so since my last clean shave, because the longer whiskers need to be pruned before using a DE blade, else they get stuck in the razor</li>
            <li>I just grew my facial hair back after years of being clean shaven.</li>
            <li>I use this trimmer to shave down to stubble level, and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and clean trims.</li>
            <li>The only thing I miss was my old trimmer had a 2nd set of smaller blades for better sculpting of the mustache.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sharp and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new trimmer to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>I was in need of a new trimmer and after considerable research, decided on the Remington MB4040.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Bought a new one, but took the old one apart and will be replacing the battery</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the new features this one offered.</li>
            <li>They promptly sent me a new one and asked me to return the old one via a prepaid mailing label.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this thing also trims everything down on the first swipe, unlike most other electric razors.</li>
            <li>I sometimes feel a pinch when hair trimmed down but very rare.</li>
            <li>So, I keep some stubble, never shaving smooth, never letting it long enough to be itchy.  </li>
            <li>The guard seems to bend really easily, so mabye I&#x27;m just unevenly applying pressure while trimming.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this trimer for my husband several months ago and he has had no problems with it at all, he likes the fact that is more powerful than his previous Remington and does hold a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Worked well initially, but after 10 months of light use the battery won&#x27;t recharge to full and doesn&#x27;t last long enough to trim my beard.</li>
            <li>One full charge will last months (with occasional use.)&lt;br /&gt;Nice cut.</li>
            <li>When the last died, I bought this because of the reviews and it supposedly would work while charging (versus needing a full charge to work like my last one).  </li>
            <li>I used a Remington trimmer before and this trimmer pretty much does what I expected it to.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a replacement for a very old model of Remington beard and mustache trimmer, and it far surpasses my expectations.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the positive things I could say about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s supposed to be self-sharpening and the fact you don&#x27;t need to apply oil to it is a big plus.to get \\&quot;close enough.\\</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the positive things I could say about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s supposed to be self-sharpening and the fact you don&#x27;t need to apply oil to it is a big plus.</li>
            <li>You rarely have to charge this, extremely strong action, I have had this for going on two years and still going strong, can pinch at times when using in the groin area (balls) but not too bad.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it comes with three different attachments is new for me, haven&#x27;t really used the others</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned the Wahl for 5 years and the battery continues to recharge, hold a charge and work like new, so I consider it a real plus that the Remington MB4040 has the same type of battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has a lot of power, so be careful and take your time, took out a little chuck of the Hubs beard, fortunately it grows quickly.</li>
            <li>It simply does a better job at trimming, I have to go over less times and have fewer missed hairs.  </li>
            <li>The cutting blades are easy to switch out and the guard is easier to attach and more sturdy. .</li>
            <li>the adjusting of the clipper is fine, but when i press it to my face it bends, so you can get uneven cuts.</li>
            <li>This takes 3-4 times as long to trim my beard and is not near as efficient or as strong as my old wahl.</li>
            <li>The package was not hard to open, the unit is solid, not flimsy and it worked well right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I use this trimmer only for certain things:  for under my nose, fading into my hairline, and without the guard.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it, is that it has to be at a certain angle to not pull hair.</li>
            <li>The plastic attachments for actual beard trimming seem flimsy and are too large to let you get that two-day growth look.</li>
            <li>different blades plus a large guard.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>It would just stall in the middle of trimming if I turned it a certain way..</li>
            <li>in all, great when it lasts, but it&#x27;s not built well enough to last that long, and not easy to fix.  </li>
            <li>the result wasn&#x27;t accurate, but when I pushed a little bit it trimmed shorter.</li>
            <li>After a little over two years of just light use the battery will no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>After a little over a year of light use, it will no longer charge or work with the power supply.</li>
            <li>Consistent, comfortable and keeps a ridiculous charge.</li>
            <li>My last one (an older model Remington) died after about 2 years of normal use.</li>
            <li>You will be hard pressed to find a better trimmer at this price.</li>
            <li>The major downside to this is that if the bald spot is large enough I pretty much have to take the guard completely off and trim my facial hair to the shortest level to avoid a very uneven look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this pretty big issue, I was pretty excited about the new trimmer and the other features it has to offer.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and precise.easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I was unhappy with that but kept it because it has great battery life and mechanical reliability.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job at cutting and the clips that come with</li>
            <li>blade is sharper than I expected, it cuts extremely smoothly, and the motor is very quiet.</li>
            <li>This clips at least as fast an smoothly as the MB-200.  </li>
            <li>product is listed as having a &amp;#34;washable design&amp;#34;; however, the packaging clearly indicates that the mechanism itself should not come in contact with water.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;goatee\\&quot; which is clear that it&#x27;s an edging tool for trimming around a goatee.</li>
            <li>The instructions clearly state that it will not operate off AC power while plugged in.  </li>
            <li>After 6 weeks, the battery completely drained and is no longer taking a charge.</li>
            <li>Also, a complete charge lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised.  </li>
            <li>I am really surprised by the battery.</li>
            <li>This really is the only groomer that you need.</li>
            <li>I charged it completely when I received it and haven&#x27;t had to recharge yet</li>
            <li>Do not put these blades anywhere near your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the trimming extension on my electric shaver to shave my face because my skin is sensitive and breaks out/gets ingrown hairs if I shave with the foil or use a razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sported a beard since I was about 14 years old, and it&#x27;s become part of what people notice when they see me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband whose old trimmer bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>and I find I do not have to go over the same areas as much as I used to in order to get an even trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What really surprised me was the battery life.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Conair razor.  </li>
            <li>Works well so far.</li>
            <li>Loud a heck.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my worn out, old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer does do the job, but just not as well as my old Remington trimmer.  </li>
            <li>have a sensitive face</li>
            <li>I used it for nearly 6 months before I had to charge it</li>
            <li>It feels like a well built unit, and so far it&#x27;s holding charge well.</li>
            <li>Mine&#x27;s three years old, and</li>
            <li>For instance I have a goatee, so I pull of the guard, and use the blade alone directly against my skin to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; my face except for my goatee.  </li>
            <li>I started off using an old model of Remington&#x27;s trimmers (now discontinued, used batteries) and had to upgrade once the trimmer attachment broke.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially convinced it was a user error, I have tried to shave with the trimmer in every conceivable orientation, but it still pulls hair and nicks skin...</li>
            <li>Have had this 8 months, and so far it&#x27;s the bomb.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between the Remington MB4040 trimmer and my old one is</li>
            <li>Or perhaps it just feels like it does because my old one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge at all.</li>
            <li>This one uses lithium-ion cells instead of the nickel-cadmium (NiCad) cells my old trimmer had.</li>
            <li>This replaced an old Remington beard trimmer that I have had for 15+ years.  </li>
            <li>simply doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to know how long the battery lasts.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer to replace my old one that died.</li>
            <li>No problems thus far.</li>
            <li>Take the old MB-200/300 series and stick a lithium battery in it.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very quiet, emitting a gentle hum.  </li>
            <li>skin is extremely sensitive to all forms of shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also my 16 year old&#x27;s preferred method.</li>
            <li>Easiest if  you go over the whole beard at the same setting.&lt;br /&gt;Setting</li>
            <li>and I have to finalize the edges with another old shaver or scissors.</li>
            <li>Very flexible for different types of styles.</li>
            <li>Go with another brand unless you need something cheap for a few months.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer provides a closer trim which is what I am used to.  </li>
            <li>and I drive a crappy old car.</li>
            <li>My old razor i always used without the guard to get the 5 oclock shadow...</li>
            <li>My old Norelco kicked the bucket</li>
            <li>Everything else is still working on the old one.</li>
            <li>I cannot make a professional review, since I am not a hairstylist.</li>
            <li>- Not aimed for a professional shave.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco beard and mustache trimmer pulled hairs a lot</li>
            <li>Does the job of both direct trimming and thinning with the attachments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Completely died after about nine months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to write 1 star reviews, but it completely doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>And at least look into how to safely use and charge lithium ion batteries.</li>
            <li>and you have go over the same area multiple times, trying to go against the grain as much as possible to catch as many hairs as possible</li>
            <li>I got this to replace my 19 year old Remington MB30.    </li>
            <li>I may have to replace my old unit.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the hair goes absolutely everywhere.</li>
            <li>do not shave frequently, so</li>
            <li>I came from an old school Wahl</li>
            <li>But after pricing them I decided WTF?Why should I pay $100 for a Braun when it probably will not last much longer then</li>
            <li>Third, I&#x27;ve gotten very inconsistent trimming length all over my face.</li>
            <li>A year old</li>
            <li>but it’s just too early to tell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as battery life goes, I&#x27;ve never had a shaver quite like this.</li>
            <li>I bought the MB-4040 to replace my old MB-200.  </li>
            <li>This does a great job of trimming mustaches and beards, and the only thing I found lacking was a charging base - for some bizarre reason, it has no stand that you can put it in to charge it - it just lays on the counter.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my son-in-law to replace his old one.</li>
            <li>Keeps me lookin classy for the ladies.</li>
            <li>My old unit is over a decade old and I have never been sliced by it.</li>
            <li>And stays charged alot loonger than my old one.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve had it for nearly 6 months now.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy beard either.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;action&#x27; or the way the blades move is smoother than others I&#x27;ve tried and I haven&#x27;t had any of the snagging problems that have happened with others.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a lithium, hoping the battery would be an improvement over old trimmers.</li>
            <li>I used it on his neck to trim his neck and found it to be very sharp and took little effort to get the back of his neck nice and pretty.</li>
            <li>is that it is a bit loud.  </li>
            <li>I cannot finish trimming my face before it completely</li>
            <li>/&gt;And if you are using to shave then don&#x27;t be surprised to see your face bleed.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want this trimmer to get anywhere close to any sensitive skin areas.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars, but honestly it&#x27;s starting to make me question if any of this is real.</li>
            <li>It certainly surprised me.</li>
            <li>I had to recharge the old one to finish my head.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old Remington that was not charging anymore.  </li>
            <li>its can not cut short hair very well ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like a straight razor or typical four blade shaver, so it gets its job done, but you still need to use an actual razor if you&#x27;re looking for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>The LiOn cells don&#x27;t get a &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; like the old batteries did.  </li>
            <li>My old one never held a charge like this one.  </li>
            <li>Received as a gift, replacing an MB40, that was a number of years old.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to replace an old one that had just worn out.</li>
            <li>Was a replacement for an old nickel cadmium that lost it&#x27;s charge.  </li>
            <li>I have no problems with it so far and the fact that the blades are titanium is just a plus.</li>
            <li>Charges fast and last</li>
            <li>My old one lasted for about 2 or 3 uses and this one lasts for WEEKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like all the adjustable sizes although I don&#x27;t think they equate to a standard size like at the barbershop.</li>
            <li>Not so much as to give it a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; but certainly a solid &amp;#34;4&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>My old trimmer did that too</li>
            <li>use the stubble trimmer if going directly against the skin.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m trying to get a replacement from Remington directly.</li>
            <li>The old remingtons had a rougher grip so the hand wouldn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Does not seem to cut as well as the old remingtons with the guard on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got about 5-6 uses on this thing so far.</li>
            <li>the battery was the selling point for me, my old one died while i was using it every time.</li>
            <li>I contacted Remington directly, and they sent me a replacement unit.</li>
            <li>have had this for 4 months so far.</li>
            <li>and overall his appearance is very well kept.</li>
            <li>I needed a replacment for my old Remington trimmer.  </li>
            <li>- I had a pervious trimmer that had a soft rubber type grip that trimmings stuck to like glue.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Norelco T990 with this Remington since Norelco doesn&#x27;t make that model anymore</li>
            <li>Replaced a 25 year old AA model with this.</li>
            <li>So far I have not had any problems with it.  </li>
            <li>My old Remington was dying, so I got this.</li>
            <li>I had an epic beard that needed to come off and these clippers chewed through it like a beaver in a pine forest.</li>
            <li>completely agree with the comment of Seth A. Zehler.</li>
            <li>Replacement for 10 year old Remington.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan on using the beard blade directly on my face again.</li>
            <li>I really like several features of this trimmer.</li>
            <li>practical, lightness is part of this tool for any man, well done, fast charge, thin blade, precision possible through its practical form, it can be put anywhere in a kit or just store it on a shelf, it look nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the few times these days when saving money on a product actually returned greater satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>A few days later, it was time for some more stubble trimming, and I decided to try the \\&quot;detail trimmer.\\</li>
            <li>Plus these batteries have more torque to keep the blades moving through thick hair without getting stuck and binding.  </li>
            <li>And for my thick hair, the stubble blade catches way more.  </li>
            <li>Had an MB200 which I loved, but sadly this is not the better-battery-life replacement for which I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>Switched to this model from the Remington B200 after much good use but the battery failed eventually.  </li>
            <li>The think is high powered, long lasting battery, price is right, no complaints.  </li>
            <li>It takes me about 10mins now (using the closest full width head attachment with no guide attached), down from about 15 for my old one (although my old ones closest cut attachment was a 17mm</li>
            <li>Then I bought a  bargain rechargeable and just threw it away because on a full charge you could not finish a trim before the batteries run down.  </li>
            <li>the built-in length guide doesn&#x27;t really go down to a true stubble.  </li>
            <li>Amazing little trimmer - I had some other model from Target (Panasonic, I think), and the two I owned died after a year.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s my first one (I&#x27;m new to the world of beards), it works just as I expected.  </li>
            <li>I am a stubble-faced now, after 40-years of being the full-beard type, and I have to say that the slight beard is so much cooler in the hot summer months.</li>
            <li>I am a stubble-faced now, after 40-years of being the full-beard type, and I have to say that the slight beard is so much cooler in the hot summer months.</li>
            <li>even if it does look how many Remington&#x27;s I could buy compared to a more expensive foreign brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively easy to keep clean (see next paragraph) and is small enough to store in the medicine cabinet above the sink so it is ready for instant use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other trimmers i&#x27;ve had trim much better and faster, altho the cordless batteries last only through 1 trim.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a well built enough razor, and though it can take several passes for a clean cut, it does the job aptly enough.</li>
            <li>This one is very adjustable and has two other heads to trim side burns and to get a very neat look on the mustache.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Design is small and compact, easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>to dial settings that lock: hubby says the nine settings are a bit much and can&#x27;t see that much difference between one level and the other.</li>
            <li>Previous shavers I&#x27;ve had never held a charge for a full month.  </li>
            <li>The main difference is that the MB4040 has a Li-Ion battery pack and these tend to last a LOT longer than the cheaper and more common Nickel Cadmium batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It recharges quickly and the battery seems to last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I only shave once per week, so I don&#x27;t bother to aim for a clean shave because that would be rough on my skin, and because I like the unshaven look.  </li>
            <li>(i dont have a thick beard, so it cuts fast and clean).</li>
            <li>one (for some reason) is all &#x27;decked out in shiny chrome and plastic&#x27; which actually makes the whole thing look much cheaper and shabby than the long design history of the MB trimmers (silver to black).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer isn&#x27;t quite as fun to use as the other although it does have changeable heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another problem is that the shortest setting is not short enough for a true short stubble look.</li>
            <li>It worked fine afterwards but in less than 12 mos old it no longer holds a charge and operates for only a minute or two before dying.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to miss more hairs in a single pass than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li>Without the attachments this works fine, but if you want to trim to a certain height using the attachments, you&#x27;ll have to work extra hard.</li>
            <li>I tried less pressure, more pressure, different hand holds, different angles, I even had my wife try to do it for me</li>
            <li>I use this trimmer almost everyday for clean up.  </li>
            <li>I had an older (and much cheaper) Remington, and it was not good at all, and a cheap plastic piece finally broke</li>
            <li>Overall, for the money it costs, you would be better off opting for one of Remington&#x27;s low cost models that do about the same sort of job and last about the same amount of time.</li>
            <li>I save a lot of time since it trims it the first time around without having to constantly go over the same area 3-4 times.</li>
            <li>Item was a replacement for an older model that had finally given up.</li>
            <li>+ times to make it decent (plenty of stubborn hairs left).</li>
            <li>For the last 10 years, I&#x27;ve used a very simply designed Norelco trimmer with no complicated attachments.  </li>
            <li>The first lasted several years, but the non-replaceable rechargeable battery finally reached the end of its useable life.  </li>
            <li>i purchased this product months ago and have only had to charge it one time since it&#x27;s main charge when i purchased it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a decent facial trimmer in quite a while</li>
            <li>The charge lasts multiple trims, the heads offer versatility for the different areas to be trimmed and the adjustable head provides consistent length.  </li>
            <li>First, as others have described, the lowest guard setting is simply not short enough.</li>
            <li>Without the length attachment it works even better, although I do recommend changing the small hair head to the big one, since I felt I was trimming my skin</li>
            <li>I particularly like that it only has one piece and a dial/wheel for length adjustment.</li>
            <li>I got several deep cuts first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for decent trimmer from a while, finally I found this product.</li>
            <li>the holidays, I let my beard grow out longer than I usually do, I then proceeded to use this product to trim my beard at many different levels.  </li>
            <li>i guess any and all trimmers need to be moved over the face area several times - it&#x27;s not the issue of this particular trimmer.</li>
            <li>Other trimmers provide many attachments for other purposes.</li>
            <li>In fact the next day he went a little bit closer on the sides and the battery was just as strong as before.</li>
            <li>If you were to take your finger and press down on them with some light pressure they would bend and return to regular position upon release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t have any major complaints.</li>
            <li>Much stronger and holds a better charge that any other that I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice long charging cord but no stand to put the trimmer on and yet in the &amp;#34;warnings&amp;#34; it makes certain to tell you NOT to get it wet, especially while charging, so it&#x27;s expected that just placing it on the side of the bathroom counter is protection enough.</li>
            <li>The build quality is really high, and the three trimmer heads are really solid.</li>
            <li>It is quite thorough, it does not pull/pinch the hairs, and on a second run over the same area you can hear that there is minimal hair being removed, meaning many passes are not required (not like my last one).</li>
            <li>Two years later, and I still highly recommend buying this, and just read the instructions and follow them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended as a regular grooming tool.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a quick fix to my growing shaggy mess.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if they fixed the problem , but i suggest you do check it if you live outside the US .&lt;br /&gt;Recommended !</li>
            <li>I only use one as I like my beard a certain way, but the second razor was purchased for my father who&#x27;s been using the old razor &amp; cream for years.  </li>
            <li>I did like how it held a charge for a very long time, and I rarely had to charge it, but just recently, I went</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this little trimmer as it meets my daily facial trimming needs.</li>
            <li>The Remington trims accurately every time is easy to adjust, and&lt;br /&gt;changing cutting heads is a snap.</li>
            <li>It does more then I had expected, in fact, I used it for a slight buzz cut, which in one cut saved my $15.00 on going to the shop to get my hair cut.</li>
            <li>The blade heads are easily swapped (I don&#x27;t use the third narrow goatee</li>
            <li>Unlike other brands I&#x27;ve purchased throughout the years, this one actually holds a strong battery charge for an extended period of time, rather than either having to keep another plugged in or constantly having to recharge it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s precise,  sharp and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m one of those guys that was born with a beard, can shave in the morning and have real stubble by the end of the day, so I gave up on shaving a long time ago and</li>
            <li>Depending on the time of year, a general dislike of shaving and having overly sensitive skin, I often sport a goatee or pseudo-beard.  </li>
            <li>took away one star for a small (but, to me, important) design glitch.  </li>
            <li>If you do the clipper teeth snag on your stubble, cut the skin and the bare metal faceplate heats up to nearly burning temperatures.</li>
            <li>As long as I don&#x27;t go too fast</li>
            <li>Really, the only drawback is that it has a lifespan of about two years (the same time span as the warranty), so you need to replace it that frequently.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that it does not come with a stand, but he was able to use his old one to hold the trimmer even though it will not hold the attachments.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what I expected it to do.  </li>
            <li>I am still on the original charge, but use it only an average of 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li>You can get a better cut around the mustache and nose area due to its size, but I may be going back to an electric and only using this for tiny trimming.</li>
            <li>I have read reviews that the head adjustment was flimsy and that there was not much difference from 0-9, not so, if used correctly it delivers exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>Fits my needs and was exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>I do realize that I have a heavy beard, but still it seems like it should be easier than having to go over the same spot 3-4 times to make sure that everything is at the same length</li>
            <li>Just be careful the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>I love remington products and had been holding on to my old shaver long past when I should have for fear of not liking anything else.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and the battery certainly last a lot longer than my previous one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;cons: the adjustment feels a little cheap and that is what broke on my last one.</li>
            <li>If the latter were available, I&#x27;d not buy it due to what might be a relative cost issue.</li>
            <li>Instead of just replacing the battery pack, they redesigned the body of the trimmer, new shape, added crappy plastic chrome and such, but the problem is the guard was also changed.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t live upto even the basic standards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would have helped if I had a miniature &amp;#34;jaws of life&amp;#34; tool to open the packaging on this new product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The problem with the new model is that it snags my beard several times each shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In use, I did experience something that another reviewer mentioned: an occasional single hair that does not get trimmed and the high number of passes required to get consistent length over a specific area.</li>
            <li>The unit holds a charge very long and it really works well.  </li>
            <li>I use to use a hair clippers set, but it was too big and awkward, this is a great size.</li>
            <li>The blade is delicate and goes off track fairly easily when it&#x27;s out of the trimmer for cleaning, or I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>the charging light only stayed on for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fixed all of the complaints that I had about old model with nickel cadmium battery (low charge retention).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to lose at least one blade at some point in the future.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t go for the stubble look, I run the trimmer blades over my face directly instead of actually shaving since my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>It has a powerful motor that cuts thru thick beard fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it almost a year and use it everyday for a quick trim and haven&#x27;t had to charge it</li>
            <li>Decent amount of resistance when you are spinning it and it clicks with a nice slow, firm</li>
            <li>This cuts really well, and the battery lasts forever on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>I had the Phillips Norelco vacuum beard trimmer before but lost the chord and decided to try a new brand.</li>
            <li># The fine head trims edges, neck and stubble more closely, and, being middle aged, it trims random ear and nose hairs</li>
            <li>major issue with this trimmer is it&#x27;s built with the durability of a five-dollar trimmer.  </li>
            <li>seven years ago I purchased almost the exact same trimmer, although it was silver in color and back then it had an internal chamber to hold hair.</li>
            <li>The unit looks pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li>thing holds its charge like no other.</li>
            <li>First, the shortest setting (1) is equivalent in length to the 2 or 3 setting on my other Remington trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Ni-cad batteries blow, so this is a major improvement.</li>
            <li>No other attachments come with it (like ears or nose attachments).</li>
            <li>This machine surely holds its charge for at least a month without recharging!</li>
            <li>the teeth on the bare trimmer are wide enough to make it useful for framing the cheek and neck lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But consistent with other products.  </li>
            <li>This is my first beard trimmer, so can&#x27;t compare to any other products.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m wondering if I want to pay another $8 for a replacement or try the other blades first.</li>
            <li>I love the attachment that stays on the unit, it makes it very hard to lose it.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no loud vacuum included, there&#x27;s no useless secondary trimmer to pop open randomly, and -- most importantly -- there&#x27;s no useless touch screen included in this model.  </li>
            <li>The curved design really helps for trimming, you can see what your cutting better in the mirror especially, as opposed to the straight design clippers.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge very well, the cutting blades move at fairly high speed, and it is powerful enough that it rarely pulls a hair.</li>
            <li>To be more clear, I don&#x27;t have a good view of what I am trimming, the braun cruzer 6 [ Face shaver model ] trimmer head is placed in a weird position that I have a difficult time seeing what I am going to trim.</li>
            <li>This little shaver works fine for trimming beards or sideburns and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>By the next day, she&#x27;s sending me a brand new one and a pre-paid shipping label to send back the old one.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the older unit&#x27;s battery stopped holding a charge a long time ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expected that the representative would provide some suggestions, maybe a certain technique of holding the device or something I should do beforehand to prepare my face -- I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>We purchased this for the ion battery which is working fine so far - we&#x27;ve had it for less than a month, but my husband loves it&#x27;s power and sharp precision.</li>
            <li>I other wise would have a long and thick beard.</li>
            <li>Battery, and decent trimming will definitely get the job done until you come back home.</li>
            <li>If I push it up my neck toward my jaw, everything cuts fine, but if I try to make a second pass by pulling the blade down my face, it&#x27;s like some medieval torture device that only knows how to irritate my skin and make my eyes water.  </li>
            <li>there are some general guidelines to use when dealing with lithium ion batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>generally leave</li>
            <li>In general terms it does the job.</li>
            <li>in general I like this product.</li>
            <li>Until now I would buy cheap trimmers that I would have to replace at least once a year.</li>
            <li>Clearly though this should not be necessary.</li>
            <li>If your beard or mustache was long u wouldn&#x27;t notice much, but if it was short you would notice &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>works well and says charged a long time with the Lith Bat - cant really see a big dif in the change out heads</li>
            <li>the whole, however, the Remington MB4040 seems to me to be a solid performer that does the job it was designed to do and which should have a fairly long life.</li>
            <li>The last year and a half has been amazing for my face: that fine, feminine, sensitive skin has been replaced with a manly leather capable of tolerating the violent removal of hair over and over and over again with barely a wince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only wish Remington would make plastic combs out of sturdier material instead of flimsy clear plastic.</li>
            <li>I kept trimming my beard shorter and shorter after a week of leaving it long and found the trimmer worked very well at a short trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Charging and battery life are long lasting as he really took his time with his beard and had no problems with the battery.</li>
            <li>I wonder if they actually USED the trimmer when they developed it?</li>
            <li>It is a loud Norelco but came with different size combs that broke</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used 1 of the 3 cutter heads so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 47 years old and have NEVER attempted growing any facial hair...</li>
            <li>I still have not answered that question myself and have switched back to the old school razor</li>
            <li>I set out in search of a simple trimmer and purchased the Remington MB4040 rechargeable trimmer, which looks somewhat like the old</li>
            <li>/&gt;Going back to my old trimmer, and I wont miss this Remington at all.</li>
            <li>Apparently where ever the &amp;#34;manufactured in PRC&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Barely ever have to charge it.</li>
            <li>Edging with the bare blade is no problem at all</li>
            <li>So if it was left unplugged, the battery would completely drain and it wouldn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s gotten to the point where after being left plugged in, the battery still drains after about 30 seconds running, making this thing completely useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how well it is made, when I look at the low</li>
            <li>It will nick you if you are not careful</li>
            <li>Recently purchased and so far holds a charge over three</li>
            <li>I then use the GOATEE TRIMMING BLADE TO SHAVE TO MY BARE SKIN, so I use the GOATEE Blade to shave my neck and the edge of my chin strap to keep it styled.</li>
            <li>Only suggestion would be a battery lite when it&#x27;s getting old....</li>
            <li>I ordered the Remington MB4040 Trimmer after my old trimmer (not Remington) finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.</li>
            <li>I am throwing this trimmer away and going back to my old one.</li>
            <li>Therefore I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments or anything, just the bare beard</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my old trimmer, also a very similar Remington which had a battery that would no longer charge.</li>
            <li>I suppose that any one more expensive it should be sort of more delicate in every sense.</li>
            <li>Definitely sharper than my old Norelco; I even managed to get a couple nicks trimming my neckline.</li>
            <li>I had one of the old remingtons (Remington MB300DT/2 Titanium PrecisionPro) for almost 4 years and finally the guard height adjustment mechanism broke.</li>
            <li>After trimming my beard with the MB4040 people thought I had had my beard professionally trimmed, a comment I never got after using a different trimmer (</li>
            <li>Well \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; is apparently a thing now and some women expect it.  </li>
            <li>I had no trouble up until the last month or so.</li>
            <li>Mark the stubble blade because the only difference between it and the beard blade is how far apart the teeth are on the blade itself.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34; blade on bare skin or you will end up nicked and bleeding.</li>
            <li>How many times have I got confused with that.</li>
            <li>NiCd cordless trimmers and razors tend to keep charging, while the Li-Ion trimmers/razors usually provide a full charge indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery may be better, but the cut is way worse.</li>
            <li>so I am not sure how it would handle a full beard or head.  </li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s kind of useless.</li>
            <li>I have a rather full beard at the moment, but to keep it&#x27;s shape I only need to make a few passes with the correct setting.</li>
            <li>the only complaint i have, and it&#x27;s a very minor one, is that the trimming guard isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>You can feel the higher power in it than the previous one and also more so than other trimmers such as my previous norelco.</li>
            <li>I have a thick beard and the thing takes down my beard nicely.</li>
            <li>The thick plastic guard stays on the unit and there&#x27;s a handy wheel to click the height up and down.  </li>
            <li>As with my first trimmer, I suspect the trimmer can not be run using the electrical outlet if the battery is run down.  </li>
            <li>Maybe start longer and go down from there on the first day</li>
            <li>The blades are very sharp for extremely accurate trimming so be careful.</li>
            <li>Only reason it&#x27;s 3 stars is because the shave is uneven, (flat cheek+ neck-hair cuts further from the skin than the curve on the jaw line) must go over the surface MANY times, especially at different angels to get an even look</li>
            <li>The battery holds up for a very long time and I actually put my charger up because it is not needed much.  </li>
            <li>This one is far better than other similar products that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and has no problem trimming a thick beard.</li>
            <li>After having a great experience with the previous model, I thought it would be a no-brainier to get the newer one with Lithium Ion batteries, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard and moustache with a pair of scissors, most times while still half asleep, sometimes resulting in an uneven trim.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong 3 weeks later after using it at least 4 or 5 times.</li>
            <li>Sucker sounds just as strong as the day I purchased though I only trim once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>The blade position is not very good for detailed trimming such as this.  </li>
            <li>I put less than a drop of oil on each of the three heads before using the first time.  </li>
            <li>It took me a little while to figure out how to work the trimmer correctly, but after a little bit of reading, and playing with it, I love it.  </li>
            <li>basically every couple days run the trimmer over my face, mow down the side burns and make sure the goatee isn&#x27;t getting too out of control, and this little trimmer does it all very well and hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of slowing down yet.</li>
            <li>Lastly, albeit the least of problems, the MB4040 is sold within the most annoying product packaging I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>Picture a machete hacking through bamboo, then turn the sound down to an extremely reduced level.  </li>
            <li>You can remove the adjustable plastic guard to get a clean shave, but I only do that for small spots.  </li>
            <li>My battery failed, however it was great little trimmer while it lasted.</li>
            <li>I clean it using the brush supplied and store it in a ziplock (since I have it in a bathroom and prefer it not rust, a little rice pouch seems to keep it in a dry micro-environnment).</li>
            <li>The other types are much cheaper, but wear out often inside of a year.  </li>
            <li>Also It seems to be very sturdy but i have not had it long enough to say it will last or not</li>
            <li>My old Norelco trimmer had a flat bottom and a side charging port which I had gotten used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was a little leery about all the talk of not having to charge as much and was I ever surprised.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who wants to keep that manly beard... or other areas trimmed...</li>
            <li>Not like some of the other brands where the whole thing just feels cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>The motor feels very strong and it can trim thick beards without bogging down.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is far better than any other trimmer I have ever owned or used, and I have probably bought at least half-dozen different trimmers throughout the years</li>
            <li>The last time I had a beard I trimmed it with a sharp shard of rock, so I have no past history with electric trimmers--no model to compare to the MB4040  which I bought for my new beard (7 weeks).</li>
            <li>So far it has consistently left a bald patch, the question is how big it&#x27;s going to be.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike my old Norelco, the Remington MB4040 is intended only to trim and groom facial hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my dad after his old one finally gave out after 10 years (different brand).</li>
            <li>was no where near short enough.  </li>
            <li>Used only once for complete, short haircut and longer, shaped beard trim.  </li>
            <li>only warning: I don&#x27;t think Remington means for you to use the beard blade directly on your face, only with the guard on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several of the Remington MB line of trimmers over the past 10-years to groom my full beard.  </li>
            <li>All three blades work wonders on my facial hair, whether it&#x27;s a beard that&#x27;s been growing in for three months or a few days&#x27; worth of stubble.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a few potential issues with this trimmer worth noting.</li>
            <li>Just be careful when switching from an older trimmer to this one.</li>
            <li>Trimmer\\&quot; is a convenient little trimmer that does exactly what I need it to.  </li>
            <li>Mine is not sharp enough.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to using the guide at first.</li>
            <li>ONLY wish I would have is for a vacuum stubble-catcher like my old trimmer had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The built in cutting depth adjustment feature works perfectly and the interchangeable cutting blades are clearly well crafted and do exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>But at least I have a slick battery-powered shaver whose batteries work perfectly months later and hold a charge for at least two weeks.  </li>
            <li>The main issue I have is that it randomly misses a dozen or so hairs scattered most noticeable around the upper lip, mouth edges and under the lower lip, even if I go over areas multiple times from different angles.</li>
            <li>After 40 minutes of using the computer sounded very hard and strong vibrated.</li>
            <li>Even after spending a long time trimming, my beard often comes out very spotty, with low spots and long spots.</li>
            <li>I will leave it at the setting in the future and pick up an stray hairs with a comb and the bare razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a Remington I&#x27;d had for far too long.</li>
            <li>Makes me wish I had retired my old trimmer long ago.</li>
            <li>When i plugged it into the wall socket with adapter it would not charge, it blew a fuse in the charger which is apparently a way different voltage.</li>
            <li>One of the trimmer parts broke within the first few weeks of buying this product, I think from it being dropped on the floor.</li>
            <li>So for the first few times I used this product I would get cut trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>Product works well but is missing a couple of &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; of higher priced products.  </li>
            <li>Numerous passes over the same area are required, and even then, a few stray whiskers will just sit there and laugh at you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I could have given this a four, or even a five star review, but after almost exactly one year of use, the battery is almost completely dead.</li>
            <li>it even cost less than those being sold at WM super center.</li>
            <li>I bought this only two months ago, and I&#x27;m already having major issues with the motor not starting.  </li>
            <li>It does not loose strength and pull hair as another brand did that I recently tried.</li>
            <li>The blades are very sharp, so be gentle.</li>
            <li>It was very sharp though, and really cut things.</li>
            <li>The other parts aren&#x27;t as much as attachments as different replacement blades which offer different levels of closeness/size.</li>
            <li>QG3360/42 Multigroom Plus]], as my old trimmer was a Philips and had performed very well for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I had as much of an issue with my previous trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I did not subtract any stars in my rating because it does give a very close shave, has a lithium battery, and is less than $35.</li>
            <li>Its closest length is far too long for a real, short stubble cut.</li>
            <li>others have said, when you shave with the bare blade only use the stubble blade for that..if you use the larger blade you could cut yourself..</li>
            <li>and I have a thick beard that needs a better than average cutter.  </li>
            <li>Nice design but not worth the money because of the poor battery technology</li>
            <li>great for trimming beard, cutting down to goatee or mustache, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a single nick from the old</li>
            <li>Works well but is a little large for beard trimming</li>
            <li>Just not long ago I was getting fed up with the razors, Lather, Shave, and possible accidental nicks.</li>
            <li>The Remington comb stays firmly in place and has no weird fragile pieces likely to break.</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve had models like this that can barely last a few minutes, so this is a refreshing change.</li>
            <li>On the Remington website they offer a 60 day warranty, so they clearly know their products will not last very long.</li>
            <li>The dial to adjust the guard length is sturdy, so you&#x27;re less likely to accidentally trim your beard much shorter than you intend.  </li>
            <li>Only down fall is there is to much plastic and not enough metal.</li>
            <li>But this thing builds up so quickly that I had to go over my hair three days in a row to make sure I didn&#x27;t look like an idiot.</li>
            <li>I have probably owned eight or ten beard trimmers over the past thirty years but this one is heads above all of the others and considering its modest $30.00 price represents a real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>only thing that I&#x27;m not sure about is if you can know when the battery is completely recharged, although I didn&#x27;t really read the manual so this could be a personal problem.</li>
            <li>This shaver does not slow down even when I try to make it down and push it fast.</li>
            <li>my list.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are very sharp, but don&#x27;t nick/cut my skin like my old ones did (maybe the old ones cut a tiny bit</li>
            <li>like that the comb attachment catches a lot of the hair trimmings, so I have less of a mess to clean up after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice even trim above lip virtually impossible for me to achieve so far.</li>
            <li>Not bad but not exceptional either.</li>
            <li>This thing works real well, you can shave and it has little snag on hairs.  </li>
            <li>I was a little leary of the plastic piece that is used to adjust the length, but it works very well, and the length setting holds</li>
            <li>The whole thing is just one unit, and there is little need to fiddle with separate pieces unless you want to change the blade head.  </li>
            <li>$40 a year seems a little much for me.</li>
            <li>He mainly uses it to trim down his whiskers without having to shave.</li>
            <li>I never write Amazon reviews, but I feel I&#x27;m obligated to let everyone know so that they do not buy this trimmer despite the high average rating for this</li>
            <li>The battery seems to last a long long time I have only charged it once and used it about 15 times so far!</li>
            <li>The blade swap is way better than having that horrible pop up fine trimmer in the old one&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a little time to get the hang of the various blades and the adjustable comb but follow the instructions and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Trims neatly and precisely, and even tough enough to handle my son&#x27;s trucker gnarly beard.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews good &amp; bad.  </li>
            <li>This one is slightly larger, which is both good and bad.</li>

            <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve owned yet.  </li>
            <li> I have been using electric mustache trimmers for over 30 years and this is the best one I have had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommed this to all the ladies trying to find their guys the perfect gift!</li>
            <li> But while it worked it was perfect.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome.</li>
            <li> A quality product that does the job very nicely!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very good, but I have found that regardless of the way I shave, the trimmer always cuts the hair on my chin and face shorter than the hair on the sides of my faces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, this is a very good trimmer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good value and it does its job quite well.</li>

            <li> I cannot begin to explain how this is so superior to anything I&#x27;ve come across.</li>

            <li> and then my brother took it from me because he loved it.</li>

            <li> Once I got the plastic head on it, I loved using it.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> too they do a good job.</li>
            <li> Good to use it for a change.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time in good condition despite inclement weather.</li>
            <li> Otherwise robust and good value.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as the guard system that contains separate guard combs you attach one at a time.  </li>
            <li> Good quality and I trust this brand of trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that needs a good rechargeable mustache &amp;/or beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good razor.</li>
            <li> i think the battery is good and its have Good shape&lt;</li>
            <li> It also took me a good 10 minutes to figure out how the trimmer guard fits on the unit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a Rubik&#x27;s cube predicament, but once you figure it out you are good</li>
            <li> It also took me a good 10 minutes to figure out how the trimmer guard fits on the unit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a Rubik&#x27;s cube predicament, but once you figure it out you are good</li>
            <li> Beard never looked so good.</li>
            <li> Hopefully an improvement over the MB200 which was a good design paired with a wimpy power supply (battery).</li>
            <li> A good value.</li>
            <li> Loved this product and used it sparingly for 10 months.</li>
            <li> Good size, holds a charge, cuts off my face hair.</li>
            <li> Feel free to post any questions in the comments below, I&#x27;ll do my best to answer them.</li>
            <li> If the battery is that good, then it deserves all 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> Also packs a lot of power along with its good design.</li>
            <li> Fits good in my hand.</li>
            <li> but the beard trimmer does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> It probably does a good job for longer beards</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my son a couple of years ago and he loved it.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  </li>
            <li> Good luck in your search if you are like me</li>
            <li> loved, here are the reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Initially, I loved this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t look good on me</li>
            <li> but I could not get the power needed for a good trim.  </li>
            <li> It also worked surprisingly well on the ol&#x27; stache as well.  </li>
            <li> But battery life is good and there have been no pulled hairs.</li>
            <li> So I bought the best trimmer I could find for the price of the cheap trimmers I was buying before.</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> Appears to be well made with good trim lines</li>
            <li> Unit also holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> This is a really good beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful and the motor works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product that delivers a close shave and clean lines.</li>
            <li> works great, and come with 3 blades (never had that before) and the guide goes on and off for cleaning very easily.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge great and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Best part is the cost, a true value.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and a very nice cut .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just have exceptionally stubborn stubble or what,</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried the stubble beard before and wasn&#x27;t sure what would be the best tool, but after reading reviews this one was recommended and it works fantastic!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this one especialy since the Wahl would no longer hold a charge for more than a day at most.  </li>
            <li> It looks great, cuts great, and does not feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li> Trims real easily but hair does go everywhere.</li>
            <li> While most of the reviews are correct, this is a great beard trimmer for the price, it&#x27;s still on the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; side of the beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this and would recommend it to anyone needing a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Does a great job trimming mustache, love everything about it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great trimmer WAY better than the cheaper Remington.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, long-lasting battery, powerful motor.  </li>
            <li> well, so I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the trimmer&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall very satisfied with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Happy styling :)  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, The blades included are great.</li>
            <li> The husband is very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> after searching everywhere ..and reading all the reviews .. I decided on this one..and am so very glad I did..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very safe, never nicks my skin or cuts me.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the way this clipper holds a charge and never seems to lose power.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> He was also impressed with the fact that the trimmer had been been unplugged for three weeks and still had a charge like freshly charged.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and would have been better it</li>
            <li> This Remington trimmer cuts much better and the trim height setting works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy for sure.</li>
            <li> I used to own a Phillips Norelco which I just loved.</li>
            <li> Good if you are grooming a beard, but it doesn&#x27;t work to keep a nice stubble look.</li>
            <li> interchangeable heads are a nice bonus, good for detail work.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a good beard trimmer now.</li>
            <li> Best of all the price is right.</li>
            <li> Feels good in my hand, and the combs are very easily adjusted with the roller.  </li>
            <li> Perfect exactly what I need after No shave November.</li>
            <li> They also love it!</li>
            <li> will return to Wisconsin (at my cost) under warrenty to see if another unit performs better (or at all)!</li>
            <li> It is excellent and is exactly what I was wanting to groom my circle beard.</li>
            <li> I have much better hopes for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Remington!</li>
            <li> : Guard doesn&#x27;t always provide the best trim on first couple passes</li>
            <li> I look handsome when I&#x27;m finished!</li>
            <li> So, since using this trimmer for 7 months, it paid for itself, and more!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>

            <li> Had it over a year now and love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> You would have to make sure you could return it with the packaging in pieces!</li>

            <li> Easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I put the stubble blade on, set it to the closest setting, and I get a great, easy shave that leaves me with what looks like 1-2 days of stubble growth.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed to see Remington&#x27;s quick and sincere comment on my post.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth feel on my face and trims fairly well.</li>

            <li> Ive have since bought a Phllips BG2040 that is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing battery life.</li>
            <li> For about $30, the Remington MB4040 is a great product.ng you need to enjoy any kind of hair trimming.</li>
            <li> Battery life is absolutely amazing, haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet</li>
            <li> No matter what direction you shave your beard, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing battery life.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job at trimming goatee to a precise length.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great product, smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> However Amazon was amazing and fix ling this issue with me.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> He had been wanting another one and then this one became available and he is a happy camper again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has great power and glides across my face smoothly.</li>
            <li> He said it trimmed evenly, it felt great on his face, and gave him a smooth trim.</li>
            <li> Nice design Remington.</li>
            <li> The adjustable mechanism is really handy, sturdy, and easy-to-use.</li>
            <li> My wahl trimmer took many passes and was never as good.  </li>
            <li> It trims very close when you need it to, and the adjustable length attachment works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great battery &amp; overall great razor!  </li>
            <li> Im sure some people are happy with this product, but Remington is producing to many defective units.</li>
            <li> It also feels nice in the hand.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable comb is a nice feature, too.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a razor with this kind of power and battery life, together.  </li>
            <li> Nice to see it doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in every day to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Remington are known to be good products, I might get one more for my brother</li>
            <li> It is a nice trimmer &amp; I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Honestly to do the 3 day stubble trim with this thing takes forever and still doesn&#x27;t get everything even.</li>
            <li> nice thing about the MB4040 is it holds a charge seemingly forever.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job of closely trimming my mustache (use it at the lowest level), and maintains the goat effectively at any length I choose..</li>
            <li> Nice design for ease of use.</li>
            <li> adjustment is nice, stays locked in place when using.</li>
            <li> Nice unit.</li>
            <li> For the more afordable clippers out there, the Remington is great, much better than its predecessor.</li>
            <li> like the size/weight of this trimmer--it fits nicely in my hand and feels like it is a quality product.  </li>
            <li> The guard works, but honestly is rather sketchy.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer - wish it had a mode below &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I own 2 of these and use them to shave my head as well as for my beard.</li>
            <li> The height wheel is really nice - at #2 or #3, I get a nice &amp;#34;three day stubble look&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Overall, excellent buy and my wife is happy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> battery life is very impressive, it will not drain much when put on shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> I own, because its battery is wearing out.</li>
            <li> I have a cheaper shaver that isn&#x27;t as nice</li>
            <li> Really nice razor.</li>
            <li> and I had to go over my beard a good 8 times to make sure nothing was missed.  </li>
            <li> It has plenty of power and trims nice and neat.</li>
            <li> Thanks Remington, for a great product!</li>
            <li> After a good cleaning/oiling, it works better than it did out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shape is kind of awkward&lt;</li>
            <li> But hair will often find its way inside under the blades where they then get stuck in the factory applied grease so that is kind of a pain.</li>
            <li> honestly, you were probably looking at some $200 trimmer, and i&#x27;ve had like 3 of those, and they all break, and</li>
            <li> Kind of a bummer.  </li>
            <li> so I am exited about this being cordless, lighweight and does a nice job of manscaping.</li>
            <li> The heads appear to be well-designed and are nicely finished.</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts really well, and the accessories and range of trimmer lengths make it an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Nice looking.</li>
            <li> Fits my hand nicely.</li>
            <li> The goatee trimmer is perfect for edges, and the stubble trimmer is very</li>
            <li> Angle it on as you gently push,, and it&#x27;s perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is so neat and effective for trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li> Nice razor.  </li>
            <li> so i assumed this would be just as good with a better battery.  </li>
            <li> He is thrilled with it and wants everyone to know what a wonderful product this is.</li>
            <li> Falling to the floor immediately causes them to spring apart, effectively breaking the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remington - you and others who do this kind of thing need to understand this.</li>
            <li> the 9 length of the trimmer is even more good about it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I did not like Norelco a lot</li>
            <li> I keep forgetting which is which, so it would be nice if they had some markings to tell the difference; you have to remember which shape does what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it about 3-4 times a week to trim my beard and it keeps everything nice and even.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job taming my beard.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I decided to tempt fate and use the device to detail the sides of my goatee so that they were nice and symmetrical.</li>
            <li> but the goatee blade is nice for precision.</li>
            <li> nice design</li>
            <li> it includes a nice set of blades.</li>
            <li> use at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I like the variety of heads, and the blade guard is effective.</li>
            <li> Nice hum.  </li>
            <li> That kind of hurts.. Would not reccomend</li>
            <li> think this is a nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon for the excellent return policy!</li>
            <li> This razor cuts nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another nice feature of the trimmer is the size and shape of it.  </li>
            <li> Handy and works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before this battery situation, I really liked this trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and portable--both lightweight and wireless.</li>
            <li> The guy who used this really liked it.  </li>
            <li> This is just what we were hoping for for a trimmer for my son&#x27;s use, which is to keep his beard at a tidy</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a nice trimmer for a while</li>
            <li> This also has a nice dial for the adjustable hair length comb.</li>
            <li> do their job nicely.  </li>
            <li> The Remington MB4040 does a nice job and the battery seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> Does need its own storage stand.</li>
            <li> Nice feel, comb does not allow for close shave and trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a Phillips stubble trimmer before this, and really liked it, but</li>
            <li> and it works as great as the first time!!</li>
            <li> It holds a great charge and is very powerful.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not the best designed clipper, but it gets the job done &amp; very nicely.  </li>
            <li> Good quality for a fair amount of money, that&#x27;s disturbingly rare to find nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great job at trimming body hair with the length setting attachment, but it was originally designed for beards</li>
            <li> I would happy to return the original and replace it..</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older model, and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding battery life and trims easily with great consistency.</li>
            <li> It works great, no pulling, easy to clean and the adjustable comb is perfect for trimming my beard to the right length.  </li>
            <li> Great for those with a full beard.  </li>
            <li> worked great for almost a full year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is true to the description and makes it a great reliable trimmer.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s pretty incredible that they&#x27;re taking care of their customers this way.  </li>
            <li> With blade factory setting you can get as close as 0.1mm which will give you great edging, and when you zero gap the blade you would get a more precise edging, or closer shave.</li>
            <li> The attachments for stubble is a good, very close cut that does a great job if you&#x27;re looking for the permanent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to work and I am looking good.</li>
            <li> The settings are easy to adjust and has a good grip.</li>
            <li> as always great service and quick shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust and good power.</li>
            <li> I will take more time before being able to give a good review.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is very easy to use and the adjustable head allows an easy change of settings without turning off the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a good charge as well.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple weeks , I think that it is a very nice groomer and works great for what I use it for , and that is trimming after a haircut or goatee trimming , and would work great for other areas .</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to sterilize in between uses since you can just pop the blades out with the press of a button.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it is very easy and the attachments exchange very easy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to maneuver and trims evenly.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the hair gets caught up in the plastic guard AND underneath the trimmer blade itself very easily.</li>
            <li> He thought the instructions to use the trimmer where very easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> The attachments are very easy to remove and install.</li>
            <li> I find it very easy to adjust the length by rolling the adjustable wheel.</li>
            <li> each was better designed and performed better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of trimmers over the years and each one was &#x27;ok&#x27;, but honestly this one is the best I&#x27;ve had by far, and it&#x27;s cordless to boot!</li>
            <li> By far the best trimmer I ever owned.</li>
            <li> It has a good feel and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> So far the performance has been excellent and the additional attachments are a welcomed feature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend as a cheap trimmer to hold you over while you save up for something good.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best beard trimmer that I have owned thus far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li> I had another trimmer that I used for many years and one day it started catching my skin and hurting a bit when I shaved.</li>
            <li> So far I am really impressed with trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It is by far the best trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li> I am impressed by the power of the lithium battery and so far have not found the maximum number of shaves her charge.</li>
            <li> and I have been very happy with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li> And when I go to replace it in the guide, the design of the barrel of the razor and the placement of the guides doesn&#x27;t naturally allow this to happen without stopping and perfectly aligning everything.  </li>
            <li> the battery so far is excellent, which is why i bought this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I am so far very happy with this trimmer!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> The Remington MB4040 was a great priced trimmer, and I found it to be powerful and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> More than that, I also cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> far as trimmers go, this has got to be the best for the price and the performance of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> because its  the best trimmer Ive owned , by far.</li>
            <li> This was the best investment in trimmers I did so far.</li>
            <li> Great product and worth the price.</li>
            <li> It fits well in the hand, easy to use!</li>
            <li> adjustable comb is very innovative and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily too!</li>
            <li> 9-27-2014:  Still going strong!</li>
            <li> strong blades!</li>
            <li> This is a powerful trimmer that is very effective at trimming my beard/mustache.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver, I use it daily and does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed at how well this trimmer works; the rechargeable future is nice as well.</li>
            <li> This has been an excellent replacement for an old trimmer that ran out of being able to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I has a good, clean cut and seems to hold a charge well.  </li>
            <li> Again, nothing major and nothing&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable in my hand, easy to move around my goatee!</li>
            <li> Very clean cut and the guard is amazing way better and easier to use.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy for something my husband really needed!</li>
            <li> After about a month of twice/week use, I am still pretty happy with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Great product I really like that these clippers can be rinsed off with water!</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first 9 months...</li>
            <li> It works great and the heads are really quick and easy to replace and the charge lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> A fine purchase indeed!</li>
            <li> Very precise cut.</li>
            <li> trims very smoothly</li>
            <li> Very smooth on goatee upkeep.</li>
            <li> This  shaver  is  very  light  </li>
            <li> I got very light use (once a week or so)</li>
            <li> Was pretty happy with this trimmer, but after having it for one year it won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 1 minute.</li>
            <li> Adjustable length is easy to use and holds position nicely.  </li>
            <li> It took some getting used to, but now that I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile it&#x27;s easy to use and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in the hand and contours easily around the face.  </li>
            <li> The Lithium battery charges quickly and should provide a good ling run time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a strong motor and cuts nicely.</li>
            <li> but when it comes to powering through your beard and giving you a comfortable, quick trim, this is great.  </li>
            <li> I got this trimmer and love how easy and effective it is.</li>
            <li> This is more powerfull, and the design fits very comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily adjustable, easy to clean, and the battery life is really great.  </li>
            <li> So far very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve charged it like twice over the many months</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> Picked this one up and love it.  </li>
            <li> so I would not be able to return or replace it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always well-kept, and I&#x27;m more picky about how my beard looks than my hair.  </li>
            <li> With that said &amp; given the thickness of my beard, I&#x27;m able to charge it once per month...</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love this beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The razor worked great for one year, and then it very rapidly began to decline.</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve been much more practical if you could charge it with a USB cable.</li>
            <li> Skips, regardless of the head used, resulting in the need to make many passes to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> and this takes about 15 minutes at the most.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for months now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 4 months now, and I&#x27;ve only had to charge it 2 or 3 times, which is impressive</li>
            <li> However, after awhile I noticed that hair had become stuck under the top metal trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li> For a $30 trimmer it probably isn&#x27;t any better than a $15 Wahl trimmer from target or amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does an OK job.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have to go over my face many more times than I did with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> It was perfect size for beard only...  </li>
            <li> This trimmer does what it needs to do, however make sure you keep the guard on it or it will indeed cut you.</li>
            <li> Well pleased with how it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and feels of good quality.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.  </li>
            <li> It is working much better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I love the wheel where you can set it for the lengh you prefer.</li>
            <li> I bought the MB4040 because of the longer battery life and more features.</li>
            <li> eight more words are needed for this to finish</li>
            <li> I love the long-lasting lithium battery in this unit.  </li>
            <li> I love the lithium battery cause</li>
            <li> and it was OK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through more than 5 beard trimmers over the years, most the rechargeable type and most around $25.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to change the blades, also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razer for about a year and now won&#x27;t hold a charge for more then 2-4 mins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model for many years.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to be able to get more of a stubble look with it.</li>
            <li> more issues</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to turn a one-year wizard beard into something more respectable.  </li>
            <li> Lithium lasts for many years, and this holds a charge for well over an hour.  </li>
            <li> Then the battery would only hold a 5 minute charge, at best.</li>
            <li> I got the upgraded version when I returned, and it is significantly better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always satisfying when a product fully meets your expectations.  </li>
            <li> Battery wouldn&#x27;t charge any more.</li>
            <li> I love it though for the price and the performance despite these drawbacks.</li>
            <li> Each time a use the trimmer it ends up pulling many hairs off my face and it does not cut all of the hairs.</li>
            <li> 3 more words</li>
            <li> In reading many trimmer reviews it took me a while to decide what to buy.  </li>
            <li> I am glad this is the trimmer I ended up obtaining.  </li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Remington mustache and beard trimmer is great, it&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t pinch and the accessories fit smoothly and work that way as well.</li>
            <li> Along with a charger, it has everything you need to enjoy any kind of hair trimming.</li>
            <li> has many settings ..</li>
            <li> I have use this happilly many times.</li>
            <li> Love mine, would buy another</li>
            <li> If you travel with it, make sure to wrap up any heads that are not attached to the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> My Remington I used before was much more even when it comes to the measurement.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> Charge has lasted more than a month for me.</li>
            <li> well built love the accessory heads.</li>
            <li> I use that the most for trimming my goatee.</li>
            <li> I get a much more &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; trim in that position.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with this trimmer and look forward to many years of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  glad I took a chance on it.</li>
            <li> And I love how it comes with customizable clips.  </li>
            <li> #34;I LOVE that trimmer you got</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive trimmer so don&#x27;t expect a lot, but you get a lot for your money for sure.</li>
            <li> Overall, really impressed...</li>
            <li> Couldnt have asked for a better product for the price.</li>
            <li> but I love the brand and it has done me well</li>
            <li> It rips more hair out then it cuts.</li>
            <li> I love this trimming machine.</li>
            <li> they want 11 more words before they will publish this.</li>
            <li> there, are you satisfied?</li>
            <li> Love the trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The best you can buy for personal use.</li>
            <li> I wish they just put a better battery in the MB200.</li>
            <li> Its smooth design feels great in my hand and allows for smooth and accurate trimming.  </li>
            <li> love the interchangeable heads.</li>
            <li> It has many settings and makes trimming goatee etc.</li>
            <li> The Remington MB4040 brings variety of accessories, the battery life is ok.</li>
            <li> or you don&#x27;t want to have the battery die after a couple years, make sure you buy a trimmer with a Lithium Ion battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most days, I just use this.</li>
            <li> &#x27;2&#x27; is much more closely cropped than &#x27;3&#x27; .</li>
            <li> wish it came with a stand for storage and for the 3 trimmers it comes with, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, if the packaging is any reflection of the quality of this trimmer, then I&#x27;m sure it will outlast the cockroaches in the event of some nuclear fallout.  </li>
            <li> specifically bought this thing because it had a lithium battery, which tend to have better behavior in their batteries.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of waiting more than 60 days to use this after purchasing it, so basically threw $30 away, but this razer is mega bogus.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d be able to do a-lot more with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard and settings just don&#x27;t cut it LITERALLY.</li>
            <li> Maybe not the most versatile, fancy product ever, but it does what it should for this price.</li>
            <li> After many years using another trimmer, I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months now and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Like most devices in this class</li>
            <li> should provide more options for a closer cut (I hope).</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use most of them.  </li>
            <li> Love the razer.</li>
            <li> It is way better than the built in trimmer on my shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the shaver.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver excels at each of those tasks, and much better than the back-of-the-electric-razor style trimmers I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I also love the extended battery life.</li>
            <li> You better buy Wahl Detailor, or Andis T</li>
            <li> Many length</li>
            <li> had to get a better trimmer which is Andis superliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 20/06/2017&lt;</li>
            <li> Cruzer 6 guard is better.</li>
            <li> - Many length settings.</li>
            <li> So in order to make my review more helpful I compared it to another beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> BUT, when I trimmed the hair under my lips the result were OK.</li>
            <li> So, I said why not push more?</li>
            <li> You would try to edge it multiple times, and you still would not get the perfect result.</li>
            <li> Yes, many would like wireless, but the wired ones have the power to edge, and trim with breeze.</li>
            <li> As they edge way better from seeing at YouTube.</li>
            <li> that you can check it out :)  </li>
            <li> are better because they are rigid plastic not flimsy like MB4040 guard.  </li>
            <li> Andis superliner seems that it will serve me for years, will, let&#x27;s hope so :)  </li>
            <li> Or maybe with the collaboration with another razor you would get a stylish beard &amp; mustache.  </li>
            <li> The shaver worked marvelously at keeping my coarse, curly beard orderly for about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I sure wish it had the Lithium battery though.</li>
            <li> I checked the box to make sure I bought a trimmer and not an epilator, then</li>
            <li> /&gt;First and foremost, the blades on this thing are top notch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I do not know if there are any better trimmers out there.</li>
            <li> I am sure not everyone would agree with me</li>
            <li> I have used this 4 times now and have been pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> This unit cuts closer than the top of the line Wahl which my work colleague has, so that trimmer was off</li>
            <li> Really glad I ordered it,</li>
            <li> glad that it is rechargeable and that it works well without the cord.</li>
            <li> I had no idea which brand to buy for a Christmas gift -- now I&#x27;m glad I went with the Remington.  </li>
            <li> Use 3 or more times a week.  </li>
            <li> Ok, but why do I keep buying them?</li>
            <li> I thought it would get better with a couple uses</li>
            <li> The charging cord could be made a lot better.</li>
            <li> but I expect to be a satisfied customer and will buy Remington from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS TO THE MANY</li>
            <li> The battery won&#x27;t even hold a charge for more than 20 seconds before it strains to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Sure I can take the guard off</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to charge it more than 3 times in the time I have owned it.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer and hope I never have to buy another one again now that it&#x27;s using Li-Ion batteries.</li>
            <li> To achieve more evenness, I use longer length setting &amp; back-shave.</li>
            <li> I did not want a trimmer that requires changing the guides, so I was pleased to find this one with an adjustable guide.</li>
            <li> Hogs shelf space and not the most convenient for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Heavy</li>
            <li> This may get better as I use the trimmer more and learn to avoid positioning it so this pulling takes place.  </li>
            <li> While this trimmer is ok, the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow blade is more like a 5am blade.</li>
            <li> and learn then stick with what you love.</li>
            <li> But my favorite feature is its battery.</li>
            <li> I guess five years or maybe more</li>
            <li> Once fully charged, he said he can use it for more than week without recharging.  </li>
            <li> Glad that it also has a lithium battery</li>
            <li> But for maintaining stubble or edging your facial hair, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It would be better if the attachment pieces that make the trimmer vibrate were made of metal instead of plastic.</li>
            <li> Holds charge for a week or more.</li>
            <li> This thing is definitely on the best trimmers I have had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was able to use it still 2 days after I returned without needing to charge.</li>
            <li> I have read many of the reviews and the one point that stood out was</li>
            <li> Recommend to any guy who wants a great trim.</li>
            <li> I love this.. just spin a wheel and get the depth of cut that I want..</li>
            <li> The power button could be recessed to help even more in preventing it from turning on when packed into luggage.  </li>
            <li> Read many reviews and considered a number of products.  </li>
            <li> More attachments than I can use.  </li>
            <li> The different heads made this perfect no matter if you&#x27;re rocking a beard, stache, goatee, or whatever else.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the trimmer itself is comfortable on your skin and trims nice and evenly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about 1/2 the price and does the job 100% better.  </li>
            <li> Wish there was one more shorter&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go to the barber shop any more.</li>
            <li> as if it&#x27;s built well, has a quality feel for plastic and the blades snap in nicely and feel secure.  </li>
            <li> I was much more pleased with the Philips Norelco than the Remington.</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts this time, so I was well pleased.</li>
            <li> me, the Philips won out, but for others the Remington might work better.  </li>
            <li> Had to read reviews to figure out to place cover on top to get the trim installation to work.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s ok, but nothing more.</li>
            <li> Oh - they&#x27;re still stuck into the top of the package.</li>
            <li> Interesting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been most pleased with the Remington MB4040.  </li>
            <li> Would be even better if it had some case or pouch to carry all the accessories</li>
            <li> Item just as described, shipping on time, and satisfied.</li>
            <li> I phreakin LOVE this trimmer.</li>
            <li> i love the adjustable option in it.</li>
            <li> but i just love it and the battery lasts for more than a month once you charge it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a convenient cordless trimmer with a Li-Ion battery pack that allows it to perform better for a longer period of time versus the cheaper NiCd trimmers.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get the improved version of the md200 with better battery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the better groomers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I do need to make a lot of passes, but when I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;ve always been satisfied with length and even-ness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There might be better out there</li>
            <li> and , it is ok.  </li>
            <li> Spend $10 more and get a competitor that has a better blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Have thoroughly enjoyed this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Without the guard, this works great at trimming hair very close to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a month ago, mostly because of the Lithium Ion battery,  I try to stay away from the NiCads.  </li>
            <li> My hustband has had several trimmers over the years and has decided that this one is the one that this is the one that he like the best.</li>
            <li> but I expect something of this nature to be more durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this machine.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it</li>
            <li> (Love their return policy.)    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This one is so much better.</li>
            <li> Second, the close but not too close shave head is awesome.  </li>
            <li> What he loves most about this trimmer is the battery life.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has plenty of power and holds a charge for many uses.</li>
            <li> I love the adjustable length trimmer that is built on to the device.</li>
            <li> I always lost the clip on guards so this was refreshing to know that it is adjustable.</li>
            <li> It is a solid beard trimmer, it does the job great!</li>
            <li> thats for sure, but</li>
            <li> he seems very happy with it much more efficient than his last one</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> The blades are not as awesome as they appear and they do not have the ability to shave close enough even without the length guide.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t any better than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to purchase another wahl g-whiz trimmer because it is a much better trimmer than this Remington.</li>
            <li> everything works as it should, I love the lithium power</li>
            <li> Good variety of attachments and easy to clean too</li>
            <li> I love it&amp;#34;, isn&#x27;t an over reach</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this because he loves this.  </li>
            <li> Not a lot of attachments but the 9 adjustable lengths and 2 added blade combinations is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li> I have used many razors and many price points.</li>
            <li> It uses a Li-ion battery which is supposed to get better recharge value.  </li>
            <li> Most would want to save that battery power for travel.  </li>
            <li> A pop-out trimmer attachment on the side would have been much better.  </li>
            <li> I feel as if there could have been one more setting to bring that trimmer closer to the face.  </li>
            <li> I feel as if there could have been one more setting to bring that trimmer closer to the face.  </li>
            <li> i love this Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li> and i think is one of the best trimmer you can get at its low price</li>
            <li> MB40 was ok.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so much better.</li>
            <li> and he is pleased with it -</li>
            <li> Much better design imo.</li>
            <li> after about three months it started loosing charge quickly barely able to finish one beard trim.  </li>
            <li> I think it is by far the best available (the recipient agrees).</li>
            <li> Hoping for better life from this one&#x27;s Lithium battery.</li>
            <li> Love the way the length adjust works.</li>
            <li> The Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer is everything I had enjoyed for so many years and more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Worked OK for about 6 months then stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I love this Remington trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a beard any more, so I can&#x27;t comment on the beard trimming aspect, but I do still have a mustache that needs</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having the adjuster built in is a more sturdy design.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Flipped the on/off switch many times but that didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It met my requirements and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> and i love having a beard</li>
            <li> Works great although it does not like really thick/long hair.</li>
            <li> (maybe 3.5 would be more fair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure if I&#x27;ll buy another one, though.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheaper trimmer from a Walgreens, it was OK.</li>
            <li> Again, it was just OK.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m keeping it as it performs much better than the cheaper beard trimmers out there.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> Worked better than  advertised.</li>
            <li> Love the power and sharpness of the blades.  </li>
            <li> His mustache is now not all over his top lips</li>
            <li> In fact he has had so many compliments about his trimmed bread that he now wonders where this trimmer has been all these months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an excellent mustache and beard trimmer, and it has two separate attachment cutters for different uses.</li>
            <li> My son research several items online and decided this was the best.</li>
            <li> DOESNT GET BETTER THAN THIS</li>
            <li> I have been using the trimmer for more than two months now, using it about thrice a week, and I HAVE RECHARGED IT</li>
            <li> I have had many, many trimmers since I tried shaving as a kid.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would</li>
            <li> Plastic guard looks kind of cheap, but hey it works.  </li>
            <li> gotta say watch what setting you use, i thought setting two was going to leave more</li>
            <li> For example, I needed to trim around my teens ears for his ROTC regulation haircut which requires no hair touching the ear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> of my favorite features is the adjustable guard.</li>
            <li> Never was able to charge up the battery, so never got a chance to use it.</li>
            <li> Much better than a handful of clip-ons.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more responsive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about Remington but the user manual is great, as is the warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the battery life of this charger.  </li>
            <li> After having owned trimmers before, I like this trimmer better than anything I have owned.</li>
            <li> love all the settings but stoped being able to hole a charge after about 2 months</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am particularly pleased that the trimmer is powered by an ion lithium battery that provides up to two-hours of usage time without requiring a recharge.  </li>
            <li> I have been quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li> and I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I needed a trimmer to cut the very short hair on my head, and this was perfect answer.</li>
            <li> The technology has obviously improved and I&#x27;m very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> so the unit could be stored safely in a drawer or to travel with?</li>
            <li> It has a powerful motor and the battery life seems to be good.  </li>
            <li> It performed flawlessly until one day, it suddenly wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  </li>
            <li> Combs are easy to use and the settings for depth also very easy to set and change.</li>
            <li> This one has very good battery life, it trims evenly and is very user friendly.</li>
            <li> Price is right and holds the charge for a good while.</li>
            <li> but so far so good!</li>
            <li> So in general it is a great beard trimmer with amazing battery life.</li>
            <li> So yeah great battery compared to older models of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I think this is a wise purchase, especially if you&#x27;re looking for a nice Christmas/Hannukah gift for a man in your life!</li>
            <li> It got 3 stars because the plastic to adjust the length of your hair trim is cheap and breaks very easily..</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the attachments are very easy to pop in and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the best one I have bought so far, the best thing about it is the battery, I can&#x27;t believe how long the battery last, it&#x27;s easy to use and clean, I have no problem trimming  my beard and mustache, I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Cuts great, very powerful, stayed charged for over three weeks before first recharge.</li>
            <li> Its light, it shaves nicely and the heads pop off easy.</li>
            <li> Great battery strength, quick charging, and a powerful motor.  </li>
            <li> Works perfect and comes with 3 different, easily removable trimming heads.</li>
            <li> It works great and does a great looking job in less time than I am accustomed to.</li>
            <li> Gives a very smooth shave and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever on a single charge, works great and quite a good value</li>
            <li> course, you can spend many times more on a professional trimmer like the ones used in salons, but this is a great at-home alternative.</li>
            <li> Battery life is great but no attachments like WAHL products normally include.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, but it can also scratch you pretty good when using it without</li>
            <li> The best thing is how long the battery lasts.</li>
            <li> First, let me state that these clippers are good, but I wanted something that I can have a ONE OVER and get a shadow look, and they cut too close.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s works pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> 1 star durability, 3 star quality (it was pretty good while it lasted) &#x3D; 2 stars.</li>
            <li> That is pretty dang good if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I have found the lithium battery technology in my power drills to be long lived and quite impressive.  </li>
            <li> charging LED will shut off to indicate a full charge, which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Worked so good the first time, my beard never got out of line again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how easily it trims and how close of a shave I get when doing the sides of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped many a razors into the sink and never had one break on me so easily.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with it and like the removable adjustable guide, which makes cleaning easy.</li>
            <li> Great quality at a fair price as expected from Remington.</li>
            <li> The MB4040 has many length settings, so you should be able to find the precise length that you want.  </li>
            <li> Nice sleek design and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that there is anything better available, but that doesn&#x27;t make this piece of junk any better.</li>
            <li> I also think the different attachments are a win, and that this should be handy for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Also it is very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> As a positive, it seems like it does a good job at the detail of my goatee in that it looks neat and</li>
            <li> What I like best is that loose hairs do not stick to the handle</li>
            <li> head).&lt;br /&gt;It is very light, which feels cheap.</li>
            <li> I damaged one but was able to repair it and it works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has the remarkable ability to rip nearly as many hairs from my previously tender flesh as it successfully cuts.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it several years ago, choosing it because it had the best reviews.</li>
            <li> but the charge last forever and for the money it is a very good deal.</li>
            <li> The actual trimming blade is very good at what it does.  </li>
            <li> As for actually trimming, it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> Perfect, Quick, Easy, and ready to go right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> The stubble blade works great on my head and neck, and it trims much shorter than my last one ever did and this is great for me because I prefer to trim rather than shave those areas, 2)</li>
            <li> That fact alone would be enough for me to love this trimmer, but its precise settings and versatility make it an ideal companion for any hairy chested or bearded man.</li>
            <li> This one replaced an old Remington that worked great for years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve contacted the company and they are replacing with a better model for free.</li>
            <li> So I chose the next best thing, the same trimmer without that feature, and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for the cost - its basically as close as you can get to professional grade without paying for pro grade prices.</li>
            <li> built to last the battery life is incredible.</li>
            <li> A bit loud but still a great product.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about what I use to shave and trim my beard with, out of the many I have been through this is the best I have had so far.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful glide throug my rough scruff.</li>
            <li> the distribution of the weight more towards the trimmer head makes this trimmer comfortable to hold and control during trimming.</li>
            <li> This one has a cheap plastic housing, a cheap plastic trimmer guard, and when I use it the hair gets pinched between the guard and the unit, and pulls!</li>
            <li> The lithium ion battery is holding it&#x27;s charge for over a month so far and is working great.</li>
            <li> But it was better designed for detailed trimming.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer offers excellent value, with two extra trim heads, sensible design and good battery life.</li>
            <li> Stubble trimmer is fantastic for when I don&#x27;t feel like shaving (most of the time).  </li>
            <li> Good product in reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My Norelco shaver is good, but the trimmer does not trim very close.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the power is good, and it keeps charge very well.</li>
            <li> quality unit - meaning good weight, thicker plastic, blades titanium or something, feels much stronger.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the good service.  </li>
            <li> a good product, battery lasts a long time and the trim tool things are good too.</li>
            <li> Well, this Remington MB4040 does not make that sound, and the cut hair seems to stay mostly in the plastic guard (easily emptied when you are done).  </li>
            <li> Great battery life, charges quickly, trims very well.</li>
            <li> And certainly one of the best trimmers for numerous reasons:  Lithium batteries are simply the best.  </li>

            <li> was concerned about nicks &amp; cuts based on other reviews, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any (yet) and hopefully won&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li> The this trimmer has got the best battery compared to other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li> I found the plastic head and the beard adjustment to be easy and intuitive.  </li>
            <li> On the sides he wanted a more rugged look (but clean) and in the front he wanted to keep his length.</li>
            <li> With the guard in place, the clipped portion of the hairs VERY quickly build up on the blade head.</li>

            <li> I like this one even better because it&#x27;s more powerful.  </li>
            <li> I loved the trimmer but really liked the stand charger that came with my last Remmington trimmer.</li>
            <li> The motor is strong and blades are sharpe.</li>
            <li> I use for two minutes twice per day - every day and has been going strong for years</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> and it is almost another 6 months and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> I have had this thing for 2 years and its still working strong.</li>
            <li> The motor is strong and well made.  </li>
            <li> It has good power and the smaller blades come in handy for shaping.</li>
            <li> Strong battery that holds the charge.</li>
            <li> i ordered this trimmer about a month ago, i charged it, and it&#x27;s still is going strong.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is working strong.</li>
            <li> It has to be charged maybe once every four months and is still running strong.</li>
            <li> Good for all facial hair and trimming to your own specification.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is pretty sweet, it has a really good system for changing trimmer blades and for changing the head length.</li>
            <li> Still going strong.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t charged it for a while and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much.</li>
            <li> The blade changes are quick and easy also making for easy clean up, the whole things feels great and very solid in hand, it&#x27;s not so light as to feel inferior, the battery life is also great, in my opinion this is probably one of the better things that Amazon sells......</li>
            <li> in all I am very satisfied with my purchase, and would recommend this product to anybody out there looking for a well-functioning and quality-made trimmer for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The battery on this is pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li> works very well, very satisfied</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great general purpose purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to my electronics and health products, so it says something that I am very pleased with this</li>
            <li> So at first I was loving the thing.</li>
            <li> and so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this product for more full beard trimming.</li>
            <li> Sure, the shiny plastic looks cool, but this is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> If the battery was as good as other reviews say, then this would be a good trimmer, as it is mine is not useable.</li>
            <li> Some reviews have said that you have to go over the area many times to get your whole trim done is very true!</li>
            <li> The trim head was easy to replace, the trimmer length was easy to set, and it was light yet sturdy.</li>
            <li> Perfect to use on the other &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; in my life!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good quality cutter but be prepared to buy a new one about every two years.  </li>
            <li> In fairness the new machine may have a superior battery</li>
            <li> Regardless, it worked fine during the 6 weeks the battery lasted.</li>
            <li> Light, and easy to  maneuver.  </li>
            <li> All-in-all a fine</li>
            <li> it might be fine for some  one else</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer for about 9 months and it did the job fine during this time.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for one year.</li>
            <li> This is a fine trimmer.</li>
            <li> Still works fine.</li>
            <li> The wider blades that this model have work fine.</li>
            <li> For $30, this is a fine razor.  </li>
            <li> Still, even after low usage, I&#x27;m still impressed that I haven&#x27;t had to charge it at all since the first charge after a year of usage and a lot of dormancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have one plastic attachment that works fine to adjust beard length.</li>
            <li> A fine product.</li>
            <li> When I was using Cruzer 6 the trimmer head wasn&#x27;t easy to use it to do precise trimming.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going just fine</li>
            <li> Mine was fine</li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> This trimmer/groomer is light weight  and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> In order to do that fine a trim, I need to pull the comb off the head all the way</li>
            <li> This adjustable clipper is working well, it charges fine and cuts well</li>
            <li> The comb easily adjusts using the thumb wheel and it locks securely in the selected setting.</li>
            <li> with the Norelco every trim was so fine and polished.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s light, easy to carry.</li>
            <li> Now i bought another one and its working totally fine.</li>
            <li> Probably, either trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is fine, however, I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> It helps to have a fine (..manual..) comb to assist with the straightening duties.</li>
            <li> Even trimmed my hair with it and worked fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but somehow a couple of the teeth broke off on the trimming head</li>
            <li> The light weight and slender shape make the shaver easy for me to handle.</li>
            <li> products that already work just fine?</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and can be used for many days before another charge.</li>
            <li> Quick Charge!</li>
            <li> From the very first use, this trimmer pulled as many hairs as it cut.</li>
            <li> (With that long name, it has to be perfect right?).</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust, easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, Easy to clean,.</li>
            <li> Solidly built, easily adjusted, and great results.</li>
            <li> It powers through beard hair easily and is really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for reaching tight places and cleaning up the neck line.</li>
            <li> and it is as powerful as Remington claims and trimming is very precise indeed.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust and secure length setting and easy to clean with the included brush.</li>
            <li> If you plan of trimming your beard every day, you might want to invest in something a little better, but it&#x27;s very good quality.</li>
            <li> This has a smooth and powerful motor and cuts very precisely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Should I run across any trimmer claimng to be better than this Remington or claiming to be better than any trimmer available, then I would certainly try it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Should I run across any trimmer claimng to be better than this Remington or claiming to be better than any trimmer available, then I would certainly try it.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying the four stars have nothing to do with the performance of the trimmer, it cuts FANTASTIC its smooth and perfectly contoured for fitment in hand and the blades are super sharp.</li>
            <li> but it was a huge dust collector on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Cuts well, length adjusts accurately and quickly.wordy rating is a pain.</li>
            <li> Huge improvement over what I had.</li>
            <li> The reviews I read were accurate about battery power.</li>
            <li> A huge design flaw.</li>
            <li> It works great as a body trimmer also, I use it for my stomach and chest on a short setting as well.</li>
            <li> Charge light indicates it is charged but it runs for about 5 min &amp; stops.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works very well and the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful enough to not pull your hair out, and the shortest length setting does a great job of trimming most of the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and is well built.</li>
            <li> gave great cut&#x27;s til the very end of it&#x27;s life same model no reason to not get the same quality very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> Charged for over 30 hours and notice battery indicator light was not on.</li>
            <li> comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> burn no matter what and has a blade that leaves it feeling smooth and feels comfortable and does not cut during use.</li>
            <li> The cut is smooth and i like the ability to adjust the height of the shave as well.  </li>
            <li> Also, for some reason I find I have to go over my face many more times to get all the hairs that used to stand up better, and therefore get trimmed with fewer passes, using the old guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels solid and does a great job.</li>
            <li> plastic guard seems cheap and gives an inconsistent setting.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality, extra heads work great for different beard styles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks since it arrived, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does very well, and keeps everything tidy.  </li>
            <li> I use clippers because I don&#x27;t like torturing my face, so pinching and yanking hairs rather than smoothly trimming them is a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I won&#x27;t be buying another cheap Remington product again.</li>
            <li> It felt cheap and not well made.</li>
            <li> Great product overall.</li>
            <li> razor is so cheap that it almost makes no sense in trying to find another attachment comb.  </li>
            <li> Works great initially.</li>
            <li> Great performance and various length options.</li>
            <li> If shaping is important, this is not the clippers for you.</li>
            <li> But it feels cheap to me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Severally easy to set up and clean plus this trimmer is made from quality material.</li>
            <li> It is easy to keep clean, and has a rotary dial to adjust the length of cut.</li>
            <li> The adjustable attachment ensures that trimming is smooth and my beard trims evenly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> Only requires one pass to trim your beard, which is a great time</li>
            <li> but I primarily use the beard blade with the zoom wheel to lock in the length setting.  </li>
            <li> thing is , the charger didn&#x27;t fit to my country</li>
            <li> The battery life is amazing and it works very well.</li>
            <li> LED indicator light turns off when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light weight</li>
            <li> Great for the guys who have coarse hair.</li>
            <li> fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer especially for the price.</li>
            <li> and they would replace it free of charge.  </li>
            <li> and so if vacuuming the hairs is important then this isn&#x27;t the product for</li>
            <li> My cheap one I had to charge every 2 days.</li>
            <li> but it works great and is solid.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the cordless function.</li>
            <li> Great to get short stubble without any razor burn.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Will not give precise</li>
            <li> - Trimming using the guard isn&#x27;t precise.</li>
            <li> - Easy to clean the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The guard will not give you a smooth accurate length of hair.</li>
            <li> They have great trimmers, especially those wired ones.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily to trim my mustache, eyebrows and neck hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean too.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Cuts smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> No replacement available.</li>
            <li> I also liked that it didnt come with a whole bunch of combs and things</li>
            <li> Had the potential to be a great item though.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and adjust.</li>
            <li> I keep my beard light and find that I don&#x27;t need any adjustment at all to the depth  level adjustment feature.</li>
            <li> This thing literally fell about (cheaply glued together) when taking it out of the box.  </li>
            <li> The battery last forever and the trimmer works great.</li>
            <li> There is a grooming comb that can fit over any of the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery system on this is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and this isn&#x27;t particularly smooth or efficient.  </li>
            <li> With the overall quality and the price, this razor is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> I guess will fit almost anyone needs, from the ZZ Tops out-there to the Indiana Jones.</li>
            <li> Ah, and I haven&#x27;t tried to maintain \\&quot;The Mighty El Insecto\\</li>
            <li> the adjustable comb gives you the precise  length you prefer.</li>
            <li> the light comes on like it&#x27;s charging then goes off after a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of a fantastic experiences with my ancient Remington beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I would reccommend for a cheap trimmer performs well.</li>
            <li> to the long-lasting battery and my being too cheap to replace it, I will get to enjoy its hair-rending talents for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, ow.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great for trimming my short beard, on a 3 setting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is great for beards and such but the hairs get caught in the guard and start to gum it up.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy a closer cut on your beard then this is not for you.  </li>
            <li> As a long-time user of beard-trimming devices, I&#x27;ve learned it&#x27;s the emitted sound that reveals their quality.</li>
            <li> Cuts smoothly, doesn&#x27;t bite.  </li>
            <li> It looked like I had used a cheap electric razor.</li>
            <li> : hubby says the plastic casing feels cheap.</li>
            <li> The Remington MB4040 Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer produces a really smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The dial to select a size is nice because it really keeps your setting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer is inexpensive, sturdy, well made, easy to clean and battery is just</li>
            <li> I always used cheap trimmers $15-$20 price range.  </li>
            <li> and  feels  cheaply  built.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and to switch out the headers with no muss or fuss.  </li>
            <li> Problem is that one of the plastic pieces that goes over the blade has chipped off and I am not feeling comfortable depending on this.</li>
            <li> having had several beard trimmers over the years, i can state confidently that this is, by far, the best.  </li>
            <li> a huge improvement over the cheap wahl i used before.</li>
            <li> He has a goatee and has had trouble keeping it trimmed, but found this product to work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is great and he would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t pull any hair and give a smooth trimming.</li>
            <li> It slides off to clean and the blades come out easily</li>
            <li> guard itself is sturdy, but has some give and has smooth edges.</li>
            <li> The trimmer attachments, adjustments, and etc are easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> It is simple and does a great job.</li>
            <li> the light weight of the trimmer, not having to use an electric cord, and the specialized uses of the blades included with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This was a great trimmer (especially for the price) but after just over a year, it died.  </li>
            <li> The plastic guard thing is more of a gimmick than actually useful though.</li>
            <li> The stubble blade is excellent for more delicate areas.  </li>
            <li> So far so good as this shaver is doing what I expect to in shaving my goatee.  </li>
            <li> I made a good charger out of a 5 volt adapter I had in the parts bin and cut the old charger cord to get the Remington plug.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the trimmer worked from the charger for those occasions when you might have a discharged or own out battery, but the manual says the charger only charges the battery and can&#x27;t be used to run the trimmer.</li>
            <li> works good so far...</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> This gives me about a days growth look which is hip and at 57 years old, hip is good.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> Battery life is good so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed videos online to make sure that I am putting the trimmer back together, but the device is fairly fool-proof.</li>
            <li> If you plan to adjust precisions frequently, there&#x27;s a good chance that this might wear out after awhile.</li>
            <li> So far so good for tending to my goatee/moustach.</li>
            <li> Battery seems good so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> With so many men&#x27;s grooming devices available now it has become more difficult to choose &#x27;the best&#x27; amongst the many.</li>
            <li> With so many men&#x27;s grooming devices available now it has become more difficult to choose &#x27;the best&#x27; amongst the many.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning of the product was pretty easy as well since it is able to be rinsed off.</li>
            <li> Perfect for grooming/trimming, not so great for cutting significant length.</li>
            <li> Takes a little work to clean but otherwise works wonderful.</li>
            <li> ANyhow, no complaints and works well, what more can you ask for, right?</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t do the fine trimming like I do, you still need to pull the comb off to fully clean the razor</li>
            <li> It allows for an incredible amount of detail, straight lines, and clean professional look.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and cuts close to the face with the guard is not used.</li>
            <li> I also sounds very powerful when running.</li>
            <li> very powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also learned to use it so that I very rarely have missed hairs anymore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also learned to use it so that I very rarely have missed hairs anymore.  </li>
            <li> Seems very powerful, well designed and time will tell about blade integrity.  </li>
            <li> It is very powerful and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Very nice and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> the detail blade makes it much easier to get the details nice and clean,</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it moves smoothly and effortlessly, and it gives me a comfortable, clean look.</li>
            <li> Works great, I use on my cat that has fine long hair, that gets matted close to her skin.</li>
            <li> IS AMAZING and the ultra long lasting lithium batteries and self sharpening blades make this the best pick out there!  </li>
            <li> This is my first cordless trimmer and it makes a huge difference not having to deal with the chord, a lot better this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> it is fairly minor, is if you plan to do detailed trimming, it is not that great.  </li>
            <li> One move and super easy.  </li>
            <li> Great battery life - only needs a full charge every week or two depending on your usage</li>
            <li> I have not tried the smaller beard trimmer or stubble blade, but the main blade works great and is very easy to adjust the guard.</li>
            <li> as the headline says, this thing has an outstanding battery life, doesn&#x27;t overcharge, and has very high quality, and easily interchangeable, blade heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great, very sharp, stays charged for many uses.  </li>
            <li> As for my needs, this product fulfills them :), and the 5 stars remain :)  If you read this REMINGTON, then please change the guard to a new one, with a rigid structure.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is versatile, easy to use, and generally a good trimmer (especially for the price).</li>
            <li> I used to own the previous Remington Trimmer, which I thought was SO good</li>
            <li> yeah, maybe they are pretty nice, but at somewhere around $30, this thing does the trick quickly and good enough for me.</li>
            <li> so I know I&#x27;m doomed if I don&#x27;t charge it more first.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve been shaving a loooong time, so I am familiar with how to operate and trim a beard</li>
            <li> At first I questioned the guard setup, but I am quite pleased with quality afterall.  </li>
            <li> Tons of length settings make this trimmer great, the guard doesn&#x27;t slip to a lower setting like a lot of trimmers, stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, my trim time has reduced significantly, while the quality of my beard has increased quite a lot.</li>
            <li> I still have the original trimmer I bought over fifteen years ago</li>
            <li> I was excited to see a Lithium-Ion version</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you are a regular guy, not insanely picky and on a budget, proud of his beard and ready to fight the naysayers anti-facial hair punks on the streets every day, this is the trimmer for you.</li>
            <li> 30 years is a long time for a trimmer and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I use it trim my goatee every week and the original charge has lasted months.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what I need it to do: trim my beard many times without running out of battery.  </li>
            <li> if you buy this product you will love it the first couple of months, after that maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a case of Stockholm</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy and every once in awhile need a razor that can trim arm/leg/chest hair.</li>
            <li> The goatee head allows fine trimming at the lip edges and also cuts quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Originally 1 star review.  </li>
            <li> And it holds a charge for a long time too, which is great.  </li>
            <li> First, I love that this things charge lasts seemingly forever.  </li>
            <li> As it was given as a gift, the higher priced models would have been better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look at the charger first as most transformers work with either voltage.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a great job and holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I can get about 2 weeks worth of use out of it on one charger!</li>
            <li> It did not hold the original charge, and could not be recharged.</li>
            <li> The guided lock-in settings are great if you grow long beards or (in my case) want to trim your sideburns to a desired length.</li>
            <li> There are two items loosely fit in plastic at the top of the large clamshell.</li>
            <li> Makes cleaning them much easier, all the real fine hair washes right out.</li>
            <li> Great product, sharp blades, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Remington MB4040 and was very excited to give it a try.</li>
            <li> works great and holds a charge very long.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair cleanly without pulling</li>
            <li> Finally stepped up to a Lithium Powered trimmer, and have been very happy with this one for over 9 months so far.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how happy that makes me, especially since it&#x27;s so powerful.  </li>
            <li> Hardheartedly recommend this trimmer for the flexibility of interchangeable blades to the clean cuts it makes.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Pulls unexpectedly now and then, battery last forever, perfect for my beard.</li>
            <li> I have had several trimmers and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> and I have had it for a few months and used it a great many times.</li>
            <li> Although they say it doesn&#x27;t require it, but it is written in the manual that if you clean the blades with water you need to lubricate the blades with oil.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Although they say it doesn&#x27;t require it, but it is written in the manual that if you clean the blades with water you need to lubricate the blades with oil.</li>
            <li> and it is a breeze to clean.</li>
            <li> Powerful and easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li> remove the guide, turn the trimmer over, and you can trim along your lip line, leaving a clean and neat appearance.</li>
            <li> I was buying the really cheap shavers in the drug store and the blades would go quickly and they wouldn&#x27;t stay charged.</li>
            <li> I used this to trim my beard and to keep my hair line clean.</li>
            <li> The quick change trimmer heads is a huge selling point.</li>
            <li> The Norelco seems to have had a more professional cutter, but this one does okay as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I removed the blade once to clean the interior out and since then, the blades do not cut anything anymore.</li>
            <li> Having the ability to keep a clean goatee just got easier.</li>
            <li> I love it and am glad my old one died.</li>
            <li> to clean</li>
            <li> Luckily they are both fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> Made clean up a breeze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the unit for a couple of weeks, but so far it is excellent.</li>
            <li> wish it could give me a clean shave, but it is just a trimmer.</li>
            <li> The settings are easy and it is powerful.</li>
            <li> However, I was able to return it and get a full refund - thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Worth the price and keeps a strong charge.</li>
            <li> Overall good power and a good product - major upgrade from my Wahl.</li>
            <li> so when I shave my whisker growth is significant, but this trimmer cuts right through, easily.  </li>
            <li> The way the blades change out is super cool and super easy.</li>
            <li> - Edging sideburns is good, because the hair is usually long, so it&#x27;s easy to edge it.</li>
            <li> Beard looks good, trimmer cleans up easily, lasts a long time on a charge.</li>
            <li> Furthermore the trim length selection wheel is easy to accidentally bump while trimming causing it to fly down to the shortest length.</li>
            <li> Love the new Lithium battery, keeps the trimmer running at full speed continuously!</li>
            <li> The adjustable length feature is very handy, and the trimmer holds its charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> took the unit apart and it has a AA-sized battery inside, but it is welded in place and therefore not replaceable without special tools or without permanently damaging the circuit board.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t seen anything special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d owned a Remington clipper before that had a special pop up for trimming moustaches, so when it died I searched for another Remington..</li>
            <li> remington special puted in the product box 120 wolt adapter</li>
            <li> Very sharp and my beard has never looked so good!</li>
            <li> This one is okay, but again too much effort to clean it out for what I use it for.</li>
            <li> I love that from my fine head on top, to my coarse hair on my chin, I have never pulled a hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t keep up with my beard much and don&#x27;t do fine detailing but want a nice fast cut when I do trim and this does the job.</li>
            <li> I am super excited with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Works about what I expected, nothing great, doesn&#x27;t  get all of my wiskers</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good razor so far.  </li>
            <li> only used it once, but first impressions this trimmer is great for 30 bucks</li>
            <li> This thing thus far is amazing...  </li>
            <li> I looked around for a good trimmer locally, couldn&#x27;t find anything and shopped Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, works well and shaves really close to skin.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked good for one shave, and one shave only.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well, trims evenly, don&#x27;t know how you could do better.</li>
            <li> received it, it weighs next to nothing, which depending on your point of view could be considered a good thing.</li>
            <li> Plus it took about 8 hours for a full charge.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light in the hand, and the motor is powerful.  </li>
            <li> Powerful and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> , this is a good basic trimmer.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good trimmer for my needs.</li>
            <li> can trim your beard in a couple of minutes as it&#x27;s a full size trimmer.</li>
            <li> But I was pleased really as did not like this shaver.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold a charge much longer ( I am sure the Wahl is NiCad battery).  </li>
            <li> there was also a distinct sound of each hair being cut.  </li>
            <li> All the extra attachments look good</li>
            <li> I use te trimmer directly to my face for a close nice 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> Nice soft blades.</li>
            <li> I am convinced you can&#x27;t find a better trimmer regardless of how much you spend.</li>
            <li> One full charge will give up to 7-10 trims.</li>
            <li> and it may not be good if we do not have enough hair to trim.</li>
            <li> Still in initial usage, but seems to be good on battery life</li>
            <li> But Battery life was the only issue with it.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t use it unplugged,  but loved the dial-a- length and Ergonomic feel.&lt;br /&gt;Sent</li>
            <li> The adjustable length helps me with all of my needs and it is not painful on the skin.</li>
            <li> Looks better on pic than real life - lots of plastic.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s been a really good investment.</li>
            <li> Cool attachments.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, this is the VERY reason why I use a trimmer instead of a shaver most of the time--because I don&#x27;t like getting nicked, cut, burned, etc.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good for facial hair</li>
            <li> It is used for full body trimming and it does that well.</li>
            <li> everything was good except it didn&#x27;t not come in the box that it shows in the pictures, it just ships in the same box it was packaged in.</li>
            <li> The darn thing couldn&#x27;t hold a battery charge (a common problem if you read the reviews), but darnit, it was the best trimmer</li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase</li>
            <li> If you need to get rid of a full beard, this will do the job.</li>
            <li> to the lack of the bag, I would give the unit a 4.5 rating if it were possible; however, it is too good a trimmer to deserve a four star rating.  </li>
            <li> That is until he dropped it in a sink full of water.  </li>
            <li> After just 4 months this device cannot hold a full charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only heard good things about Remingtons.</li>
            <li> you want that 2 day beard or want to groom up the wild beard you rock to keep your face warm or to be the lasted hipster icon.</li>
            <li> I should have purchased a cool trimmer like this years ago.</li>
            <li> I chose this trimmer because it seemed a good balance between quality and low price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer when it works, but its life is too short.  </li>
            <li> Full charges takes 8 hours, but a use in the morning</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price with all the accssories that come with this product.</li>
            <li> Not a bad performance lifespan for a $25 trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good for facial grooming, notgood for a full a shave.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by how long the charge last on this, and its also easy to switch clips.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried when I took it out of the package, a little light, didn&#x27;t think I was going to be good but works GREAT!</li>
            <li> Easy to dial in the exact length you want.</li>
            <li> It is bigger than some of the other trimmers but the battery life is great, the height adjustment is easy and reliable, and the blades trim the beard/ goatee nicely.</li>
            <li> The plastic comb seems pretty sturdy, and all serviceable pieces are easily removed.  </li>
            <li> but it does cut consistently and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> 14 years ago I tried my first Remington with the easy adjustable length (it was a twist adjuster).  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, I like the built-in adjuster for the trim guard, it really is a great package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until now, it has been a useful tool and nearly 2 years is pretty good for the price point.</li>
            <li> But, I tried this trimmer from Remington and true to form the beard blade assembly broke the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Works great and has a loooooooong battery life compared to other trimmers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, he says it&#x27;s a good trimmer and just wishes it felt a little more durable.</li>
            <li> operates as it should giving a clean line and fresh look to my son&#x27;s hairline and beard</li>
            <li> Powerful trimmer with no pulling, durable and clean look.</li>
            <li> I had another Remington trimmer where the trimmer blade would pop up easily, but stayed connected on the back side of it to the body of the trimmer, making it very quick and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The too-wide tooth issue is theonly flaw - but a serious one - on an otherwise excellent product.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a super longtime between charges.</li>
            <li> MB200 has short battery life and doesn&#x27;t look as fancy but cuts more evenly and does a better job.</li>
            <li> Product works very well, adjustable, quiet and works great.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works like a dream and shaves very well, the interchangeable trimmer blades is a nice touch and makes this trimmer very versatile.</li>
            <li> After using it now for a few weeks, I assess its performance, ergonomics, battery, and comfort, to be every bit as good as the Norelco, and, perhaps, even better, since the battery is lithium-ion, (you can read the product description for its benefits), and the cutters self-sharpening titanium.  </li>
            <li> Quickly and even trimmed my beard-</li>
            <li> I finally gave up and figured the Remington looked like the best one and knew I could send it back if I had problems with it.</li>
            <li> Yes, my hair grows in quickly.  </li>
            <li> I use the lowest setting #1 to trim around my mustache and chin area - where the hair tends to get quickly out of control.  </li>
            <li> I love the extra blade options to give you a better shave for the beard.</li>
            <li> You would think I would have stopped after the 4th cut, but no, I went for lucky number 5.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to use on my dogs for quick trims of the feet and around the face on my poodle.</li>
            <li> Charging light would be nice if it would tell you when the battery is about to die, or show what the remaining power is, but for the price, that is no big deal.</li>
            <li> At the beginning, it charged quickly and held a charge for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Quick charge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only using the stubble blade, based on others reviews (thanks) and it shaves great with no cuts even without the guard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more about learning how to use it vs my last version.</li>
            <li> It cuts quickly without pulling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v had a few trimmers, and this one is a good one for sure.</li>
            <li> Very versatile​ and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I had an older, similiarly priced Nolrelco trimmer which cut more &#x27;consistantly&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> 6 months in battery is now quick to die.</li>
            <li> My husband is the main user of this trimmer, but as a licensed cosmetologist (hairstylist) who often cuts his hair and helps him trim his beard with it, I am pleased with this product considering it&#x27;s price range.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky now if the run time lasts for 5 minutes on a charge.</li>
            <li> I have brought in the iStubble and have tried it quickly once</li>
            <li> I charge it fully, and it is lucky if it can make it through one trimming of my beard.  </li>
            <li> What he really enjoyed about it was the fact he could set so many different sizes for beard length.</li>
            <li> then the battery life went downhill quickly</li>
            <li> I just finished a quick trim about 20 minutes ago and thought that I should update my review to reflect the additional six months since I began using the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I simply could not be more pleased with the craftsmanship, the ease of use and the results.</li>
            <li> I simply could not be more pleased with the craftsmanship, the ease of use and the results.</li>
            <li> In my case I use it for a 4 setting beard, which I maintain every 3-4 days, and the job is very easy to complete with this machine.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this, being able to easily remove each cutting blade with the push of a button, the trimming guide snapping on easily, and the ergonomics are pretty great.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the rugged construction and high torque this unit produces.  </li>
            <li> Im enjoying the high quality and precision of these trimmers.</li>
            <li> I normally use it without the comb on the end and it is very sharp and does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li> , the plastic sleeve that fits over the top is a bit cumbersome and comes off easily if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> This thing is awesome, love it, very sturdy feels as if it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> It was great at first, but now that I&#x27;m almost at a year I can&#x27;t finish shaving beard on single charge.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very compact and not very expensive, also easy to clean</li>
            <li> Also I noticed that this Remington doesn&#x27;t cut very consistently.</li>
            <li> Had other models, this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> OK, it&#x27;s simply a normal shaver.  </li>
            <li> Sara&#x27;s husband:Great trimmer, finally a suitable replacement for my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied; especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two other Remington products with great success.  </li>
            <li> Would have given a higher score if not for the cheaply made beard guard.</li>
            <li> With this trimmer, once you get the hang of it  trimming is very quick and easy and the results are amazing (even if half asleep).</li>
            <li> My last Remington lasted over 6 - 8 years, and I&amp;#34;ve always had good luck with them so far - my favorite brand</li>
            <li> Sure you could do better, but you could also do a lot worse, and for this price it&#x27;s about as good as it</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time and the blades are of good quality.</li>
            <li> My Norelco was able to adjust by mm and thus I was able to really zero in on the exact length that I particularly like.</li>
            <li> It cut cleanly and efficiently, far better than any razor I have owned.</li>
            <li> buy beard trimmers exclusively to replace shaving, because I have sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t need to be perfectly clean shaven most of the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for clipping hair and shaving down to a stubble</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, lots of power, charged right out of the box, but didn&#x27;t take long for a full charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to charge this new one once in about a month, and it still has a healthy charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the new powerfull Motor.  </li>
            <li> I love this new version of the remington trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about three and a half months now, and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great improvement on his previous one.  </li>
            <li> It really keeps a charge and its easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had it long enough to comment on durability or battery life, but useability and function are top-notch.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product has so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> lots of power, smooth cut, long battery life, NICE trimmer.</li>
            <li> A very nice improvement over the older model i had that recently stopped working.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to do!</li>
            <li> Had I written a review last winter, it would have been 4 or 5 stars as I grew my first beard ever and tried various trimmers, and this was the best one I tried that would get close without getting too close (one of the guards on the others resulted in me always nicking myself in an unintended place and my beard-growing efforts would be for naught until I found this).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> It has all the features I was looking for; easy to use, well designed, hope it last many years.</li>
            <li> Sent it back to Amazon, glad they make returns so easy.  </li>
            <li> My only concern is that without a guard in place, the blades can easily &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; you, for example the top of your lip.</li>
            <li> The blades are easy to change, but they come fairly well oiled which makes cleaning somewhat messy because the oil attracts the hair shavings and requires some scrubbing with soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and the adjustment wheel has a nice solid feel to it.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable guard is easy to adjust and is way better than having multiple guards all over the place in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have used two previous models of this trimmer and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Works great in the tight spots.</li>
            <li> Some units come with a large number of junk accessories, but the Philips has genuinely useful fine trimmers, etc.</li>
            <li> The shave using the blades is not super close but good enough for a good stubble.</li>
            <li> and I like for it to be clean cut with a crisp edge</li>
            <li> Minor issue on an otherwise exceptional product.</li>
            <li> you still need a hand razor for those up-close large areas (cheeks/neck) which this shaver doesn&#x27;t quite make smooth.</li>
            <li> As humans we might press strongly in this spot, and press gently in another spot while trimming, right?</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The most noticebale first impression offered by the Remington MB4040 beard trimmer is that its motor is powerful enough to provide a very clean cut.  </li>
            <li> Here are my thoughts on this handy and stylish little gadget;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Powerful and great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Also want to add that the plastic attachment for trimming you beard to a specified length, the plastic attachment is kind of flimsy and even if you apply just a little more pressure it will trim to a shorter length.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful, hold its charge for a long time and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you want a fast and precise razor, buy this.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts forever and it is light and relatively quiet, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few days, and it is working great.</li>
            <li> there is absolutely zero change in the length, and then when you adjust to a 3 setting it makes a huge jump.</li>
            <li> After trying multiple trimmers, this one is by far the best I have owned so far.</li>
            <li> The few times I got to use it it worked great.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, my wife prefers the unshaved look and feel, but not so much the mustache or beard.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t explain why it feels cheap to me, maybe too much plastic.  </li>
            <li> fast, comfortable.</li>
            <li> Was great while it lasted but it broke after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m fully satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The motor is plenty powerful.</li>
            <li> Nice quiet motor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, and for the ridiculously low price you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find something better.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still as powerful as day one.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the duration of a charged battery is hugely better than the old model that used NiCad batteries.  </li>
            <li> Lithium Ion battery is noticeably more powerful than the old NiCad trimmer I replaced.  </li>
            <li> Good value for the price and even better than more expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> Depending on how you hold the trimmer, you either end up not cutting any hair, or shaving your face bald.</li>
            <li> but I thought it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> have given this 5 stars if it came with a case of some sort to keep the extra heads in, and a brush for cleaning would be nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alos nice to only have one guard to keep track of.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a heavy shaver, probably at most a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for another Remington that was many years old.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably quiet, cuts nicely, recharges well.</li>
            <li> Overall a nice product.</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful, it&#x27;s a nice form factor and the device is obviously well built.  </li>
            <li> But the lithium ion battery is sure an improvement over the old nicads.</li>
            <li> I have been through a few cordless chargers over the years and this one is, by far, the best one I have ever had.</li>
            <li> This is def worth the cost over some of the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> Had this for a few months and this is by far the best trimmer I have ever earned.</li>
            <li> The length gauge is a nice simple dial, just turn it to what you want.</li>
            <li> Powerful.</li>
            <li> There is no bag or stand or anything, so I put all of the external parts in my own bag</li>
            <li> This trimmer is much more powerful than my old Wahl that it is replacing.  </li>
            <li> Nice to finally find a company you can depend on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised to see that so many people gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor get the job</li>
            <li> - Powerful motor compared to Cruzer 6.</li>
            <li> Still full power on its first charge.  </li>
            <li> It is not cutting as well but after 2 years what do you expect.</li>
            <li> He loved it so much that when he accidentally left his at a hotel, he just purchased another one.</li>
            <li> Nice and solid.</li>
            <li> It moves effortlessly through my beard and seems to trim it well, arguably better than the old units.  </li>
            <li> Each head is screwed into a plastic case which easily snaps into the main trimmer device.</li>
            <li> This thing is powerful and cuts my hairy face with ease.  </li>
            <li> Better than my old Remington which I saved for what reason I have no clue.</li>
            <li> I would have liked one lower setting, but it works well enough as is.</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful and trims without pulling or snagging on your beard.  </li>
            <li> The clear plastic used in the adjustable spacer looks like it may be more resilient than the that of</li>
            <li> It does better for the beard but in a pinch can also do a complete haircut.</li>
            <li> im on 2 months on my first full charge.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer had a bunch of attachments, like the Wahl, so it would adapt to many uses.</li>
            <li> the additional blades aren&#x27;t useful to me and have joined my cluttered drawer of attachments and cords i never use, but keep just in case...</li>
            <li> was worth it.</li>
            <li> plenty powerful and well built.</li>
            <li> The older version was strong and versatile.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s certainly worth the money</li>
            <li> the battery is good, does a great cutting too</li>
            <li> I rarely charge it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i like to try to maintain a natural look with my facial hair, and this trimmer has been great for that.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m rather pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Extra shaving heads are a nice plus.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> has a nice solid feel to it.  </li>
            <li> The exchangeable blades are a nice touch, especially at this price point.</li>
            <li> You slide the guard to different preset positions - and there is a handy indicator on the razor telling you what length you&#x27;ve selected.</li>
            <li> But I still believe it surpasses all the others of its kind, so I keep coming back at holiday time!</li>
            <li> Not too noisy as well.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with only 1 adjustable plastic guard with 9 different sizes for custom level of trimming which is a bonus{less pieces laying around}, and 3 different razor heads.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - Very happy with this product, for the price I dont think you can get anything better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t grumble too  much as the item is such good value for money</li>
            <li> I read the book on them but to be honest, I don&#x27;t know whats different about them.</li>
            <li> well worth the amount paid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite powerful and cuts well.  </li>
            <li> This guy is powerful, and seems well built.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier than the old Norelco, probably because of the better battery.</li>
            <li> , the company was kind enough to send me a replacement blade, complementary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall.. its been fun.  </li>
            <li> For everything this trimmer does and features, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Multiple head are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> The battery performance alone makes trimmer worth buying.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write a review although I purchase often on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> liked the power, sharpness, shape, design, plastic guard, Lithium battery, and especially the thumb roller adjustment for blade height/depth.</li>
            <li> Bought it to upgrade the battery, but I prefer the old one with the nickel cad battery better in terms of shape and ease of use.</li>
            <li> Also liked that it came with the extra shaver heads</li>
            <li> Does the job and apparently holds a great deal of power since it took more than 2 hours to run down</li>
            <li> My wife loved the newly discovered salt and pepper look but wasn&#x27;t a big fan once my stubble went into full Grizzly Adams mode after a week.  </li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer and the battery runs strong and lasts a long time (still working from my initial charge).  </li>
            <li> and it seems to work well and was exactly what he needed (right now he has a full beard and wanted this to trim it).</li>
            <li> It runs long and strong, is stylish and does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> It also has excellent commercial style blades compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> And as for irritation, even with the stubble blade the razor pulls hairs, and has nicked me several times, which is very uncommon in my experience with other products.</li>
            <li> The battery charged quickly the first time</li>
            <li> This blade gives me about a one day stubble, which most days is clean enough for me.  </li>
            <li> This mainly would be good for shaving the entire beard.</li>
            <li> I had an older Remington trimmer for years and loved it, but the battery finally died.</li>
            <li> Really holds a charge (much better than my older one).  </li>
            <li> I am still a very pleased user and certainly recommend this trimmer for any man with the slightest facial hair that needs to be tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still a very pleased user and certainly recommend this trimmer for any man with the slightest facial hair that needs to be tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes the stubble one cuts my skin under my chin but other than that good product, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as any other inexpensive trimmer</li>
            <li> The other 2 cutters are good though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He says it makes keeping his beard the right length</li>
            <li> so it chews you right up.  </li>
            <li> I searched for a couple of months to find the right trimmer.</li>
            <li> When I came across this one it had everything I was looking for and the price was right also.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Done everything right.</li>
            <li> Price was right.</li>
            <li> Priced just right.</li>
            <li> It even came charged right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Well then, you&#x27;ve bought the right clipper set.  </li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t matter because I think it cuts just right for the day after shaving look.  </li>
            <li> now I think those other trimmers were not even up to the standards of OK - This guy is quick, easy and rechargable.</li>
            <li> I previously had a very cheap remington that had lived its life after many years of beard trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was great for the first few months and now the battery does not charge</li>
            <li> So I purchased this several months ago, and at first I liked it.</li>
            <li> you still need to clean up with a straight or electric razor.</li>
            <li> MB4040 is easy to hold in your hand, not too heavy, not too light, ergonomically designed to make your life easier while holding it to go over your face with ease while you make yourself handsome.</li>
            <li> The two shaving attachments -- which were more or less stuck to the plastic clamshell that I was trying to pry open -- then fly out of the packaging and onto the floor.</li>
            <li> Would it have cost them so much more to create a small tray of some kind</li>
            <li> Does good job on my mustache and beard, long charge life for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and battery last for ever!</li>
            <li> The different styles allow me to shave down stubble, trim my goatee and mustache, and it all looks perfect when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Although the different trimmer heads are easy to swap in and out my primary use is to trim my goatee.</li>
            <li> The guard also easily removes for precise trimming around the next line and stray hairs in the cheek area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also light enough to travel easily.</li>
            <li> I have owned probably a half a dozen different brands to this point, this is the best.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light, easy to handle, multiple heads and the battery lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I found, however, that it is still easy enough to get a smooth, even trim by using the trimmer without the guard in place...</li>
            <li> Works better than my previous trimmer, a more even trim without having to go over and over and over for  fifteen minutes</li>
            <li> After using a Wahl for many, many years, I needed to upgrade to something that was new, sharp, wouldn&#x27;t grab my mustache hair, and would cut cleanly and thoroughly through my goatee.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer with absolutely zero cream/moisturizer, and never a painful moment.  </li>
            <li> Though the plastic guard, with more than enough adjustments for the length of whiskers, is nice, I wish I would have made a different purchase.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say that for best battery results it should be completely discharged about once a month and left on the charger for about 24 hours, and I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;m going to have to leave it running until it dies.  </li>

            <li> This is the first product review I have ever written, but I think this product is worth the time.</li>
            <li> so many users complain that they cut themselves when using this trying to shave their bare skin.</li>
            <li> no problems, battery last forever, easy to clean, and powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Works great, Battery life is unbelievable</li>
            <li> the small detail blade is great for eyebrows and ears too.</li>
            <li> It  it a great beard trimmer the only thing that I could see going wrong is the adjustable part breaking if u drop it or something but all and all a great beard trimmer haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet</li>
            <li> It cut well, and the battery held a nice long charge.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time, it cuts nicely, and seems durable.</li>
            <li> Quick charge: Got to use it right out of the box and fully charged really fast</li>
            <li> Feels solid and holds a strong charge!</li>
            <li> Clippers are sharp, easy to use, could not have made a better purchase.</li>
            <li> It does not offer easily clogged vacuum features, and thus is a good choice for beards that have gotten too long and need a \\&quot;brush cutter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> He said it shaves nice &amp; battery lasts a very very long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> The great thing about this razor is not only that it does the job without pulling your hairs out, but that it comes with three different attachments.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing about it is that it holds a charge, which my old trimmer would no longer do.</li>
            <li> Always used Remington (4th so far) and really not too happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things seemed to be ok, but at some point a few months ago my trimmer stopped being able to hold a charge, so now I can&#x27;t use it at all,</li>
            <li> The quality, fit and finish were better than I expected at even twice the price.  </li>
            <li> really quickly and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I spent way too much time looking for a trimmer for my beard and this one had good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I realize that someone reading this review will probably make fun of me for not being able to figure out how to put this thing back together, but I&#x27;m manning up and admitting it anyway.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, that&#x27;s a great product, but it&#x27;s designed more for your head than for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick review because I don&#x27;t want to spend much time on this</li>
            <li> Works great and cuts low enough that I do not have to use a razor!</li>
            <li> The first charge lasted so long that I honestly don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> I like the trimmer attachment with the smaller teeth that are closer together, it gives you nice straight edges when outlining, of course you must  take the comb off.  </li>
            <li> It gives appropriately short cuts, seems to hold a charge well and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Been through several Mustache &amp; Beard Trimmers &amp; so happy I finally found one that is to my husband&#x27;s liking!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, especially as the price is great</li>
            <li> That has worked fine, but the battery is pretty old and it&#x27;s not quite as powerful as it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Travel-friendly: it&#x27;s cordless and amazingly lightweight, not heavy like his old Remington.</li>
            <li> Great Trimmer, versatile with the 3 different blades and various setting heights.  </li>
            <li> It as simple to use, easy to clean, and cut evenly.  </li>
            <li> me, I am thrilled with this trimmer because that means the Wolf Man has left the building and in his place is a much cleaner looker hubby.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works as expected and a good reasonably priced replacement piece.  </li>
            <li> I have only used twice, so far so good.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice product -- small, but plenty of power to do the job.</li>
            <li> Long charge life, powerful motor, easy to clean and lots of setting options.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care about battery life so much as its not a very important feat in a trimmer which you will mostly use in you bathroom where you have the ability to keep it charged most of the time.</li>
            <li> Oh, and very accurate trimming heads (you get 3 of them in various sizes).  </li>
            <li> Even a very very close shave is doable without the heads on it.</li>
            <li> I am handling it very gently.</li>
            <li> All that at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This tool at a very reasonable price gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> I spent a few dollars more on this nice Remington and am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Was worried ( as I always am buying a new product to replace the old one) that it would not be as good as my old trimmer (also a Remington).  </li>
            <li> I had an old cheapo Remington cordless that worked fine for trimming my beard and my head, but the rechargeable battery had given up the ghost.</li>
            <li> guess like u just need to get used to... not bad trimmer with some improvements required - mainly concerning plastic combo, its regulation and fabrication material.</li>
            <li> Also good for a little over-the-ear and sideburns trim.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about a new trimmer for my beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a ton of adjustable settings (multiple heads, lots of length settings), but length adjustments are quick and easy with a dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in kind of an odd position for turning on and off quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, cuts clean, has good adjustment levels and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Nothing huge to report on, as far as that goes.  </li>
            <li> That took some effort, but the battery lasted and it looks pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is kind of strange really</li>
            <li> This is my 10th trimmer and the first Remington; I&#x27;ve always used Phillips.</li>
            <li> Order arrived on time and exactly as advertised, but then I started to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, this is my third in the Remington MB line.  </li>
            <li> He was immediately in love with it and still has it a year later</li>
            <li> I am public health doc! :-)</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of a Remington and this model is very much better.  </li>
            <li> First one died out after 2 months....</li>
            <li> After only 6 months the battery has stopped holding a charge for more than a minute or two so I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband needed and he loves it.</li>
            <li> It turned on when I first opened it.  </li>
            <li> Most guys will want the lowest setting for the trimmer, which only increases the risk of creating bald</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This one feels more substantial than the cheapies I&#x27;ve used and the height settings are solid (don&#x27;t slip).</li>
            <li> I go back and forth wearing a beard, usually more in the winter.</li>
            <li> Trims pretty well.</li>
            <li> Adjustable guides take some practice, but when you use it with the power switch and dial facing away from your face (per the instructions) it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks on the first charge.  </li>
            <li> so this is my first shot at growing a beard</li>
            <li> My first trimmer and it works well.  </li>
            <li> As a first time user the hardest thing for me was to learn to hold the unit perpendicular to the face.  </li>
            <li> If I ran out of battery life while I was trimming, I think I would be a sasquatch, but more likely it is probably for traveling and not taking the charger with you.  </li>
            <li> I liked my old trimmer better,  this one seems to pull a bit &amp; cut uneven.</li>
            <li> word of advice though, be sure to use the stubble trimmer blade as the beard trimmer will make short work of your flesh.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it looked like I went swimming with piranhas.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington because I&#x27;ve always had a goatee and wanted the smaller blade that came with the set to be able to shape the hair on my face.</li>
            <li> Lithium Ion battery makes a big difference as well as being able to use it with the charger cord in place (using 110v) when needed.</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery, and the adjustable guard level is great.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on the first charge.</li>
            <li> Also the battery  on it last for days with just one charge :)</li>
            <li> Most power bricks of this size can be used globally, but not this one...</li>
            <li> I only used the trimmer once a week at most.</li>
            <li> I will wait till he uses it for the first time.</li>
            <li> This shaver trims much closer and even comes with a blade to leave stubble - which is apparently the latest style.</li>
            <li> The adjustable guard is helpful in keeping my goatee a consistent length.</li>
            <li> At first I was unsure about the lithium ion battery.  </li>
            <li> I modified it by trimming away some of the cover plastic to allow the cover switch to be more recessed and slide further and got it working again.  </li>
            <li> The first time I received this product, the head had popped off the trimmer and the blade assembly had come apart.  </li>
            <li> Having replaced my old trimmer, this product has fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> It is the first lithium one I have ever had, so there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used a Remington trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love that there is only one comb, and length is adjustable.  </li>
            <li> First the battery stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> The guard also prevents me from trimming my mustache properly (i can&#x27;t bring the blades to the top of the mustache.</li>
            <li> it just doesnt keep a consistent length.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer (a cheap Wahl) would drain in two days just by sitting on my shelf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut myself a couple times but not since my first week using it.</li>
            <li> The short is: I love it.</li>
            <li> It has not been on the charger since the first night.</li>
            <li> - If your beard or mustache is short, edging results will not be satisfying, but for longer hair like sideburns it would do the job.</li>
            <li> - Better trimming in the neck, but needs several passes.</li>
            <li> Which exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> Despite how hot the bearded model is in the product photos, *</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d done some research and this product was rated among the top five on various sites.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my hair short and it really works great and simple to use.</li>
            <li> and this is my ONLY electronic product that is not compatible with most of the world.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on the first charge.</li>
            <li> [i should have checked this first].</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a thick beard and it works great on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok looking at the pictures on this amazon product description page I will refer to the 3rd picture from the top in the description.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure when you buy it to follow the directions and FULLY charge it when you open the package.</li>
            <li> If you look at the trimmer with the guard on the guard rests about an inch higher than the blade, not flush on the blade.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what he was wanting.</li>
            <li> I chose another Remington because of the quality of the first</li>
            <li> First: I wish the #1 setting was shorter.  </li>
            <li> I like to trim/finish my beard away from my mouth (a nod to my wife&#x27;s not liking to &amp;#34;kiss beard&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> Just something to be aware of in an otherwise well designed grooming aid.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> It will most likely prove to be a five star trimmer</li>
            <li> This trimmer far exceeds my expectations by light years.</li>
            <li> I usually try to stick with brands with which I have had good success (Panasonic, Braun).</li>
            <li> The height guard delivers a consistent length, even around jawbone and chin.  </li>
            <li> With the Lithium Ion battery that does not maintain a memory, it will last for many years.</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s a much better system than having a dozen different attachments, just roll the wheel and it adjusts quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a consistent cut and doesn&#x27;t tug any hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating my rating from 1 star to 4 stars, it would have garnered 5 stars had I not had the battery issue on the first unit I received.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first beard</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> me first thank Amazon for their generous return policy.</li>
            <li> It is too flexible and should have been made more rigid without the open edges that can grab at hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer</li>
            <li> This was exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a particularly expensive trimmer</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;something to be aware of:  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is *guaranteed* to nick you (painfully) in multiple places if you shave against the grain like many guys do.  </li>
            <li> This is my first beard trimmer but it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for a couple of months and charged  it once after the first time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before it started acting up it did do a good job trimming, but be warned that if used without a guard the pointy prongs will catch in your skin and make you bleed if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I hoped for</li>
            <li> Regrettably, this resulted in more of the same: pain and bleeding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it has the interchangeable heads for different shave &amp;#34;projects&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than my last Remington I wore out.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li> The guard is only one piece that is able to be set higher or lower.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor in June 2014 and gave it its first charge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several beard trimmers most of which were junk.</li>
            <li> really powerfull!</li>
            <li> First, the battery.  </li>
            <li> Second, based on its price, I figured I was getting something better than those $15 trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remington brand has done well, the trimmer does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> He was pleased not only with how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> Mission accomplished!</li>
            <li> Battery power and life seem leading edge - I am interested to see how this one ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> was purchased on January 21 and use it for the first time on February 27.</li>
            <li> but with what is supposed to be a higher quality battery.</li>
            <li> If the battery last for a couple of years I would say Remington has the better product in the market.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m completely satisfied and stoked I bought this thing.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what I want it for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t exactly what he wanted, but he kept it anyway.</li>
            <li> First thing I was amazed by was the packaging of the product itself.</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope this type of rechargeable battery will last a lot longer and not end up as another \\&quot;disposable\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The beard attachment actually made a better stubble.</li>
            <li> but it does the job and does it pretty well.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t expect to be able to keep your stubble trimmed short.</li>
            <li> : This is the first electronic shaver device I have ever had and since the first use got the results I was looking for</li>
            <li> charger spoild on first day, batt charge for 2 days can use max 10 mins then need to charge.&lt;br /&gt;please check the review before buy.</li>
            <li> The first one only lasted 8 yrs., and you can&#x27;t do better than that.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li> but it did get hot against my skin.  </li>
            <li> Construction is a bit on the light side when compared to my 3 year old Remington titanium trimmer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my beard upstairs and downstairs.</li>
            <li> Another thing you CANT trim/shave on zero level, the blades will cut through your skin (happened to be the first time).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and all that in the first go with the device.</li>
            <li> The first one of these I got worked like a charm for close trims (it was confiscated by TSA</li>
            <li> Thanks, Remington!    </li>
            <li> On time exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> But because I have a short beard, I find myself using the MB-200 more because the plastic guard allows for a closer cut.</li>
            <li> Iuse this shaver not for a beard but for my hair so this review is based upon mostly hair and some facial hiar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is my first experience of shaving at home</li>
            <li> Takes way too many passes over my beard to actually trim it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for everyday shaving</li>
            <li> but as far as trimming goes, it does a good job, just a mess to clean.</li>
            <li> The MB4040 didn&#x27;t require recharging as frequently as my older model, but other than that, I don&#x27;t have much good to say about it.</li>
            <li> far battery life has been great, and it can get a quick charge enough to last through a trim if the battery dies on you</li>
            <li> I have used many Norelco and other brand trimmers in the past, but this might be the best so far.</li>
            <li> but man if ur not careful it cuts pretty easily.</li>
            <li> It seems like it doesn&#x27;t want to charge to begin with as the yellow charging light goes off rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It runs very well and for the time being it is superior to the previous rechargeable I owned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super powerful, holds a VERY long charge, and is pretty precise.  </li>
            <li> My father is now enjoying the new razor &amp; able to shave in half the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it less than 12 times but I am very pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the battery last a long time, and the handle is nice and shiny, but those 2 aspects have to the only 2 postive factors with this cheaply made Remington trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I have spent far to many hours on line researching clippers, I tried the TRYM11, did not come close to being able to clip my beard, nor did this clipper at the lowest adjustment, where the MB 300 really does</li>
            <li> There are no other attachments that can give you fine detailing options.</li>
            <li> So the 4040 while probably a very suitable clipper just does not clip short enough, and I am not a stubble guy.</li>
            <li> product!a lot worse, and for this price it&#x27;s about as good as it gets!    </li>
            <li> My old $9 trimmer with snap-on guides was far easier to use and also was gave more consistent results.</li>
            <li> I predict this trimmer will far outlast my original too.</li>
            <li> Lots of power, and the blades are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> How could it have taken so long for someone to design such a simple product that works effortlessly and flawlessly</li>
            <li> Love, love the cordless feature and the long lasting battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Only the main trimmer is useful, the fine trimmer and goalie trimmer didn&#x27;t seem useful to me.</li>
            <li> Most reviewers claim that they go very long periods at a time and they haven&#x27;t had to charge it, and I&#x27;m pleased to say that I&#x27;ve had the same experience!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First the pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life has so far been nothing short of amazing</li>
            <li> The trimmer blade must be completely removed frequently to clean it out.</li>
            <li> The plastic, multi-length attachment comes on and off easily, so I can adjust for different lengths on the side and back, then take it off to buzz the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I had a soft bag saved from an old shaver and an able to put all the parts in that, including cleaning brush and comb</li>
            <li> Compared to fancier and more fragile products, this was a real relief.</li>
            <li> The extra blade attachments are going to come in handy where others just have one fixed blade</li>
            <li> I really like is how long the battery holds up (am able to use many times before needing to recharge) and the low price of this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> FYI, pretty much only good for facial trimming, really nothing else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good if you want a clean shave, but it is great as far as managing a beard.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I can send it back and get a full refund.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed it for the past three months and the AC charging unit is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average at best compared to previous models</li>
            <li> biggest positive is the battery life.  </li>
            <li> It had a decent charge from right out the package.</li>
            <li> Love the lithium ion battery, powerful motor and sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Been at least two months, and I&#x27;m still loving this product!</li>
            <li> have only had the opportunity to use it a few times but so far I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any pressure, and I just barely touched the hairs as lightly as I could.</li>
            <li> Most pleasing is the long battery life and the built in recharger.</li>
            <li> This trims it exactly the way I like it, and it was reasonable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it pretty much once a week since then.</li>
            <li> You can pretty much set it at any length you want to by the adjusting wheel.</li>
            <li> It appears to be more powerful than other razors I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean....  holds a charge for longer than any other cordless trimmer I have used.  </li>
            <li> I held the trimmer, and it seems well balanced, and his beard looked GREAT after he used it - not too short like it sometimes looked with the other model.</li>
            <li> It would be a good additon to have a small accessories bag with this</li>
            <li> the past fair while--</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a nice, clean buzz cut, instead it kind of shreds the hair in all directions, so his hair looks messy and &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; so I have to keep going over the same area a few times to get all the hair it missed and smooth it out.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail lightning quick and even had enough charge to do a quick touch up on my beard.</li>
            <li> But the new one works pretty good, just messy.</li>
            <li> The adjustment wheel works as I expected and gives a very fine length adjustment for beard, sideburns and around ears.</li>
            <li> the plus side battery does last a long time (as long as mine was working) and fit and finish is great.</li>
            <li> trimmer operates at a seemingly high RPM which generates more noise than anticipated - would not operate if someone was sleeping in the next room.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> So this beard trimmer seemed to work OK for a while, and the motor was strong enough to cut through thick hair pretty easily.</li>
            <li> The titanium blades are really sharp and very easy to use product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is very easy to use and does its job.</li>
            <li> This is a good economical trimmer which is user friendly and not too expensive either.</li>
            <li> What I just realized about it that makes it amazing is I have not charged it for a year and a half</li>
            <li> The Lithium battery is really pretty amazing, as I&#x27;ll not charge the thing and use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to do more than 2 passes regardless of how lazy I&#x27;ve been, which is a huge improvement over what I had before.</li>
            <li> I like the overall design and easy of use.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is pretty much the whole package.</li>
            <li> This thing will easily make it through a summer sheer session on one charge (I&#x27;d say I have a medium amount of body hair).  </li>
            <li> The adjustable comb attachment fits over the blade easily and has several calibration setting using the numbered zoom wheel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of guy who typically runs things into the ground.</li>
            <li> It also comes with two additional heads for different trimming requirements which are extremely easy to swap out.  </li>
            <li> I concluded that maybe I&#x27;m just getting older and that the recently higher prevalence of grey in my beard gave it a tougher texture, making shaving just suck more than it used to.</li>
            <li> Those saying they can&#x27;t have this happen easily need to watch the instructional video that Remington provides on youtube, it shows how to properly use it.</li>
            <li> but the comb is not as effective, it is harder to clean and I have managed to cut myself twice (something that never occurred with the prior model I used).</li>
            <li> The 9 different easy to select positions</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;ll still yank em out easy enough.  </li>
            <li> Cuts even and easy to adjust the settings, but I have only had it for a week now.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s pretty light and doesn&#x27;t tire your hand if you&#x27;re shaving your neck or back.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of this built-in system instead of the myrid of attachments I previously had for my trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is easily adjustable for facial hair trimming,</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer would not hold a charge so I found this model on-line and liked the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Its pretty fantastic, I have only charged it once in a month or so, so</li>
            <li> Solid construction, easy to use for beard and mustache trimming.</li>
            <li> I like that you can adjust the length by dial, and the different trimmers are easy to swap out.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you wash and dry the blade after use.  </li>
            <li> Has 9 different settings so easy to find the setting you desire.</li>
            <li> When I used the trimmer for the first (and only) time, I learned that the guard is made out of cheap flimsy plastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, but I would go for a higher quality shaver next time since in this case</li>
            <li> : The trimmer comes with three different blades, really easy to change</li>
            <li> It seems to be that if you try to cut off too much (by letting your hair get too long and then trying to take more than 1/3 of an inch</li>
            <li> I like how they are easily changed by  a simple snapping mechanism.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong after the final trim.</li>
            <li> Now I only use the trimmer 2-3 times per month, but it has held a charge and is running just as strong today as it was the day I charged it.  </li>
            <li> That is the last time I charged this thing, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> This mainly would be good for shaving the entire beard before using a razor blade, line up sideburns, back of head, and over the ears, or if you want a stubble</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 weeks now and it is still running strong from the initial charge.</li>
            <li> lightweight, well made, feels good in the hand and has a long lasting lithium battery.</li>
            <li> and since it is a Remington I expect it to last a good long time.</li>
            <li> Its super cute and havent had a single issue with it so far.</li>
            <li> Very well designed, ergonomic handle, sharp fine blades , easy to clean , low noise and stayed charged for long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery seems very good, and if properly maintained seems like it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea in theory: rather than having a ten detachable plastic combs (one for each length), the one attachment slides over the blades, and a dial on the trimmer moves it up or down to adjust length.</li>
            <li> leaving a large gap in the comb</li>
            <li> For a lithium powered shaver, even the A/C adapter is large and heavy&lt;br /&gt;Limited accessory set.</li>
            <li> so you get what you pay for to a certain extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one ever dies, I will certainly replace it with an identical model.</li>
            <li> shaver  is  large  in  size.  </li>
            <li> It can certainly hold the charge for months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades are easy to remove and switch: right now, hubby is only interested in the detail blade for his goatee but likes how easy it is to pop the other blades in</li>
            <li> Solid build, great battery life, and very sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I hoped the product would have quite a bit more longevity, but here I am a year later looking for yet another new beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had a similar previous version of this trimmer that did a great job while it was running.  </li>
            <li> for cleaning is not as handy as my previous one since you have to remove the whole lid&lt;</li>
            <li> It is far superior to my previous Remington.</li>
            <li> Cut very well with no pull and the different blades makes the job easy.  </li>
            <li> Keeps things nice and tight.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my beard tight to my face and this does it nicely.</li>
            <li> At first I chalked it up to me getting used to a new trimmer, but every time I used it it pulled hairs!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i just use if for clean up of sideburns and general grooming, not</li>
            <li> our experience with this product is a good one, and even though my name is Remington, I stay with Remington because trimmers like this seem to last a real long time.</li>
            <li> our experience with this product is a good one, and even though my name is Remington, I stay with Remington because trimmers like this seem to last a real long time.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it vibrates a lot now with the fine blade.</li>
            <li> The mess is easy to clean</li>
            <li> The trimmer holds a charge well, and works just fine for regular trimming.  </li>
            <li> However I have found I can use the fine tooth regular cutter to do everything.</li>
            <li> dial in your personal &amp;#34;hey, i didn&#x27;t shave (because i&#x27;m creative/outdoorsy/apathetic/lazy) level for the day and fine tune the areas you do want to refine.</li>
            <li> The blades themselves are fine, but the plastic mounts that hold the blades are apparently fragile.</li>
            <li> Keep a steady hand, or you&#x27;ll alter the landscape in a hurry!</li>
            <li> Nice little tremor trimmer</li>
            <li> The adjustable length attachment on the MB4040 is a nice feature as it just take a little dial to change the height</li>
            <li> Because I have Braun 790, it will clean those small hairs, and would give me a better shave around the edges of my mustache.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp blades, no more pulling out whiskers and does a great job of shaving the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> It was good enough -- cheap and flimsy but got the job done -- when I first started using it, but 8 months later it won&#x27;t hold a charge long enough for even a quick beard trim.</li>
            <li> But the iStubble isn&#x27;t good for hard to reach places like under the nose</li>
            <li> I love the long charge on the battery and the high R.P.M. of the motor that is not even mentioned in the add or instruction sheet that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, thank you.</li>
            <li> Well, a little more than 1 year from purchase date and the charge doesn&#x27;t last more than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> The blades do not make a clean sharp line and they do not cut close to the skin where I want to clean up the edges.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, powerful, easily adjustable, quieter than a lot.</li>
            <li> Powerful, sharp and does the job very quick.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and charges in a few</li>
            <li> Worked great for a month, then the battery would only run for about 2 minutes and died a few weeks after that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid trimmer, with accurate, visible adjustment settings and lots of power.</li>
            <li> The stubble attachment works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really glad I spent the money and purchased this item.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t bother me much because I don&#x27;t need it any shorter than 2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very aggressive cutter with a lot of power</li>
            <li> bought this trimmer to shave my whole face with.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if not for the quality, for the price!</li>
            <li> Holds a charge really well, but it will tear yore skin up.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely a must have for beard aficionados.</li>
            <li> Beefy.</li>
            <li> Really holds a charge.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for a year, but Battery no longer holds a charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wanted to point out the plastic height adjustment / guard since when I was shopping for this I really had to dig to find info about it.  </li>
            <li> Since the gaps between the teeth are so much narrower</li>
            <li> /&gt;It Trims much closer.</li>
            <li> The stubble blade attachment gets very close.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t trim very well around the curves of the face, under the nose/upper lip, and on the chin.</li>
            <li> The P.N. trims MUCH faster with fewer passes.  </li>
            <li> The battery on this one lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> so I cant use a foil or straight razor.</li>
            <li> Turns out that this one doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li> Really like the battery.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to trim it up, and upon initial use, I&#x27;m gonna keep trying, as it evened out my scruff well &amp; worked smoothly...</li>
            <li> Very good..serves u well to maintain stubble.</li>
            <li> In short, it&#x27;s industrial, simple to use, and works great, which keeps things simple for me, just the way I like it!</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for not even a whole year</li>
            <li> and very inexpensive for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> But the real question is ....</li>
            <li> works real well &amp; the battery</li>
            <li> The battery stays charged while unplugged for months a time thanks to it being Lithium Ion.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really fault</li>
            <li> It works really well too.</li>
            <li> I am usually much faster at decisions.  </li>
            <li> Get a dedicated, real stubble trimmer or you&#x27;ll end up wasting a lot of time with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Feels durable and takes a charge really well.</li>
            <li> really well I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for some time</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The blades are well constructed and feel very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> /cheap feel to them, but together the razor functions very well.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is great as well as the compact design, but with the results I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;m not sure how much longer I will be willing to gamble with my facial hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s simply not an acceptable lifespan with today&#x27;s available battery technology.</li>
            <li> Cuts very well</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really all I need.</li>
            <li> and it lasted the whole time.</li>
            <li> It also comes out of the box ready to use (including being fully charged).</li>
            <li> I am very fond of this Remington MB4040 trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I would really like Amazon to fix this problem with a replacement charger.</li>
            <li> As i am a regular user of amazon this should be done free of charge.</li>
            <li> This trimmer functions very well, and</li>
            <li> So much for that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;strong blades and cuts very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> the charging light stays on constantly and there is no power getting to it.</li>
            <li> Just too much effort had to buy another trimmer as well.</li>
            <li> Also it is much cleaner to use.</li>
            <li> This clipper is precise enough to shape my moustache.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the MB4040 to replace it because I knew it would be much quieter (which it is).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since returned the MB4040 and am going to try another Remington model which looks promising at it</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it cuts really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> As you might have guessed it, it is very reliable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (realistically it won&#x27;t cost that much anyways).</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> The clippers without one of te size heads on it is very close to the skin where I have nicked it once or twice.</li>
            <li> this does the trick very well.</li>
            <li> wanted a very close shave because I get rashes from using a blade.</li>
            <li> but this thing you can just hear how much faster the blades move.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge real well.</li>
            <li> Throwing it in the garbage at this very moment.</li>
            <li> Holds charge very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely forever.  </li>
            <li> This works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> The 3 heads that come with it make it very flexible to any type of trimming.</li>
            <li> a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic protector feels smooth against my skin as I trim my goatee.</li>
            <li> I do my hair ( I don&#x27;t have much ) and beard with the guide on and the close trimming with the guide off.</li>
            <li> ( you cant really see what you are doing)&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> Seems to hold a charge very well</li>
            <li> Second, you can&#x27;t comfortably use the MB4040 without the clipper guard attached.</li>
            <li> Maybe Remington responded to those remarks and stopped sharpening the blades as much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Remington for making my day.  </li>
            <li> Very functional trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Had this for a couple of months now and it really does work well.</li>
            <li> You can leave it plugged in without overcharging, so it is always ready.  </li>
            <li> worked the whole time no recharge.  </li>
            <li> I really lïke the device.</li>
            <li> It trims very close.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I wasnt too concerned as i didnt use them much anyway.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> He really likes the way it trims.</li>
            <li> For the price, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I go at things carefully, slitting the tape on the sides and top with a pocketknife and then pulling the inside packaging</li>
            <li> (the blades get REALLY close to your skin with this head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine came charged and ready out of the box.  </li>
            <li> i have owed it for about six weeks and find it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it</li>
            <li> would like to see a battery life indicator or even a battery getting low light</li>
            <li> Just wanted a stubble trimmer that was simple and cheap.  </li>
            <li> Yes this unit comes with swappable trimmer attachments but who the heck wants to get a screw driver out and swap just to do a moustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used the mb200 for years and years and really like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grow beards very often, but when I do, I need to keep them well groomed in order to be presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really lasts (I don&#x27;t bother to pack the charger whenever I go on trips).</li>
            <li> The jog dial moves the blade part very, very slightly - I can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s the smoothness of the shaver that I really like and can recommend.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer that you can just buzz over your face without worrying if you&#x27;ll take off to much, i have my doubts if this critter will do it.  </li>
            <li> If Remington were a responsible bunch, they&#x27;d pull this product from the market immediately.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to report it to the CPSC, and I may very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> really?).  </li>
            <li> Charge also holds a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this trimmer.</li>
            <li> .. very sturdy cant beat the price..</li>
            <li> Very sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I fear I&#x27;ve said too much.</li>
            <li> and feel make it a comfortable use and the different heads come in handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those that like their goatee and mustache trimmed very close, the guard does not allow the blade to get \\&quot;close enough.\\</li>
            <li> Lithium holds a charge longer and charges fast when I need it.</li>
            <li> It may work well for longer hair trimming, but if you like to keep your beard cut at the \\&quot;lowest setting\\&quot; then its a real pain in the butt to get this to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Very quiet (compared), and smooth.</li>
            <li> Very unfriendly, so I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my college-age son for Christmas and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I will be treating it carefully (and making sure to store it at the \\&quot;minimum/</li>
            <li> It was very time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I really like this razor</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> really long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I realize I don&#x27;t have time for my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the length adjustment roller is very sleek.</li>
            <li> It lasts MUCH longer between charges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> It is very well built.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a well-built, cheap beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> My husband has been complaining about how much work it takes to maintain his goatee.</li>
            <li> After receiving the item, much to my surprise, it appears that I am now one of the picky people.</li>
            <li> it seems like I got what I paid for...not much.</li>
            <li> The battery really lasts a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a well priced cordless trimmer that works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I understand that he wants to grow it out</li>
            <li> Plus since hubby works in retail his appearance matters and having a really shaggy beard (picture the wolf</li>
            <li> but it really helped with cleaning up the front of his beard.</li>
            <li> Plus he says it does it fast so he can keep up with his look even if he doesn&#x27;t have much time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues with battery life, and I don&#x27;t charge it very often.</li>
            <li> The real kicker however is the lithium ion battery.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t recharged it since and the battery still continues to drive the blades fast.</li>
            <li> and this one does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t shave on a schedule, so when I&#x27;m shaggy this gets me ready for blade or foil.</li>
            <li> It does the goatee trimming very well.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well.</li>
            <li> I will not say that this Remington brand is the very finest of the bunch but, for me, it has proven to work very well.</li>
            <li> I will not say that this Remington brand is the very finest of the bunch but, for me, it has proven to work very well.</li>
            <li> Much easier to provide shape to my beard or moustache with this beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> whenever the mood strikes without eating into the number of recharges older-style recharables are capable of taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades themselves are also very heavy-duty and feel like they are quality made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really</li>
            <li> a great&lt;br /&gt;Priced very appropriate&lt;br /&gt;nice</li>
            <li> seem sto be very sturdy.</li>
            <li> In this aspect of the Remington design teams infinite wisdom they really dropped the ball.</li>
            <li> unit works very well, and doesn&#x27;t spread whiskers all over the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Solid construction; doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  </li>
            <li> Does a respectable job, but loud as a lawnmower next to your ear.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a trimmer that got broken recently, and I am very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Nice they offer those, since the unit will likely last for years.  </li>
            <li> and while i able to put them back together, they eventually all completely broke.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with it&#x27;s simplicity and long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve only used the regular beard attachment, so I can speak to the goatee or the stubble attachments, but I&#x27;ve had nothing but good results with what I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> It has 3 different heads for trimming different things which is really nice</li>
            <li> good to handle for a hair cut , but to trim a beard is not so good .....is cutting the beard to short !</li>
            <li> , Much better than my ten year old trimmer did.</li>
            <li> So far so good , haven&#x27;t had it long enough to rate it any higher.</li>
            <li> This a good trimmer that I use when I&#x27;m running late</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using beard trimmers for many years, and most have been usable but (a) poorly constructed,</li>
            <li> This is my third trimmer in roughly 10 years, and it will probably be my trimmer-of-choice for a good while to come.</li>
            <li> and they were a nice heavy quality metal.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use the right blade attachment though as the blades will &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; a little if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> (unit still contains charge from factory and going strong) - I am simply amazed and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day and I love the attachments and the ability to trim my beard to a certain length.</li>
            <li> As with most trimmers, trying to find the right method to do your mustache can be more difficult than the rest of your beard</li>
            <li> This unit works exactly as the old trimmers did: with 9 length settings for triming, a simple on/off switch, and a guard that easily comes off for cleaning the unit of cut hair.  </li>
            <li> Great Shaver, very sharp, holds a long charge.</li>
            <li> The attachment give a wide range of cuts and is just the right width for precise trimming.  </li>
            <li> It is, however, very sharp, not at all suitable for trimming borders or shape.  </li>
            <li> The battery life I am not sure about I will have to use it more, but it is comfortable in your hands and is nimble not like my old Norelco!</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last a long time between charges, the blade attachments are nicely sized and function fine, and it&#x27;s a fairly quiet trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer comes with attachments to ensure a consistent length to the beard (a plastic, comb-like cover that goes over the cutter head) and extra cutter heads to get into tight areas or do a good stubble trim.</li>
            <li> My old one was very cheap, didn&#x27;t hold a charge for long and didn&#x27;t cut very well.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought a new Wahl (for half the price) and am once again happy when I trim</li>
            <li> It goes a long time on a charge and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The charger functions well and the battery stays strong for a long time.</li>
            <li> Nice and adjustable, it&#x27;s got a sharp blade and does nearly anything you would want a trimmer to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not good for very short stubble; does not cut as closely as other trimmers (from Wahl and Philips)&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> but it slipped from a the grip of the user and broke on the first fall, which wasn&#x27;t very far.</li>
            <li> It is powerful, it holds a charge and the settings are clear and steady.</li>
            <li> I really like that this is the lithium ion powered trimmer, as the batteries seem to hold a charge much longer than the older nimh or nicad rechargeables.  </li>
            <li> The length knob is very easy to use for multiple lengths on different parts of my beard.  </li>
            <li> This is much better than any other trimmer I have used for my head and face.  </li>
            <li> and it gives me a significantly closer shave, leaving me with stubble only.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge well, able to be used in the shower, metal blades are sharp and there is no tugging.</li>
            <li> THE OTHER TWO PINCH LIKE MOST JUNK TRIMMERSS.OVERWISE</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the MB200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer last year.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The titanium coated blades offer long-lasting sharpness, but many of the other cordless trimmers like the ones from Philips, also feature titanium coated blades.</li>
            <li> This Remington is more functional than other comparable shavers, for the price.  </li>
            <li> I have had Norelco and a couple of other off brands and this one is better than them all.</li>
            <li> My husband says that it is better than any other beard shaver he has had.  </li>
            <li> Most other shavers, the adjuster is a plastic attachment which almost always breaks.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, its OK</li>
            <li> Better than expected !</li>
            <li> I have had it for a couple of months and still have not recharged it, and it does not pull the hair in my beard like so many other trimmers do.</li>
            <li> Then, as experience by many other reviewers who gave the trimmer 1 star, the trimmer stopped holding charge and eventually died.  </li>
            <li> Clean cuts, long battery life - have used it once a week (2 minutes per session) for 3 weeks, still going strong, have yet to charge the battery.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable trimmer guard works fine, a little cumbersome reattaching as there are two groves which must be aligned - not a big issue mildly</li>
            <li> The little wheel in the middle controls the length of the beard guide and is easy to change on the fly, which was extremely helpful between beard trimming and mustache work.</li>
            <li> Gets close enough to keep me looking clean shaven but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> The material it is made of shouldn&#x27;t allow shaved whiskers to stick to it nearly as much as the older Remington unit it replaced.  </li>
            <li> I could never get the older unit really cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Taking it apart to clean it after use is also extremely simple.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is small, effective and very convenient.</li>
            <li> the whole this is a decent trimmer, that gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to clean and like it says, it has self-oiling blades (not sure how that works but</li>
            <li> this works ok, pulled a few beard hairs at first but has stopped since then.</li>
            <li> Because the trimmer guard is FLIMSY, NOT HARD, ISN&#x27;T ENGINEERLY WILL DESIGNED!</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and cuts fast as well as seems to hold a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The battery only takes a short time to charge up but the best part is the charge lasts a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A great example of how something new on the evolutionary tree is WORSE than what it was intended to update.</li>
            <li> I tried shaving over the same areas MANY times and from multiple angles, but this thing just would *not* trim certain areas.</li>
            <li> The strength of the motor is better than any battery charged unit that I&#x27;ve used previously, the blades much, much sharper.</li>
            <li> I really liked that old trimmer, but in typical fashion, I ran it to death.</li>
            <li> Accurate control and long life between charges.</li>
            <li> Has some pretty unique power settings so be careful.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty clearly a quality built piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> For some reason I haven&#x27;t been able to find a trimmer that will trim these stray hairs along with the dark hair.  </li>
            <li> Even with a full charge, I have to try over and over again--turning off and then back on--to get it to start.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve either gotta be going for a very short look or a full beard.</li>
            <li> I have a full beard and only trim twice a week, so I&#x27;m hoping for years of use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grow a full beard at all so short stubbly</li>
            <li> and it only goes 30 seconds on a full charge.  </li>
            <li> Level adapter does not get properly fixed to the number you select unless you select a higher one (3 in my case) and then go to the lower (2) From 1 to 2</li>
            <li> They said if I send the product back (at my cost) they will issue a full refund.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, this was the first task I tried with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Watch out thought because at first it can cut your neck as you have sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li> Trimmer cuts fairly close to the skin, but the guard is too big, even on the lowest setting, especially if you want a shortly trimmed, but still visible beard</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;mustache trimmer&amp;#34; head that is included is also pretty handy as it is basically a very small (in width) trimmer head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked my Remington MB-200, which has lasted me about four years, until recently the clipper assembly has started coming loose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being able to change the head gives it a big advantage to clean it properly and making it last longer.</li>
            <li> With this razor, the ability to ratchet the comb up and down in very small increments using a thumb dial on the body makes this a perfect solution to that</li>
            <li> It is a little bit bigger and noticeably heavier than the Norelco, which makes me think it probably has a more powerful motor  and a higher capacity battery.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I brought this in to use for my shortly kept neat beard, I have an old Remington MB 300 that works fine after</li>
            <li> there are many pieces, all fragile, the money spent on the accessory blades would be better put toward making the primary blades not rip your hair out, and after minimal use it died about a year after later</li>
            <li> If it lasts half as long as my old one I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> SO FAR, which was when I received the product and  had to charge it completely for the first time !</li>
            <li> I would buy this one again if I needed a new one!</li>
            <li> By Friday I had a brand new razor sitting at my door!  </li>
            <li> Really good battery life, but it pretty much ends there  - at least for trimming short beards.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the new exchanging heads feature.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate their responsiveness, and I didn&#x27;t expect a whole new packaged unit, just a battery.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a very long time, cuts well and accurate.</li>
            <li> MUCH better than the inexpensive MB200 I previously purchased.</li>
            <li> one is even better, and sturdier than previous one.&lt;br /&gt;Higly recommended.</li>
            <li> That alone makes it a worthwhile upgrade from previous models.</li>
            <li> I hope they update this and make the plastic guard more like the previous models.</li>
            <li> another trimmer i bought for half the price did better.</li>
            <li> Should make for a decent doorstopper.</li>
            <li> I hope this one will last as many years as the last.</li>
            <li> So far this unit has kept it&#x27;s charge better than expected.</li>
            <li> Trims decently well.</li>
            <li> main drawback is the gray hair.  </li>
            <li> I use bought this because the older model I had battery died.  </li>
            <li> After only a dozen or so battery charges under occasional use the battery will no longer take a charge that lasts more than five minutes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this around Christmas 2012 hoping to find a decent trimmer that I could use around twice a week.</li>
            <li> As an FYI, Remington recommends the Main (not the stubble) blade for the closest cut.  </li>
            <li> I leave the main blade on all the time.  </li>
            <li> sure enough, the SAME THING HAPPENS WITH THIS MODEL.  </li>
            <li> The lithium battery lasts a long time, which is nice to have a long use time without worrying about the battery dying.  </li>
            <li> I use the comb attachment mainly when trimming  and shaping my mustache.  </li>
            <li> I had an older trimmer that fell and broke.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older rechargeable Panasonic beard trimmer that had to be charged before every use.</li>
            <li> I love all of the options you have for such a low price.</li>
            <li> It recommends charging for 24 hours prior to use, but luckily the product was designed for men and ignoring the instructions is taken into account.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of keeping the design similar, the trimming machinery and the guard are completely different and yank many of my hair out instead of trimming them.</li>
            <li> After months of use I can say that it lasts way longer than my older unit with a NiCd battery.  </li>
            <li> When my last hair trimmer (also made by Remington), after many years of reliable use finally died, I started looking for another one.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this to replace an older model because of the longer-life battery.</li>
            <li> I will end up using my older model.</li>
            <li> I end up using the beard trimmer on the outer parts of my beard then using the stubble with no guard at an angle to fade to a decent stubble on the interior.</li>
            <li> I get done and still see patches where it totally missed no matter how many times you go over the same spot.</li>
            <li> Only 110v - loud sound.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on sale at a department store to replace the older [[ASIN:B0009OMU0A Remington MB-200 Beard Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> My beard is older than a lot of people that I work with.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer mainly for the stubble trimmer feature...</li>
            <li> Hols a decent charge.</li>
            <li> , that was one of my main reasons for buying it.  </li>
            <li> My main use is for trimming a goatee beard.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s describe this particular one.</li>
            <li> plus I believe it didn&#x27;t have the L-Ion battery.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for handling this particular product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i keep my van dyke trimmed short, and use my normal razor to shape it while i take care of the rest of my face--and so i use the trimmer the way it came out of the box:  with a blade that goes the full length of the machine, and with a built-in length guide.  </li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased this trimmer was to detail the edges (mainly the sides) of my goatee and to even up the bottom of my mustache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older model of this type of clipper and I have to say that they don&#x27;t make em like they used to.</li>
            <li> I’ve used mainly the beard trimmer</li>
            <li> Holds a decent charge</li>
            <li> This purchase was to replace an older model and it is just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent quality trimmer that feels well built.</li>
            <li> After all, there is only so many times you can recharge these batteries before they totally run out of power.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also find the ergonomic angle of the trimming head to be much better than the classic trimmer style, especially when trimming the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quiet and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the beard trimmer for the main areas and the goatee trimmer to shape the lower lip area.  </li>
            <li> Decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an older set of hair clippers, with no guard.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have too many fancy gadgets like some of the more expensive devices have nowadays</li>
            <li> Some were better than shears and a comb and, as the years, they got better but not perfect.</li>
            <li> The MB4040 model replaced my older Remington that I used for 15 years.</li>
            <li> I have an older version MB 85 which has lasted me for years and also has the mustache trimmer which this model lacks.</li>
            <li> I have this and the older (and cheaper) MB-200.  </li>
            <li> It was a replacement for a previous trimmer with older battery technology and it performs 100% better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wide enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like a beard trimmer and does the job quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> and you must either rely on a steady hand and a comb.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought the older model.</li>
            <li> I like the easy trim-height adjustment with a very solid feedback and nice, solid on/off switch that is not easy to accidently turn off.</li>
            <li> this one sucks without the guard, if you want the stubble look this is not for you, youll cut your face up for sure!</li>
            <li> its got a significant battery life as it takes so long to get a job finished.</li>
            <li> battery wont hold a full charge and wont work plugged in long enough to trim a full beard</li>
            <li> Works well on multiple settings, priced right and delivery was very timely.</li>
            <li> the job, but mannnnnn the motor buzzes at a high</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this trimmer if you are looking for one under $60.</li>
            <li> I have not charged it since my purchase, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After using this set a few times I must say it works great on my head with no guard &amp;#34;a very close shave&amp;#34; and on my face I would definitely recommend this product to any of you using it for the same reason.</li>
            <li> Looks like a high end product and trims hair well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d replace it with a rechargeable, portable unit that was highly rated.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> A high quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> can highly recommend this trimmer to any of my fellow bearded</li>
            <li> now after this trimmer I got,  my life has really become easy, it shaves instantly into different styles</li>
            <li> This cutting machine is quite good, I am not disappointed by it.</li>
            <li> And if I use it with the attachment it pulls my hair when it goes between the plastic and the blade, which hurts more than just a little.</li>
            <li> shape of the product is a little more curved than I was expecting, but does not impede any area of clipping, probably helps get under the chin on an upward stroke.</li>
            <li> The adjustment seems to stay put a little bit better than on</li>
            <li> Because of this it does take a little more time to get cleaned up.</li>
            <li> Cots a little more</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when I read some of the reviews which mentioned how it felt in the hand and pulling of the hair, but he seems 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I liked it although it really does have serious battery issues.  </li>
            <li> The last Remington I had when the mechanism was locked in, the shaved off hair ended up in the sink, which is far easier to clean when trimming a beard.</li>
            <li> Very good lithium trimmer with built in cutting height adjustment.  </li>
            <li> I like my stubble pretty short and even on the lowest setting on this, it does not cut as close as setting 3 on the older model, so i cannot really get it to the length I want.  </li>
            <li> This item is extremely sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit cheap and seems to be the first thing that would wear out .</li>
            <li> ; It&#x27;s...just as bad as they are saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for one week (like two shaves) and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Everything great but no charge light when plugged in (unless the shaver is fully charged, in which case I dont know how to ytell either way) and the second thing is the stubble cutting length seems to be its weekest feature.</li>
            <li> It has  done the job very well so far.  </li>
            <li> Battery best out, bare razor cuts dangerously close, Plastic Attachment comb is trash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised, by the performance and qualities as it&#x27;s engineer very well.....</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I like the week old stubble look and while this gets reasonably close, it&#x27;s not close close.  </li>
            <li> I knew it wasn&#x27;t water proof or resistant when I bought it, but I really miss that feature on my old one.  </li>
            <li> Great trimmer that does a great job and doesn&#x27;t crap out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> so far no problems at all,  purchesed about year ago, it really works well and have no complains.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li> Stays charged for much longer than my old trimmer, which ran on NiCad batteries.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not flawless and fantastic like my professional salon quality plug-in trimmer, at times it requires a few extra runs over a spot to get all the hair, and the blades aren&#x27;t AS precise as I&#x27;d like (many of us hairstylists really love a t-blade)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Remington for about two months now, and so far really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper trimmer for years and this is worth the extra bucks</li>
            <li> I normally trimmed my beard to a 2 or 3 length setting</li>
            <li> It is powerful enough to trim without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did love this razer when I first got it but now looking back if it&#x27;s only going to last a year</li>
            <li> There were too many detachable parts to this, which made it too messy.</li>
            <li> The same holds true for my old Remington beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally go to the barber and have them shave my face</li>
            <li> THE STUBBLE BLADE IS THE ONLY ONE WORTH KEEPING IT</li>
            <li> But it is even better, and the charge last a long time.  </li>
            <li> If I comb my beard first, and straighten out all the hairs in the same direction it really doesn&#x27;t happen much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t seem to kill this battery with normal usage.  </li>
            <li> Been at least two months, and I&#x27;m still loving this</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t seem to kill this battery with normal usage.  </li>
            <li> and it went for a few more months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many shavers in the past, and this one really seems to be the cream of the crop.</li>
            <li> there aren&#x27;t as many visibly stray and messy hairs.</li>
            <li> (you won&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stepped guard and simple design of this trimmer have been useful for quite some time to me.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> The battery and motor seem powerful, and the unit feels solid and substantial.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of mixed success with rechargeable trimmers.</li>
            <li> I can actually complete a full trim without the battery dying mid- stream.  </li>
            <li> Truthfully, out of all the others I wasted money on, this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After dropping the MB-300 more than a few times, I could no longer piece the trimmer together.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer leaves quite a few longer hairs sticking up, and if you want to make sure that all your hairs are even you have to go over your face</li>
            <li> I agree with one of the reviewers that it works better on long hair than short hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement, something that isn&#x27;t made for hair trimming and isn&#x27;t as narrow as most beard and mustache trimmers.</li>
            <li> This sucker is nice.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews on this and similar products and after a while the old adage that &amp;#34;you can&#x27;t please everybody&amp;#34; seems as true as ever.  </li>
            <li> I tried a couple different methods to see if I could &#x27;restore&#x27; the battery&#x27;s ability to hold a charge, but without success.  </li>
            <li> I looked and looked for a electric trimmer before finally settling on this Remington (which was in many ways similar to my old Norelco that is still being used by my son).  </li>
            <li> I made multiple passes without success.</li>
            <li> Normally I purchase Norelco products, but have always bought Remington trimmers.</li>
            <li> At first, I trimmed my whole face and neck down with the regular blade, which did a pretty good job of getting the hairs down pretty short.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for trimming around beard and also for taking down extra long stubble between extended shaves.</li>
            <li> Zero catching on my skin, it cuts right through my fairly thick facial hair with ease.</li>
            <li> May be fine for other users.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good trimmer and is powerful and sharp enough and should last a while.</li>
            <li> It is one of those cords that will eventually break right near the part tha plugs into the shaver if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charge a long time, great functionality &amp; good sharp cutting blades.</li>
            <li> Many of them don&#x27;t last very long and some don&#x27;t even work without the charger plugged in.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that traveling with multiple heads, the one that is not attached to the razor can be easily and irreparably damaged.  </li>
            <li> Only small complaint is it&#x27;s shape, but I&#x27;m getting better and more acclimated to it, we will be fine in time.</li>
            <li> My old Remington, that would no longer hold a charge, cost me much less and did a MUCH better job.</li>
            <li> And it has been far better than any purchased previously.</li>
            <li> So far, I have used it for 2 weeks on the first charge (using it every other day) and it is still running at full speed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;n the process of sending it back right now.</li>
            <li> With one right out of the box I&#x27;ve had to go over the same spot 40</li>
            <li> yes that&#x27;s right, one time which was months ago when initially purchased.  </li>
            <li> so you just simply roll a dial to get the right length</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is in its&#x27; initial 24-hour charge right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li> feels substantial in your hand, the three interchangeable blades are of a high quality and it cut through my year old beard with ease!</li>
            <li> The battery on this one is very good and the cutting is fairly good, however I am overall dissatisfied given that after only a year and a half the switch to turn the unit on and off has failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My complaint however has to do with the lack of a proper ABS or some sort of solid plastic holding tray for the cutter and the accessories instead of the card board thing that it came in and the fact that no blade lube was included in the package, that being said I would still recommend the trimmer to anyone that wants a great trimming/shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I really only use the basic tip and plastic guard, but it&#x27;s been good enough for my simple needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MB4040 has nine length settings which give users an excellent range, especially compared to trimmers that only allow one to choose between very short, medium and relatively thick lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is something that should be fairly simple: many of my battery operated devices have a visual representation of how much charge is left, so the technology is anything but new.  </li>
            <li> Shave worked fine for several months and all of a sudden just stopped working.  </li>
            <li> It feels like something is not snug enough to dampen that vibration, but I checked everything (on the blade, cause it only does it with just one of the blades) and it seems fine.</li>
            <li> well (note to self: use only the fine head for trimming, as the regular head can nick corners of nostrils).&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve become familiar with a wide variety of cutters and trimmers and suchlike.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is only about $30 though - but not sure it&#x27;s worth investigating a fix - or just buying a new, better one.    </li>
            <li> I got this model for a few reasons: 1) The adjustment wasn&#x27;t a cheap plastic guard, it uses Li-Ion batteries for long run-time and quick recharge and 3) it was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I&#x27;m now in the market for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d have to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> New Update</li>
            <li> issue: I live abroad and this is a 220 volt world out here.</li>
            <li> and they sent out a new one</li>
            <li> After three years it seems to be dulling a bit, so I just ordered two new blades online from Remington for $7.99 each.  </li>
            <li> As of this review I have used the new trimmer for about 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> So I decided it&#x27;s time; it&#x27;s time to replace it with a new</li>
            <li> Since I am out of return policy, it seems I am stuck with this and will have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Looking at the new model Norelco products side-by-side with this Remington, the price differential is noteworthy.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll just buy a new one of those instead.</li>
            <li> bought this new in september of 2014.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is no longer an issue and it is still working like it is brand new.  </li>
            <li> I come from New Zealand and ordered this shaver online.</li>
            <li> Like the new design too.</li>
            <li> The new ones do not have this feature which I sorely miss.</li>
            <li> looking for something new.</li>
            <li> When I decided to get a new one I got this one.</li>
            <li> Something in the design of the new head causes it to snag in medium length beards (5 on the dial).  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live with a beard without it.</li>
            <li> Received the new one two days ago.  </li>
            <li> length settings are really good, although when you choose the smaller ones it can be hard to follow the shape of your head and get an even trim.</li>
            <li> Even my grandchildren, ages 2 and 4, commented that my freshly trimmed short beard felt smoother after I trimmed it with the MB4040, a comment they never made after I&#x27;ve used other trimmers that leave my beard feeling \\&quot;scratchy.\\&quot; Using this trimmer results in a neat, clean, fine-grained trim with all the trimmed hairs even in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looked more like a very tightly trimmed beard.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t share, get your own.</li>
            <li> It does everything that did, but with better batteries and more cutting head options.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with two blades, one more wide for trimming stubble which is what I use it for and one smaller for intricate beard trimming.</li>
            <li> i freely admit, however, that i haven&#x27;t tried to figure out if there&#x27;s a way to do it or not--because i&#x27;m lazy that way ;-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a trimmer this way for many years, and never once have I nicked myself as frequently and predictably as I have while using this product.  </li>
            <li> When my last cheap one broke, I knew it was time to actually drop some money on a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Really, just a reiteration of what I wrote earlier in the year: hands-down, without question and undeniably the very finest beard trimmer that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Yes, I made the foolish mistake of using the standard blade directly on my skin and, yes, I had four distinct wounds and a bit of blood</li>
            <li> Yes, I made the foolish mistake of using the standard blade directly on my skin and, yes, I had four distinct wounds and a bit of blood</li>
            <li> It also charges very fast and the battery last for hours and hours</li>
            <li> only use the full size blade, so I can&#x27;t comment on the smaller blade, but the full size cuts adequately, requiring only the occasional second pass to catch a stray hair or two.  </li>
            <li> So, in the end I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and am going back to buy a new MB-200 instead, as I should have in the first place.</li>
            <li> The different blades interchange easily and I am amazed by how long the battery lasts.</li>
            <li> Its last a long time without being recharged and the blades are still going strong.</li>
            <li> And the guard pops off easily to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; or trim tight around your beard or goatee.  </li>
            <li> It proved less easy to clean, it didn&#x27;t trim nearly as well, as now (after using it for little more than half a year)</li>
            <li> If my past experience with the Remington brand still applies, I&#x27;m sure it will give me years of service.  </li>
            <li> My beard grows a lot faster than most, and I&#x27;m constantly trimming it every other day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a trimmer, it ether works or it does not so the review is pretty simple.</li>
            <li> I wear my beard pretty short and this trimmer has been nothing short of exactly what I wanted and needed.  </li>
            <li> but if I do, then I will come back and give it a higher rating.  </li>
            <li> i charged in back in mid June &amp; use it every 2-3days &amp; it still is on that original charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really interested to see when it will actually run out of power.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely recommend this product for anyone who are interested in this price range.</li>
            <li> A couple days ago (nearly exactly 1 year later)</li>
            <li> Went a week without shaving during a June trip to Yellowstone Park and for the first time, my facial hair came in gray.  </li>
            <li> I keep my beard pretty short.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only charged it twice; once when I first received it, and today (8-30-2013).</li>
            <li> I had a pretty big beard for No Shave November</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, use it everyday!</li>
            <li> &quot; problem some other people seem to be having; I just have to go over the same area 10 times to be reasonably sure it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Others I have used in the past would not hold a charge for more than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The first of these I received stopped working (charging) shortly after I received it.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve charged this once when I first got it and have used it literally for about 2 months on the same</li>
            <li> Buy this razor, and see how far the rabbit hole goes!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband because his other one finally died after many years.  </li>
            <li> I have had this razor about 2 months and have not had to charge it since the initial charge when I first received it.</li>
            <li> The different trimmer heads is a great idea, however I did make the mistake of using the wrong head to shave without the guard on to get really close to my skin.</li>
            <li> being said, I thought the stubble attachment was the way to go, only it ended up being a pretty close cut indeed</li>
            <li> I charged it on the first day I got it (December 25th) and it still doesn&#x27;t need a charge in mid February.  </li>
            <li> The Remington MB4040 is the first unit that both works well and is built to last.</li>
            <li> thing I should mention is, though it came with 3 trimming heads, I could not differentiate between the \\&quot;beard\\&quot; head and the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; head, both of them looked exactly the same to me.</li>
            <li> This was my first beard trimmer purchase, since I&#x27;ve only had a beard for a two months.  </li>
            <li> I had been trimming my beard with hair clippers at first, and finally decided to try something designed for beard trimming.  </li>
            <li> Even though I can&#x27;t get as specific with the guard length on them, they give an extremely consistent and even trim across my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The regular blades are much to heavy to use for gentle trimming like on top of my bald head.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he&#x27;s only really used it for a month now, but so far he really likes it</li>
            <li> I have been a avid regular razor user sense</li>
            <li> But for the present, I&#x27;m sticking with my Remington.t in the first go with the device.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for my personal grooming needs.</li>
            <li> I have not had this problem with any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned, including my original Remington shaver 14 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It actually cuts pretty close itself.</li>
            <li> With the Phillips I&#x27;d have to go over things several times, but this gets everything the first time.  </li>
            <li> Nice so far only had it for a few weeks ,battery charge an</li>
            <li> Well, they also, FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER, decided, \\&quot;Wow we need to redesign our new trimmer to show off the new fancy battery!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> MB4040 comes with three different trim cutters, a removable guard that can be adjusted to nine different depth levels, and a brush to clean hair out of all the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> Trim my entire beard if it&#x27;s been a week or so since my last clean shave, because the longer whiskers need to be pruned before using a DE blade, else they get stuck in the razor</li>
            <li> I just grew my facial hair back after years of being clean shaven.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to shave down to stubble level, and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and clean trims.</li>
            <li> The only thing I miss was my old trimmer had a 2nd set of smaller blades for better sculpting of the mustache.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new trimmer to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new trimmer and after considerable research, decided on the Remington MB4040.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Bought a new one, but took the old one apart and will be replacing the battery</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the new features this one offered.</li>
            <li> They promptly sent me a new one and asked me to return the old one via a prepaid mailing label.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this thing also trims everything down on the first swipe, unlike most other electric razors.</li>
            <li> I sometimes feel a pinch when hair trimmed down but very rare.</li>
            <li> So, I keep some stubble, never shaving smooth, never letting it long enough to be itchy.  </li>
            <li> The guard seems to bend really easily, so mabye I&#x27;m just unevenly applying pressure while trimming.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this trimer for my husband several months ago and he has had no problems with it at all, he likes the fact that is more powerful than his previous Remington and does hold a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Worked well initially, but after 10 months of light use the battery won&#x27;t recharge to full and doesn&#x27;t last long enough to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> One full charge will last months (with occasional use.)&lt;br /&gt;Nice cut.</li>
            <li> When the last died, I bought this because of the reviews and it supposedly would work while charging (versus needing a full charge to work like my last one).  </li>
            <li> I used a Remington trimmer before and this trimmer pretty much does what I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for a very old model of Remington beard and mustache trimmer, and it far surpasses my expectations.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the positive things I could say about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s supposed to be self-sharpening and the fact you don&#x27;t need to apply oil to it is a big plus.to get \\&quot;close enough.\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the positive things I could say about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s supposed to be self-sharpening and the fact you don&#x27;t need to apply oil to it is a big plus.</li>
            <li> You rarely have to charge this, extremely strong action, I have had this for going on two years and still going strong, can pinch at times when using in the groin area (balls) but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it comes with three different attachments is new for me, haven&#x27;t really used the others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Wahl for 5 years and the battery continues to recharge, hold a charge and work like new, so I consider it a real plus that the Remington MB4040 has the same type of battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has a lot of power, so be careful and take your time, took out a little chuck of the Hubs beard, fortunately it grows quickly.</li>
            <li> It simply does a better job at trimming, I have to go over less times and have fewer missed hairs.  </li>
            <li> The cutting blades are easy to switch out and the guard is easier to attach and more sturdy. .</li>
            <li> the adjusting of the clipper is fine, but when i press it to my face it bends, so you can get uneven cuts.</li>
            <li> This takes 3-4 times as long to trim my beard and is not near as efficient or as strong as my old wahl.</li>
            <li> The package was not hard to open, the unit is solid, not flimsy and it worked well right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer only for certain things:  for under my nose, fading into my hairline, and without the guard.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it, is that it has to be at a certain angle to not pull hair.</li>
            <li> The plastic attachments for actual beard trimming seem flimsy and are too large to let you get that two-day growth look.</li>
            <li> different blades plus a large guard.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> It would just stall in the middle of trimming if I turned it a certain way..</li>
            <li> in all, great when it lasts, but it&#x27;s not built well enough to last that long, and not easy to fix.  </li>
            <li> the result wasn&#x27;t accurate, but when I pushed a little bit it trimmed shorter.</li>
            <li> After a little over two years of just light use the battery will no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> After a little over a year of light use, it will no longer charge or work with the power supply.</li>
            <li> Consistent, comfortable and keeps a ridiculous charge.</li>
            <li> My last one (an older model Remington) died after about 2 years of normal use.</li>
            <li> You will be hard pressed to find a better trimmer at this price.</li>
            <li> The major downside to this is that if the bald spot is large enough I pretty much have to take the guard completely off and trim my facial hair to the shortest level to avoid a very uneven look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this pretty big issue, I was pretty excited about the new trimmer and the other features it has to offer.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and precise.easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with that but kept it because it has great battery life and mechanical reliability.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job at cutting and the clips that come with</li>
            <li> blade is sharper than I expected, it cuts extremely smoothly, and the motor is very quiet.</li>
            <li> This clips at least as fast an smoothly as the MB-200.  </li>
            <li> product is listed as having a &amp;#34;washable design&amp;#34;; however, the packaging clearly indicates that the mechanism itself should not come in contact with water.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;goatee\\&quot; which is clear that it&#x27;s an edging tool for trimming around a goatee.</li>
            <li> The instructions clearly state that it will not operate off AC power while plugged in.  </li>
            <li> After 6 weeks, the battery completely drained and is no longer taking a charge.</li>
            <li> Also, a complete charge lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised.  </li>
            <li> I am really surprised by the battery.</li>
            <li> This really is the only groomer that you need.</li>
            <li> I charged it completely when I received it and haven&#x27;t had to recharge yet</li>
            <li> Do not put these blades anywhere near your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the trimming extension on my electric shaver to shave my face because my skin is sensitive and breaks out/gets ingrown hairs if I shave with the foil or use a razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sported a beard since I was about 14 years old, and it&#x27;s become part of what people notice when they see me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband whose old trimmer bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> and I find I do not have to go over the same areas as much as I used to in order to get an even trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What really surprised me was the battery life.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Conair razor.  </li>
            <li> Works well so far.</li>
            <li> Loud a heck.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my worn out, old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer does do the job, but just not as well as my old Remington trimmer.  </li>
            <li> have a sensitive face</li>
            <li> I used it for nearly 6 months before I had to charge it</li>
            <li> It feels like a well built unit, and so far it&#x27;s holding charge well.</li>
            <li> Mine&#x27;s three years old, and</li>
            <li> For instance I have a goatee, so I pull of the guard, and use the blade alone directly against my skin to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; my face except for my goatee.  </li>
            <li> I started off using an old model of Remington&#x27;s trimmers (now discontinued, used batteries) and had to upgrade once the trimmer attachment broke.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially convinced it was a user error, I have tried to shave with the trimmer in every conceivable orientation, but it still pulls hair and nicks skin...</li>
            <li> Have had this 8 months, and so far it&#x27;s the bomb.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between the Remington MB4040 trimmer and my old one is</li>
            <li> Or perhaps it just feels like it does because my old one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge at all.</li>
            <li> This one uses lithium-ion cells instead of the nickel-cadmium (NiCad) cells my old trimmer had.</li>
            <li> This replaced an old Remington beard trimmer that I have had for 15+ years.  </li>
            <li> simply doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be interested to know how long the battery lasts.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace my old one that died.</li>
            <li> No problems thus far.</li>
            <li> Take the old MB-200/300 series and stick a lithium battery in it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very quiet, emitting a gentle hum.  </li>
            <li> skin is extremely sensitive to all forms of shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also my 16 year old&#x27;s preferred method.</li>
            <li> Easiest if  you go over the whole beard at the same setting.&lt;br /&gt;Setting</li>
            <li> and I have to finalize the edges with another old shaver or scissors.</li>
            <li> Very flexible for different types of styles.</li>
            <li> Go with another brand unless you need something cheap for a few months.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer provides a closer trim which is what I am used to.  </li>
            <li> and I drive a crappy old car.</li>
            <li> My old razor i always used without the guard to get the 5 oclock shadow...</li>
            <li> My old Norelco kicked the bucket</li>
            <li> Everything else is still working on the old one.</li>
            <li> I cannot make a professional review, since I am not a hairstylist.</li>
            <li> - Not aimed for a professional shave.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco beard and mustache trimmer pulled hairs a lot</li>
            <li> Does the job of both direct trimming and thinning with the attachments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Completely died after about nine months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write 1 star reviews, but it completely doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> And at least look into how to safely use and charge lithium ion batteries.</li>
            <li> and you have go over the same area multiple times, trying to go against the grain as much as possible to catch as many hairs as possible</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my 19 year old Remington MB30.    </li>
            <li> I may have to replace my old unit.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the hair goes absolutely everywhere.</li>
            <li> do not shave frequently, so</li>
            <li> I came from an old school Wahl</li>
            <li> But after pricing them I decided WTF?Why should I pay $100 for a Braun when it probably will not last much longer then</li>
            <li> Third, I&#x27;ve gotten very inconsistent trimming length all over my face.</li>
            <li> A year old</li>
            <li> but it’s just too early to tell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as battery life goes, I&#x27;ve never had a shaver quite like this.</li>
            <li> I bought the MB-4040 to replace my old MB-200.  </li>
            <li> This does a great job of trimming mustaches and beards, and the only thing I found lacking was a charging base - for some bizarre reason, it has no stand that you can put it in to charge it - it just lays on the counter.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son-in-law to replace his old one.</li>
            <li> Keeps me lookin classy for the ladies.</li>
            <li> My old unit is over a decade old and I have never been sliced by it.</li>
            <li> And stays charged alot loonger than my old one.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve had it for nearly 6 months now.</li>
            <li> Not a heavy beard either.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;action&#x27; or the way the blades move is smoother than others I&#x27;ve tried and I haven&#x27;t had any of the snagging problems that have happened with others.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a lithium, hoping the battery would be an improvement over old trimmers.</li>
            <li> I used it on his neck to trim his neck and found it to be very sharp and took little effort to get the back of his neck nice and pretty.</li>
            <li> is that it is a bit loud.  </li>
            <li> I cannot finish trimming my face before it completely</li>
            <li> /&gt;And if you are using to shave then don&#x27;t be surprised to see your face bleed.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want this trimmer to get anywhere close to any sensitive skin areas.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but honestly it&#x27;s starting to make me question if any of this is real.</li>
            <li> It certainly surprised me.</li>
            <li> I had to recharge the old one to finish my head.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old Remington that was not charging anymore.  </li>
            <li> its can not cut short hair very well ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like a straight razor or typical four blade shaver, so it gets its job done, but you still need to use an actual razor if you&#x27;re looking for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> The LiOn cells don&#x27;t get a &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; like the old batteries did.  </li>
            <li> My old one never held a charge like this one.  </li>
            <li> Received as a gift, replacing an MB40, that was a number of years old.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an old one that had just worn out.</li>
            <li> Was a replacement for an old nickel cadmium that lost it&#x27;s charge.  </li>
            <li> I have no problems with it so far and the fact that the blades are titanium is just a plus.</li>
            <li> Charges fast and last</li>
            <li> My old one lasted for about 2 or 3 uses and this one lasts for WEEKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like all the adjustable sizes although I don&#x27;t think they equate to a standard size like at the barbershop.</li>
            <li> Not so much as to give it a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; but certainly a solid &amp;#34;4&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> My old trimmer did that too</li>
            <li> use the stubble trimmer if going directly against the skin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m trying to get a replacement from Remington directly.</li>
            <li> The old remingtons had a rougher grip so the hand wouldn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Does not seem to cut as well as the old remingtons with the guard on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got about 5-6 uses on this thing so far.</li>
            <li> the battery was the selling point for me, my old one died while i was using it every time.</li>
            <li> I contacted Remington directly, and they sent me a replacement unit.</li>
            <li> have had this for 4 months so far.</li>
            <li> and overall his appearance is very well kept.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacment for my old Remington trimmer.  </li>
            <li> - I had a pervious trimmer that had a soft rubber type grip that trimmings stuck to like glue.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Norelco T990 with this Remington since Norelco doesn&#x27;t make that model anymore</li>
            <li> Replaced a 25 year old AA model with this.</li>
            <li> So far I have not had any problems with it.  </li>
            <li> My old Remington was dying, so I got this.</li>
            <li> I had an epic beard that needed to come off and these clippers chewed through it like a beaver in a pine forest.</li>
            <li> completely agree with the comment of Seth A. Zehler.</li>
            <li> Replacement for 10 year old Remington.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on using the beard blade directly on my face again.</li>
            <li> I really like several features of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> practical, lightness is part of this tool for any man, well done, fast charge, thin blade, precision possible through its practical form, it can be put anywhere in a kit or just store it on a shelf, it look nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few times these days when saving money on a product actually returned greater satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> A few days later, it was time for some more stubble trimming, and I decided to try the \\&quot;detail trimmer.\\</li>
            <li> Plus these batteries have more torque to keep the blades moving through thick hair without getting stuck and binding.  </li>
            <li> And for my thick hair, the stubble blade catches way more.  </li>
            <li> Had an MB200 which I loved, but sadly this is not the better-battery-life replacement for which I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Switched to this model from the Remington B200 after much good use but the battery failed eventually.  </li>
            <li> The think is high powered, long lasting battery, price is right, no complaints.  </li>
            <li> It takes me about 10mins now (using the closest full width head attachment with no guide attached), down from about 15 for my old one (although my old ones closest cut attachment was a 17mm</li>
            <li> Then I bought a  bargain rechargeable and just threw it away because on a full charge you could not finish a trim before the batteries run down.  </li>
            <li> the built-in length guide doesn&#x27;t really go down to a true stubble.  </li>
            <li> Amazing little trimmer - I had some other model from Target (Panasonic, I think), and the two I owned died after a year.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s my first one (I&#x27;m new to the world of beards), it works just as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I am a stubble-faced now, after 40-years of being the full-beard type, and I have to say that the slight beard is so much cooler in the hot summer months.</li>
            <li> I am a stubble-faced now, after 40-years of being the full-beard type, and I have to say that the slight beard is so much cooler in the hot summer months.</li>
            <li> even if it does look how many Remington&#x27;s I could buy compared to a more expensive foreign brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively easy to keep clean (see next paragraph) and is small enough to store in the medicine cabinet above the sink so it is ready for instant use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other trimmers i&#x27;ve had trim much better and faster, altho the cordless batteries last only through 1 trim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a well built enough razor, and though it can take several passes for a clean cut, it does the job aptly enough.</li>
            <li> This one is very adjustable and has two other heads to trim side burns and to get a very neat look on the mustache.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Design is small and compact, easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> to dial settings that lock: hubby says the nine settings are a bit much and can&#x27;t see that much difference between one level and the other.</li>
            <li> Previous shavers I&#x27;ve had never held a charge for a full month.  </li>
            <li> The main difference is that the MB4040 has a Li-Ion battery pack and these tend to last a LOT longer than the cheaper and more common Nickel Cadmium batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It recharges quickly and the battery seems to last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I only shave once per week, so I don&#x27;t bother to aim for a clean shave because that would be rough on my skin, and because I like the unshaven look.  </li>
            <li> (i dont have a thick beard, so it cuts fast and clean).</li>
            <li> one (for some reason) is all &#x27;decked out in shiny chrome and plastic&#x27; which actually makes the whole thing look much cheaper and shabby than the long design history of the MB trimmers (silver to black).&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer isn&#x27;t quite as fun to use as the other although it does have changeable heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another problem is that the shortest setting is not short enough for a true short stubble look.</li>
            <li> It worked fine afterwards but in less than 12 mos old it no longer holds a charge and operates for only a minute or two before dying.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to miss more hairs in a single pass than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> Without the attachments this works fine, but if you want to trim to a certain height using the attachments, you&#x27;ll have to work extra hard.</li>
            <li> I tried less pressure, more pressure, different hand holds, different angles, I even had my wife try to do it for me</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer almost everyday for clean up.  </li>
            <li> I had an older (and much cheaper) Remington, and it was not good at all, and a cheap plastic piece finally broke</li>
            <li> Overall, for the money it costs, you would be better off opting for one of Remington&#x27;s low cost models that do about the same sort of job and last about the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> I save a lot of time since it trims it the first time around without having to constantly go over the same area 3-4 times.</li>
            <li> Item was a replacement for an older model that had finally given up.</li>
            <li> + times to make it decent (plenty of stubborn hairs left).</li>
            <li> For the last 10 years, I&#x27;ve used a very simply designed Norelco trimmer with no complicated attachments.  </li>
            <li> The first lasted several years, but the non-replaceable rechargeable battery finally reached the end of its useable life.  </li>
            <li> i purchased this product months ago and have only had to charge it one time since it&#x27;s main charge when i purchased it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a decent facial trimmer in quite a while</li>
            <li> The charge lasts multiple trims, the heads offer versatility for the different areas to be trimmed and the adjustable head provides consistent length.  </li>
            <li> First, as others have described, the lowest guard setting is simply not short enough.</li>
            <li> Without the length attachment it works even better, although I do recommend changing the small hair head to the big one, since I felt I was trimming my skin</li>
            <li> I particularly like that it only has one piece and a dial/wheel for length adjustment.</li>
            <li> I got several deep cuts first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for decent trimmer from a while, finally I found this product.</li>
            <li> the holidays, I let my beard grow out longer than I usually do, I then proceeded to use this product to trim my beard at many different levels.  </li>
            <li> i guess any and all trimmers need to be moved over the face area several times - it&#x27;s not the issue of this particular trimmer.</li>
            <li> Other trimmers provide many attachments for other purposes.</li>
            <li> In fact the next day he went a little bit closer on the sides and the battery was just as strong as before.</li>
            <li> If you were to take your finger and press down on them with some light pressure they would bend and return to regular position upon release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t have any major complaints.</li>
            <li> Much stronger and holds a better charge that any other that I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li> It comes with a nice long charging cord but no stand to put the trimmer on and yet in the &amp;#34;warnings&amp;#34; it makes certain to tell you NOT to get it wet, especially while charging, so it&#x27;s expected that just placing it on the side of the bathroom counter is protection enough.</li>
            <li> The build quality is really high, and the three trimmer heads are really solid.</li>
            <li> It is quite thorough, it does not pull/pinch the hairs, and on a second run over the same area you can hear that there is minimal hair being removed, meaning many passes are not required (not like my last one).</li>
            <li> Two years later, and I still highly recommend buying this, and just read the instructions and follow them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended as a regular grooming tool.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a quick fix to my growing shaggy mess.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if they fixed the problem , but i suggest you do check it if you live outside the US .&lt;br /&gt;Recommended !</li>
            <li> I only use one as I like my beard a certain way, but the second razor was purchased for my father who&#x27;s been using the old razor &amp; cream for years.  </li>
            <li> I did like how it held a charge for a very long time, and I rarely had to charge it, but just recently, I went</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this little trimmer as it meets my daily facial trimming needs.</li>
            <li> The Remington trims accurately every time is easy to adjust, and&lt;br /&gt;changing cutting heads is a snap.</li>
            <li> It does more then I had expected, in fact, I used it for a slight buzz cut, which in one cut saved my $15.00 on going to the shop to get my hair cut.</li>
            <li> The blade heads are easily swapped (I don&#x27;t use the third narrow goatee</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands I&#x27;ve purchased throughout the years, this one actually holds a strong battery charge for an extended period of time, rather than either having to keep another plugged in or constantly having to recharge it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s precise,  sharp and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those guys that was born with a beard, can shave in the morning and have real stubble by the end of the day, so I gave up on shaving a long time ago and</li>
            <li> Depending on the time of year, a general dislike of shaving and having overly sensitive skin, I often sport a goatee or pseudo-beard.  </li>
            <li> took away one star for a small (but, to me, important) design glitch.  </li>
            <li> If you do the clipper teeth snag on your stubble, cut the skin and the bare metal faceplate heats up to nearly burning temperatures.</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t go too fast</li>
            <li> Really, the only drawback is that it has a lifespan of about two years (the same time span as the warranty), so you need to replace it that frequently.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it does not come with a stand, but he was able to use his old one to hold the trimmer even though it will not hold the attachments.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what I expected it to do.  </li>
            <li> I am still on the original charge, but use it only an average of 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> You can get a better cut around the mustache and nose area due to its size, but I may be going back to an electric and only using this for tiny trimming.</li>
            <li> I have read reviews that the head adjustment was flimsy and that there was not much difference from 0-9, not so, if used correctly it delivers exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> Fits my needs and was exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> I do realize that I have a heavy beard, but still it seems like it should be easier than having to go over the same spot 3-4 times to make sure that everything is at the same length</li>
            <li> Just be careful the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I love remington products and had been holding on to my old shaver long past when I should have for fear of not liking anything else.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and the battery certainly last a lot longer than my previous one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;cons: the adjustment feels a little cheap and that is what broke on my last one.</li>
            <li> If the latter were available, I&#x27;d not buy it due to what might be a relative cost issue.</li>
            <li> Instead of just replacing the battery pack, they redesigned the body of the trimmer, new shape, added crappy plastic chrome and such, but the problem is the guard was also changed.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t live upto even the basic standards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would have helped if I had a miniature &amp;#34;jaws of life&amp;#34; tool to open the packaging on this new product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem with the new model is that it snags my beard several times each shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In use, I did experience something that another reviewer mentioned: an occasional single hair that does not get trimmed and the high number of passes required to get consistent length over a specific area.</li>
            <li> The unit holds a charge very long and it really works well.  </li>
            <li> I use to use a hair clippers set, but it was too big and awkward, this is a great size.</li>
            <li> The blade is delicate and goes off track fairly easily when it&#x27;s out of the trimmer for cleaning, or I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> the charging light only stayed on for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fixed all of the complaints that I had about old model with nickel cadmium battery (low charge retention).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to lose at least one blade at some point in the future.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t go for the stubble look, I run the trimmer blades over my face directly instead of actually shaving since my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> It has a powerful motor that cuts thru thick beard fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it almost a year and use it everyday for a quick trim and haven&#x27;t had to charge it</li>
            <li> Decent amount of resistance when you are spinning it and it clicks with a nice slow, firm</li>
            <li> This cuts really well, and the battery lasts forever on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> I had the Phillips Norelco vacuum beard trimmer before but lost the chord and decided to try a new brand.</li>
            <li> # The fine head trims edges, neck and stubble more closely, and, being middle aged, it trims random ear and nose hairs</li>
            <li> major issue with this trimmer is it&#x27;s built with the durability of a five-dollar trimmer.  </li>
            <li> seven years ago I purchased almost the exact same trimmer, although it was silver in color and back then it had an internal chamber to hold hair.</li>
            <li> The unit looks pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li> thing holds its charge like no other.</li>
            <li> First, the shortest setting (1) is equivalent in length to the 2 or 3 setting on my other Remington trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Ni-cad batteries blow, so this is a major improvement.</li>
            <li> No other attachments come with it (like ears or nose attachments).</li>
            <li> This machine surely holds its charge for at least a month without recharging!</li>
            <li> the teeth on the bare trimmer are wide enough to make it useful for framing the cheek and neck lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But consistent with other products.  </li>
            <li> This is my first beard trimmer, so can&#x27;t compare to any other products.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m wondering if I want to pay another $8 for a replacement or try the other blades first.</li>
            <li> I love the attachment that stays on the unit, it makes it very hard to lose it.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no loud vacuum included, there&#x27;s no useless secondary trimmer to pop open randomly, and -- most importantly -- there&#x27;s no useless touch screen included in this model.  </li>
            <li> The curved design really helps for trimming, you can see what your cutting better in the mirror especially, as opposed to the straight design clippers.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge very well, the cutting blades move at fairly high speed, and it is powerful enough that it rarely pulls a hair.</li>
            <li> To be more clear, I don&#x27;t have a good view of what I am trimming, the braun cruzer 6 [ Face shaver model ] trimmer head is placed in a weird position that I have a difficult time seeing what I am going to trim.</li>
            <li> This little shaver works fine for trimming beards or sideburns and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> By the next day, she&#x27;s sending me a brand new one and a pre-paid shipping label to send back the old one.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the older unit&#x27;s battery stopped holding a charge a long time ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected that the representative would provide some suggestions, maybe a certain technique of holding the device or something I should do beforehand to prepare my face -- I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> We purchased this for the ion battery which is working fine so far - we&#x27;ve had it for less than a month, but my husband loves it&#x27;s power and sharp precision.</li>
            <li> I other wise would have a long and thick beard.</li>
            <li> Battery, and decent trimming will definitely get the job done until you come back home.</li>
            <li> If I push it up my neck toward my jaw, everything cuts fine, but if I try to make a second pass by pulling the blade down my face, it&#x27;s like some medieval torture device that only knows how to irritate my skin and make my eyes water.  </li>
            <li> there are some general guidelines to use when dealing with lithium ion batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> generally leave</li>
            <li> In general terms it does the job.</li>
            <li> in general I like this product.</li>
            <li> Until now I would buy cheap trimmers that I would have to replace at least once a year.</li>
            <li> Clearly though this should not be necessary.</li>
            <li> If your beard or mustache was long u wouldn&#x27;t notice much, but if it was short you would notice &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> works well and says charged a long time with the Lith Bat - cant really see a big dif in the change out heads</li>
            <li> the whole, however, the Remington MB4040 seems to me to be a solid performer that does the job it was designed to do and which should have a fairly long life.</li>
            <li> The last year and a half has been amazing for my face: that fine, feminine, sensitive skin has been replaced with a manly leather capable of tolerating the violent removal of hair over and over and over again with barely a wince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only wish Remington would make plastic combs out of sturdier material instead of flimsy clear plastic.</li>
            <li> I kept trimming my beard shorter and shorter after a week of leaving it long and found the trimmer worked very well at a short trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Charging and battery life are long lasting as he really took his time with his beard and had no problems with the battery.</li>
            <li> I wonder if they actually USED the trimmer when they developed it?</li>
            <li> It is a loud Norelco but came with different size combs that broke</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 1 of the 3 cutter heads so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 years old and have NEVER attempted growing any facial hair...</li>
            <li> I still have not answered that question myself and have switched back to the old school razor</li>
            <li> I set out in search of a simple trimmer and purchased the Remington MB4040 rechargeable trimmer, which looks somewhat like the old</li>
            <li> /&gt;Going back to my old trimmer, and I wont miss this Remington at all.</li>
            <li> Apparently where ever the &amp;#34;manufactured in PRC&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Barely ever have to charge it.</li>
            <li> Edging with the bare blade is no problem at all</li>
            <li> So if it was left unplugged, the battery would completely drain and it wouldn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s gotten to the point where after being left plugged in, the battery still drains after about 30 seconds running, making this thing completely useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how well it is made, when I look at the low</li>
            <li> It will nick you if you are not careful</li>
            <li> Recently purchased and so far holds a charge over three</li>
            <li> I then use the GOATEE TRIMMING BLADE TO SHAVE TO MY BARE SKIN, so I use the GOATEE Blade to shave my neck and the edge of my chin strap to keep it styled.</li>
            <li> Only suggestion would be a battery lite when it&#x27;s getting old....</li>
            <li> I ordered the Remington MB4040 Trimmer after my old trimmer (not Remington) finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.</li>
            <li> I am throwing this trimmer away and going back to my old one.</li>
            <li> Therefore I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments or anything, just the bare beard</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old trimmer, also a very similar Remington which had a battery that would no longer charge.</li>
            <li> I suppose that any one more expensive it should be sort of more delicate in every sense.</li>
            <li> Definitely sharper than my old Norelco; I even managed to get a couple nicks trimming my neckline.</li>
            <li> I had one of the old remingtons (Remington MB300DT/2 Titanium PrecisionPro) for almost 4 years and finally the guard height adjustment mechanism broke.</li>
            <li> After trimming my beard with the MB4040 people thought I had had my beard professionally trimmed, a comment I never got after using a different trimmer (</li>
            <li> Well \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; is apparently a thing now and some women expect it.  </li>
            <li> I had no trouble up until the last month or so.</li>
            <li> Mark the stubble blade because the only difference between it and the beard blade is how far apart the teeth are on the blade itself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34; blade on bare skin or you will end up nicked and bleeding.</li>
            <li> How many times have I got confused with that.</li>
            <li> NiCd cordless trimmers and razors tend to keep charging, while the Li-Ion trimmers/razors usually provide a full charge indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery may be better, but the cut is way worse.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how it would handle a full beard or head.  </li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s kind of useless.</li>
            <li> I have a rather full beard at the moment, but to keep it&#x27;s shape I only need to make a few passes with the correct setting.</li>
            <li> the only complaint i have, and it&#x27;s a very minor one, is that the trimming guard isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> You can feel the higher power in it than the previous one and also more so than other trimmers such as my previous norelco.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and the thing takes down my beard nicely.</li>
            <li> The thick plastic guard stays on the unit and there&#x27;s a handy wheel to click the height up and down.  </li>
            <li> As with my first trimmer, I suspect the trimmer can not be run using the electrical outlet if the battery is run down.  </li>
            <li> Maybe start longer and go down from there on the first day</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp for extremely accurate trimming so be careful.</li>
            <li> Only reason it&#x27;s 3 stars is because the shave is uneven, (flat cheek+ neck-hair cuts further from the skin than the curve on the jaw line) must go over the surface MANY times, especially at different angels to get an even look</li>
            <li> The battery holds up for a very long time and I actually put my charger up because it is not needed much.  </li>
            <li> This one is far better than other similar products that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and has no problem trimming a thick beard.</li>
            <li> After having a great experience with the previous model, I thought it would be a no-brainier to get the newer one with Lithium Ion batteries, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard and moustache with a pair of scissors, most times while still half asleep, sometimes resulting in an uneven trim.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong 3 weeks later after using it at least 4 or 5 times.</li>
            <li> Sucker sounds just as strong as the day I purchased though I only trim once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> The blade position is not very good for detailed trimming such as this.  </li>
            <li> I put less than a drop of oil on each of the three heads before using the first time.  </li>
            <li> It took me a little while to figure out how to work the trimmer correctly, but after a little bit of reading, and playing with it, I love it.  </li>
            <li> basically every couple days run the trimmer over my face, mow down the side burns and make sure the goatee isn&#x27;t getting too out of control, and this little trimmer does it all very well and hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of slowing down yet.</li>
            <li> Lastly, albeit the least of problems, the MB4040 is sold within the most annoying product packaging I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Picture a machete hacking through bamboo, then turn the sound down to an extremely reduced level.  </li>
            <li> You can remove the adjustable plastic guard to get a clean shave, but I only do that for small spots.  </li>
            <li> My battery failed, however it was great little trimmer while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I clean it using the brush supplied and store it in a ziplock (since I have it in a bathroom and prefer it not rust, a little rice pouch seems to keep it in a dry micro-environnment).</li>
            <li> The other types are much cheaper, but wear out often inside of a year.  </li>
            <li> Also It seems to be very sturdy but i have not had it long enough to say it will last or not</li>
            <li> My old Norelco trimmer had a flat bottom and a side charging port which I had gotten used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was a little leery about all the talk of not having to charge as much and was I ever surprised.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone who wants to keep that manly beard... or other areas trimmed...</li>
            <li> Not like some of the other brands where the whole thing just feels cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> The motor feels very strong and it can trim thick beards without bogging down.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is far better than any other trimmer I have ever owned or used, and I have probably bought at least half-dozen different trimmers throughout the years</li>
            <li> The last time I had a beard I trimmed it with a sharp shard of rock, so I have no past history with electric trimmers--no model to compare to the MB4040  which I bought for my new beard (7 weeks).</li>
            <li> So far it has consistently left a bald patch, the question is how big it&#x27;s going to be.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike my old Norelco, the Remington MB4040 is intended only to trim and groom facial hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my dad after his old one finally gave out after 10 years (different brand).</li>
            <li> was no where near short enough.  </li>
            <li> Used only once for complete, short haircut and longer, shaped beard trim.  </li>
            <li> only warning: I don&#x27;t think Remington means for you to use the beard blade directly on your face, only with the guard on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of the Remington MB line of trimmers over the past 10-years to groom my full beard.  </li>
            <li> All three blades work wonders on my facial hair, whether it&#x27;s a beard that&#x27;s been growing in for three months or a few days&#x27; worth of stubble.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few potential issues with this trimmer worth noting.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when switching from an older trimmer to this one.</li>
            <li> Trimmer\\&quot; is a convenient little trimmer that does exactly what I need it to.  </li>
            <li> Mine is not sharp enough.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to using the guide at first.</li>
            <li> ONLY wish I would have is for a vacuum stubble-catcher like my old trimmer had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The built in cutting depth adjustment feature works perfectly and the interchangeable cutting blades are clearly well crafted and do exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> But at least I have a slick battery-powered shaver whose batteries work perfectly months later and hold a charge for at least two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The main issue I have is that it randomly misses a dozen or so hairs scattered most noticeable around the upper lip, mouth edges and under the lower lip, even if I go over areas multiple times from different angles.</li>
            <li> After 40 minutes of using the computer sounded very hard and strong vibrated.</li>
            <li> Even after spending a long time trimming, my beard often comes out very spotty, with low spots and long spots.</li>
            <li> I will leave it at the setting in the future and pick up an stray hairs with a comb and the bare razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Remington I&#x27;d had for far too long.</li>
            <li> Makes me wish I had retired my old trimmer long ago.</li>
            <li> When i plugged it into the wall socket with adapter it would not charge, it blew a fuse in the charger which is apparently a way different voltage.</li>
            <li> One of the trimmer parts broke within the first few weeks of buying this product, I think from it being dropped on the floor.</li>
            <li> So for the first few times I used this product I would get cut trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> Product works well but is missing a couple of &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; of higher priced products.  </li>
            <li> Numerous passes over the same area are required, and even then, a few stray whiskers will just sit there and laugh at you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I could have given this a four, or even a five star review, but after almost exactly one year of use, the battery is almost completely dead.</li>
            <li> it even cost less than those being sold at WM super center.</li>
            <li> I bought this only two months ago, and I&#x27;m already having major issues with the motor not starting.  </li>
            <li> It does not loose strength and pull hair as another brand did that I recently tried.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp, so be gentle.</li>
            <li> It was very sharp though, and really cut things.</li>
            <li> The other parts aren&#x27;t as much as attachments as different replacement blades which offer different levels of closeness/size.</li>
            <li> QG3360/42 Multigroom Plus]], as my old trimmer was a Philips and had performed very well for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I had as much of an issue with my previous trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I did not subtract any stars in my rating because it does give a very close shave, has a lithium battery, and is less than $35.</li>
            <li> Its closest length is far too long for a real, short stubble cut.</li>
            <li> others have said, when you shave with the bare blade only use the stubble blade for that..if you use the larger blade you could cut yourself..</li>
            <li> and I have a thick beard that needs a better than average cutter.  </li>
            <li> Nice design but not worth the money because of the poor battery technology</li>
            <li> great for trimming beard, cutting down to goatee or mustache, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a single nick from the old</li>
            <li> Works well but is a little large for beard trimming</li>
            <li> Just not long ago I was getting fed up with the razors, Lather, Shave, and possible accidental nicks.</li>
            <li> The Remington comb stays firmly in place and has no weird fragile pieces likely to break.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve had models like this that can barely last a few minutes, so this is a refreshing change.</li>
            <li> On the Remington website they offer a 60 day warranty, so they clearly know their products will not last very long.</li>
            <li> The dial to adjust the guard length is sturdy, so you&#x27;re less likely to accidentally trim your beard much shorter than you intend.  </li>
            <li> Only down fall is there is to much plastic and not enough metal.</li>
            <li> But this thing builds up so quickly that I had to go over my hair three days in a row to make sure I didn&#x27;t look like an idiot.</li>
            <li> I have probably owned eight or ten beard trimmers over the past thirty years but this one is heads above all of the others and considering its modest $30.00 price represents a real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> only thing that I&#x27;m not sure about is if you can know when the battery is completely recharged, although I didn&#x27;t really read the manual so this could be a personal problem.</li>
            <li> This shaver does not slow down even when I try to make it down and push it fast.</li>
            <li> my list.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are very sharp, but don&#x27;t nick/cut my skin like my old ones did (maybe the old ones cut a tiny bit</li>
            <li> like that the comb attachment catches a lot of the hair trimmings, so I have less of a mess to clean up after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice even trim above lip virtually impossible for me to achieve so far.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not exceptional either.</li>
            <li> This thing works real well, you can shave and it has little snag on hairs.  </li>
            <li> I was a little leary of the plastic piece that is used to adjust the length, but it works very well, and the length setting holds</li>
            <li> The whole thing is just one unit, and there is little need to fiddle with separate pieces unless you want to change the blade head.  </li>
            <li> $40 a year seems a little much for me.</li>
            <li> He mainly uses it to trim down his whiskers without having to shave.</li>
            <li> I never write Amazon reviews, but I feel I&#x27;m obligated to let everyone know so that they do not buy this trimmer despite the high average rating for this</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last a long long time I have only charged it once and used it about 15 times so far!</li>
            <li> The blade swap is way better than having that horrible pop up fine trimmer in the old one&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get the hang of the various blades and the adjustable comb but follow the instructions and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Trims neatly and precisely, and even tough enough to handle my son&#x27;s trucker gnarly beard.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews good &amp; bad.  </li>
            <li> This one is slightly larger, which is both good and bad.</li>
            <li> My only feature wish would be that it had a vacuum</li>
            <li> He has used other Remington trimmer products, and they have all lasted a long time and been high quality.</li>
            <li> The adjustable guard keeps too much beard away from the blades, requiring 2x to 3x as long to trim as my previous Wahl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used probably a half dozen electric razors throughout my life, and this is the only one that has ever made me bleed like I was using a normal razor.</li>
            <li> Too bad the various heads from the old one don&#x27;t fit the new!</li>
            <li> This razor appears to be good quality with a sharp blade, but it still feels like it occasionally pulls the hairs rather than cutting them.</li>
            <li> well since I got married a few years ago--my hobby has become a bit limited.  </li>
            <li> it does not catch skin in between like I have experienced (painfully) with other trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I have only had it one week, so I can not comment on the battery other than that it is holding a charge well so far.</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to the settings of the guard, as I normally trimmed on a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; with my previous trimmers</li>
            <li> I had that panasonic vacuum one.  </li>
            <li> I use a Phillips Norelco (the vacuum type) for the rest which is 95% of my face.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum cleaner works 95%!</li>
            <li> , if you don&#x27;t use the skin guard, the clipper teeth often catch on my skin/hair/any little bump on my face, particularly when shaving the neck area.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard I use this to groom and clean up.</li>
            <li> I recommend passing on the Lithium Ion version of the Remington and just get the other models with the old battery</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the gap in trim levels between the lowest level with the guard on, and the bare blade trim, is too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it three times in the past two weeks, but the first time was on my beard that hadn&#x27;t been trimmed in over four months (long story there) and, after getting rid of all that rubbish, actually getting some shape into what was remaining and using the bare blade to get rid of the stubble so that I could partially shave a bit of my neck and cheek</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s truly lasting forever or maybe the fact that I dread using it so it just lasts that much longer from lack of usage.</li>
            <li> This product fails pretty much on all three of these counts, for me.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not really anything between barely stubble to short beard.</li>
            <li> I threw it away July 23rd (8.5 months later)  because the battery would not hold a charge long enough for me to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> But.....6 months later, it will not hold a charge long enough to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> The only comfort-related gripe, which overall ranks fairly minor, is the positioning of the on/off switch.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Remington model I&#x27;ve had for a few years.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going on a short trip just give this trimmer a full charge and leave your charger behind.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the trim is average at best, the power is down right bad, significantly worse than wahl products 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> Took the unit apart and discovered that it worked perfectly fine when the the cover was not on, the cover switch does not perfectly line up with or maneuver the actual switch that is internal to the shaver.  </li>
            <li> The product seemed well built, had very sharp blades, was quiet and had plenty of battery to complete a trim.  </li>
            <li> 3) the main blade works well on my beard, and 4) I suspect that the blades will last longer since I&#x27;m using 3 blades, where in the past I only had one blade to do all the work.  </li>
            <li> I was slightly turned off by some of the negative reviews of this product, but after reading a bunch of reviews on many other trimmers I decided to chance it, and order this one.  </li>
            <li> Replaced it with a norelco, more expensive but it hasn&#x27;t yanked a single hair yet.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to write, the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t take much a charge or the blades wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The battery lasted just long enough</li>
            <li> Now a person may think that two years is long enough but not when you consider the specifics.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to comment on battery life.</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big, and the lowest setting still leaves my beard too long.</li>
            <li> but I have not owned it long enough to rate durability</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate how long it holds a charge--great for traveling purposes.</li>
            <li> This unit has a power motor and long lasting charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not apparent, but you can get a lot of hair caught between the clipper head and the handheld part.</li>
            <li> It has all the features I was looking for including a long lasting charge.  </li>
            <li> Not too long, not too short.  </li>
            <li> plastic removable trimmer head is going to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I know its the charger as can charge on my flat mates no prob.</li>
            <li> I has the non-lithium version before, but the battery did not last long at all.</li>
            <li> No longer holding a charge long enough to fully trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The charges do last a long time, I use it two - three times a week.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time and I have used it for several weeks - 1 -2 times per week- without having to recharge.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say how long it will last</li>
            <li> My beard length is about 1/4&amp;#34; long and keeps it trimmed properly.</li>
            <li> the guard on #1 is too long, so I remove the guard and just use the stubble attachment (blade) and that is TOO short IMHO.  </li>
            <li> but I can tell the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with what I know last a long time for my money.</li>
            <li> I always end up with patches of disproportionately long hairs even after multiple passes.</li>
            <li> I thought that the Lithium battery would hold up under long term storage I would purchase another one as a backup trimmer for use when this one no longer operates properly.</li>
            <li> The lithium battery keeps a charge for such a long time, not messing with a corded trimmer is the way to go for anyone.</li>
            <li> In about 4 months the trimmer would not run long enough to finish trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li> flat</li>
            <li> Seems to last a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> The tone of this one suggests the internals are precision built and that they will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> look forward to the Remington lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> A flat bottom or a stand would be a help.</li>
            <li> I was replacing my Phillips Norelco T980 due to durability issues, so I was looking for a tough trimmer that was easy to use and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had trouble changing heads, you just have to take the time to do it correctly, which is not hard.</li>
            <li> Width of device makes fine trimming difficult, even with the smaller trimming blade</li>
            <li> I got it after my old Philips got too worn down to use.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and the guard is required when shaving around sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s hoping that this is my last trimmer for a long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The problem is the guard; the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; at the tip of of the guard are sharp enough that they actually dig INTO your hair follicle underneath an untrimmed hair, and when this happens, the oscillating blade inevitably meets your skin and blood starts pooling at the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only problem with the trimmer is that if you want to trim the hairs on the back of your neck, it&#x27;s somewhat sharp on the neck, leaving red marks.</li>
            <li> I am extra careful (probably due to the comments I read), but so far, so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just feels like a waste to discard something that just needs a new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I only use it once a week, but the battery holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It has lots of power, and the battery last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Seems to last a very long time on one charge.</li>
            <li> Thus far it has held a charge way longer than my previous trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Battery sucks, does not even last a whole shave.</li>
            <li> The smaller blade that is include is also awkward to use for many applications.  </li>
            <li> You have to be a tad bit careful directly against the skin, but not very.  </li>
            <li> My old razor would die out after a few minutes and needed to be charged constantly.</li>
            <li> last forever on a single charge.</li>
            <li> the battery life, I did use this beard trimmer multiple times without having to do a single recharge, so I have zero complaints on the battery life.</li>
            <li> This trimmer comes with several cutting heads, but so far I&#x27;ve found the largest one to be sharp and accurate enough to do everything I ask of it.  </li>
            <li> It is a little hard to clean all the hair out from under the head because it adheres to the lube oil.</li>
            <li> Sharp and apparently has been reliable for me unlike others.</li>
            <li> have given it 5 stars but my old Remington, and I do mean old, had a feature that vaccumed the cut whiskers into a holding pocket built into the unit which captured 99% of the clippings.</li>
            <li> The blades need no oiling and the battery last a long, long, long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull hair at all even though my beard was thick enough to house a family of gnomes by the time I used it, and the beard guide is slick.</li>
            <li> Needed a new trimmer for my relatively small amount of facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I get a bit less than full power for about 20 seconds, and then it slowly fades for another 40 seconds or so, then it quits.</li>
            <li> This is the facial hair trimmer -and possibly other, non-facial hair trimmer, that would be entirely up to you-</li>
            <li> A little too loud</li>
            <li> but I purchased this a little over a year ago and it has completely died.  </li>
            <li> The stubble blade has much finer teeth, but oddly shaves to about a two day/ slightly longer cut.  </li>
            <li> It is not water proof and you are discouraged to clean it under water, but I have done it several times (since it&#x27;s not that expensive if I have to replace it)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t vacuum the cut hairs like my other (double the cost)</li>
            <li> I got tired of my other brand not lasting than a few more months, so I tried a remington.  </li>
            <li> i really like the interchangeable heads to trim close up and in hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> that only half worked.&lt;br /&gt;the new with no collection chamber the whiskers just fall down into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Starting with the mustache, I had a few hairs that were a little too long, so I gently touched the trimmer head to the hairs, and OUCH, there was blood and pain.</li>
            <li> I RESEARCHED A LOT BEFORE BUYING ONE AS I HAVE BEEN CUTTING BUSSING MY HAIR FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS ..</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay much attention to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> This model has more cutting heads</li>
            <li> am I taking this much time to write a negative review?</li>
            <li> what bothers me the most is trying to trim the moustache area without cutting myself.</li>
            <li> Another thing that is unfortunate is that after reading a wealth of reviews on Amazon about available trimmers from the likes of Remington, Wahl and Panasonic, none of them got glowing reviews across the board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I have used trimmers like these in the past and, for the most part, most of them: 1) Require you to oil the blades, which is messy and annoying and 2)</li>

            <li> It lasted for so long I saw no reason to try another brand and hubby concurs.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a five for getting the job done and a long battery life.  </li>
            <li> This thing has a battery that lasts for an incredibly long amount of time.</li>
            <li> On the plus side it does hold a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> and the fact it holds a long charge.</li>

            <li> which is the shortest - which I still consider a tad too long.</li>

            <li> We will see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> , If your beard or mustache was long it would do the job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver has an amazingly long battery life.</li>
            <li> Have used it 3 or 4 times now, still haven&#x27;t charged it since the 1st long one when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Long battery life.  </li>
            <li> how long that</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with three different types of blades for different types of trimming, which change in only a few seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have a couple of minor issues with the Remington MB4040:&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can go a long time between charges and it feels like it has a ton of power.  </li>
            <li> charging, and long life of charge&lt;br /&gt;Great cuts, when set at shorter lengths&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> I will only be using the one blade so it is not really an issue for me</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time and it may work well to trim beards.  </li>
            <li> In any case I have used this over a month and will attempt to return it to Remington as I believe I have used it too long to return to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Maintains charge for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li> With the long time run of 120 minutes it is just what I needed in a trimmer.</li>
            <li> The charge holds for a long time</li>
            <li> Adjustable, Re-chargeable and lasts a long time on a charge.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have ham fists or mental impairments that keep me from opening them properly.</li>
            <li> Hold a long charge.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has lots of Power, and the charge lasts a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> they are way too long.</li>
            <li> It is a minor issue, that is why I am not rating 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This trimmer lasts so long that I sometimes even forget that it needs to be charged at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, back into the box and off to the Amazon returns center it went.</li>
            <li> Its either long stubble or nothing.</li>
            <li> long battery lasting.&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li> I can go a long time before recharging.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;so long that i lost the charger and now have to find one online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charges fully in 3 hours and battery lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> The charge also holds up for a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as you let it discharge once in a while</li>
            <li> lithium ion battery keeps the battery charged for a long time, without loss of power when unused.  </li>
            <li> , you have to be careful not to keep it on the default and very low setting</li>
            <li> Even getting it in from the factory, I went for a long time without having to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially I just used the trimmer to keep a long beard well trimmed.  </li>
            <li> I just hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Seems to hold a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> We shall see how long the battery lasts.  </li>
            <li> this one works for a long time with no perceived reduction in power or cut quality.</li>
            <li> warning: the three detachable heads can be taken apart for cleaning or resharpening but they are much harder to get back together than to take apart.  </li>
            <li> My old shaver couldn&#x27;t even make it a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have yet to have to charge this...lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I purchased it a long time ago but am just now writing the review.</li>
            <li> The Remington tries to do this but the shortest length is still a tad too long for what I like and without the guard on (just using the blade) is too short</li>
            <li> I do have to go over it a few times to really get it all trimmed down correctly, maybe that&#x27;s just me though.</li>
            <li> Some of the hairs were short, and are gone, some isn&#x27;t equal in height to other hairs!</li>
            <li> You can pull the adjustable comb off easily to change the cutting head if you wish... which is also simple to do.  </li>
            <li> I took it on a month long vacation last summer, used it every other day,</li>
            <li> The battery lasts quite a long time on a single charge though.</li>
            <li> Long battery life after single charge.</li>
            <li> This is a very clean cutting trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have an extremely long battery life!</li>
            <li> , it is sharp enough for trimming.</li>
            <li> And forget about trimming up your junk hair, I was way to terrified to cut the seam and bleed out only to have the ambulance guys find me on the floor holding my gnarled sac in one hand and a death tool in the other.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a terrific trimmer.</li>
            <li> Remington markets this as a beard trimmer, but my experience has been that it can be used for any type of body hair: beard, mustache, head, or other personal area.</li>
            <li> Remington markets this as a beard trimmer, but my experience has been that it can be used for any type of body hair: beard, mustache, head, or other personal area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would definitely buy again if this one ever wears out OR as gifts for other guys in the family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trimming other body hair, like the back of my neck, etc (close shave;</li>
            <li> Only thing is this thing is sharp which shouldn&#x27;t be a shocker</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong!</li>
            <li> I know in other reviews there were concerns about the total life of the battery.  </li>
            <li> It does not include any type of storage for the extra blade heads, so I ended up throwing the other blades into a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only other two I&#x27;ve owned were a Norelco and a Wahl.</li>
            <li> my other trimmers had multiple heads and plastic length attachments.</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t go 5 stars is because I lack a lot of experience with other brands.</li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve tried switching to one of the other blades that it comes with and since then I haven&#x27;t had a problem.</li>
            <li> I actually use this on my little Lakeland Terrier who need constant close trimming around her eyes.  </li>
            <li> The depth guard is not as stiff as I would like, but after using it a few times it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;The only con with this trimmer is that I wish it had a vacuum hair catcher like my old Wahl.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from the $20 range trimmers which get dull with my thick facial hair too quickly.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it very long</li>
            <li> The battery life lasts for a VERY long time.  </li>
            <li> Does not keep a charge very long at all.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a very long battery life.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you&#x27;re trimming a very long, curly beard, and you get a hair wrapped around the spacer teeth?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this line of Remington MB trimmers (I like the scroll to change clipping length - prevents accidental switching and a very strange shave stroke on your head/</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Very long and reliable charge holding.&lt;br /&gt;Feels sturdy and</li>
            <li> Holds a charge a very long time.</li>
            <li> bad thing is, I discovered about 3 teeth on the stubble blade broke off, and I only use this thing once a week at most.</li>
            <li> But always let it dry out before reassembling and storing it, so</li>
            <li> I have purchased a wide range of shavers/trimmers from expensive Phillips and Braun to as cheap and disposable as Wahl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This guard on this Remington misses a few hairs because it is not perfect at sending them up to be cut, but you do the area over, and over once more, and it works.</li>
            <li> or else I would have short dark hair with long gray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having to use 2 different trimmers sucks, but neither do the job completely (anymore).  </li>
            <li> There are also a few different heads to the trimmer for different looks and styles.</li>
            <li> I tried for about 30 minutes to put it back together, suffering a few scratches and cuts on my fingers, and then I finally gave up.  </li>
            <li> Less then 1 year old and will run for only a few minutes</li>
            <li> After that, I only charge it when it is dead or very low, and that seems to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I have gone through several trimmers over the last few years and none have been satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This makes it very difficult to do more than minor trimming.</li>
            <li> But the last few weeks it has gotten weaker and weaker before finally refusing to charge at all.</li>
            <li> When you open the box, the first impression is that the item has been previously opened and then re-packaged with the inside packaging sloppily stapled back together.</li>
            <li> This new Remington took twice as long to trim my beard evenly, and wouldn&#x27;t hardly do my head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Forty years ago when I first became serious about growing a beard, I don&#x27;t believe that there existed anything like a &amp;quot;beard trimmer&amp;quot; – I just used a comb and sharp barber&#x27;s shears.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my old trimmer required a small amount of pressure to get a complete cut when trimming my neck.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product who has thick beard like me.</li>
            <li> I mean everybody thinks I am a total stud (an old one) now that I have been using this.</li>
            <li> such that you can&#x27;t figure out how to open it up and fix any issue you get, so it&#x27;s not easy to fix it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very poorly made and not at all user friendly.</li>
            <li> priorities are: as close a trim as possible; high power motor for speed and ease; no cuts, pulling hairs or other irritating events (this is also related to motor power).</li>
            <li> had an old rimington lasted me way past 2year warrenty period</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra $ paid for the shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to a nick or two when shaving with a blade, but the pain this groomer causes and the multiple blood letting blobs you&#x27;ll have after using it, well, it&#x27;s just not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While for me the product didn&#x27;t meet minimum standards, the customer service was way above average.  </li>
            <li> So far, no more charges needed, and I&#x27;ve used it weekly just to keep things in shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, no more charges needed, and I&#x27;ve used it weekly just to keep things in shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you cant avoid applying at least some pressure in order trim normally.</li>
            <li> short, it&#x27;s a slick device, feels like a quality device, and hopefully will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with its performance and because I travel a lot not having a charging base</li>
            <li> Had a nice Wahl trimmer and it dies :-(.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty poor trim.</li>
            <li> Unless you have a beard that stands straight up, the thickness of the plastic basically pushes your hair down so that it only trims half the hairs each time, very uneven</li>
            <li> I still have to do a lot of trimming with scissors to get everything looking neat, but it gets all the facial hair down to the length that I want quicker than scissors and a comb.</li>
            <li> Only down side I have found is when I push it to my face to get a cleaner cut it pulls on my hair at time.</li>
            <li> I have it all the way down on the closest setting, which isn&#x27;t close enough.</li>
            <li> But I may have to pass it down to the next generation and to my children&#x27;s&#x27; children before this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I remove the comb attachment and buzz it back down to make shaving easier.</li>
            <li> The Rimington has a zoom wheel which raises the plastic beard attachment up or down to 9 different settings.</li>
            <li> I keep my beard trimmed down to the lowest level possible with the guard installed</li>
            <li> , I narrowed it down to a Norelco that starts as low as .5mm and the Conair iStubble.</li>
            <li> I finally charged it after about 5 haircuts, as I felt it was time, but not because it was showing any signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li> Adjusting the cutting head to the desired length is easy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and a half, and even though it&#x27;s plugged into the wall, its power will only last for about half the time it takes me to give my beard its weekly trim.  </li>
            <li> I switched to using the &amp;#34;scruff&amp;#34; trimming head, and that seems to pull less because the teeth extend across the entire front of the head and minimize the gaps between the guard and the head that pulls the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a step above the previous 4040 model I have used for years.</li>
            <li> And the price is only slightly more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I bought this trimmer I was using just typical cheaper trimmers that I&#x27;d pick up at my local target.</li>
            <li> I have to go over my face several times, unlike a previous Panasonic machine.</li>
            <li> It sounds less than my earlier trimmer which was Wahl.  </li>
            <li> The power switch is lower-profile than on the MB-200, so it&#x27;s less likely to turn itself on and drain the battery if you pack it in your luggage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery life is definitely longer than its predecessor, but WHY ON EARTH did they change the blade guard from their previous model?</li>
            <li> Only giving it 4 stars because this sucker cuts your damn skin if your not careful.</li>
            <li> $15 is exactly half of the cost that I paid initially for the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li> No lithium battery should ever fail so quickly, Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a month and a half ago after my old dependable gave up.</li>
            <li> I inadvertently disassembled the underside of one of the blades and found it difficult to get the clips high enough to put things back together.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews for other products should have fancy things like vacuum to suck away the trimmings, and water proof so you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The beard trimmer length options are extremely skewed toward long beards.</li>
            <li> and it cleaned up the mess left by this trimmer with zero hassle.</li>
            <li> The battery was already charged when delivered and like other people have said, it lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have given it five stars, but still waiting to see how long it stays sharp and holds up.</li>
            <li> Most men have larger hands and some trimmers are too small and are awkward for men to us.  </li>
            <li> Once you charge this it works for a really long time, countless beard trimmings, at least several dozen.  </li>
            <li> - Edging the mustache is NOT precise if your mustache is not long.</li>
            <li> But it was limited to only a few blade guard lengths, and one of them broke a tooth off....</li>
            <li> In fact, I have never had the battery go dead since my purchase on July 26, 2013, even after multiple trims on a single charge.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want a noisy vacuum attachment, so I knew I would have to deal with a mess after trimming.  </li>
            <li> This is not a good trimmer, but it&#x27;s decent.  </li>
            <li> that are deep enough to hold the base with the trimmer standing up, making it easy to keep all the parts together without keeping it on the counter or a shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little finicky regarding angles and such, but nothing to get upset about.</li>
            <li> Now I am just upset I didn&#x27;t spend a little extra to get another brand.</li>
            <li> This little guy has been running on the same charge for over three months.</li>
            <li> i have to run over my face with the attachment off to get a short cut, i wish i could cut a little shorter with the attachment, but</li>
            <li> But with a little patience, they do go back together so,</li>
            <li> complaint about inability of low cut still remains and plastic comb is not steady enough - it bends as u push trimmer against the face.</li>
            <li> The other problem is that after coming out with a 220V compatible charger on my previous Remington trimmer charger, this Li-Ion version has reverted to a 110V only.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the manufacturers fault for creating idiotic packaging that would cause significant damage to necessary parts just by opening the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad I lost the charger and attachments, I&#x27;ll buy another one though since I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> edges of the cutting head are smooth and don&#x27;t irritate if pressed along the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap plastic and constantly pulls on my hairs, giving me an annoyingly painful experience.</li>
            <li> It makes my beard look so ugly as many hair stick out after a trim.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the trimmer heads can and do occasionally pull on hairs.</li>
            <li> At least the height adjustment works, but I wanted to replace the old trimmer, not keep using it for close trimmings and this one for adjustable trimmings.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is having to switch heads for different cuts.</li>
            <li> length dial is slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really irritating when I start to get ready for work or a night out, and my trimmer dies before the job is done.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week and only had to charge it twice since I bought it December of 2012, 1-year this month.</li>
            <li> I think I could give myself a military buzz cut with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For even the harder spots, I go over my face 2-3 times to get my beard trimmed as I want.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer has ceased working after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful trimming neck hair without the blade guard.</li>
            <li> Spent time researching.</li>
            <li> it feels like an arm could break off if you are too rough or drop</li>
            <li> It has a solid, sturdy feel to it without being to heavy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a closer stubble cut, but this is not really that close (as it says you need to use the guide).</li>
            <li> The only reason I did end up charging it was because I was headed to Europe for a few weeks and didn&#x27;t want it to die on me in the middle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product a few times a week and have for months and only have had to charge it twice</li>
            <li> + times before needing a recharge, at roughly 5-10 minutes per use.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Cuts uneven on facial hair</li>
            <li> after spending some time reading the low reviews I want to add a few things.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No, really.  </li>
            <li> Be careful be careful what setting this item is on otherwise thank you</li>
            <li> This trimmer has worked exactly as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, &amp; works as expected.</li>
            <li> Adverb fully charged, battery hold enough charge for me to trim my beard once every few weeks without needing a recharge for months.</li>
            <li> They last a few years usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, sometimes I have to go over the same area a few times.</li>
            <li> Then within about 2 months I noticed battery life was slipping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the trimmer for a few weeks,</li>
            <li> I could tell after a few uses that this motor was solid.</li>
            <li> A &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; up to a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; setting is not much of a difference at all.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I received a response roughly equivalent to &amp;#34;Yeah, those blades are sharp!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used it only a few times</li>
            <li> The plastic beard guard is of a very low quality and tends to bend when I use it, leaving a somewhat uneven trim.</li>
            <li> On the Remington, there is room between teeth to allow rogue hairs to remain partially coiled or angled away from the meshing blades.</li>
            <li> Gets the rough to reach spots.</li>
            <li> I recently started to grow beard but wanted to trim it for that &amp;#34;Cool&amp;#34; look of a few days of stubble.</li>
            <li> Everything works as expected.</li>
            <li> Starting from the longest setting and moving in, I never felt I was going to destroy my mustache.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor broke within only a few months.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no problems changing blades, using the removable comb, or charging the unit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;and be careful when the guide is absent..</li>
            <li> After it is fully charged, it only lasts a few minutes.</li>
            <li> A few days later, I re-shaved with the &amp;#34;stubble trimmer&amp;#34; blade and had no problem.</li>
            <li> He was tired of keeping up with the different combs that his old one had</li>
            <li> this trimmer doesn&#x27;t have a vacuum feature that sucks the hair trimmings into an internal chamber that can be emptied when I&#x27;m done trimming.</li>
            <li> I found that the stubble blade and regular blade are both a little sharp, but that may just be me getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> few months ago got a Philips Norelco which has a vacuum cleaner built into its trimming head.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with the vacuum feature of my previous trimmer and wanted to try something different, so I gave in to the 4.5 stars for this product, my first Remington product ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to get a decent 1mm beard length.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it the Cadillac  of trimmers, but it&#x27;s certainly no Yugo either.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to buy another Remington, however this one failed me right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough.</li>
            <li> The charger is not strong enough to run the clippers without a charge.</li>
            <li> Figured it would be like every other shaver and barely last a few days.  </li>
            <li> I worked as expected, not much to say other than that.  </li>
            <li> Long battery life, with less battery drainage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - Long battery life, with less battery drainage.</li>
            <li> This was not a problem with my previous Remington.&lt;br /&gt;# A minor issue is that it snags or pulls hairs once or twice when I trim my beard.</li>
            <li> USE THE SMALL GOATEE BLADE FOR ALL OTHER SHAVING THAT INVOLVES SHAVING TO BARE SKIN LIKE UNDER YOUR CHIN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp, powerful, adjustable, keeps a charge for months at a time, is compact and it doesn&#x27;t have a million useless parts in a bag.</li>
            <li> The small head is just right for tight, delicate areas.  </li>
            <li> I also like the guide which is very sturdy and adjusts in a  clever manner that doesn&#x27;t allow it to jump places on you and cause a bad beard day.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this particular model again if it ever fails.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and require minimal passes of a bearded area to get the result you want.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise works as expected and does its job extremely well and with ease.</li>
            <li> After some examination (and comparison to two other trimmers), I believe the culprit is the wide spacing of the teeth on the adjustable comb.</li>
            <li> Blade is sharp so must be careful not to press too close to skin.</li>
            <li> Seems like something may have come loose as it works when you hold the blade facing up, but if you flip it upside down, it dies.  </li>
            <li> Since I am half blind and couldn&#x27;t put back together, I removed it from my presence in a very dignified way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have gone through quite a few beard trimmers generally stepping up in price or brand and have used Remington products in the past; this, however, is the first one I&#x27;ve ever purchased that didn&#x27;t come with at least a small vile of blade oil.</li>
            <li> this is much, much nicer than my last trimmer even though it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are sharp, (although I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to dull them) and cut hair with ease.  </li>
            <li> have had this for a little over 2 years now, and have only charged the battery less than 10 times.</li>
            <li> trimmer attachment took a few seconds to understand and set, but once I did, that is put it all the way on and use the dial instead of sliding it up and down (like my last trimmer)</li>
            <li> Even for a $30 device, I should get at least six months before major issues.  </li>
            <li> The shortest length on this is still a little long for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> No. 1\\&quot; setting) as I don&#x27;t think the attachment  would survive even a single drop onto even a wood (much less tile) floor.</li>
            <li> Only one of the blades is really sharp!!!</li>
            <li> In fact, I like everything about this trimmer except that it scratches me sometimes when using on bare skin, at least with one of the trimming edges.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer after my other one died on me.</li>
            <li> Still sharp.</li>
            <li> but that renders it pretty useless.</li>
            <li> But if you want a close, but not shaved looked there are other options.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One issue that I&#x27;ve had with other trimmers is that some of them tend to pull my hair due to the coarseness of it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t report on the other two or three that came with it.</li>
            <li> I do not experience pulling or any other discomfort.</li>
            <li> I never had this issue with trimmers from other brands (wahl,philips).</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, this pulled my beard hairs..  </li>
            <li> the other Remington look like a joke.</li>
            <li> One is cole slaw and the other a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> one and 6 months later it still has not gone dead!  </li>
            <li> There are two other heads included, but I haven&#x27;t found a need for them yet.</li>
            <li> just like the other reviews said..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is off the charts - went on a two week vacation - shaving my face, trimming my beard and shaving my head every other day</li>
            <li> is because there is the OCCASIONAL hair that slips its way past the comb and doesn&#x27;t get cut as closely, but it&#x27;s nothing drastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also inexpensive compared with other brands.</li>
            <li> Extremely durable, lithium ion battery makes a world in difference in charging frequency.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a gift after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even with three different blades, it can&#x27;t be adjusted to a low enough setting to provide a close-cropped look.  </li>
            <li> It will not give you sharp outlines.</li>
            <li> Every other month or</li>
            <li> Used every other day, it lasts for up to a month, which means I can take it on trips without the charger.</li>
            <li> I have not used any of the other blades</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I give it a score of 3 of 5 due to the missed hairs and snagged hairs.</li>
            <li> Once you adjust the height it stays in place, unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy the same one.</li>
            <li> I think the blades are too sharp.</li>
            <li> compared with other units.</li>
            <li> I have used a corded trimmer in the past and like the cordless feature of this unit a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The cutting head stays cool to the touch and the unit is quiet.  </li>
            <li> It does not include a travel bag or any other type of container.</li>
            <li> Labelling the dial \\&quot;1\\&quot; through \\&quot;9\\&quot; instead of the actual lengths (e.g. \\&quot;1/8\\&quot; or \\&quot;1/4\\&quot;) is a bit confusing, but the big issue for me is that using the comb 1-3 times results in an uneven trim.</li>
            <li> I clip my scalp and trim my beard every other day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the Arrmy and had my buddy give me a fade the other day</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have any of the issues the other buyers were talking about.</li>
            <li> But the blade grabs the hairs on your face and rips them out with such violence, I&#x27;m just not sure I can take it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I will research a product online &amp; in stores ceaselessly !</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and it trims my beard without tugging, pinching, or hurting in any way.  </li>
            <li> I then ask myself where the other grooming attachments are.</li>
            <li> Remington MB4040 looks, feels, and operates like any other cordless trimmer.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t opine on any trimmer attachment other than the beard option.</li>
            <li> This is SHARP.</li>
            <li> I never use the other two heads/</li>
            <li> Overall, not many, if any, drawbacks that I have discovered.</li>
            <li> It works well in the other &amp;#34;man shaving&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My only complain for now is it didn&#x27;t come with a small bag.</li>
            <li> He can use it every other day, and use it for a couple weeks without having to recharge the battery.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get other men complaining about the supposedly tacky look on the handle.  </li>
            <li> Blades is soo sharp that I almost cut my throat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does the job extremely well, with two additional blades for goatee and stubble.</li>
            <li> After cleaning, the head repeatedly was difficult to put back on and finally it simply refused to go back into place.</li>
            <li> But the other 2 I have no idea what the difference is....</li>
            <li> The only concern is that there are a number of small parts and nothing to hold them.  </li>
            <li> In fact, when using one of the other heads as a \\&quot;guide,\\&quot; I managed to push that one out of place, too</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any of the other accessories except the blade cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> I use the other cutters for goatee (length 4) and mustache (length 2).  </li>
            <li> You have to be very careful about the direction you shave with this thing.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick stubble and was looking for something that would keep my shadow look but basically cut the hair as close to your skin as possible, without actually using a razor - which I despise.  </li>
            <li> After I finally had to give up on a different brand due to battery failure and I could not obtain a replacement, One warning!</li>
            <li> The slim body also allows it to go into hard to reach places, and the interchangeable heads for stub, beard and goatee gives you a wide array of possibilities and combinations for different looks.</li>
            <li> this has been very strange, but i have yet to recharge this trimmer since i purchased it few months ago.</li>
            <li> For some of the harder spots on your face, typically under the neck, you might have to use one hand to hold your hair while you trim, but this is an issue with any trimmer in this price range.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve ever bought a worse, more useless product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is noisy, and the mustache blade does not project out far enough, making it difficult to see where one is trimming.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product, Very well made and seem to last long...</li>
            <li> Works about the same as previous trimmers I have used in the past, but seems sturdier with a thicker plastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to agree with some other reviewers that it sometimes takes several passes to get all the hair trimmed, but I have an exceptionally thick goatee and that has been the case for every trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> trimmer itself is too large for the job, and is curved so as to make it difficult to see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> (This is the one with the small cutting blade with fine</li>
            <li> Like some other reviews on this trimmer I had it for a year, actually less, when the battery stopped taking a charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially the problem was that I had to press in as hard as possible while sliding the switch in order to get it to turn on.  </li>
            <li> He is such a hard person to buy for.</li>
            <li> I am finding it really hard to navigate product reviews for beard trimmers, because people seem to have a lot of different needs, and they don&#x27;t specify what they bought the product for up</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend last year for Christmas since he has a hard time finding a shaver that can handle thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> The sound is atrocious.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the cover on my unit doesn&#x27;t move/adjust between setting one and two.</li>
            <li> Battery is average.</li>
            <li> It is straight forward and gets the job done efficiently without all the bells and whistles some of the expensive items have.</li>
            <li> Battery will last for at least 5 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that my last Remington grooming kit came with a charging stand and holders for the additional guards/blades, but this razor does not.  </li>
            <li> It only comes with the one and it sucks.</li>
            <li> Not worth knocking a star</li>
            <li> only complaint that I have would be directed towards the designers of this unit.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is no stand.</li>
            <li> Only negative</li>
            <li> My only complaint was I couldn&#x27;t turn it up to 11.</li>
            <li> A tad noisy is only complaint.</li>
            <li> But this is about the only complaint I have with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a powerful as it could be.</li>
            <li> The plastic attachment is way to difficult to put on and it also very bulky when trimming against my beard.  </li>
            <li> only negative is that it does not stand up in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have a moderately thick beard that i keep short.</li>
            <li> Some mornings I hate this machine, but it does still cut most of the hair.</li>
            <li> I have a thick, wiry beard that needs constant maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Never very comfortable.</li>
            <li> (b) have poor battery life, and (c) don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> was looking for a trimmer to keep my beard down to a stubble length, this seems to do it adequately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What works for me is shaking the device down as I turn it on, like I&#x27;m shaking water off it.  </li>
            <li> I put it at it&#x27;s highest setting and clicked it down a notch at a time until I heard some beard being clipped.</li>
            <li> Look to my update down bellow.  </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s down to this:  </li>
            <li> The guard seems to just flatten the hairs down, instead of lifting them up into the blades.</li>
            <li> The charge never goes down</li>
            <li> The &#x27;slide up &amp; down&#x27; guide is bulky and the hair grooves are ineffective.  </li>
            <li> Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> &quot; I found the detail trimmer got the stubble down to just where I like it without any nicks or hair</li>
            <li> and then it slows down and stops.  </li>
            <li> I like to use this guy about once a week and trim my beard down to a stubble length.  </li>
            <li> For those of us who take our hair down to near-skin level, the product itself works well.  </li>
            <li> You just have to get the heads down</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now: His beard is trimmed down on the sides and at the chin it is groomed at the length at he wanted.</li>
            <li> It slides down the sides of the trimmer and locks in place , but it needs to be removed for close trims.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy and the slide on guard/adjustable attachment could use some redesigned other than that I like it</li>
            <li> It is so sharp that I can not cut underneath my chin because it will cut me!  </li>
            <li> There is no setting, and I mean NO setting, in which the trimmer, with the guard on, will touch facial hair in a way that allows for a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I was a long-time Norelco user, but when the inevitable occurred, that is, the failure of the battery to accept a charge, I shopped for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> It is not a low battery issue, I think its just a slow speed issue, just needs to be a little bit faster so it doesnt pull hair at times.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with other trimmers.</li>
            <li> I was able to charge it again, but it was cutting very slowly.</li>
            <li> (even then I sometime have to take the attachment off ad try to catch a few remaining hairs very carefully) .</li>
            <li> I think it has something to do with the floating tines on the guard which none of my previous trimmers have had.</li>
            <li> previously had the Wahl PEANUT battery.  </li>
            <li> My husband is now shopping for something else that will last him at least a few years.  </li>
            <li> It no longer holds a charge, less than 4 months into its service life as a once-a-week-trimmer.</li>
            <li> I find myself using half that because it is easier to keep.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunate that the power brick for this is not usable for 220-240v; would be helpful if the writing on the brick was larger so this issue wasn&#x27;t such a mystery.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer seemed to run out of juice after three or four trims so I was always charging it.  </li>
            <li> The Remington charges in half the time.  </li>
            <li> It runs for less than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li> Unlike my previous Conair razer, this one cuts my skin when I use it without the attachment.</li>
            <li> I think it is less durable.</li>
            <li> Blade cuts with less passes compared to MB4040 Attachments</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous model, the plastic guard on this one gets caught in my beard and pulls at my hair.</li>
            <li> this is well made just like all my previous trimmers.</li>
            <li> 10/28/14 - Called Remington as the comment below recommended, and in less than 5 minutes a replacement trimmer is on the way at no cost to me, with a pre-paid return shipping label.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer was a Remington</li>
            <li> MB4040 uses a lithium-ion battery, which does not have the memory-effect problems of Nickel Cadmium and is less toxic when it comes time to dispose of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use it to trim ear hairs and a slight touch up on my hair in between haircuts.</li>
            <li> It really sucks when you arrive at your destination and realize your trimmer&#x27;s dead, especially if you were trying to save weight by leaving the power adapter at home!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I had to switch to Norelco because of battery issues with my previous Remington model.</li>
            <li> This is an upgrade from my previous Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li> unlike a previous trimmer I endured.</li>
            <li> However the battery recharged less than 2 years and then died.  </li>
            <li> We had to use one from a previous trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> The charge lasts longer than my previous trimmers and the blades</li>
            <li> I previously had Remington NiCad battery trimmer and it lasted for years.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this particular brand/model when a previous Remington model (which I had owned and used practically forever) finally failed to keep a charge.</li>
            <li> previous trimmer had a collection system</li>
            <li> # This replaces an older Remington model with nicad battery finally failed after 12+ years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gouged myself twice before realizing how sharp the plain blades are (and they cannot be adjusted).</li>
            <li> have pretty thick hair, so sometimes I need to make a few passes, but the razor just keeps on cutting through, even when my grain suddenly changes direction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t get a stand or case for it like every other unit I&#x27;ve ever purchased, which I found very odd.</li>
            <li> While this is not an electric razor, it is plenty sharp enough to shave a stubble look on my tough, course beard.</li>
            <li> Plastic depth cover for cutting hair at different length is the only piece that you need to be careful with, not as robust as it should be, but it does work well.</li>
            <li> Comparing the two trimmers is not fair since they are in a different categories.  </li>
            <li> This is also seen in with the power button which is metallic and slick and my finger keeps slipping on</li>
            <li> It takes me twice as long to trim my beard with this trimmer than it does using my little Norelco with dull blades.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer has an odd shape that takes a little getting used to, but I guess that&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use two of the blades that come with it (stubble and the wide main cutting blade).  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the depth guard is a little sharp, but maybe I am just pushing to hard.</li>
            <li> I could have lived with a slightly longer beard, but the inconsistent trimming killed that</li>
            <li> only thing to note is that when changing the blade it is very difficult to line it up into the correct position and the nylon snaps seem a little flimsy for frequent use.</li>
            <li> I use another trimmer if I want the closer stubble length just because I&#x27;m too lazy to remove the comb and this other trimmer has a nose hair attachment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a cheapo beard trimming kit for a couple years, and it got the job done, but this little machine gets the job done with style.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my beard and a little &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; and it blew my expectations away.  </li>
            <li> little background:  </li>
            <li> I will update on longevity UPDATE: A little over a year</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> THIS CLIPPER/TRIMMER IS A LITTLE NOISY.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to make this thing work, but every time I use it I wind up with a cut on my neck, face, ear, even the inside of my nose when I try and do a little maintenance there.</li>
            <li> I do wish the #1 settings was a little shorter...</li>
            <li> I Said to myself to push the the trimmer head a little bit, and the hairs were shorter.</li>
            <li> I know my beard can be a little majestic at times, but you&#x27;d think the &amp;#34;lithium ion&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed on two significant counts.  </li>
            <li> have used the stubble blade on my neck, but I don&#x27;t care for that blade much.&lt;br /&gt;After trimming my beard a little with the Beard Trimming Blade AND THE PLASTIC GUIDE.</li>
            <li> I use mine every other day for not much more than a minute or two on my moustache and goatee.</li>
            <li> Lots of little hair clippings seem to get into the area under the changeable blade, but again, doesn&#x27;t detract from the quality of the device-</li>
            <li> This razor has plenty of torque and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; at my beard like some other under-powered units I had in the past.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the shower with little water splashing on it</li>
            <li> It seems to get a closer trim than any other trimmers I have used in the past (and I have bought a lot of them trying to find one that works well for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard looking neat with little effort.  </li>
            <li> A little noisy.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re a little easier on the neck.</li>
            <li> to see numbers on the dial: hubby says he had to squint to see the numbers, so they could have been a little</li>
            <li> /&gt;One way that they could improve the product would be to add a bag to hold all the little pieces that come with it.  </li>
            <li> No more feeling like the guard is trying to cut your face off with sharp edges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i cut myself where my skin was a little wrinkled (no, not there).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had one of those trimmers with multiple attachments that sit in a poorly designed stand that seems to spill half of them out on the bathroom counter whenever you are trying to use one of them you will appreciate this trimmer.</li>
            <li> the only complaint i have is when you try use guard level 1 and try to go down to a stubble it often grabbs and pulls and that sucks.</li>
            <li> it makes it very hard to accidentally slip to a different setting while in use-</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, in short (sorry), extra time is definitely needed for additional passes to achieve truly even beard length - not ideal.</li>
            <li> My last few trimmers would already be down to only doing one shave per charge by now, but this one just keeps on cutting.</li>
            <li> Still very few nicks or cuts, despite all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> He said it was a little heavy</li>
            <li> The trimmer is fine enough for the price, but the battery is terrible.</li>
            <li> Be careful when not using the guard and pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> The plastic guard can be set for ten different cutting lengths, &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; being the shortest.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t mind your beard hair being pulled and cutting yourself while trimming your moustache.. buy it because it does hold a charge really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given up using it as a beard trimmer and only use it when cutting hair and trimming up the back of the neck.</li>
            <li> and my beard is neatly kept/trimmed in a few seconds...</li>
            <li> For the money it costs, however, it should not start going dead within a minute of turning it on...plugged in or</li>
            <li> so it requires me to go over my face a few times in a row before everything is uniformly trimmed.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had for a few months</li>
            <li> and I was worried that my beard would get an uneven cut.  </li>
            <li> So, I have to go over the gray hairs a few times in order for the trimmer to cut them.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Did not realize how sad my old Norelco trimmer had become until I started using this.</li>
            <li> battery seems to be having trouble and finding it to be sluggish in operation,</li>
            <li> I grow a goatee for a few months each winter and need to trim it about once a week.  </li>
            <li> One of the few trimmers that doesn&#x27;t pull your hair.</li>
            <li> I can take it along on short trips and leave the charger cord behind.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally dead and in the trash.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the Remington name fool you its not cheaply made by any means.</li>
            <li> the cut is really uneven.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday to keep that stubble look.</li>
            <li> Found quite a few on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Using it for few weeks now.</li>
            <li> battery is almost dead.</li>
            <li> I am a person who doesn&#x27;t wan&#x27;t to waste he&#x27;s time at the barber shop.</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> My concern is that the blades will get misplaced.</li>
            <li> And the attachments stay firmly in place no worries about over trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> but after a few uses it started tugging on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a few months now</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow these few rules and you won&#x27;t cut yourself when using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dead now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just another shaver with few bells n whistles.</li>
            <li> Completely dead now.</li>
            <li> Uneven length when using adjustable feature&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s dead as a doughnut.  </li>
            <li> me a few seconds to figure how to get the adjustable head to attach correctly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that you do have to go over a few spots when trimming</li>
            <li> but it got me a few times.</li>
            <li> The 1st few months it worked like a champ.</li>
            <li> much trouble</li>
            <li> You basically have to destroy the packaging to extract the item.  </li>
            <li> A few clicks on the thumb wheel will raise or lower the comb.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few time</li>
            <li> so it takes a few times over each area to get them all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trim the length of my beard too often, but haven&#x27;t had to charge it the few times I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> After a few months of sporadic use this trimmer will no longer hold a charge for longer than a minute.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a few months.  </li>
            <li> I did not realize what i was missing until I used this.</li>
            <li> Not having owned this but a few months I haven&#x27;t had the chance to fully check it out.  </li>
            <li> eventually it completely lost it ability to hold a charge,  and now it is useless.  </li>
            <li> I can maybe round off the tips</li>
            <li> The trimmer completely depletes itself during one session and to make matters worse, plugging it in does not allow the device to run on AC power - it still uses the battery!</li>
            <li> The battery fried after a few months.</li>
            <li> One small gripe would be that it takes numerous passes to get my stubble-style beard to look even without any random long hairs.</li>
            <li> every few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before: I was always complaining to hubby that his beard was just so messy.</li>
            <li> but it seemed to run out of batteries, and then not hold charge after a few months.  </li>
            <li> If you, like me, forget to recharge the battery on your trimmer every few days and wake up to find the trimmer not working, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I came across these Remington&#x27;s, I read quite a few of the reviews and was intrigued by some of the features.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t even get through a trim without having a few hairs yanked, which hurts.</li>
            <li> Charge it maybe every few months.  </li>
            <li> Using the &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34; blade ended up with a few cuts on my face and neck because of the wider-pitched teeth on the blade.</li>
            <li> incident made me not to believe any electric trimmer as nothing helped to shave my thick beard as I wanted in different style and the razor takes around 3 -4 times to shave it completely so thick is my beard&lt;</li>
            <li> its so false and it also leaves some patches if u keep it at 2 and 1 will cut u through , so over all utter disspointment and will never recommend any Remington trimmer to anyone</li>
            <li> Not accurate.</li>
            <li> You can usual tell from it slowing down</li>
            <li> And something about the slippery design of the plastic guard made it completely impossible to get a consistent trim.</li>
            <li> Trimmers that I&#x27;ve owned in the past – Panasonic, Norelco, etc. – couldn&#x27;t hold a charge for two weeks, much less six months.</li>
            <li> I read some of the other negative reviews</li>
            <li> so I charge it because I think it shouldn&#x27;t have any charge left because I use it at least once per week if not more and each time I operate this thing for at least 20 mins.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the very least, it should come with a small bag or plastic box to hold the two extra trimming heads.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I thought I would miss the pop-up trimmer, since this one has a separate small cutter to use for trimming tight areas.</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic about it, but you don&#x27;t want drama with personal care!</li>
            <li> This is just not strong at all.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this trimmer even though there may be other trimmers a lot more expensive.  </li>
            <li> It may be that i&#x27;m pressing down too hard</li>
            <li> I just wont push down so hard.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the metal under the trimmer head had rusted pretty bad.</li>
            <li> (I tried another Norelco model first and it was really bad).</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied as it didn&#x27;t work after few months.</li>
            <li> When I get lazy and don&#x27;t shave my head for a few days</li>
            <li> After that I heard the motor slow down.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pinch or slow down.  </li>
            <li> use it for cutting my hair (short guy hair with not much to worry about).  </li>
            <li> For around $20 bucks you cannot beat this little trimmer!</li>
            <li> After a single use, already two of the three trimmer heads on were broken.</li>
            <li> If you press too  hard on your skin, it will give you a little cut.</li>
            <li> It has multiple settings and 2 other cutting heads.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried after reading some negative reviews here.</li>
            <li> Handles thick hair with relatively little blow by -</li>
            <li> Bad is that it is a bit too large for those small jobs like trimming ears and a close cut goatee.</li>
            <li> I was using a barber trimmer and found that the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; attachments were either a bit too deep (leaving the beard too long) or a bit too shallow (cutting it too close) with no in-between.  </li>
            <li> However, the extensions usually break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a product defect in mine or not,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it affected the performance as all the moving parts seems to be rust-resistant.</li>
            <li> Did not trim as short/close with guard on #1 as my past remington</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Also the trim height uses small increments which I like.</li>
            <li> I would just buy another one - usually retail.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of small grooves under the trimmer for hair to get stuck in, so you&#x27;ll want to keep some canned air.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Remington&#x27;s warranty is only for 60 days.  </li>
            <li> This clippers works well to trim the length of my small beard (goatee).  </li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I dont use any other attachments other than the beard one that is connected with it as those others are really useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 4 weeks, and I usually use it around once a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed from this product.</li>
            <li> It also holds its charge unbelievably well.</li>
            <li> it is also small piece of equipment that fits in my glove</li>
            <li> After that final trim, it fails to even turn on anymore.</li>
            <li> Fully charged upon receiving, swapped trimmer head for the small close shave trimmer.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t paying attention that this product lack the precision, because the shaver cleans the small hairs after it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: 2-ish years later, the clippers will no longer charge, and are useless.</li>
            <li> Never made it past the two minute mark.</li>
            <li> In addition to \\&quot;classing up\\&quot; the design of this unit, the weight has been re-balanced so that the head is heavier than the handle, which makes shaping a beard (particularly cutting in the direction of growth, for a longer beard) nearly effortless.  </li>
            <li> but I find that I have an occasional pull on a hair during use, which is really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have used 2 trimmers over the past 30 years or so.  </li>
            <li> The chromed plastic looks cheesy (entirely subjective).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s past the return date, so I&#x27;m out about $40 bucks</li>
            <li> Not really sure that I&#x27;ve noticed a difference between the \\&quot;beard\\&quot; blade and the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; blade&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no more words for it .too</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s wrong with a simple box that has a picture of the item on the cover?</li>
            <li> but it usually dies mid-use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it  doesnt offer enough range for trimming stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too terribly concerned with \\&quot;precision blades,\\&quot; but the trimmer comes with plenty of options if you&#x27;re looking for something more</li>
            <li> Being in the Army the past 7yrs, I&#x27;ve been through a lot of razor/beard trimmers.  </li>
            <li> the batter is completely dead it will not effectively work while plugged in the wall.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after just 6 months, the battery is starting to act up.</li>
            <li> Have used problem-free for the past year.  </li>
            <li> not able to change or return, the period was until 21 February.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Remington beard trimmer for the past 25 years and when it quit, I was hoping I could find a like product, and I did.</li>
            <li> with  a  small  vibration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cordless is neat and size works with small bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> Sorry that we bought it and since we only have a 30-60 day return window we are now stuck with it.  </li>
            <li> Remington usually make reliable products.</li>
            <li> But I am using the trimmer to this day, without having charged it once over the past 8 months, and continue to use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> So do a small number test beforehand</li>
            <li> (I have some difficulty putting the blades back on since they have a weird angle, but that may be just me.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had owned, it seemed, everything but a Remington brand in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened -</li>
            <li> I chose to ignore the negative ratings that mentioned uneven trimming for close shaves thinking it would be a user error.</li>
            <li> It just has that bulky vacuum that gets in the way, and the guard adjustment measuring system is completely useless as it doesn&#x27;t line up with any of the measurements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the electric beard trimmer because I bought the sharp electric trimmer in the drug store of the same price of this remingtion beard trimmer</li>
            <li> however, i have stubble instead of a beard, and on the shortest setting, this trimmer misses a lot of hairs, leaving my stubble very uneven.</li>
            <li> Very harsh rubbing feel on skin.</li>
            <li> Have had it for some time and had to charge it VERY FEW times.</li>
            <li> but it seems like the trim is very uneven around my chin and jaw.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any pulling or other discomfort as another reviewer has mentioned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the absolute worst facial grooming tool I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> But not very good on stubble.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck with a broken down pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Clippers worked fine, but very disappointed in the battery&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> The curved shape feels very strange and it makes it difficult for me to trim with precision.</li>
            <li> Now, less than three months in, all three heads are broken.</li>
            <li> This one does often enough to make me slow down the trimming process hoping to avoid the painful yanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hard to turn when my fingers are slippery, and I resort to using my fingernail, since it&#x27;s rubberized.</li>
            <li> It died on me after a year, and I hardly used it.</li>
            <li> I like all aspects of this trimmer except it&#x27;s hard to read the guide settings.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it is hard, but MB4040 is easier, that&#x27;s all.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe when I was not pushing it too hard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to work.</li>
            <li> In fact as I&#x27;ve learned the hard way, any pressure at all and you may cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> He highly recommend this to all men in need of a shaver you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After a few days a shave can be a little uncomfortable, but pre-trimming helps solve that problem.  </li>
            <li> The old trimmers had a bad habit of losing the ability to correctly hold a charge after a couple years.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with a case or soft bag.  </li>
            <li> Internet shopping sucks sometimes.</li>
            <li> I had to drop at least one star because it does not have a corded option.</li>
            <li> If they can&#x27;t provide a corded option, I would at least like to have a gauge</li>
            <li> I charged it once when it arrived, and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it since, and that was at least a couple of months ago...</li>
            <li> You need to pass at least 3 times to cut it all.</li>
            <li> Does not have an ear/nose trimmer which is common amongst others</li>
            <li> Breaks too easily, loses ability to hold charge altogether after about three-four months.</li>
            <li> Had a Norelco product for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> so I actually think this item is dangerous and should be recalled.</li>
            <li> I had at least 2 beard-worths of hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone quite a while without the need to re-charge, the three different heads allow me to adjust for what I&#x27;m cutting (the beard blade for my goatee and the stubble blade for the rest of my face since I don&#x27;t like to shave with a razor).</li>
            <li> Flimsy, clumsy and cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One I&#x27;ve owned for at least a year and</li>
            <li> one complaint is that the trimmed hair goes everywhere</li>
            <li> and I never really liked an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> having hair yanked out really sucks.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for at least a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> Now I do not use it every day, but at least 3-4 times a week for trimming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been at least 2 months and still going.</li>
            <li> The attachment for styling beard is not effective.</li>
            <li> at least, not yet.  </li>
            <li> Seeing its flexibility and wide array of options, I fail to see someone not happy with this trimmer, although there will always be the one that complains that it is missing the moisturizer spreader or that beard-length-self-maintainer button that will be</li>
            <li> and it sucks at doing the neck line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not in the least bit anemic, and each blade fullfills its purpose well.  </li>
            <li> I noticed reviewers complained about the Wahl also.</li>
            <li> but it does get used at least 3 times a week</li>
            <li> and I have owned at least four others.</li>
            <li> Use it at least once a week and still haven&#x27;t charged it.</li>
            <li> Note that this really sucks when the battery starts to die part way through a trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It sits very low on the handle, making one handed operation awkward.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one in spite of reading some negative reviews.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a tad awkward, but not a big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which was a big disappointment-</li>
            <li> At least they could have supplied a plastic cap for the spare blades and a bag to keep everything together.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have the same experience (I use setting 1) and am not happy with the trimmer at all.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t have the power or blades for my thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My thick curly beard hairs are cut with no pulling.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and it would get caught on some of my wiskers and just pull them...</li>
            <li> Meanwhile my goatee is still as thick as it was, just neater.</li>
            <li> poor battery life ,  waste of money IMO .</li>
            <li> The comb is alright but not amazing.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too thick, I dont know,</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have a thick beard.  </li>
            <li> I knew this in advance, but the corded options lacked other features that I like, so I made this choice anyway, but why is it so difficult to give us the option?  </li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> By Shadow, I mean maybe a NEAT 3-4 day look, not 1 day look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Razor cuts unbelievably close!  </li>
            <li> My last Remington lasted 8 years, so I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> (Weirdly Conair doesn&#x27;t make my other shaver anymore, which was perfect.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean if it&#x27;s around 5mm.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was disappointed when I tried it and found that it cut a bit too close, nicking my upper neck several times and drawing blood when used without a blade guard.</li>
            <li> I mean who uses staples?  </li>
            <li> Comes with various cutting heads and keeps an electric charge for a long time (saves energy) without a reduction in cutting power.</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean...</li>
            <li> My initial review was influenced by my past bad experience with Braun Cruzer 6.</li>
            <li> My conclusion is that my original trimmer was great, it lasted a long time and eventually got dull, but the MB4040 is just an AWFUL, TERRIBLE, WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK that made shaving my face a really unpleasant experience for a year or so.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful, it&#x27;s not too bad and with a little patience</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used less expensive trimmers, but I suspect that some of them do just as well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, but Remington seriously needs to rethink the products they&#x27;re putting out.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5/5 was the changing heads can be difficult to fix if they pop off wrong.</li>
            <li> And less expensive.</li>
            <li> The mounts on my beard blade failed after about a year, making the entire blade useless.</li>
            <li> Works well, the included trimmer ad on is terrible does not cut evenly, large size not easy to maneuver,</li>
            <li> I like the guard, although the thumb wheel is a little difficult to turn.  </li>
            <li> Bead trimmer when kept at 1 and trimmed its sooo bad that it almost takes you skin out if not not careful , happened once or twice and is very very delicate ,it has been dropped from a meter height it broke.</li>
            <li> Actual performance is bad.</li>
            <li> It finally got so bad with the hair pulling that I ordered this...what a world of difference.  </li>
            <li> I have read several bad reviews regarding the battery.</li>
            <li> It is not good for body grooming and the bldes catch and pull beard hairs often.</li>
            <li> the battery fails to hold a charge after a few months&#x27; use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Norelco died on me a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> Longer beards are harder to trim because hair can stay curled below the cutting surface which is why I went to a shorter beard.  </li>
            <li> I am giving this Remington away because it is not a good as I need for trimming.</li>
            <li> I too want to jump on the \\&quot;this product is not good at all\\&quot; bandwagon.  </li>
            <li> This item is not good for closer cuts.</li>
            <li> The battery was weak from the start, and now will not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> It just seemed weak and their shortest trim(with attachment)</li>
            <li> Got a replacement from amazon tough.</li>
            <li> trimmer whips through that tough fur, doesn&#x27;t bind or snag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick whiskers</li>
            <li> NO MORE BATTERIES!!</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid when I looked at the pictures of this product.</li>
            <li> so  is  a  little  awkward  </li>
            <li> AND it was less expensive!  </li>
            <li> Though I thought the number readout (as you adjust the beard trimmer length) was so hard to read as to be useless.  </li>
            <li> Poor design...</li>
            <li> Does a poor job of any sort of trimming.</li>
            <li> and/or they are using poor quality batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all the features can&#x27;t make up for the poor function.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor battery life</li>
            <li> ; is they have poor quality control --</li>
            <li> This was a game changer when it came to beard trimming and shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;- Not great for edging the mustache, and beard</li>
            <li> Bottom line: - Not great Edging of the mustache, and beard &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Height  adjustment clogs and is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy.</li>
            <li> A base was included that has spaces for the trimmer, the five extra heads, the hand comb, and the cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced any hair pulling with the MB-4040 or the MB-200.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x60;m traveling in Europe and really confused about it.</li>
            <li> Game over.</li>
            <li> continues to perform poorly.  </li>
            <li> Overall an annoying product.</li>
            <li> grateful for the thin, patchy look it has added to my beard, which women find so attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit confused about the difference in the 2 blades....</li>
            <li> I was originally confused by how the beard trimming mechanism worked, however.</li>
            <li> and I got a close enough trim that I didn&#x27;t need to shave (which I hate).</li>
            <li> What is irritating is that  </li>
            <li> It was tired of using hair clippers.</li>
            <li> the blade has broken, forcing me to purchase another trimmer.</li>
            <li> Poor way to spend $30.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY THIS THING IS THE BOMBBBB!</li>
            <li> , I like it a little rough, but this is insane.  </li>
            <li> You can trim up your hair or make shaving less painful by pre-trimming the areas I shave.  </li>
            <li> You have to literally rip and destroy the box it came in to get it and its accessories out, making a return impossible if you change your mind (as I have).</li>
            <li> I have to go over and over an area, and even then it&#x27;s just a bad, uneven trim.</li>
            <li> I switched the cutting blades out to the set with the &amp;#34;finer teeth&amp;#34; and no more pulling!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very disappointed to find upon its arrival that this Remington only works on battery power.  </li>
            <li> find the plastic comb a little annoying to attach -</li>
            <li> I should use both of them, but since the Remington has cut me I&#x27;m wary of using it even with the guard.  </li>
            <li> and it has become completely useless.</li>
            <li> : Rusts, expensive, and not washable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this beard trimmer just does not perform well.</li>
            <li> Thought it was weird</li>
            <li> When I received this product, the cord failed after one use.</li>
            <li> Sadly it is useless junk, stay away.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this one after the MB200 failed and,</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t that expensive , but don&#x27;t know if I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> It saves a ton of money than bringing him to a barber, which is difficult to do with a two year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It saves a ton of money than bringing him to a barber, which is difficult to do with a two year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That or I&#x27;m using the clippers completely wrong.</li>
            <li> Neither is all that expensive , but I&#x27;d recommend spending the difference and getting the Remington.</li>
            <li> Its useless now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable to handle.  </li>
            <li> this is absolutely useless as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Looks really expensive.</li>
            <li> For $29, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Flimsy plastic beard trimming guard (want to add that if you trim with the wrong angle using this you will shave to the skin)&lt;br /&gt;Trim</li>
            <li> This thing is almost entirely useless and I&#x27;ll tell you why:</li>
            <li> However, I bought this to TRIM the goatee, not just style it and in that respect it fails.</li>
            <li> but then what&#x27;s the point of the guard if it&#x27;s useless?</li>
            <li> charger stopped working, so the product became useless</li>
            <li> This thing worked about as well as a something you&#x27;d buy off a street cart sandwiched between fake purses and burnt Steven Segall DVDs.  </li>
            <li> Failed to hold a charge afterward.</li>
            <li> so I know I&#x27;m not doing anything wrong.  </li>
            <li> It just feels like it is wrong and eventually going to hurt the razor/comb function in some way.  </li>
            <li> Works well, just takes a bit of getting used to the weird blade angle.</li>
            <li> This is useless as a goatee trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough terrible things about this clipper.  </li>
            <li> If I had seen a picture of the packaging, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it, because it comes in a ridiculously complicated clamshell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blister pack is stapled to the cardboard, and it made it difficult to remove the trimmer.</li>
            <li> For the money, I don&#x27;t think you can wrong by giving this one a shot.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong.</li>
            <li> Bought it in Jan and it failed in Sept.  </li>
            <li> but it kinds of randomly dies.</li>
            <li> but the battery failed within a year</li>
            <li> Yeah it works well whne it has power, however I have be unable to recharge the battery.</li>
            <li> Used it one time before the battery failed.</li>
            <li> He has very tough beard</li>
            <li> product of very poor quality.</li>
            <li> The snout on this thing is very poorly designed.</li>
            <li> hate to throw the trimmer away, but I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a way to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> Provides an EXTREMELY close shave without cutting!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The previous one died and though I tried to replace its NiCd battery, it proved to be just about impossible (bad!).</li>
            <li> Both the beard blade and the stubble blade randomly and repeatedly pulled at my beard hairs (which is quite unpleasant).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Horrible for shaving down to a stubble - as others have mentioned</li>
            <li> After owning this trimmer for about a year and a half, I have come to appreciate its uniquely vicious personality.</li>
            <li> Be advised though, demonstrate between the cutting side and the stabbing side.</li>
            <li> The difference is that the cutting side with cut the hair effortlessly with or against the grain and the stabbing side will result in bleeding.</li>
            <li> Awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> Disappointment all the way around.</li>
            <li> After removing the plastic guard to shape my beard, the clippers is dangerous to one&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> I like the ability to change cutting length without having to change a plastic guide.</li>
            <li> and it is still cutting well.  </li>
            <li> May struggle cutting tougher</li>
            <li> I do know that the shave is crazy inconsistent.</li>
            <li> The stubble trimmer kept cutting me.  </li>
            <li> Crazy power.</li>
            <li> I also found the angles you have to hold it awkward.</li>
            <li> Others mention blades cutting their faces.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken off the guard in order to try cutting against my skin but nothing works.</li>
            <li> This is disappointing.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and tried changing the cutting head that was on it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer for some inexplicable reason just doesn&#x27;t trim well.</li>
            <li> It pulls your hair out rather than cutting it.</li>
            <li> All in all a disappointing product.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am cutting my losses and trying someone else.</li>
            <li> but I give 4 stars because of the awkward shape.</li>
            <li> Cuts those annoying thin hairs.</li>
            <li> It cuts unevenly and the hair pulling is very bad and painful.</li>
            <li> The guard moves down when there is any pressure on it making impossible to have an even trim and it doesn&#x27;t a horrible job of directing the hair to the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a painful experience as it pulls on whiskers rather than cutting them.</li>
            <li> The biggest pain in the wrong place is the stupid placement of the on and off switch.</li>
            <li> It pinches and grabs, and that is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It is horrible; possibly the worst designed product I&#x27;ve ever seen.  </li>
            <li> and it was impossible to replace.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just bad.</li>
            <li> Really bad.</li>
            <li> I set out to buy a trimmer for my mustache and goatee a month ago and could not believe all the bad reviews here at Amazon about them.  </li>
            <li> and I see no reason for it to go bad.  </li>
            <li> The bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a trimmer pull your hair so bad.</li>
            <li> Just a bad trimmer.</li>
            <li> That will eventually get gummed up but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> Still 3 years isn&#x27;t too bad for a $30 beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> The viewing angle is really bad</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t a BAD thing-</li>
            <li> This is a bad ass beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe I got a bad clipper, but it&#x27;s going to the trash pile, because I can&#x27;t take the pain</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tug or pull, nothing bad happened, yet..</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> This is potentially bad news.  </li>
            <li> I read all the bad reviews, but I bought this anyway.</li>
            <li> I figured &amp;#34;How bad can this be?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> yes, this is just as bad as everyone says.</li>
            <li> and I just cant find anything bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> I shave like a nervous cat now, expecting the painful tug &amp; tear at any moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seemed to tug at my beard with painful pulled hairs rather than an efficient trim.</li>
            <li> Come on how hard can it be!!!!</li>
            <li> It worked for another day but then the battery died permanently :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Get one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its intended purpose is to trim hair without trimming skin and it fails miserably.  </li>

            <li> I soon found myself not wanting to trim my beard because it was so annoying.</li>

            <li> Great battery life, charges quickly, trims very well. A little finicky regarding angles and such, but nothing to get upset about. It could be stronger in thicker hair patches, hence only 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a proud owner of this shaver. I use it occasionally to keep my facial hair presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT THAT BATTERY THOUGH. It&#x27;s gotta be lithium. It lasts forever. Admittedly, I only use it once a week, but the battery holds a charge for a very long time. I&#x27;ve charged it like twice over the many months I&#x27;ve owned it. (And unlike Ni-Cad batteries, Lithium  batteries maintain their power output until the end.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this to give myself a buzzcut. That took some effort, but the battery lasted and it looks pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does not claim to be water resistant, but I have rinsed the end of it while it was running, without any problems. But always let it dry out before reassembling and storing it, so that rust won&#x27;t form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The length dial is slippery when wet. It is hard to turn when my fingers are slippery, and I resort to using my fingernail, since it&#x27;s rubberized.</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks, the battery completely drained and is no longer taking a charge. Of course I can&#x27;t return it now because there&#x27;s only a 30 day return policy. Internet shopping sucks sometimes. Regardless, it worked fine during the 6 weeks the battery lasted. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a broken down pair of clippers. Should make for a decent doorstopper.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased! Great quilt! I have only had to charge it 3-4 times since I&#x27;ve owned it which has been a couple months.</li>
            <li> For every 5 hairs it trims it pulls one.  I wonder if they actually USED the trimmer when they developed it?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy and the slide on guard/adjustable attachment could use some redesigned other than that I like it</li>
            <li> Well, a little more than 1 year from purchase date and the charge doesn&#x27;t last more than 3 minutes. This trimmer worked well when it held a charge. And you can&#x27;t run it plugged in! Nice design Remington. Seems battery mode is the only mode. When the battery is gone, throw it out. Time to call Remington.</li>
            <li> BEST EVER !  I RESEARCHED A LOT BEFORE BUYING ONE AS I HAVE BEEN CUTTING BUSSING MY HAIR FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS .. THIS LIVES UP TO ITS REVIEWS .. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> By far the best trimmer I ever owned. It&#x27;s precise,  sharp and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Very powerful and cuts close to the face with the guard is not used. I have a thick beard and the thing takes down my beard nicely. No snags. Would recommend to anyone. Also, a complete charge lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I had that panasonic vacuum one.  Picked this one up and love it.  It simply does a better job at trimming, I have to go over less times and have fewer missed hairs.  The stubble attachment works very well.</li>
            <li> It has all the features I was looking for; easy to use, well designed, hope it last many years. thank you</li>
            <li> Perfect exactly what I need after No shave November.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, but it can also scratch you pretty good when using it without it&#x27;s guard on it.  It is kind of strange really, I have never had another trimmer do what this does sometimes.  I like the overall design and easy of use.  In fact, I like everything about this trimmer except that it scratches me sometimes when using on bare skin, at least with one of the trimming edges.</li>
            <li> Given the number of laudatory reviews, I expect my situation may be an anomaly.  I had the trimmer for about a year, and as advertised, I did not have to charge it once.  I was quite surprised.  Now however, it is \\&quot;dead\\&quot; and won&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He says it makes keeping his beard the right length so&lt;br /&gt;easy.  He has not had any problem with it pulling as some&lt;br /&gt;have said.  He says it is the best trimmer he has ever had!</li>
            <li> I use this to shorten my beard, hair on my head and my girlfriend uses it to trim my body hair. It shears through all of it no problem or bogging, and you don&#x27;t have to have a cord so you can do it the garage or in the grass. Be advised though, demonstrate between the cutting side and the stabbing side. The difference is that the cutting side with cut the hair effortlessly with or against the grain and the stabbing side will result in bleeding.</li>
            <li> For $25, this is the best trimmer I have owned. The olde WAHL trimmer I had would catch on and hurt even after cleaning and oiling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing blazes through the beard without any difficulty and with great comfort. The adjustable mechanism is really handy, sturdy, and easy-to-use.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised by the battery. I bought it almost three months ago and I use it every week for beard, mustache and hair. I didn&#x27;t charge it yet. It runs very well and for the time being it is superior to the previous rechargeable I owned.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the electric beard trimmer because I bought the sharp electric trimmer in the drug store of the same price of this remingtion beard trimmer but it didnt shaved at all properly.&lt;br /&gt;This incident made me not to believe any electric trimmer as nothing helped to shave my thick beard as I wanted in different style and the razor takes around 3 -4 times to shave it completely so thick is my beard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and now after this trimmer I got,  my life has really become easy, it shaves instantly into different styles so I can finish it up within 10 mins and go to work soon or out. The titanium blades are really sharp and very easy to use product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product who has thick beard like me.</li>
            <li> ease of use.handles well. would recommend for anyone on the go. my husband has used Remington products for years. would make a good gift.</li>
            <li> I loved the trimmer but really liked the stand charger that came with my last Remmington trimmer. I hope this one will last as many years as the last.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to figure out how to work the trimmer correctly, but after a little bit of reading, and playing with it, I love it.  It has lots of power, and the battery last a very long time.  I think its a good purchase for the money.</li>
            <li> Good product in reasonable price. However some hairs scattered around after every use.&lt;br /&gt;If they add vacum in this production it will make it perfect, but off course it will come with additional price.</li>
            <li> Trims real easily but hair does go everywhere. Make sure to use this in an environment easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> Does a respectable job, but loud as a lawnmower next to your ear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it less than 12 times but I am very pleased with the performance. I wouldn&#x27;t pay much attention to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> This is my 10th trimmer and the first Remington; I&#x27;ve always used Phillips. I haven&#x27;t had it very long but so far I&#x27;m fully satisfied with it. The motor is strong and blades are sharpe. I especally like the way the guard adjusts, roller button. It has a good feel and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Very good lithium trimmer with built in cutting height adjustment.  Compact enough to travel.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy trimmer. It comes with a tiny brush, power charger, three blades (goatee, stubble, trimmer) and a blade cover that can be adjusted to 9 different length. I have only had it one week, so I can not comment on the battery other than that it is holding a charge well so far. I like to keep a stubble appearance so I use a short setting and my beard is neatly kept/trimmed in a few seconds... very handy. I use to use a hair clippers set, but it was too big and awkward, this is a great size. The motor is plenty powerful. It works great as a body trimmer also, I use it for my stomach and chest on a short setting as well. I am really glad I spent the money and purchased this item. The only complaint I have is that the cover on my unit doesn&#x27;t move/adjust between setting one and two. This doesn&#x27;t bother me much because I don&#x27;t need it any shorter than 2.</li>
            <li> Battery charge has gradually faded&lt;br /&gt;After 1 1/2 years, battery only last a couple of minutes</li>
            <li> After about 6 months of use, battery could not be charged fully. Tried everything the directions said &amp; it doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;Very good (versital) product except for that. Charge light indicates it is charged but it runs for about 5 min &amp; stops.</li>
            <li> This really is the only groomer that you need. Nice quiet motor. Easy to dial in the exact length you want. Easy to clean. I use a brush to remove the hair and keep the comb attached. I use another trimmer if I want the closer stubble length just because I&#x27;m too lazy to remove the comb and this other trimmer has a nose hair attachment. It is a loud Norelco but came with different size combs that broke so I bought this Remington to replace it. The Remington comb stays firmly in place and has no weird fragile pieces likely to break. Keeps a charge over days of use. Good looking on the shelf too.</li>
            <li> So far this unit has kept it&#x27;s charge better than expected. It cuts good and depth adjustment works well for me.</li>
            <li> It had a decent charge from right out the package. So at first I was loving the thing. Once the battery died that was it, it was no longer usable. I have tried leaving it plugged in a couple days a nothing. So I tried for a week, ... aaand nothing. The battery lasted just long enough so I would not be able to return or replace it. For while I thought I had a great deal. Now I am just upset I didn&#x27;t spend a little extra to get another brand.</li>
            <li> long battery life, I haven&#x27;t recharged it since I bought it.  Light, and easy to  maneuver.  I&#x27;ve only used 1 of the 3 cutter heads so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, but so far so good.  If my past experience with the Remington brand still applies, I&#x27;m sure it will give me years of service.  My last Remington lasted over 6 - 8 years, and I&amp;#34;ve always had good luck with them so far - my favorite brand so I hope I&#x27;m not dissapointed.  Here&#x27;s what I like about this one - My last one had only one blade; I like that this one has the 3 blades because:  1) The stubble blade works great on my head and neck, and it trims much shorter than my last one ever did and this is great for me because I prefer to trim rather than shave those areas, 2) the detail blade makes it much easier to get the details nice and clean, 3) the main blade works well on my beard, and 4) I suspect that the blades will last longer since I&#x27;m using 3 blades, where in the past I only had one blade to do all the work.  Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m not so fond of:  I had to drop at least one star because it does not have a corded option. I knew this in advance, but the corded options lacked other features that I like, so I made this choice anyway, but why is it so difficult to give us the option?  It&#x27;s really irritating when I start to get ready for work or a night out, and my trimmer dies before the job is done.  If they can&#x27;t provide a corded option, I would at least like to have a gauge so I know I&#x27;m doomed if I don&#x27;t charge it more first.  I think this is something that should be fairly simple: many of my battery operated devices have a visual representation of how much charge is left, so the technology is anything but new.  Come on Remington, give us a cord or a gauge, and this could well be the perfect trimmer for me!</li>
            <li> Absolutely pleased with this trimmer.  I charged it completely when I received it and haven&#x27;t had to recharge yet and it has been a couple of months.  I use it 2-3 times per week</li>
            <li> Ouch.  And blood.  I tried it twice and got the same result both times.  Do not put these blades anywhere near your skin.  They will cut a ragged edge.  Cannot be used to trim the edge of a beard.  It&#x27;s a very aggressive cutter with a lot of power so it chews you right up.  It worked well for trimming my beard with the guard on it.  It cuts in columns, but is so aggressive that two or three passes and it&#x27;s good.  My wahl trimmer took many passes and was never as good.  I should use both of them, but since the Remington has cut me I&#x27;m wary of using it even with the guard.  If I still had the box I would send it back.  I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the trimming extension on my electric shaver to shave my face because my skin is sensitive and breaks out/gets ingrown hairs if I shave with the foil or use a razor. However, the extensions usually break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this trimmer to shave my whole face with. I use the stubble extension. Gets close enough to keep me looking clean shaven but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. great for trimming beard, cutting down to goatee or mustache, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great if you like to change your facial hair or want to shave without irritation!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer after my other one died on me. I was really excited about a new trimmer for my beard. Order arrived on time and exactly as advertised, but then I started to use it. Now, I&#x27;ve been shaving a loooong time, so I am familiar with how to operate and trim a beard so that is not a factor in this review. From the very first use, this trimmer pulled as many hairs as it cut. At first I chalked it up to me getting used to a new trimmer, but every time I used it it pulled hairs! OUCH! I tried less pressure, more pressure, different hand holds, different angles, I even had my wife try to do it for me but nothing worked. I soon found myself not wanting to trim my beard because it was so annoying. In all fairness, once the face-torture was over, my beard looked really good. The trimmer definitely performs well, but I could do without the constant pulling of hairs. I think it has something to do with the floating tines on the guard which none of my previous trimmers have had. Regardless, I&#x27;m now in the market for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever had.  Great value. It doesn&#x27;t come with a bunch of worthless accessories that you will never use.  It holds a charge for months while using it 3 or 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a longer setting but it appeared to be the longest setting when I was shopping. I trimmed my beard too close on the longest setting and felt &amp;#34;naked.&amp;#34; Construction and function all seem excellent... just the length limitation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a cheapo beard trimming kit for a couple years, and it got the job done, but this little machine gets the job done with style. It trims very close when you need it to, and the adjustable length attachment works flawlessly. The blade is made from quality material, and you get a replacement anyway. It should last a while.</li>
            <li> I like the weightless and the 3 options of blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;opening for cleaning is not as handy as my previous one since you have to remove the whole lid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that is a good product</li>
            <li> I actually like this one. After I finally had to give up on a different brand due to battery failure and I could not obtain a replacement, One warning!.................... if you are trimming a line, such as the mustache/lip line without the guard on you WILL cut yourself. My wife uses it to trim the back of my hair and I end up with a blood bead necklace. Even me trimming my lip line cannot totally avoid the problem. Overalla good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not only purchased this razor once, but twice!  I love it.  I&#x27;ve sported a beard since I was about 14 years old, and it&#x27;s become part of what people notice when they see me.  It&#x27;s always well-kept, and I&#x27;m more picky about how my beard looks than my hair.  The great thing about this razor is not only that it does the job without pulling your hairs out, but that it comes with three different attachments.  I only use one as I like my beard a certain way, but the second razor was purchased for my father who&#x27;s been using the old razor &amp; cream for years.  I use this trimmer with absolutely zero cream/moisturizer, and never a painful moment.  My father is now enjoying the new razor &amp; able to shave in half the time.  My beard grows a lot faster than most, and I&#x27;m constantly trimming it every other day.  With that said &amp; given the thickness of my beard, I&#x27;m able to charge it once per month...sometimes two.  It&#x27;s a great battery &amp; overall great razor!  I highly recommend it if not for the quality, for the price!</li>
            <li> It does not work as well as my last one but it meets my needs. Some reviews have said that you have to go over the area many times to get your whole trim done is very true! but the charge last forever and for the money it is a very good deal. would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband whose old trimmer bit the dust.  This one works well and seems to keep its charge for a sizable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, long-lasting charge to keep your beard at the length you want.</li>
            <li> This is great, my best trimmer yet. Very smooth feel on my face and trims fairly well. A couple of passes gets the job done.</li>
            <li> perfect trimmer for a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer. Works very well and the battery life is amazing. I charged it once when it arrived, and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it since, and that was at least a couple of months ago...</li>
            <li> Awesome....  This cuts really well, and the battery lasts forever on a single charge.  Its also quiet and well made.</li>
            <li> The razor allows hair shaved off to enter into the cavity of the mechanism where the shaving head is at and needs to be constantly cleaned. The last Remington I had when the mechanism was locked in, the shaved off hair ended up in the sink, which is far easier to clean when trimming a beard. Poor design... but as far as trimming goes, it does a good job, just a mess to clean.</li>
            <li> Exellent Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I was living my life without this thing.  It&#x27;s that good!  I had a cheaper trimmer for years and this is worth the extra bucks</li>
            <li> I love this beard trimmer.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying case.  I even knew that going in, but it&#x27;s still bothersome.  It does everything it claims though.  Easy to switch out the 3 blades.  Great for those with a full beard.  Keeps things nice and tight.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, this is my third in the Remington MB line.  Never snags or pulls, no extraneous attachments.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Standard unit of this type with the necessary heads and adjustable comb height for all trimming needs. Charges quickly and can be used for many days before another charge. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand for charging!</li>
            <li> Best beard/mustache trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> The razor worked great for one year, and then it very rapidly began to decline. It&#x27;s a well built enough razor, and though it can take several passes for a clean cut, it does the job aptly enough. For the money it costs, however, it should not start going dead within a minute of turning it on...plugged in or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has no indicator as to whether it is successfully charging or not. The blades are made of solid material, but a lot of the razor is fragile and plastic. Overall, for the money it costs, you would be better off opting for one of Remington&#x27;s low cost models that do about the same sort of job and last about the same amount of time. If you want a piece of equipment that lasts, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge really well, but it will tear yore skin up.  It made me bleed everytime I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of trimmers over the years and each one was &#x27;ok&#x27;, but honestly this one is the best I&#x27;ve had by far, and it&#x27;s cordless to boot! The Lithium battery is really pretty amazing, as I&#x27;ll not charge the thing and use it a few times a week and it&#x27;s still going strong after the final trim. The blades are sharp, I like the built-in adjuster for the trim guard, it really is a great package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those guys that was born with a beard, can shave in the morning and have real stubble by the end of the day, so I gave up on shaving a long time ago and basically every couple days run the trimmer over my face, mow down the side burns and make sure the goatee isn&#x27;t getting too out of control, and this little trimmer does it all very well and hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of slowing down yet. This is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> Absolutely a must have for beard aficionados. The interchangeable heads are a good feature. Battery is average. I get a lot of use out of it as I even use it to trim my hair. Nothing too fancy, but it gets the job done. It would&#x27;ve been much more practical if you could charge it with a USB cable. Keep that in mind if you are someone who travels a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bit of a heads up, it feels as if the lengths run short. I normally trimmed my beard to a 2 or 3 length setting but I have to use a 4 with these clippers.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend last year for Christmas since he has a hard time finding a shaver that can handle thick facial hair. He was immediately in love with it and still has it a year later and it works as great as the first time!!</li>
            <li> This machine gets the job done and it does it well.</li>
            <li> Awesome job on trimming beard and stach!    Don&#x27;t share or you will get AIDS &amp; HEPATITIS and die. Seriously, don&#x27;t share, get your own. I am public health doc! :-)</li>
            <li> While most of the reviews are correct, this is a great beard trimmer for the price, it&#x27;s still on the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; side of the beard trimmers. I&#x27;ve had mine for just at a year and it has become completely useless. Letting it fully charge only results in about one minute of use before the battery dies. Rinse and repeat. I hoped the product would have quite a bit more longevity, but here I am a year later looking for yet another new beard trimmer. When it works, it works well enough.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is pretty much the whole package. It&#x27;s got a ton of adjustable settings (multiple heads, lots of length settings), but length adjustments are quick and easy with a dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful enough to not pull your hair out, and the shortest length setting does a great job of trimming most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far battery life has been great, and it can get a quick charge enough to last through a trim if the battery dies on you mid-trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, and for the ridiculously low price you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find something better.</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally for the stubble look and to trim my sideburns. What I just realized about it that makes it amazing is I have not charged it for a year and a half and it&#x27;s still as powerful as day one. Your milage may vary depending on use.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. I save a ton of money bye using this versus buying razors. Gives a close trim and no razor burn! Battery lasts a super longtime between charges. Easy to clean and is well built.</li>
            <li> Beefy. Very happy with it. Update: 14 months later. Still sharp. Really holds a charge.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk.......too noisy.....blades came off after 2 months....never buy this</li>
            <li> As advertised. Works well on multiple settings, priced right and delivery was very timely.</li>
            <li> Junk. The only good thing about it is that it holds a charge, which my old trimmer would no longer do. Does a poor job of any sort of trimming. Skips, regardless of the head used, resulting in the need to make many passes to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Always used Remington (4th so far) and really not too happy. I used it for both bear and short hair, but the razor doesn&#x27;t cut passing once. You need to pass at least 3 times to cut it all. Okay but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> had an old rimington lasted me way past 2year warrenty period gave great cut&#x27;s til the very end of it&#x27;s life same model no reason to not get the same quality very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> worked great for almost a full year. battery wont hold a full charge and wont work plugged in long enough to trim a full beard</li>
            <li> Good trimmer. Does not have an ear/nose trimmer which is common amongst others</li>
            <li> Cuts like it should and easy to use. Need to make several passes to get everything the same length. Works well.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for a year, but Battery no longer holds a charge.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of a Remington and this model is very much better.  As others have said, the duration of a charged battery is hugely better than the old model that used NiCad batteries.  The built in cutting depth adjustment feature works perfectly and the interchangeable cutting blades are clearly well crafted and do exactly as promised.  All-in-all a fine product.&lt;br /&gt; ________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE -  * BAD BATTERY !! *  After a little over two years of just light use the battery will no longer hold a charge.  Now a person may think that two years is long enough but not when you consider the specifics.  In my case, I give myself a beard trim and haircut about once every three weeks and this takes about 15 minutes at the most.  Therefore over the 27 months that I was using this cutter I would have actually used it about 38 times.  Compare that to my Braun electric toothbrush with I use for two minutes twice per day - every day and has been going strong for years (I don&#x27;t even remember when I bought it) .  .  .  and is still working great.  The electrical effort to operate my toothbrush is very similar to what is required to vibrate the cutter blades of a hair trimmer.  I believe that Remington has either designed this cutter with an undersized battery and/or they are using poor quality batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line . . .  it&#x27;s a good quality cutter but be prepared to buy a new one about every two years.  Personally, I decided to try another brand this time.</li>
            <li> First one died out after 2 months....Pulls and rips out hair</li>
            <li> After only 6 months the battery has stopped holding a charge for more than a minute or two so I would not recommend buying this product. I contacted Remington and received no response from their customer service. I have since purchased a similar Braun product and definitely won&#x27;t purchase any Remington times in the future.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this purchase.  Lithium Ion battery is noticeably more powerful than the old NiCad trimmer I replaced.  Cuts hair cleanly without pulling and I find I do not have to go over the same areas as much as I used to in order to get an even trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to point out the plastic height adjustment / guard since when I was shopping for this I really had to dig to find info about it.  Works about the same as previous trimmers I have used in the past, but seems sturdier with a thicker plastic.  I have had a guard break on me before (different brand/model) and I don&#x27;t see that happening with this one.  Looks like they updated the images since I bought mine, so you can actually see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE the interchangeable blades.  Though I have a goatee I just use the beard trimmer and it does the job.  The stubble blade is excellent for more delicate areas.  Since the gaps between the teeth are so much narrower it does not catch skin in between like I have experienced (painfully) with other trimmers.  It is also very easy to sterilize in between uses since you can just pop the blades out with the press of a button.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver, I use it daily and does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband needed and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Shave worked fine for several months and all of a sudden just stopped working.  I guess they should sell it as a disposable shaver.</li>
            <li> It works  just  couldn&#x27;t  do  the job I needed  it might be fine for some  one else</li>
            <li> Trims decently well. I have very thick whiskers so it requires me to go over my face a few times in a row before everything is uniformly trimmed. I only use one of the heads. The adjustable length feature is very handy, and the trimmer holds its charge for a very long time. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Have used it for months now and love it.  The battery life lasts for a VERY long time.  Great product.</li>
            <li> So far so good as this shaver is doing what I expect to in shaving my goatee.  Good value for the price and even better than more expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> Everybody, and I mean everybody thinks I am a total stud (an old one) now that I have been using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and a half, and even though it&#x27;s plugged into the wall, its power will only last for about half the time it takes me to give my beard its weekly trim.  Not sure if this is a product defect in mine or not, but that renders it pretty useless.</li>
            <li> Returning this today.  Received item on March 12, 2015. Charged for over 30 hours and notice battery indicator light was not on. Trimmer never charged therefore I cant speak on how they cut. What a waste. Im sure some people are happy with this product, but Remington is producing to many defective units. Im going to try panasonic.</li>
            <li> Awkward to hold. Doesn&#x27;t give a nice, clean buzz cut, instead it kind of shreds the hair in all directions, so his hair looks messy and &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; so I have to keep going over the same area a few times to get all the hair it missed and smooth it out.</li>
            <li> This little guy has been running on the same charge for over three months. That fact alone would be enough for me to love this trimmer, but its precise settings and versatility make it an ideal companion for any hairy chested or bearded man.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to do! What really surprised me was the battery life. Most reviewers claim that they go very long periods at a time and they haven&#x27;t had to charge it, and I&#x27;m pleased to say that I&#x27;ve had the same experience! I&#x27;ve had it for about 4 months now, and I&#x27;ve only had to charge it 2 or 3 times, which is impressive considering I use it several times a week!</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer for about 9 months and it did the job fine during this time. In fact, I only charged it once during this entire period. I even used it in the shower! However, after awhile I noticed that hair had become stuck under the top metal trimmer attachment. I popped it off and washed it. It worked for another day but then the battery died permanently :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the product says it is &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34; but I would use a brush instead of rinsing it. The battery can get water on it when the metal head is popped off so keep that in mind. I also noticed that the metal under the trimmer head had rusted pretty bad. I&#x27;m not sure if it affected the performance as all the moving parts seems to be rust-resistant. For a $30 trimmer it probably isn&#x27;t any better than a $15 Wahl trimmer from target or amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: gets job done. comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Rusts, expensive, and not washable.</li>
            <li> lightweight and easy to manipulate. operates as it should giving a clean line and fresh look to my son&#x27;s hairline and beard</li>
            <li> Works as good as any I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome. I&#x27;ve had for a few months I remember charging it once I use it every two or three days. Gives my brad trim at the perfect length. Under my neck I like to have just stubble as close to skin without trimming as shaving gives severe razor burn no matter what and has a blade that leaves it feeling smooth and feels comfortable and does not cut during use. If I somehow break this one I would definitely buy another.</li>
            <li> It does an OK job. I still have to do a lot of trimming with scissors to get everything looking neat, but it gets all the facial hair down to the length that I want quicker than scissors and a comb. I haven&#x27;t used less expensive trimmers, but I suspect that some of them do just as well. I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to comment on battery life.</li>
            <li> Did not trim as short/close with guard on #1 as my past remington product.&lt;br /&gt;If you do not need the &amp;#34;stubble look&amp;#34; this is a good trimmer. But if you want a close, but not shaved looked there are other options.&lt;br /&gt;I returned this and got&lt;br /&gt;Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard&lt;br /&gt;It Trims much closer.</li>
            <li> The last time I had a beard I trimmed it with a sharp shard of rock, so I have no past history with electric trimmers--no model to compare to the MB4040  which I bought for my new beard (7 weeks). It has  done the job very well so far.  The blade is delicate and goes off track fairly easily when it&#x27;s out of the trimmer for cleaning, or I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have used trimmers like these in the past and, for the most part, most of them: 1) Require you to oil the blades, which is messy and annoying and 2) Run out of juice in a relatively short period of time. This Remington trimmer is the best I have ever used. The blades need no oiling and the battery last a long, long, long time. I am very pleased with this and would recommend it to anyone needing a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> So this beard trimmer seemed to work OK for a while, and the motor was strong enough to cut through thick hair pretty easily. The plastic guard, however, never seemed to work properly, because it assumes that you&#x27;re holding the beard trimmer such that the blades are perpendicular to your hair fibers. If you tip the razor towards parallel, then the guard does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things seemed to be ok, but at some point a few months ago my trimmer stopped being able to hold a charge, so now I can&#x27;t use it at all, not even when it&#x27;s plugged in! The warranty expired almost a year ago, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s acceptable to have something like this die after only a year of using it once every 3 to 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> The stubble blade attachment gets very close.  This is much better than any other trimmer I have used for my head and face.  Take the time and pamper your skin; as you should. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Finally stepped up to a Lithium Powered trimmer, and have been very happy with this one for over 9 months so far. My last few trimmers would already be down to only doing one shave per charge by now, but this one just keeps on cutting. So bottom line, it does it&#x27;s job well, and seems as if it will continue to do just that, which is all I could ask for.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. I charged it when I purchased it almost a year ago and lost the charger and it&#x27;s still going strong. I use it just about every day. Unbelievable. And it will trim your beard at whatever length you like, from lumberjack to 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Conair razor.  Works great, very sharp, stays charged for many uses.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is terrific. Outstanding battery life and trims easily with great consistency. It also feels nice in the hand. Great quality at a fair price as expected from Remington. I use it once per week to keep my beard in check.</li>
            <li> I had the Remington Ni-cad battery trimmer for 8 years and never had a problem with it until I dropped it and broke the head off. I wanted to buy the same one but I decided to upgrade to the lithium Ion battery. I have been using this for over an year and still works great. Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> This thing works real well, you can shave and it has little snag on hairs.  The cut is smooth and i like the ability to adjust the height of the shave as well.  Its light, it shaves nicely and the heads pop off easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use out of this trimmer and I use it to trim about once a week, but even in all that time I think I have charged it once. It seems to have an extremely long battery life! In negatives one thing I find is that it doesn&#x27;t trim my beard around the neck as evenly and it can be physically tricky trimming around the mustache area when using the trimmer head.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a trimmer that got broken recently, and I am very happy with this purchase.  I was a little leary of the plastic piece that is used to adjust the length, but it works very well, and the length setting holds securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use 2 of the 3 different blades included, but they both work well for their intended purposes.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer did not charge from the beginning. I&#x27;m wondering what is the quality control at this brand. Got a replacement from amazon tough. I hope this one will last longer</li>
            <li> good product - works as advertised.  Prompt shipment.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> trims beard very good. note that you have to use the longer settings or beard will be to short.</li>
            <li> Works well so far. It&#x27;s a trimmer, it ether works or it does not so the review is pretty simple.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Holds a charge for ever.</li>
            <li> It cuts unevenly and the hair pulling is very bad and painful. It does have a a stable setting for length and the battery seems good.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this beard trimmer just does not perform well. I had the Phillips Norelco vacuum beard trimmer before but lost the chord and decided to try a new brand. This Remington beard trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim well for the &amp;#34;3 day stubble&amp;#34; look. That is all that I have used it for and so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this product for more full beard trimming. My Norelco was able to adjust by mm and thus I was able to really zero in on the exact length that I particularly like. The Remington tries to do this but the shortest length is still a tad too long for what I like and without the guard on (just using the blade) is too short so I am stuck with an inability to get to the perfect length. Also I noticed that this Remington doesn&#x27;t cut very consistently. I have to go over my face many more times than I did with the Norelco. And it doesn&#x27;t trim very well around the curves of the face, under the nose/upper lip, and on the chin. Disappointment all the way around. I am going to have to buy my Norelco again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many trimmers and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve used. It is straight forward and gets the job done efficiently without all the bells and whistles some of the expensive items have. I save a lot of time since it trims it the first time around without having to constantly go over the same area 3-4 times. The battery lasts me weeks before having to charge it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Loud a heck.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job, but mannnnnn the motor buzzes at a high pitch.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a trimmer to keep my beard down to a stubble length, this seems to do it adequately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously had the Wahl PEANUT battery.  It was perfect size for beard only...  But it was limited to only a few blade guard lengths, and one of them broke a tooth off.... leaving a large gap in the comb and I was worried that my beard would get an uneven cut.  The length wasn&#x27;t short enough either.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does what it needs to do, however make sure you keep the guard on it or it will indeed cut you.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my worn out, old trimmer.  I wear a goatee, and like it to have a &amp;#34;stubble/scruff&amp;#34; look to it (very short).  The MB4040 has many length settings, so you should be able to find the precise length that you want.  This trimmer does do the job, but just not as well as my old Remington trimmer.  I find that in order to obtain an even trim I have to go over the same area multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally dark, coarse facial hair.  I also am starting to get some gray peppered in.  One issue that I&#x27;ve had with other trimmers is that some of them tend to pull my hair due to the coarseness of it.  The MB4040 doesn&#x27;t pull.  It is powerful enough to trim without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main drawback is the gray hair.  For some reason I haven&#x27;t been able to find a trimmer that will trim these stray hairs along with the dark hair.  So, I have to go over the gray hairs a few times in order for the trimmer to cut them.....or else I would have short dark hair with long gray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest positive is the battery life.  I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few weeks.  I use it once or twice a week, and have only had to charge it one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product - especially if you have thinner facial hair.</li>
            <li> Loved it for 1 year, now won&#x27;t hold a charge, and can&#x27;t find replacement battery.  And it won&#x27;t run plugged in.  Thus it&#x27;s a throwaway.  My husband is now shopping for something else that will last him at least a few years.  Maybe a corded one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for ~2 years. Using it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: long battery life, light, affordable, several lengths&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: started pulling my hair after 2 years, no way to lock off so sometimes would turn on in my suitcase and arrive with a dead battery (fixed by taping a small piece of matchstick in on/off depression), requires several passes for an even cut</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the MB series trimmers before and would give them 5 stars except for their battery life.  Trimmed great and awesome adjustable/removable guard with the scroll wheel/number system.  However, they would always last for about a year then not hold a charge well and you&#x27;d have to buy a new one.  If only the battery was better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Remington comes out with the Lithium Ion battery version.  That&#x27;s great and now the trimmer is perfect, right!?!?  Well, they also, FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER, decided, \\&quot;Wow we need to redesign our new trimmer to show off the new fancy battery!\\&quot;  Instead of just replacing the battery pack, they redesigned the body of the trimmer, new shape, added crappy plastic chrome and such, but the problem is the guard was also changed.  Now the guard will catch on your beard and pull hairs every couple of seconds or so.  I have a short beard and it will pull any length hair. This makes painful trimming!  Also, for some reason I find I have to go over my face many more times to get all the hairs that used to stand up better, and therefore get trimmed with fewer passes, using the old guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use this trimmer only for certain things:  for under my nose, fading into my hairline, and without the guard.  I use a Phillips Norelco (the vacuum type) for the rest which is 95% of my face.  The P.N. trims MUCH faster with fewer passes.  It just has that bulky vacuum that gets in the way, and the guard adjustment measuring system is completely useless as it doesn&#x27;t line up with any of the measurements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having to use 2 different trimmers sucks, but neither do the job completely (anymore).  I recommend passing on the Lithium Ion version of the Remington and just get the other models with the old battery and just know you&#x27;ll have to replace it every year or so, and you&#x27;ll need to remember to charge it after/before every use.</li>
            <li> Bought this model based on the reviews. Well pleased with how it works. one two three four five six seven</li>
            <li> Great product. Reasonably quiet.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed.  I shave with this (not just trim)</li>
            <li> I use bought this because the older model I had battery died.  The battery on this one lasts much longer.  This is a nice product.  My son like buzz cuts and I use this to give him a haircut at home instead of spending $15 and an  hour of time at the haircut place.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to write, the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t take much a charge or the blades wouldn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;n the process of sending it back right now. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This was a Father&#x27;s Day gift for hubby.  He loves it!!!  Loves its precision and ease of use.  This one replaced an old Remington that worked great for years but it was dropped and the housing cracked.  It lasted for so long I saw no reason to try another brand and hubby concurs.  Remington is awesome.</li>
            <li> Item was a replacement for an older model that had finally given up. So far the performance has been excellent and the additional attachments are a welcomed feature.</li>
            <li> Product just does not work.  It turned on when I first opened it.  Read the instructions and began charging it.  Thought it was weird the charging light only stayed on for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the recommended time to charge, I unplugged and now it does nothing.  Won&#x27;t turn on, won&#x27;t charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting to call Remington but the time hasn&#x27;t been there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hit and miss with shavers/body groomers, in my experience.  I bought this to use for my beard and a little &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; and it blew my expectations away.  It&#x27;s powerful and feels of good quality.  The adjustable comb is a nice feature, too.  I mean, it&#x27;s a trimmer.  Nothing huge to report on, as far as that goes.  Works as expected.  BUT, the batter lasts FOREVER.  I can&#x27;t tell you how happy that makes me, especially since it&#x27;s so powerful.  Figured it would be like every other shaver and barely last a few days.  On one charge it has shaved my chest/back/neck multiple times over the course of a month.  Beard, too.  It just keeps going.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a razor with this kind of power and battery life, together.  Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.  I&#x27;ve only used one of the blades, however, so I can&#x27;t report on the other two or three that came with it.</li>
            <li> Did not realize how sad my old Norelco trimmer had become until I started using this. Love the lithium ion battery, powerful motor and sharp blades. Feels solid and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Works about what I expected, nothing great, doesn&#x27;t  get all of my wiskers</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;If you need to trim a beard or hair...it sort of does that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;The plastic guard seems cheap and gives an inconsistent setting. Depending on how you hold the trimmer, you either end up not cutting any hair, or shaving your face bald. Most guys will want the lowest setting for the trimmer, which only increases the risk of creating bald patches.&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimming head is terrible. It bulls the hair on your face in a way that I cannot begin to describe. I switched to using the &amp;#34;scruff&amp;#34; trimming head, and that seems to pull less because the teeth extend across the entire front of the head and minimize the gaps between the guard and the head that pulls the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: skip it.</li>
            <li> Best razor I ever owned!! Bought one for my Dad and one for my son. They also love it! Battery will last for at least 5 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitive face so I cant use a foil or straight razor. This gets close enough to look like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> I searched for a couple of months to find the right trimmer. When I came across this one it had everything I was looking for and the price was right also. It is working much better than I was expecting. I use it a few times a week and only had to charge it twice since I bought it December of 2012, 1-year this month. It feels very well made, not cheap plastic like alot of others. I do not experience pulling or any other discomfort. I love the wheel where you can set it for the lengh you prefer. Cleaning it is very easy and the attachments exchange very easy. The best thing is how long the battery lasts. I used it for nearly 6 months before I had to charge it and it is almost another 6 months and its still going strong. I also sounds very powerful when running. You will not be dissapointed in this one. Amazon got it here in 2 days with my prime shipping.</li>
            <li> The MB4040 is a very good product that basically does the job it purports to accomplish.  It lacks some desired results, but probably all competing products do as well.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t live upto even the basic standards. It cuts my skin whenever i try a finer trim. I never had this issue with trimmers from other brands (wahl,philips).</li>
            <li> Incredible battery life. Cuts like a champ</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying the four stars have nothing to do with the performance of the trimmer, it cuts FANTASTIC its smooth and perfectly contoured for fitment in hand and the blades are super sharp. My complaint however has to do with the lack of a proper ABS or some sort of solid plastic holding tray for the cutter and the accessories instead of the card board thing that it came in and the fact that no blade lube was included in the package, that being said I would still recommend the trimmer to anyone that wants a great trimming/shaving experience. The blade changes are quick and easy also making for easy clean up, the whole things feels great and very solid in hand, it&#x27;s not so light as to feel inferior, the battery life is also great, in my opinion this is probably one of the better things that Amazon sells......Go get one, order today.</li>
            <li> i plugged my remington into 220v outlet and it doesnt work now. can anyone say what can i do now?? i bought it two weeks ago...</li>
            <li> After only a dozen or so battery charges under occasional use the battery will no longer take a charge that lasts more than five minutes. Nice design but not worth the money because of the poor battery technology</li>
            <li> My husband loves this - he said it&#x27;s the best one he&#x27;s ever owned. The battery stays charged Forever!!!</li>
            <li> Had the Remington MB-200 before this one. I bought the MB4040 because of the longer battery life and more features. It was more expensive at the time but I thought it was worth it. Turns out that this one doesn&#x27;t cut very well. I need to go over many times and even then it doesn&#x27;t look evenly cut or that clean. NOWWW the MB200 and MB4040 are the same price... all the features can&#x27;t make up for the poor function. MB200 has short battery life and doesn&#x27;t look as fancy but cuts more evenly and does a better job. If you had the MB200 and are thinking about getting this one, don&#x27;t. Stick with what works.</li>
            <li> This cutting machine is quite good, I am not disappointed by it. eight more words are needed for this to finish</li>
            <li> Works great. Comes with different attachments also. Well worth the cost. Plastic depth cover for cutting hair at different length is the only piece that you need to be careful with, not as robust as it should be, but it does work well. Get one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hardheartedly recommend this trimmer for the flexibility of interchangeable blades to the clean cuts it makes.  It is a step above the previous 4040 model I have used for years.</li>
            <li> Product works very well, adjustable, quiet and works great. Would highly recommend. Great price and quality, extra heads work great for different beard styles.</li>
            <li> Used it 2 months without charging.  Great battery life!</li>
            <li> saves me $$ instead of letting the barber do my beard</li>
            <li> Dollar for Dollar this is the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I wear my beard pretty short and this trimmer has been nothing short of exactly what I wanted and needed.  The build quality is good, the Batter life will baffle you as it never sees to rum out.  I use it twice a week and have only charged it 4 times and have owned it for a year!  I highly recommend this trimmer if you are looking for one under $60.</li>
            <li> I love the long-lasting lithium battery in this unit.  As other reviewers have said, this pulled my beard hairs..  I switched the cutting blades out to the set with the &amp;#34;finer teeth&amp;#34; and no more pulling!  Only the blade set with the &amp;#34;coarser&amp;#34; teeth pulled my beard hairs.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor battery life</li>
            <li> Save your money.  This product only gave me 2 months of service before it quit.</li>
            <li> I gave it a five for getting the job done and a long battery life.  At first I questioned the guard setup, but I am quite pleased with quality afterall.  I love the lithium battery cause it holds a charge.  If you are in the market for a razor to trim your beard, mustache, goatee, balls or whatever, this will do the job!</li>
            <li> This is a well put together trimmer.  I had a cheaper set with multiple combs from Norelco (I think) and it was OK but it didn&#x27;t have the power or blades for my thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have given this 5 stars if it came with a case of some sort to keep the extra heads in, and a brush for cleaning would be nice.</li>
            <li> If you want something to maintain stubble or a short beard, this is the one.  The guard system is easy to use.  It&#x27;s alos nice to only have one guard to keep track of.  The battery life is great.  I&#x27;ve had it for months nad have only had to recharge once in that time.  The &amp;#34;mustache trimmer&amp;#34; head that is included is also pretty handy as it is basically a very small (in width) trimmer head.</li>
            <li> The battery life on this is awesome. I have not charged it since my purchase, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works great, my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> I only shave once per week, so I don&#x27;t bother to aim for a clean shave because that would be rough on my skin, and because I like the unshaven look.  You can remove the adjustable plastic guard to get a clean shave, but I only do that for small spots.  This is definitely not a clean-shave tool.  The plastic guard can be set for ten different cutting lengths, &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; being the shortest.  I always use setting &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and found that it didn&#x27;t cut short enough to look like an unshaven shave.  It looked more like a very tightly trimmed beard.  I was unhappy with that but kept it because it has great battery life and mechanical reliability.  I recharge once a month and could probably go longer between charges.  By chance I discovered that on setting &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; I can turn the shaver upside-down and it gives me a significantly closer shave, leaving me with stubble only.  This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve been through more than 5 beard trimmers over the years, most the rechargeable type and most around $25. This one feels more substantial than the cheapies I&#x27;ve used and the height settings are solid (don&#x27;t slip). Also the trim height uses small increments which I like.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth wearing a beard, usually more in the winter. I looked around for a good trimmer locally, couldn&#x27;t find anything and shopped Amazon. After a lot of searching, I kept coming back to the MB4040 because of the reviews. The price was too go to pass up. It&#x27;s been a few weeks since it arrived, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It feels solid and well built. I like that I&#x27;m able to change the blades, also.</li>
            <li> Has great power.Update I&#x27;ve had this razer for about a year and now won&#x27;t hold a charge for more then 2-4 mins.I did love this razer when I first got it but now looking back if it&#x27;s only going to last a year then it&#x27;s not worth it.New Update I&#x27;ve contacted the company and they are replacing with a better model for free.Great  customer service .</li>
            <li> battery seems to be having trouble and finding it to be sluggish in operation,</li>
            <li> Great gift for my husband</li>
            <li> Does a great job trimming mustache, love everything about it.  Long lasting battery. good for traveling also. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Trims pretty well. Adjustable guides take some practice, but when you use it with the power switch and dial facing away from your face (per the instructions) it works pretty well. Only the main trimmer is useful, the fine trimmer and goalie trimmer didn&#x27;t seem useful to me.</li>
            <li> I got tired of my other brand not lasting than a few more months, so I tried a remington.  It is not good for body grooming and the bldes catch and pull beard hairs often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model for many years. [[ASIN:B00006IV4B Remington Precision Grooming Travel Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it would die I would just buy another one - usually retail. The last one I bought only lasted about 6 months so I started looking for another model. This MB4040 has the best reviews on Amazon. And the price is only slightly more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great trimmer WAY better than the cheaper Remington. It comes with 3 sets of blades so it should last several years. It cuts with a lot authority - makes the other Remington look like a joke. I think I could give myself a military buzz cut with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue: I live abroad and this is a 220 volt world out here. The charger is 110 only. I didn&#x27;t notice that and plugged it in. The charger expired in about 2 seconds. I made a good charger out of a 5 volt adapter I had in the parts bin and cut the old charger cord to get the Remington plug. The trimmer was not damaged in the incident. All is well - 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Does not cut quite close enough unless ou do it by hand which I&#x27;ve been doing for years. I had hoped to be able to get more of a stubble look with it. Really like the battery.</li>
            <li> Breaks too easily, loses ability to hold charge altogether after about three-four months.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust, easy to clean up. You can pull the adjustable comb off easily to change the cutting head if you wish... which is also simple to do.  I had a unit with a bunch of separate combs and a stand for the trimmer, brush, oil, etc... but it was a huge dust collector on the bathroom counter. Just chuck this one in the drawer or shaving kit when you aren&#x27;t using it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks on the first charge.  Nice to see it doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in every day to do the job.  Great value as well...</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, works well and shaves really close to skin. The only problem I have with it, is that it has to be at a certain angle to not pull hair. I will rate it a 4 out of 5, just for that reason.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Remington SCC-100 clippers and the chargers are interchangeable but have different voltages. I suggest marking them to match one another.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big, and the lowest setting still leaves my beard too long. It feels like a well built unit, and so far it&#x27;s holding charge well.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, the cord failed after one use. But I called up Remington and they sent out a new one right away.&lt;br /&gt;No more issues and it works great. The battery life is very good and the adjustable attachment keeps your bathroom from getting cluttered.</li>
            <li> Bead trimmer when kept at 1 and trimmed its sooo bad that it almost takes you skin out if not not careful , happened once or twice and is very very delicate ,it has been dropped from a meter height it broke.I bought this as I thought Remington is a good brand , its so false and it also leaves some patches if u keep it at 2 and 1 will cut u through , so over all utter disspointment and will never recommend any Remington trimmer to anyone</li>
            <li> First, let me state that these clippers are good, but I wanted something that I can have a ONE OVER and get a shadow look, and they cut too close.  By Shadow, I mean maybe a NEAT 3-4 day look, not 1 day look.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to turn a one-year wizard beard into something more respectable.  The trimmer does very well, and keeps everything tidy.  The actual trimming blade is very good at what it does.  My thick curly beard hairs are cut with no pulling.  The dial to adjust the guard length is sturdy, so you&#x27;re less likely to accidentally trim your beard much shorter than you intend.  For some of the harder spots on your face, typically under the neck, you might have to use one hand to hold your hair while you trim, but this is an issue with any trimmer in this price range.  For even the harder spots, I go over my face 2-3 times to get my beard trimmed as I want.  The after cleanup could be improved, but only takes about a minute.  There are a lot of small grooves under the trimmer for hair to get stuck in, so you&#x27;ll want to keep some canned air.  I can&#x27;t speak for the shorter trimmers, but if they&#x27;re like the beard trimmer, this will do a great job turning your face into a mansterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One major issue with this trimmer is it&#x27;s built with the durability of a five-dollar trimmer.  I bought this only two months ago, and I&#x27;m already having major issues with the motor not starting.  Even with a full charge, I have to try over and over again--turning off and then back on--to get it to start.  What works for me is shaking the device down as I turn it on, like I&#x27;m shaking water off it.  Even for a $30 device, I should get at least six months before major issues.  Unfortunately, Remington&#x27;s warranty is only for 60 days.  Adding to that, the device snaps together and screws in such that you can&#x27;t figure out how to open it up and fix any issue you get, so it&#x27;s not easy to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great when it lasts, but it&#x27;s not built well enough to last that long, and not easy to fix.  I&#x27;d recommend as a cheap trimmer to hold you over while you save up for something good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes it and uses it often.  He wore out one of these already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 years old and have NEVER attempted growing any facial hair...US Air Force and now ex-wife would not allow it...so this is my first shot at growing a beard -- it&#x27;s coming in a bit spotty.  I ordered this to trim it up, and upon initial use, I&#x27;m gonna keep trying, as it evened out my scruff well &amp; worked smoothly...</li>
            <li> There are two things in life so simple that you can not screw it up. One is cole slaw and the other a beard trimmer. But somehow, they did. Remington is a name I&#x27;ve known and trusted for over 50 years, but this trimmer cannot hold a candle to the cheaper Braun that it replaced. I have to go over and over an area, and even then it&#x27;s just a bad, uneven trim. I&#x27;ve read the manual. Done everything right. It&#x27;s just bad. Really bad.</li>
            <li> I ordered this around Christmas 2012 hoping to find a decent trimmer that I could use around twice a week. The battery finally ran out of charge today (Sept 20 2013). Incredible battery and great design.</li>
            <li> Very good..serves u well to maintain stubble.</li>
            <li> No problems with battery life. Actual performance is bad. With one right out of the box I&#x27;ve had to go over the same spot 40+ times to make it decent (plenty of stubborn hairs left). It&#x27;s junk.</li>
            <li> Had other models, this is the best so far.  Like the different metal heads</li>
            <li> Probably the best value out of all of the trimmers.  And certainly one of the best trimmers for numerous reasons:  Lithium batteries are simply the best.  The other types are much cheaper, but wear out often inside of a year.  Lithium lasts for many years, and this holds a charge for well over an hour.  Mine&#x27;s three years old, and I took it on a month long vacation last summer, used it every other day, no charger no problem.&lt;br /&gt; Plus these batteries have more torque to keep the blades moving through thick hair without getting stuck and binding.  It also has excellent commercial style blades compared to other brands.  And the build overall is a very simple commercial build-  You don&#x27;t have to keep swapping out parts to get through your morning routine.  The thick plastic guard stays on the unit and there&#x27;s a handy wheel to click the height up and down.  And the guard pops off easily to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; or trim tight around your beard or goatee.  For instance I have a goatee, so I pull of the guard, and use the blade alone directly against my skin to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; my face except for my goatee.  And then I pop the guard on and trim my goatee.&lt;br /&gt; One move and super easy.  As an FYI, Remington recommends the Main (not the stubble) blade for the closest cut.  You have to be a tad bit careful directly against the skin, but not very.  This blade gives me about a one day stubble, which most days is clean enough for me.  And when I need to I shave with a blade.  The stubble blade has much finer teeth, but oddly shaves to about a two day/ slightly longer cut.  And for my thick hair, the stubble blade catches way more.  I leave the main blade on all the time.  After three years it seems to be dulling a bit, so I just ordered two new blades online from Remington for $7.99 each.  Nice they offer those, since the unit will likely last for years.  In short, it&#x27;s industrial, simple to use, and works great, which keeps things simple for me, just the way I like it!</li>
            <li> Worked well initially, but after 10 months of light use the battery won&#x27;t recharge to full and doesn&#x27;t last long enough to trim my beard. I followed the user manual instructions for fully discharging and recharging the batteries, but no luck. Defective battery.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me ,pinches no stand for it I donated it to charity</li>
            <li> Works great, great power, easy to use and easy to adjust the height.  The only thing that keeps me from giving it the extra star is it doesn&#x27;t have a stand.  Great trimmer though and would recommend it to any guy.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has ceased working after only a few uses. It no longer holds a charge, less than 4 months into its service life as a once-a-week-trimmer. Sadly it is useless junk, stay away.</li>
            <li> Bought in Oct.,2013. Worked fine for one year. Then the battery would only hold a 5 minute charge, at best. Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough. Pinches and pulls at beard hairs. I use clippers because I don&#x27;t like torturing my face, so pinching and yanking hairs rather than smoothly trimming them is a deal breaker. Had an MB200 which I loved, but sadly this is not the better-battery-life replacement for which I&#x27;d hoped. Have since switched to Norelco.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product for the price. Simple functions and great results, just how most men prefer it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, long-lasting battery, powerful motor.  MUCH better than the inexpensive MB200 I previously purchased.</li>
            <li> Absolutely ridiculous.  I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for not even a whole year and the battery will NOT hold a charge anymore.  I never write Amazon reviews, but I feel I&#x27;m obligated to let everyone know so that they do not buy this trimmer despite the high average rating for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background:  I use this trimmer to trim my beard maybe once, twice weekly, averaging a use of up to 1 hour a week, and that&#x27;s being generous.  I started off using an old model of Remington&#x27;s trimmers (now discontinued, used batteries) and had to upgrade once the trimmer attachment broke.  I decided on the MB200 which has THE SAME PROBLEM as this one: the battery fails to hold a charge after a few months&#x27; use.  I ended up buying this one after the MB200 failed and, sure enough, the SAME THING HAPPENS WITH THIS MODEL.  Neither of the chargers will trim for longer than 2 minutes now.  I guess you get what you pay for, but Remington seriously needs to rethink the products they&#x27;re putting out.  Because of this, I won&#x27;t be buying another cheap Remington product again.</li>
            <li> Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard...&lt;br /&gt;Pulls unexpectedly now and then, battery last forever, perfect for my beard.</li>
            <li> Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer is a great trimmer . and very inexpensive for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It felt cheap and not well made. There were too many detachable parts to this, which made it too messy. The need to switch heads is annoying. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new trimmer to replace my old one. This trimmer works like a dream and shaves very well, the interchangeable trimmer blades is a nice touch and makes this trimmer very versatile. I am very impressed at how well this trimmer works; the rechargeable future is nice as well.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer. Very powerful and the battery certainly last a lot longer than my previous one. I like the simple design of this product. Great product overall.</li>
            <li> Battery best out, bare razor cuts dangerously close, Plastic Attachment comb is trash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it up day one and 6 months later it still has not gone dead!  Unreal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor cuts unbelievably close!  It is so sharp that I can not cut underneath my chin because it will cut me!  Excellent for trimming, shaping up, and getting a close cut on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the combs on the Plastic Attachment piece broke within 2 months!  Now I can not get an even cut for the times when I want to have some facial hair remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is so cheap that it almost makes no sense in trying to find another attachment comb.  But the real question is .... do I want to risk buying another one?  I still have not answered that question myself and have switched back to the old school razor</li>
            <li> I grow a goatee for a few months each winter and need to trim it about once a week.  For the last 10 years, I&#x27;ve used a very simply designed Norelco trimmer with no complicated attachments.  Unfortunately, the Norelco died on me a few months ago.  I set out in search of a simple trimmer and purchased the Remington MB4040 rechargeable trimmer, which looks somewhat like the old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now used the Remington trimmer about 6 times.  It is horrible; possibly the worst designed product I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Its intended purpose is to trim hair without trimming skin and it fails miserably.  The blade cover is flexible...what genius thought that was a good idea?  The flexible cover prevents uniform hair length trimming and allows the blade to contact skin.  Do their engineers test products before production?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially convinced it was a user error, I have tried to shave with the trimmer in every conceivable orientation, but it still pulls hair and nicks skin...EVERY TIME.  I shave like a nervous cat now, expecting the painful tug &amp; tear at any moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased hundreds of products from Amazon over the years and maybe left one prior review.  That should tell you something about my feeling on this crummy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run from this thing.  I am going to search for a replacement and get rid of this medieval torture device.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be the last electric beard trimmer I owned......WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery is GREAT! Quick Charge! But thats it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned this for about 9 months and all the attachments have broke on me. After about a month, the attachment heads starting falling apart and while i able to put them back together, they eventually all completely broke. The metal teeth on one of the attachments actually chipped away. I&#x27;m not a heavy shaver, probably at most a couple times a week. Do not buy this. The search continues.........</li>
            <li> Was pretty happy with this trimmer, but after having it for one year it won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 1 minute. My last Remington lasted 8 years, so I&#x27;m a little disappointed. it wasn&#x27;t that expensive , but don&#x27;t know if I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> One of the few trimmers that doesn&#x27;t pull your hair. If you press too  hard on your skin, it will give you a little cut.</li>
            <li> I have had this thing for 2 years and its still working strong. I hate shaving, this baby lets me have permanent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> My first trimmer and it works well.  I find I keep a shorter beard because it is easier.  I bought it thinking the 5/8&amp;#34; max setting (9) would be too short.  I find myself using half that because it is easier to keep.  Placing the plastic guard on does require looking at the shape, but it only fits on one way.  The setting stays set even when you remove and replace the guard.  As a first time user the hardest thing for me was to learn to hold the unit perpendicular to the face.  This seems obvious once you use it for a while, but the curved design makes one want to hold it like a toothbrush.  You can trim up your hair or make shaving less painful by pre-trimming the areas I shave.  After a few days a shave can be a little uncomfortable, but pre-trimming helps solve that problem.  The battery charged quickly the first time and I have not charged it for a couple weeks.  I plan to charge it about every two weeks.  There is no pulling with any of the blades.  Longer beards are harder to trim because hair can stay curled below the cutting surface which is why I went to a shorter beard.  It is a great product, and for the price, it is a good value.</li>
            <li> Great Product I like it, it is sharp enough for trimming. Remington are known to be good products, I might get one more for my brother</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars but I have not owned it long enough to rate durability but if I do, then I will come back and give it a higher rating.  Anyhow, this is a great beard trimmer and body hair trimmer.  It is very powerful and cuts fast as well as seems to hold a charge for a long time.  If I ran out of battery life while I was trimming, I think I would be a sasquatch, but more likely it is probably for traveling and not taking the charger with you.  ANyhow, no complaints and works well, what more can you ask for, right?</li>
            <li> This thing is a death trap. I used it to trim my beard and then edge my beard at the bottom and this thing will bleed you out if you dont use the guard. I take the guard off to get skin close under my beard and it slices me every time in a moment that is reminiscent of an episode of Dexter. They must have made the blades from ancient Samurai blade technology because this damn thing will cut ya. And forget about trimming up your junk hair, I was way to terrified to cut the seam and bleed out only to have the ambulance guys find me on the floor holding my gnarled sac in one hand and a death tool in the other. Ive have since bought a Phllips BG2040 that is amazing. Save yourself the tetanus shot and spend the extra 20 bucks...</li>
            <li> I am super excited with this purchase.  Received it around the last week August - as of today, (Mid October), I have used it about 8 times (trimming my goatee - once a week) - and NEVER HAD TO CHARGE!!! (unit still contains charge from factory and going strong) - I am simply amazed and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Had the MB4020 until I blew is out by plugging it in overseas. I got the upgraded version when I returned, and it is significantly better. You can feel the higher power in it than the previous one and also more so than other trimmers such as my previous norelco.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful trimmer that is very effective at trimming my beard/mustache. The attachments for stubble is a good, very close cut that does a great job if you&#x27;re looking for the permanent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. The plastic attachments for actual beard trimming seem flimsy and are too large to let you get that two-day growth look. You&#x27;ve either gotta be going for a very short look or a full beard. If that matches your needs, this is a great trimmer though. The charger functions well and the battery stays strong for a long time. The trimmer itself is compact but has a good weight in your hand. You&#x27;ll always feel in control of the trimmer without a fear of dropping it.</li>
            <li> This thing has a battery that lasts for an incredibly long amount of time. Granted, I don&#x27;t sit here all morning using it but it went weeks without a recharge and I eventually just plugged it in. In the past I&#x27;ve had models like this that can barely last a few minutes, so this is a refreshing change. Other than that, it is very easy to use and does its job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always satisfying when a product fully meets your expectations.  I especially appreciate how long it holds a charge--great for traveling purposes.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for another Remington that was many years old. What a difference!  This is more powerfull, and the design fits very comfortably in my hand.  The lithium battery lasts a long time, which is nice to have a long use time without worrying about the battery dying.  I have not tried the smaller beard trimmer or stubble blade, but the main blade works great and is very easy to adjust the guard.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what I expected it to do.  I will see how the battery fares as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time as a beard trimmer. The depth dial is a breeze to adjust. I can take it along on short trips and leave the charger cord behind.</li>
            <li> works real well &amp; the battery NEVER runs out</li>
            <li> Worked well until 1 month after the warranty was up! Figures.</li>
            <li> I liked my old trimmer better,  this one seems to pull a bit &amp; cut uneven.</li>
            <li> The build quality and battery life are superb on this beast.  This thing will easily make it through a summer sheer session on one charge (I&#x27;d say I have a medium amount of body hair).  The battery stays charged while unplugged for months a time thanks to it being Lithium Ion.  It doesn&#x27;t do a great job at trimming body hair with the length setting attachment, but it was originally designed for beards so I can&#x27;t really fault it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice though, be sure to use the stubble trimmer blade as the beard trimmer will make short work of your flesh.  The first time I used this, it looked like I went swimming with piranhas.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked good for one shave, and one shave only.  It does not work at all now. I would like to send it back.</li>
            <li> Very clean cut and the guard is amazing way better and easier to use. Also it is very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Had a Norelco product for at least 10 years. Battery wouldn&#x27;t charge any more. Like how this cuts my goatee and sideburns. Price was right. Great product</li>
            <li> Feels good in my hand, and the combs are very easily adjusted with the roller.  I found that the stubble blade and regular blade are both a little sharp, but that may just be me getting used to it.  Overall good power and a good product - major upgrade from my Wahl.</li>
            <li> This is my second Remington mustache and beard trimmer.  The first lasted several years, but the non-replaceable rechargeable battery finally reached the end of its useable life.  As of this review I have used the new trimmer for about 5 weeks.  I am still on the original charge, but use it only an average of 3 times a week.  My use is for trimming my mustache, sideburns and eyebrows.  Although it can also be used to trim your head hair.  The motor is strong and well made.  Of the three supplied blades I only use the beard blade, which was preinstalled on the shaver.  The adjustable comb attachment fits over the blade easily and has several calibration setting using the numbered zoom wheel. I use the comb attachment mainly when trimming  and shaping my mustache.  Once I have used the comb it easily slides off and then you can use the blade to trim sideburns and shape the mustache line.  I find the adjustable dial for the removeable head a great convenience.  You do not have to have a variety of attachable heads as with others on the market.  As with my first trimmer, I suspect the trimmer can not be run using the electrical outlet if the battery is run down.  I am very pleased with its performance and because I travel a lot not having a charging base is a big plus.</li>
            <li> This is a fine trimmer. I got it after my old Philips got too worn down to use. This one is slightly larger, which is both good and bad. Good is that it feels weighty and does the job. Bad is that it is a bit too large for those small jobs like trimming ears and a close cut goatee. I love it though for the price and the performance despite these drawbacks.</li>
            <li> It takes me twice as long to trim my beard with this trimmer than it does using my little Norelco with dull blades.  It doesnt want to cut, especially the gray hairs, of which I have a lot of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to my old trimmer, and I wont miss this Remington at all.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy yet another rechargeable shaver but this one actually holds a charge. My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a few weeks. It is still operating on the initial charge I gave it. It cuts clean&lt;br /&gt;and well, so I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> I have a moderately thick beard that i keep short. Each time a use the trimmer it ends up pulling many hairs off my face and it does not cut all of the hairs. A 5 to 8 minute trim now takes me about 20 minutes plus I get hairs pulled off my face. How can I return it?</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head since i was in the 8th grade lol I have used a great deal of clippers, beard trimmers and so on. I purchased the Remington because I&#x27;ve always had a goatee and wanted the smaller blade that came with the set to be able to shape the hair on my face. After using this set a few times I must say it works great on my head with no guard &amp;#34;a very close shave&amp;#34; and on my face I would definitely recommend this product to any of you using it for the same reason. Also It seems to be very sturdy but i have not had it long enough to say it will last or not but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I use it all the time. It holds a great charge and is very powerful. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5/5 was the changing heads can be difficult to fix if they pop off wrong.</li>
            <li> Lithium Ion battery makes a big difference as well as being able to use it with the charger cord in place (using 110v) when needed. Fixed all of the complaints that I had about old model with nickel cadmium battery (low charge retention).</li>
            <li> Removed packaging -- charged overnight -- turned it on and when I changed trimmer orientation, it stopped!  Apparently where ever the &amp;#34;manufactured in PRC&amp;#34; is they have poor quality control -- will return to Wisconsin (at my cost) under warrenty to see if another unit performs better (or at all)!</li>
            <li> My hubs loves this trimmer! And I love that we don&#x27;t have to have a charger sitting on the counter all the time, because the battery life is so great! It&#x27;s been about 6 weeks and we still haven&#x27;t had to charge it. It works really well too. This was a great buy for something my husband really needed!</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer. I had an older trimmer that fell and broke. This one is very adjustable and has two other heads to trim side burns and to get a very neat look on the mustache.</li>
            <li> I worked as expected, not much to say other than that.  It definitely holds a charge forever.  I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older rechargeable Panasonic beard trimmer that had to be charged before every use. I got this Remington and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I&#x27;ve charged this trimmer once, yes that&#x27;s right, one time which was months ago when initially purchased.  Now I only use the trimmer 2-3 times per month, but it has held a charge and is running just as strong today as it was the day I charged it.  Good to know you can take it on a trip and no worries about taking the charger, you won&#x27;t need it if yours holds a charge like mine.  The trimmer works very well, trims evenly, don&#x27;t know how you could do better.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful trimming neck hair without the blade guard. I&#x27;ve cut my neck each time I&#x27;ve used it without.</li>
            <li> I have had this item for a handful of months and now it no longer holds a charge.  Other than that it is a terrific trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nice little tremor trimmer</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome, love it, very sturdy feels as if it will last a long time! Always liked Remington shavers!</li>
            <li> The different length shears are built in so you just simply roll a dial to get the right length and you do not have a bunch of pieces laying around your bathroom! There are also a few different heads to the trimmer for different looks and styles.</li>
            <li> Works great initially. I will update on longevity UPDATE: A little over a year it&#x27;s totally dead and in the trash.</li>
            <li> Kicks the crap out of the Phillips Norelco trimmer.  The guard actually works on the Remington.  WHODATHUNKIT?!?!?! 3 more words</li>
            <li> Definitely holds its charge. i charged in back in mid June &amp; use it every 2-3days &amp; it still is on that original charge. It is a nice trimmer &amp; I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> In reading many trimmer reviews it took me a while to decide what to buy.  I am usually much faster at decisions.  I am glad this is the trimmer I ended up obtaining.  It is excellent and is exactly what I was wanting to groom my circle beard.</li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge.  It cuts through a beard well.  This is a great trimmer.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good product, does a great job of trimming. In use it for my head and does a great job of removing all the hair. It&#x27;s a little noisy but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. It came in the mail lightning quick and even had enough charge to do a quick touch up on my beard. I love all of the options you have for such a low price. Don&#x27;t let the Remington name fool you its not cheaply made by any means. Trust me treat yourself to this you cant beat it for that price.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for the stubble look</li>
            <li> The Remington mustache and beard trimmer is great, it&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t pinch and the accessories fit smoothly and work that way as well. Nice machine!</li>
            <li> Amazing battery life. Great performance and various length options.</li>
            <li> Amazing little trimmer - I had some other model from Target (Panasonic, I think), and the two I owned died after a year. Have had this 8 months, and so far it&#x27;s the bomb.</li>
            <li> This clippers works well to trim the length of my small beard (goatee).  It is, however, very sharp, not at all suitable for trimming borders or shape.  After removing the plastic guard to shape my beard, the clippers is dangerous to one&#x27;s skin.  I gouged myself twice before realizing how sharp the plain blades are (and they cannot be adjusted). On the plus side it does hold a charge for a long time.  Though the plastic guard, with more than enough adjustments for the length of whiskers, is nice, I wish I would have made a different purchase.  If shaping is important, this is not the clippers for you.</li>
            <li> Works well, the included trimmer ad on is terrible does not cut evenly, large size not easy to maneuver,</li>
            <li> If you want a STUBBLE trimmer, this isn&#x27;t it. It doesn&#x27;t fulfill that like it claims to. Get a dedicated, real stubble trimmer or you&#x27;ll end up wasting a lot of time with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it said it does stubble but it really doesn&#x27;t. Its closest length is far too long for a real, short stubble cut. The box says &amp;#34;3 day stubble&amp;#34; but even then you have to run the thing across the same spot a dozen times or the cut is really uneven. Honestly to do the 3 day stubble trim with this thing takes forever and still doesn&#x27;t get everything even.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best beard trimmer that I have owned thus far. Feels durable and takes a charge really well.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. It cuts the hair evenly and doesn&#x27;t pull or tug. The charge lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product months ago and have only had to charge it one time since it&#x27;s main charge when i purchased it and i use it a lot.  works great!!</li>
            <li> Use this every day.  It&#x27;s Plastic-y so you can&#x27;t handle it like a pro scizzor but for the price it&#x27;s a great tool!</li>
            <li> I like the ability to change cutting length without having to change a plastic guide. I had a Remington trimmer that lasted 10yrs. the battery wouldn&#x27;t recharge. The trimmer blades cut without pulling. I would recommend to anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of guy who typically runs things into the ground. You&#x27;ve met guys like me. I keep a car for sixteen years and sell it out of my driveway. I run a riding lawnmower until its creaking on its springs and gasping on its last exhaustive breath. The same holds true for my old Remington beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I purchase Remington because I am a Remington. I guess it runs in the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About seven years ago I purchased almost the exact same trimmer, although it was silver in color and back then it had an internal chamber to hold hair. I really liked that old trimmer, but in typical fashion, I ran it to death. A year ago it only held a charge for four or five minutes, and now it holds a charge for about thirty seconds. So I decided it&#x27;s time; it&#x27;s time to replace it with a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between the Remington MB4040 trimmer and my old one is this trimmer doesn&#x27;t have a vacuum feature that sucks the hair trimmings into an internal chamber that can be emptied when I&#x27;m done trimming. Boy that was a nice feature! I miss it. So I chose the next best thing, the same trimmer without that feature, and I&#x27;m happy with it. Now I have to trim in the shower with the water off or over a sink, otherwise the trimmings land all over the floor. I can&#x27;t fault the trimmer for that though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about the MB4040 is it holds a charge seemingly forever. Or perhaps it just feels like it does because my old one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge at all. Remington specs it at a 120-minute run time, which is really impressive. This one uses lithium-ion cells instead of the nickel-cadmium (NiCad) cells my old trimmer had. I&#x27;ve had to charge this new one once in about a month, and it still has a healthy charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MB4040 comes with three different trim cutters, a removable guard that can be adjusted to nine different depth levels, and a brush to clean hair out of all the nooks and crannies. Along with a charger, it has everything you need to enjoy any kind of hair trimming. Remington markets this as a beard trimmer, but my experience has been that it can be used for any type of body hair: beard, mustache, head, or other personal area. I don&#x27;t have a beard, but I use it around the outside of my head to keep it closely trimmed, and my wife uses it on our toddler. It saves a ton of money than bringing him to a barber, which is difficult to do with a two year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So our experience with this product is a good one, and even though my name is Remington, I stay with Remington because trimmers like this seem to last a real long time. For the money, they work for me. I stick with things that work for me. For about $30, the Remington MB4040 is a great product.ng you need to enjoy any kind of hair trimming.

            <li> does the job, perfect if you keep experimenting with your looks .. has many settings .. easily reachargaeble ..easy cleaning</li>
            <li> This replaced an old Remington beard trimmer that I have had for 15+ years.  It is better, faster, lighter, easier to use and just perfect!</li>
            <li> If you want a fast and precise razor, buy this. Very good for the price. I recommend this. I have use this happilly many times.</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery, and the adjustable guard level is great. Wish the blades could cut just a bit closer though.</li>
            <li> Love mine, would buy another</li>
            <li> This is one of those purchases that makes you question the validity of Amazon reviews. At the time of purchase, it was the highest rated beard trimmer I could find, with great reviews available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it, it weighs next to nothing, which depending on your point of view could be considered a good thing. But it feels cheap to me.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about it is the cordless ability. Though I can&#x27;t vouch for it&#x27;s lasting battery life as I&#x27;ve only used it once.&lt;br /&gt;It simply doesn&#x27;t cut very well. It&#x27;s a painful experience as it pulls on whiskers rather than cutting them.</li>
            <li> Well-rated, which is why I bought it.  And well-priced too.  Very happy with it.  My only issue is that traveling with multiple heads, the one that is not attached to the razor can be easily and irreparably damaged.  If you travel with it, make sure to wrap up any heads that are not attached to the trimmer.  Also, this razor can easily turn on inside your luggage.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for two years and still does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> My Remington I used before was much more even when it comes to the measurement. 1 was one and 2 was two. This number one needs to cut closer..Not accurate.</li>
            <li> Great product, perfect for home use. Severally easy to set up and clean plus this trimmer is made from quality material.</li>
            <li> After researching and reading reviews I decided on this model, and I have been very impressed with it&#x27;s construction and performance.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good razor so far.  It&#x27;s not good if you want a clean shave, but it is great as far as managing a beard.  I&#x27;ll be interested to know how long the battery lasts.  My last razor, (not a Remington), can no longer charge, and won&#x27;t even run if plugged into the wall.  I have much better hopes for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Remington!</li>
            <li> Love this razor. Barely ever have to charge it. Charge has lasted more than a month for me. I use about 3 times a week to shave. Very happy with this purchase. The Lithium Ion battery is a must</li>
            <li> I was waiting to write a review until I had to recharge this trimmer after the initial charge. I ordered this trimmer on March 3rd 2012 and as of June 12th I still have not had to recharge it. I use it once or twice a week, not every day. I think it is great. If you&#x27;ve had one of those trimmers with multiple attachments that sit in a poorly designed stand that seems to spill half of them out on the bathroom counter whenever you are trying to use one of them you will appreciate this trimmer. It is easy to keep clean, and has a rotary dial to adjust the length of cut. Although the different trimmer heads are easy to swap in and out my primary use is to trim my goatee. I am very satisfied with it&#x27;s simplicity and long lasting battery. I have not experienced any pulling or other discomfort as another reviewer has mentioned.</li>
            <li> I normally go to the barber and have them shave my face but now I can do it at home. This product is easy to work and I am looking good.</li>
            <li> Bought this beard trimmer to trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately even on the lowest level, the clipper does not clip/trim my beard.</li>
            <li> well built love the accessory heads. hold charge. Very precise cut. It came with three different blade heads and the adjustment for the trimmer is built into the unit itself. I use that the most for trimming my goatee. It has good power and the smaller blades come in handy for shaping.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product 1 year ago and suddenly this week it crapped out.&lt;br /&gt;I have nicked myself dozens of times with this trimmer so I actually think this item is dangerous and should be recalled.</li>
            <li> Works great--my husband likes it a lot. He has used other Remington trimmer products, and they have all lasted a long time and been high quality.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice product -- small, but plenty of power to do the job. Different settings helpful. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Before I bought this trimmer I was using just typical cheaper trimmers that I&#x27;d pick up at my local target. The problem with those trimmers was that they were not precise and weren&#x27;t made with as much quality as this trimmer. Perfect for a beard touch up to get a clean look and the stubble trimmer works great as well giving you a perfect 5&#x27;o&#x27;clock shadow look. Battery charge has held up really well I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for some time and I&#x27;m still on the first charge.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. He even boys it as a gift for any men&#x27;s present. It works well for his beard and aslo we cut his hair with it using the attachment. We can&#x27;t find it anywhere else in store, so we keep coming back to Amazon for it.</li>
            <li> This is a surprisingly good product.  It also comes with two additional heads for different trimming requirements which are extremely easy to swap out.  Thus far it has held a charge way longer than my previous trimmer.  Nice!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband still loves it!</li>
            <li> This trimmer comes with attachments to ensure a consistent length to the beard (a plastic, comb-like cover that goes over the cutter head) and extra cutter heads to get into tight areas or do a good stubble trim. It&#x27;s reasonably quiet, cuts nicely, recharges well. It would be nice if the trimmer worked from the charger for those occasions when you might have a discharged or own out battery, but the manual says the charger only charges the battery and can&#x27;t be used to run the trimmer. Nothing dramatic about it, but you don&#x27;t want drama with personal care!</li>
            <li> This unit has a power motor and long lasting charge. I have charged it twice in two months and it is used every 3 days or so. I even used it to give myself a haircut trim when I couldn&#x27;t get to the shop on time. It did not need the charge I gave it, as it would have lasted quite a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless I read the instructions incorrectly, I prefer to use it opposite of the way they recommend. I prefer to use it with the Power button and Adjustment roller facing me, not pointing away. I get a much more &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; trim in that position. It does a nice job of closely trimming my mustache (use it at the lowest level), and maintains the goat effectively at any length I choose.. It is easy to clean and charges in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find anything to complain about. It is far superior to my previous Remington. Too bad the various heads from the old one don&#x27;t fit the new!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the rugged construction and high torque this unit produces.  Great trimmer for the cost - its basically as close as you can get to professional grade without paying for pro grade prices.</li>
            <li> It died on me after a year, and I hardly used it.</li>
            <li> I use it like 3 times a week and the battery lasted like forever!! great quality</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised, by the performance and qualities as it&#x27;s engineer very well.....I had a Wahl for years before that a Panasonic.....each was better designed and performed better!</li>
            <li> Bout it about 6 months ago. Still works fine. My only issue is that it vibrates a lot now with the fine blade. It feels like something is not snug enough to dampen that vibration, but I checked everything (on the blade, cause it only does it with just one of the blades) and it seems fine. I might put a bit of oil on it and see if that fixes it, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> So good! My old razor would die out after a few minutes and needed to be charged constantly. I&#x27;ve used this a handful of times over several weeks with just one charge. The mess is easy to clean and it&#x27;s a sturdy design.</li>
            <li> Nice so far only had it for a few weeks ,battery charge an it comes with three different heads 9/7/13</li>
            <li> I Have had a beard for the past thirty years and have had several beard trimmers, but being operated by AA batteries, they didn&#x27;t have consistent speeds and of course required replacement frequently.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I charged this Remington trimmer when I received it over 2 months ago, have used it once or twice a week and it is yet to require a recharge .  The adjustable attachment ensures that trimming is smooth and my beard trims evenly.  The two included trimming heads are used to trim my neck and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with this trimmer and look forward to many years of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was supposed to have a great battery life.  After around a month or so of use it has become basically unusable.  Even if i charge if for 12+ hours it will only stay powered on for 1min.  Since I am out of return policy, it seems I am stuck with this and will have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer I&#x27;m  glad I took a chance on it. It goes a long time on a charge and is easy to use. I will buy another one when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Has been working fantastically for me. It co!as with 3 blades and an adjuster. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace my old one that died. This one is very good.Seller was prompt and efficent. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Spent time researching. Like the adjustable head and the fact it holds a long charge. Does a great job, fast and easy Very happy with decision.</li>
            <li> Cuts those annoying thin hairs. It&#x27;s not skin irritation it&#x27;s works pretty darn good. It works for all types of hair. And I love how it comes with customizable clips.  Also the battery  on it last for days with just one charge :)</li>
            <li> Unfortunate that the power brick for this is not usable for 220-240v; would be helpful if the writing on the brick was larger so this issue wasn&#x27;t such a mystery. Most power bricks of this size can be used globally, but not this one...ask me how I know. :(</li>
            <li> Been using it a year now. Really like it.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.  Perfect!  The quality, fit and finish were better than I expected at even twice the price.  I would buy this one again if I needed a new one!</li>
            <li> After a single use, already two of the three trimmer heads on were broken. Now, less than three months in, all three heads are broken. I only used the trimmer once a week at most. The components of this beard trimmer are as good as made of glass. What a waste of time and money! I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve ever bought a worse, more useless product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works great, have had it for a year now and it gets the job done no problem. Just buy it</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this trimmer after the charger batteries died on a similar model after 15 years. This replacement is ideal. It has a powerful motor that cuts thru thick beard fast. It does not loose strength and pull hair as another brand did that I recently tried. When the guard is removed, it is easy to shave all hair off and trim your mustache. The only thing I miss was my old trimmer had a 2nd set of smaller blades for better sculpting of the mustache. The wider blades that this model have work fine.</li>
            <li> Owned this for 3 months and use it about once a week have not had to charge battery yet! Trims great</li>
            <li> Tons of length settings make this trimmer great, the guard doesn&#x27;t slip to a lower setting like a lot of trimmers, stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> I had another trimmer that I used for many years and one day it started catching my skin and hurting a bit when I shaved. I figured it was the trimmer so I ordered this product. When it arrived it also caught on my skin and hurt to shave, so I concluded that maybe I&#x27;m just getting older and that the recently higher prevalence of grey in my beard gave it a tougher texture, making shaving just suck more than it used to. Well I lost the charger to this and ordered a Norelco BT5275, it just arrived and it is awesome. Zero catching on my skin, it cuts right through my fairly thick facial hair with ease. My conclusion is that my original trimmer was great, it lasted a long time and eventually got dull, but the MB4040 is just an AWFUL, TERRIBLE, WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK that made shaving my face a really unpleasant experience for a year or so. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Every time my husband uses it, he comes out of the bathroom and says &amp;#34;I LOVE that trimmer you got me!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says it doesn&#x27;t pull and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read through a lot of review before deciding on this one and we are both happy with the decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again if this one ever wears out OR as gifts for other guys in the family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it even cost less than those being sold at WM super center.</li>
            <li> These are great. I dont use any other attachments other than the beard one that is connected with it as those others are really useless. Only down side I have found is when I push it to my face to get a cleaner cut it pulls on my hair at time. It is not a low battery issue, I think its just a slow speed issue, just needs to be a little bit faster so it doesnt pull hair at times. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Started having battery issues within a couple of months, couldn&#x27;t hold a charge after six months. After 12 months, it didn&#x27;t work at all. 1 star durability, 3 star quality (it was pretty good while it lasted) &#x3D; 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new trimmer and after considerable research, decided on the Remington MB4040.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great battery life - only needs a full charge every week or two depending on your usage&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Easy-to-use length adjustment&lt;br /&gt;- Only requires one pass to trim your beard, which is a great time saver.&lt;br /&gt;- Good cost for the features&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Horrible for shaving down to a stubble - as others have mentioned, if you don&#x27;t use the skin guard, the clipper teeth often catch on my skin/hair/any little bump on my face, particularly when shaving the neck area. It makes my eyes water! Awful! Wish they had included a thinner plastic guard for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not apparent, but you can get a lot of hair caught between the clipper head and the handheld part. I didn&#x27;t know this was possible until today, and when I opened it up I had at least 2 beard-worths of hair inside!&lt;br /&gt;- I never use anything but the basic clipper head. There are two other heads included, but I haven&#x27;t found a need for them yet. That or I&#x27;m using the clippers completely wrong.</li>
            <li> works good so far... just like the other reviews said.. Im happy!!</li>
            <li> For $30, this is a fine razor.  The blades are well constructed and feel very sturdy.  The body of the razor and the guard attachment have that plastic-y/cheap feel to them, but together the razor functions very well.  My only real complaint is that my last Remington grooming kit came with a charging stand and holders for the additional guards/blades, but this razor does not.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to lose at least one blade at some point in the future.  Again though - this is a great value item.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday to keep that stubble look.</li>
            <li> This trimmer comes with several cutting heads, but so far I&#x27;ve found the largest one to be sharp and accurate enough to do everything I ask of it.  I&#x27;ve only needed to charge it once and it is still cutting well.  Handles thick hair with relatively little blow by - I&#x27;ve never had to do more than 2 passes regardless of how lazy I&#x27;ve been, which is a huge improvement over what I had before.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying, this isn&#x27;t my first facial hair trimmer, but it is the first one I&#x27;ve had that creates random bald spots on my face.  I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 4 weeks, and I usually use it around once a week.  So far it has consistently left a bald patch, the question is how big it&#x27;s going to be.  The major downside to this is that if the bald spot is large enough I pretty much have to take the guard completely off and trim my facial hair to the shortest level to avoid a very uneven look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this pretty big issue, I was pretty excited about the new trimmer and the other features it has to offer.  The battery life is great as well as the compact design, but with the results I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;m not sure how much longer I will be willing to gamble with my facial hair.</li>
            <li> I love,&lt;br /&gt;very practical, lightness is part of this tool for any man, well done, fast charge, thin blade, precision possible through its practical form, it can be put anywhere in a kit or just store it on a shelf, it look nice</li>
            <li> Everything was good with it. I like the adjustable roller for the cuts. I just wish it had a base for the trimmer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed from this product. It&#x27;s very hard to get a decent 1mm beard length. I have to go over my face several times, unlike a previous Panasonic machine.</li>
            <li> Awesome! This is the best razor for trimming. Gets rid of hair really quickly and highly recommend it! The battery seems to last a long long time I have only charged it once and used it about 15 times so far!</li>
            <li> The unit looks pretty sharp.  The material it is made of shouldn&#x27;t allow shaved whiskers to stick to it nearly as much as the older Remington unit it replaced.  I could never get the older unit really cleaned.  Plus, the older unit&#x27;s battery stopped holding a charge a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have helped if I had a miniature &amp;#34;jaws of life&amp;#34; tool to open the packaging on this new product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in its&#x27; initial 24-hour charge right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell...</li>
            <li> very powerful trimmer. has 3 blades- beard, trim, goatee. Sharp and clean trims. The only thing I do not like is that it&#x27;s closest trim setting is still a bit coarse.</li>
            <li> I compared several mustache and beard trimmers before deciding on the Remington MB4040.  It has all the features I was looking for including a long lasting charge.  My previous trimmer seemed to run out of juice after three or four trims so I was always charging it.  Plus it took about 8 hours for a full charge.  The Remington charges in half the time.  It came with three interchangeable blades but I primarily use the beard blade with the zoom wheel to lock in the length setting.  It has great power, doesn&#x27;t pull and handles well.</li>
            <li> I use this without the guard and it gets closer than the Philips Norelco QT4000/42. If you are looking for a close trim, buy this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive trimmer so don&#x27;t expect a lot, but you get a lot for your money for sure. It does give you the stubble look. Those saying they can&#x27;t have this happen easily need to watch the instructional video that Remington provides on youtube, it shows how to properly use it. It&#x27;s not as intuitive as you might think and I suspect many people are using the device wrong. I shave with the stubble blade without the guard and have a perfect stubble look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, when you shave with the bare blade only use the stubble blade for that..if you use the larger blade you could cut yourself..the larger blade is intended to be used with the guard for your actual hair. The battery lasts forever and it is light and relatively quiet, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Since I am waiting to give this to my boyfriend on the day of his birthday. I will wait till he uses it for the first time. After. That I will write a review based the on quality and function of this product.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is really good , i have it over a year .&lt;br /&gt;The thing is , the charger didn&#x27;t fit to my country so i had to buy a charger .&lt;br /&gt;However , Amazon&#x27;s costumer support is great and refunded me for the charger cost .&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if they fixed the problem , but i suggest you do check it if you live outside the US .&lt;br /&gt;Recommended !</li>
            <li> Charged it when I got it over a month ago, and haven&#x27;t had to charge it again yet...but I only use it to trim the stach.</li>
            <li> This is a versatile and easy-to-use trimmer, but after 8 months the battery ceased to take a charge.  That&#x27;s simply not an acceptable lifespan with today&#x27;s available battery technology.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Nice design for ease of use. Strong battery that holds the charge. Trims well.&lt;br /&gt;Comb adjustment is nice, stays locked in place when using. I&#x27;m happy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> 5 stars. Just got it today, and was eager to use it since I was starting to fear being mistaken for a sasquatch upon leaving the house. It recommends charging for 24 hours prior to use, but luckily the product was designed for men and ignoring the instructions is taken into account.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull hair at all even though my beard was thick enough to house a family of gnomes by the time I used it, and the beard guide is slick. The little wheel in the middle controls the length of the beard guide and is easy to change on the fly, which was extremely helpful between beard trimming and mustache work. Overall, really impressed...this is much, much nicer than my last trimmer even though it was less expensive. Taking it apart to clean it after use is also extremely simple.</li>
            <li> My Norelco shaver is good, but the trimmer does not trim very close. This shaver trims much closer and even comes with a blade to leave stubble - which is apparently the latest style. I also like the spacer that attaches over the blade for trimming eyebrows and beards. Overall a nice product.</li>
            <li> So far I am really impressed with trimmer.  The battery holds up for a very long time and I actually put my charger up because it is not needed much.  The motor feels very strong and it can trim thick beards without bogging down.  I also like the guide which is very sturdy and adjusts in a  clever manner that doesn&#x27;t allow it to jump places on you and cause a bad beard day.  It is a beard trimmer though and will not give you a shaved look so keep that in mind</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used probably a half dozen electric razors throughout my life, and this is the only one that has ever made me bleed like I was using a normal razor. You have to be very careful about the direction you shave with this thing. If you go upward on your neck, it&#x27;ll cut you and leave rashes.&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer length options are extremely skewed toward long beards. There&#x27;s not really anything between barely stubble to short beard. If you have a longer beard though, there are tons of options.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the beard trimmer will give you a closer shave on the chin than on the cheeks so you have to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this thing also trims everything down on the first swipe, unlike most other electric razors. It also holds its charge unbelievably well. I&#x27;ve had it about a month and haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet.</li>
            <li> Priced just right. Looks like a high end product and trims hair well</li>
            <li> This item works great. Holds a charge well, able to be used in the shower, metal blades are sharp and there is no tugging. The adjustments in length are easy to make.</li>
            <li> The battery life is amazing and it works very well. No problems thus far. Couldnt have asked for a better product for the price.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Cuts very well and I can go weeks, yes weeks!!! without charging this unit.  Does a great job at cutting and the clips that come with it are great.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome; the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve gone quite a while without the need to re-charge, the three different heads allow me to adjust for what I&#x27;m cutting (the beard blade for my goatee and the stubble blade for the rest of my face since I don&#x27;t like to shave with a razor). The adjustable guard is helpful in keeping my goatee a consistent length. I&#x27;d highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> not as good as the cheaper one but I love the brand and it has done me well</li>
            <li> Does not keep a charge very long at all. Also it just doesn&#x27;t seem well made. It rips more hair out then it cuts.</li>
            <li> I spent way too much time looking for a trimmer for my beard and this one had good reviews.  I agree with every 5 star review for this thing.  The motor is powerful, it&#x27;s a nice form factor and the device is obviously well built.  Great trimmer, buy it.</li>
            <li> THIS CLIPPER/TRIMMER IS A LITTLE NOISY. THE STUBBLE BLADE IS THE ONLY ONE WORTH KEEPING IT WORKS WELL. THE OTHER TWO PINCH LIKE MOST JUNK TRIMMERSS.OVERWISE THE CLIPPER IS A GOOD BUY</li>
            <li> Take the old MB-200/300 series and stick a lithium battery in it. That&#x27;s all the trimmer needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose this because I was very happy with my MB-200, but the crappy battery inside is not holding charge anymore and can&#x27;t be replaced without soldering (planned obsolescence 101).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of keeping the design similar, the trimming machinery and the guard are completely different and yank many of my hair out instead of trimming them. Sure, the shiny plastic looks cool, but this is a piece of junk. Replaced it with a norelco, more expensive but it hasn&#x27;t yanked a single hair yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric Wahl haircutting machine for years on my beard and it finally started wearing out. I thought I&#x27;d replace it with a rechargeable, portable unit that was highly rated. This takes 3-4 times as long to trim my beard and is not near as efficient or as strong as my old wahl. You can get a better cut around the mustache and nose area due to its size, but I may be going back to an electric and only using this for tiny trimming.</li>
            <li> battery life lasts for weeks...it is also small piece of equipment that fits in my glove compartment.&lt;br /&gt; I love this trimming machine.</li>
            <li> works like it&#x27;s supposed too. i would recommend it. they want 11 more words before they will publish this. there, are you satisfied?</li>
            <li> I was a long-time Norelco user, but when the inevitable occurred, that is, the failure of the battery to accept a charge, I shopped for a replacement.  Looking at the new model Norelco products side-by-side with this Remington, the price differential is noteworthy.  After using it now for a few weeks, I assess its performance, ergonomics, battery, and comfort, to be every bit as good as the Norelco, and, perhaps, even better, since the battery is lithium-ion, (you can read the product description for its benefits), and the cutters self-sharpening titanium.  It&#x27;s light in the hand, and the motor is powerful.  It&#x27;s one of the few times these days when saving money on a product actually returned greater satisfaction.  I endorse this trimmer and recommend it to any shopping for such.</li>
            <li> Love the trimmer. Only small complaint is it&#x27;s shape, but I&#x27;m getting better and more acclimated to it, we will be fine in time.</li>
            <li> Very well designed, ergonomic handle, sharp fine blades , easy to clean , low noise and stayed charged for long.&lt;br /&gt;The best you can buy for personal use.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever on a single charge, works great and quite a good value</li>
            <li> Perfect beard trimmer, great length settings.  Not too long, not too short.  It fits well in the hand, easy to use!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the MB200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer last year.  I liked it although it really does have serious battery issues.  Although I find it incredibly ergonomic.  This trimmer isn&#x27;t quite as fun to use as the other although it does have changeable heads.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and haven&#x27;t had to charge this one it, but still getting used to the length&#x27;s this one cuts.  I wish they just put a better battery in the MB200. That&#x27;s really all I need.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Was worried ( as I always am buying a new product to replace the old one) that it would not be as good as my old trimmer (also a Remington).  But it is even better, and the charge last a long time.  I charged it before I went on a 3 week trip overseas and it never needed charging.</li>
            <li> i ordered this trimmer about a month ago, i charged it, and it&#x27;s still is going strong. I&#x27;m really interested to see when it will actually run out of power. it&#x27;s insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for the trimmer itself, it rocks. i really like the interchangeable heads to trim close up and in hard to reach places. the only complaint i have, and it&#x27;s a very minor one, is that the trimming guard isn&#x27;t very strong. it feels like an arm could break off if you are too rough or drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this trimmer to anyone. go on, get it. what are you waiting for?</li>
            <li> I have had several trimmers and this one is by far the best.  It is bigger than some of the other trimmers but the battery life is great, the height adjustment is easy and reliable, and the blades trim the beard/ goatee nicely.</li>
            <li> I prefer this product to the [[ASIN:B00009RF1E Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer]], which I recently purchased. The charge appears to last longer. The cutting blades are easy to switch out and the guard is easier to attach and more sturdy. . Neither is all that expensive , but I&#x27;d recommend spending the difference and getting the Remington.</li>
            <li> Depending on the time of year, a general dislike of shaving and having overly sensitive skin, I often sport a goatee or pseudo-beard.  I haven&#x27;t had a decent facial trimmer in quite a while so I decided to try the Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer.  Here are my thoughts on this handy and stylish little gadget;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Lengthy battery (Lithium Ion) life.  Mine has lasted well over 2 hours before needing a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ 3 titanium coated self-sharpening detachable blades with a total of 9 different length settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ LED indicator light turns off when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ 2 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustment attachment may eventually wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not the sturdiest construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Detachable heads can be a bit tricky to reassemble after cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No storage or travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- May struggle cutting tougher beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer\\&quot; is a convenient little trimmer that does exactly what I need it to.  Its smooth design feels great in my hand and allows for smooth and accurate trimming.  What impressed me the most was the exceptional battery life.  I&#x27;ve been using it over a month now and have yet to charge it for a second time.  Previous shavers I&#x27;ve had never held a charge for a full month.  All in all I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this little trimmer as it meets my daily facial trimming needs.</li>
            <li> built to last the battery life is incredible. love the interchangeable heads. plastic removable trimmer head is going to last a long time.  Good design.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is the one to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is off the charts - went on a two week vacation - shaving my face, trimming my beard and shaving my head every other day and it lasted the whole time. Never had to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had it now for almost a year and I have had zero problems.</li>
            <li> Got this for my father-in-law and he loved it! Nice and adjustable, it&#x27;s got a sharp blade and does nearly anything you would want a trimmer to do. Several guards come with this shaver. It also comes out of the box ready to use (including being fully charged). If you want/need a beard and mustache trimmer, this is a must buy.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer for a Christmas gift.  He loves it not only for his face but it also makes for a body groomer.</li>
            <li> I am very fond of this Remington MB4040 trimmer.  At first I was unsure about the lithium ion battery.  After months of use I can say that it lasts way longer than my older unit with a NiCd battery.  The trimmer is very quiet, emitting a gentle hum.  The unit cuts hair with ease with and without the guard attached.  It has a solid, sturdy feel to it without being to heavy.</li>
            <li> Switched to this model from the Remington B200 after much good use but the battery failed eventually.  The battery on this one is very good and the cutting is fairly good, however I am overall dissatisfied given that after only a year and a half the switch to turn the unit on and off has failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially the problem was that I had to press in as hard as possible while sliding the switch in order to get it to turn on.  Finally that stopped working also.  Took the unit apart and discovered that it worked perfectly fine when the the cover was not on, the cover switch does not perfectly line up with or maneuver the actual switch that is internal to the shaver.  I modified it by trimming away some of the cover plastic to allow the cover switch to be more recessed and slide further and got it working again.  Clearly though this should not be necessary.</li>
            <li> Powerful and comfortable to use. It has many settings and makes trimming goatee etc. a breeze. Adjustable head is easy to use and blades interchange easily. Very nice product. Definitely would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> The first time I received this product, the head had popped off the trimmer and the blade assembly had come apart.  It seems like it should be very simple to re-assemble, but it definitely is not.  For the life of me I could not get it put back together, so I returned the item.  The second one I received was in-tact, but as soon as I removed the Stubble Trimmer from the packaging, that blade assembly came apart too.  I tried for about 30 minutes to put it back together, suffering a few scratches and cuts on my fingers, and then I finally gave up.  I realize that someone reading this review will probably make fun of me for not being able to figure out how to put this thing back together, but I&#x27;m manning up and admitting it anyway.  After I returned the second one, I gave up and went back to Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> ....but it does the job.  I don&#x27;t really care for the new exchanging heads feature.  But the lithium ion battery is sure an improvement over the old nicads.</li>
            <li> The Remington MB4040 brings variety of accessories, the battery life is ok. Very easy to use. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Having replaced my old trimmer, this product has fit the bill.  The charge lasts multiple trims, the heads offer versatility for the different areas to be trimmed and the adjustable head provides consistent length.  The blades are sharp and require minimal passes of a bearded area to get the result you want.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to be a slave to the charger or you don&#x27;t want to have the battery die after a couple years, make sure you buy a trimmer with a Lithium Ion battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is extremely sensitive to all forms of shaving. I&#x27;ve tried tons of razors, electric razors, and even double edged razors. This is the easiest on my skin for every day shaving. When I need a close shave I go to my double edged razor, which is the only way I can get a proper shave without breaking out. Most days, I just use this. It is faster, easier, and I like that even without the guard that it leave a tiny bit of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also my 16 year old&#x27;s preferred method.</li>
            <li> Good for keeping a beard cropped in an even fashion. Easiest if  you go over the whole beard at the same setting.&lt;br /&gt;Setting &#x27;2&#x27; is much more closely cropped than &#x27;3&#x27; .</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for almost a year now and it is holding up great. My only issue is that it takes multiple passes to get an even trim. I don&#x27;t feel like I had as much of an issue with my previous trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Holds charge for a long time&lt;br /&gt;  Powerful&lt;br /&gt;  Light weight&lt;br /&gt;  Easily adjustable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Guard doesn&#x27;t always provide the best trim on first couple passes</li>
            <li> When my last hair trimmer (also made by Remington), after many years of reliable use finally died, I started looking for another one.&lt;br /&gt;This one is even better, and sturdier than previous one.&lt;br /&gt;Higly recommended.</li>
            <li> After a year of using this 2-4 times per week, the battery does not hold a charge sufficient to trim my beard. It runs for less than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is a good basic trimmer.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this to replace an older model because of the longer-life battery. So I am writing the review.  I like my stubble pretty short and even on the lowest setting on this, it does not cut as close as setting 3 on the older model, so i cannot really get it to the length I want.  I will end up using my older model.</li>
            <li> Perfect beard shaver. Charge lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer last year for Christmas.  I&#x27;ve only charged it once and that was the day after I got it.  I don&#x27;t use it every day; I use it about once every two weeks.  Still, even after low usage, I&#x27;m still impressed that I haven&#x27;t had to charge it at all since the first charge after a year of usage and a lot of dormancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came with a stand for storage and for the 3 trimmers it comes with, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> Had I written a review last winter, it would have been 4 or 5 stars as I grew my first beard ever and tried various trimmers, and this was the best one I tried that would get close without getting too close (one of the guards on the others resulted in me always nicking myself in an unintended place and my beard-growing efforts would be for naught until I found this). However, now it&#x27;s not quite a year later and the shaver is not holding a charge. It&#x27;s very disappointing that each time I go to shave/trim my beard, this ends up dying before I can finish and I have to finalize the edges with another old shaver or scissors.</li>
            <li> I have been through a few cordless chargers over the years and this one is, by far, the best one I have ever had. It is the first lithium one I have ever had, so there&#x27;s that. It is powerful, it holds a charge and the settings are clear and steady. Zero complaints after two months and just a couple of recharges.  This is def worth the cost over some of the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> Had this for a few months and this is by far the best trimmer I have ever earned. Battery life is absolutely amazing, haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet and I have had it for a few months and used it a great many times.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I was trimming my beard with a pair of Wahl clippers that I bought on sale at target. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, that&#x27;s a great product, but it&#x27;s designed more for your head than for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to look up smaller cordless beard trimmers and after reading lots of reviews on Amazon, I decided on this on. Other reviews for other products should have fancy things like vacuum to suck away the trimmings, and water proof so you can use it in the shower. But I just wanted something that would give me a good trim every time.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only used the regular beard attachment, so I can speak to the goatee or the stubble attachments, but I&#x27;ve had nothing but good results with what I&#x27;m using. The length gauge is a nice simple dial, just turn it to what you want. Maybe start longer and go down from there on the first day so you don&#x27;t over cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty thick hair, so sometimes I need to make a few passes, but the razor just keeps on cutting through, even when my grain suddenly changes direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the comb attachment catches a lot of the hair trimmings, so I have less of a mess to clean up after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my trim time has reduced significantly, while the quality of my beard has increased quite a lot. This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Quickly and even trimmed my beard- only used it once, but first impressions this trimmer is great for 30 bucks</li>
            <li> Got 120v supply adaptor.plugged  in Aus 240v and.... lost my money....&lt;br /&gt;I thought with all the robots fulfilling the order in Amazon they should have figured this one out !&lt;br /&gt;Then again may be not</li>
            <li> awesome for beard and body hair upkeep</li>
            <li> Nice unit.Versatile and easily handled.Very sharp and precise.easy to clean.Holds charge well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard from Amazon after 48hrs of this msg.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Remington MB4040 after only its 2nd charge the charger has stopped charging. I know its the charger as can charge on my flat mates no prob. I would really like Amazon to fix this problem with a replacement charger. As i am a regular user of amazon this should be done free of charge. I will let you know if i get a response from Amazon and how efficient they are with my problem.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Easy to use, Easy to clean,. Powerful. Once a week it turns me from Grizzly Adams to Ansel Adams: My face is picturesque.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the blade notch will catch on my skin (or in a pore?) and tear or tug. Otherwise, the power is good, and it keeps charge very well. It can cut close, which is about the only thing i use it for. I wish hair couldn&#x27;t get in the sides.</li>
            <li> For the more afordable clippers out there, the Remington is great, much better than its predecessor. The ion-powered rechargable unit lasts weeks between charges. Very nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. This is the first time I used a Remington trimmer. It sounds less than my earlier trimmer which was Wahl.  I am sure its going to be at its best for coming months and I will definitely recommend this product for anyone who are interested in this price range.</li>
            <li> I was slightly turned off by some of the negative reviews of this product, but after reading a bunch of reviews on many other trimmers I decided to chance it, and order this one.  I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, if the packaging is any reflection of the quality of this trimmer, then I&#x27;m sure it will outlast the cockroaches in the event of some nuclear fallout.  Once I FINALLY got this thing out of the package&#x27;s relentless grasp, I did as instructed, and charged the device for 24 hours (almost...).  That is the last time I charged this thing, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  The battery seems very good, and if properly maintained seems like it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the size/weight of this trimmer--it fits nicely in my hand and feels like it is a quality product.  The plastic comb seems pretty sturdy, and all serviceable pieces are easily removed.  I love that there is only one comb, and length is adjustable.  The whole thing is just one unit, and there is little need to fiddle with separate pieces unless you want to change the blade head.  There is no bag or stand or anything, so I put all of the external parts in my own bag so I don&#x27;t lose them, but that&#x27;s no big loss really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp, (although I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to dull them) and cut hair with ease.  Edging with the bare blade is no problem at all and my beard looks great!  This trimmer functions very well, and I am very satisfied with the trimmer&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because there is the OCCASIONAL hair that slips its way past the comb and doesn&#x27;t get cut as closely, but it&#x27;s nothing drastic.  If I comb my beard first, and straighten out all the hairs in the same direction it really doesn&#x27;t happen much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very satisfied with my purchase, and would recommend this product to anybody out there looking for a well-functioning and quality-made trimmer for a reasonable price.  Sure you could do better, but you could also do a lot worse, and for this price it&#x27;s about as good as it gets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Just a short update, I have been using this trimmer regularly since I purchased it, and I still have yet to charge it again.  The instructions say that for best battery results it should be completely discharged about once a month and left on the charger for about 24 hours, and I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;m going to have to leave it running until it dies.  I just can&#x27;t seem to kill this battery with normal usage.  I&#x27;ve also learned to use it so that I very rarely have missed hairs anymore.  Been at least two months, and I&#x27;m still loving this product!a lot worse, and for this price it&#x27;s about as good as it gets!    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Just a short update, I have been using this trimmer regularly since I purchased it, and I still have yet to charge it again.

            <li> I has the non-lithium version before, but the battery did not last long at all. This lithium one is great. Battery lasts weeks on one charge.</li>
            <li> Trimming my beard is now effortless. The trimmer is lightweight, well- balanced and relatively quiet. The design makes switching out and cleaning the trimmer heads very quick and easy. It&#x27;s also inexpensive compared with other brands.</li>
            <li> Quick review because I don&#x27;t want to spend much time on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where do I start? The packaging is god awful and fights you as you try to unpackage the trimmer and blades.  I should have given up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice selection of blades, AWFUL trimmer comb. Flimsy, clumsy and cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself is too large for the job, and is curved so as to make it difficult to see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, avoid this one...</li>
            <li> No matter what direction you shave your beard, it&#x27;s amazing. Great for the guys who have coarse hair. Looks great to keep stubble!</li>
            <li> I trim my beard two to three times a week. The battery life is incredible, its been over a month since I had to charge it.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this several months ago, and at first I liked it. It cut well, and the battery held a nice long charge. But after a couple months that changed. First the battery stopped holding a charge. So if it was left unplugged, the battery would completely drain and it wouldn&#x27;t work at all. So I had to start leaving it plugged in all the time. Now it&#x27;s gotten to the point where after being left plugged in, the battery still drains after about 30 seconds running, making this thing completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I specifically bought this thing because it had a lithium battery, which tend to have better behavior in their batteries. So much for that.</li>
            <li> Needed a new trimmer for my relatively small amount of facial hair.  This does the trick.  No cords - battery holds enough charge for several trims, and holds charge for months at a time.  Adjustable length is easy to use and holds position nicely.  Trim is even, with only occasional strays that get missed.  Overall, a good trimmer for my needs.</li>
            <li> This was a game changer when it came to beard trimming and shaving.  It&#x27;s super powerful, holds a VERY long charge, and is pretty precise.  I have an edger that I use for the finer details, but this thing is REALLY great.</li>
            <li> I like all aspects of this trimmer except it&#x27;s hard to read the guide settings.&lt;br /&gt;You can trim your beard in a couple of minutes as it&#x27;s a full size trimmer.</li>
            <li> You will be hard pressed to find a better trimmer at this price. I ordered this product 6 months ago and I have only had to charge it once.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. I was looking for a closer stubble cut, but this is not really that close (as it says you need to use the guide). I am anyway still practicing with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that you can charge it and then you don&#x27;t need wires (or batteries) is great. Very flexible for different types of styles.</li>
            <li> Calling it a &#x27;trimmer&#x27; is an understatement. Get&#x27;s the job done and holds its charge. A bit loud but still a great product.</li>
            <li> I use it to trim my beard and mustache. It works great, no pulling, easy to clean and the adjustable comb is perfect for trimming my beard to the right length.  Stays charged.</li>
            <li> Extremely durable, lithium ion battery makes a world in difference in charging frequency.  You rarely have to charge this, extremely strong action, I have had this for going on two years and still going strong, can pinch at times when using in the groin area (balls) but not too bad.  I would say I use mine moderately.</li>
            <li> Holds charge for a long time. Though I use it occasionally, it works well when I do use it. The blades are easy to change but may be easy to damage. I damaged one but was able to repair it and it works fine.</li>
            <li> The battery on this is pretty amazing.  I chose this model because of the Lithium Ion feature after having been burnt by trimmers dying on me after a short while.  This trimmer came pre-charged out of the package and, I kid you not, I used it for almost a year before ever charging it.  For clarification, I use it once every 6-8 days for about 2-5 minutes per session.  The only reason I did end up charging it was because I was headed to Europe for a few weeks and didn&#x27;t want it to die on me in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very satisfied with this trimmer.  Would easily recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find any beard trimmers in the big box stores the week of Father&#x27;s Day. Found quite a few on Amazon. Good trimmer, lots of power, charged right out of the box, but didn&#x27;t take long for a full charge. This has a lot of power, so be careful and take your time, took out a little chuck of the Hubs beard, fortunately it grows quickly. lol</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of waiting more than 60 days to use this after purchasing it, so basically threw $30 away, but this razer is mega bogus. Unlike my previous Conair razer, this one cuts my skin when I use it without the attachment. And if I use it with the attachment it pulls my hair when it goes between the plastic and the blade, which hurts more than just a little. Like we are talking tears of pain here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to make this thing work, but every time I use it I wind up with a cut on my neck, face, ear, even the inside of my nose when I try and do a little maintenance there. It&#x27;s time to just face the fact that I have to cut my loss and start shopping for another one. (Weirdly Conair doesn&#x27;t make my other shaver anymore, which was perfect.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this shaver is for men with beards longer than 1/4\\&quot;. If you&#x27;re like me and like a tidier beard then you might consider another shaver.</li>
            <li> fantastic trimmer. The best I had so far.&lt;br /&gt;strong blades and cuts very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> GREAT mustache and beard shaver.trimmer!!! Provides an EXTREMELY close shave without cutting!!!  Great price and accessories!!! Highly recommended product!!! Even power output from start to finish!!!</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer maybe once a week to trim my beard and after 2 months I noticed the battery life decreasing. It was still plenty to get though a trim. After about 9 months I had to leave it plugged in constantly to get through. A couple days ago (nearly exactly 1 year later) the charging light stays on constantly and there is no power getting to it. Its useless now.</li>
            <li> I set out to buy a trimmer for my mustache and goatee a month ago and could not believe all the bad reviews here at Amazon about them.  I finally gave up and figured the Remington looked like the best one and knew I could send it back if I had problems with it. So far, I really like it. You have one plastic attachment that works fine to adjust beard length. Clicks on easily and I see no reason for it to go bad.  I put it at it&#x27;s highest setting and clicked it down a notch at a time until I heard some beard being clipped. I will leave it at the setting in the future and pick up an stray hairs with a comb and the bare razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If the motor or controls break, I will deal with that when it happens and report it here. I am surprised at how well it is made, when I look at the low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re: The bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that either these people who wrote them are the world&#x27;s worst grouches, or they are fake, paid for, reviews.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a gift after reading other reviews.  It&#x27;s a great trimmer especially for the price. Keeps it&#x27;s charge a long time, great functionality &amp; good sharp cutting blades. My husband has been very happy with this trimmer!</li>
            <li> Well let&#x27;s start off by saying it works... It holds a good charge. It has the three attachments it said it came with.&lt;br /&gt;The stubble and beard trimmer seem no different to me. The guard works, but honestly is rather sketchy. I just use this to trim. I thought I&#x27;d be able to do a-lot more with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard and settings just don&#x27;t cut it LITERALLY. I end up using the beard trimmer on the outer parts of my beard then using the stubble with no guard at an angle to fade to a decent stubble on the interior. Just too much effort had to buy another trimmer as well.</li>
            <li> Maybe not the most versatile, fancy product ever, but it does what it should for this price. Has held up well for over a year. I think I&#x27;ve charged it twice, using it once or twice a week. My only complaint would be that the gap in trim levels between the lowest level with the guard on, and the bare blade trim, is too much. In fact, I wanted to get something that fills that gap, but have determined to wait until this dies. But I think I might be waiting a long time.</li>
            <li> The build quality is really high, and the three trimmer heads are really solid. I use it daily and have had no issues with it at all.</li>
            <li> But I was pleased really as did not like this shaver. It hurt and made me bleed when next to the skin. It grabbed hair when trimming my bead. It dies because the head fell apart when a spring loaded bit came out. I did fix it once and it went for a few more months then did it again when away on holiday. Since I am half blind and couldn&#x27;t put back together, I removed it from my presence in a very dignified way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago got a Philips Norelco which has a vacuum cleaner built into its trimming head. So far very good. Does not hurt or make me bleed or grab hair. Also it is much cleaner to use. The vacuum cleaner works 95%!</li>
            <li> This product worked great for about 4 months trimming my beards once per week. After that I heard the motor slow down. I was able to charge it again, but it was cutting very slowly. After that final trim, it fails to even turn on anymore. On the Remington website they offer a 60 day warranty, so they clearly know their products will not last very long. Go with another brand unless you need something cheap for a few months.</li>
            <li> After many years using another trimmer, I bought this one. When I started using it, I was disappointed but hoped to get used to it. I never did. The adjustable guard keeps too much beard away from the blades, requiring 2x to 3x as long to trim as my previous Wahl. The guard also prevents me from trimming my mustache properly (i can&#x27;t bring the blades to the top of the mustache. Even after spending a long time trimming, my beard often comes out very spotty, with low spots and long spots. I recently bought a new Wahl (for half the price) and am once again happy when I trim</li>
            <li> This clipper is precise enough to shape my moustache. The beard guard makes trimming the beard a no-brainer! So easy... I look handsome when I&#x27;m finished!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is much more powerful than my old Wahl that it is replacing.  It seems to hold a charge much longer ( I am sure the Wahl is NiCad battery).  The depth guard is not as stiff as I would like, but after using it a few times it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;The only con with this trimmer is that I wish it had a vacuum hair catcher like my old Wahl.</li>
            <li> I had read several reviews on a variety of trimmers and selected this one. It is by far the best trimmer I have used. The interchangeable heads are easy to change. The adjustable trim head has all the depth positions needed. The blades are very sharp for extremely accurate trimming so be careful. The Lithium Ion battery holds a charge for a long period of time. This is the first product review I have ever written, but I think this product is worth the time. I hope this review helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chet</li>
            <li> Good product, good design. Like it. Using it for few weeks now. Only one of the blades is really sharp!!!</li>
            <li> Powerful trimmer with no pulling, durable and clean look. Feels solid and holds a strong charge! Best trimmer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son fXmas. He uses it every day.</li>
            <li> Im enjoying the high quality and precision of these trimmers.</li>
            <li> I was content with this product until it started to lose charge very quickly.  Buy another trimmer because this one won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I keep my beard close to my face.  The last clippers I had mowed through the hair, sending it flying everywhere on the sink, and there was also a distinct sound of each hair being cut.  Picture a machete hacking through bamboo, then turn the sound down to an extremely reduced level.  Well, this Remington MB4040 does not make that sound, and the cut hair seems to stay mostly in the plastic guard (easily emptied when you are done).  A fine product.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer - wish it had a mode below &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; which is the shortest - which I still consider a tad too long. Otherwise works as expected and does its job extremely well and with ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months now and am very happy with it.  The trimmer holds a charge well, and works just fine for regular trimming.  Like most devices in this class you have to hold the plastic guide to keep it from clicking in a couple of notches, but I&#x27;m used to doing that anyway.</li>
            <li> Solid trimmer, has some weight to it. comes with 3 removable blades and a blade guard. no travel case, though.</li>
            <li> I had the beard and mustache trimmer for almost a year.  It worked great.  I only shave about once a week.  Unfortunately it stopped working.  Either it wouldn&#x27;t charge or the trimmer just wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I contacted Remington and asked about the warranty.  The said to ship it back and they would replace it free of charge.  I sent it back on Monday.  By Friday I had a brand new razor sitting at my door!  Great service and great to see a manufacturer stand by their product.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product and any product from Remington.  Nice to finally find a company you can depend on.</li>
            <li> The quality of Remington products is without peer.  I still have the original trimmer I bought over fifteen years ago and it works very well.  I purchased the MB4040 to replace it because I knew it would be much quieter (which it is).  Unfortunately, even with three different blades, it can&#x27;t be adjusted to a low enough setting to provide a close-cropped look.  My old trimmer provides a closer trim which is what I am used to.  I&#x27;ve since returned the MB4040 and am going to try another Remington model which looks promising at it should provide more options for a closer cut (I hope).</li>
            <li> Do not like the shape.  Uncomfortable to handle.  Nicked myself couple of times.</li>
            <li> I own 2 of these and use them to shave my head as well as for my beard. One I&#x27;ve owned for at least a year and it seems to be holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is how long the battery holds up (am able to use many times before needing to recharge) and the low price of this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t vacuum the cut hairs like my other (double the cost) Phillips unit and so if vacuuming the hairs is important then this isn&#x27;t the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> OK, it&#x27;s simply a normal shaver.  But it works perfectly.  PERFECTLY.  Nothing fancy here, but it does look a bit like a Ferrari and I drive a crappy old car. But at least I have a slick battery-powered shaver whose batteries work perfectly months later and hold a charge for at least two weeks.  All the extra attachments look good but I don&#x27;t use most of them.  Best feature is the adjustable beard length scroll wheel.  Note:  you still need a hand razor for those up-close large areas (cheeks/neck) which this shaver doesn&#x27;t quite make smooth.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is very easy to use and the adjustable head allows an easy change of settings without turning off the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a good charge as well.  I get several weeks out of a charge.</li>
            <li> After my $9 trimmer from walmart died I decided to buy this one.  I&#x27;ve had it almost a year and use it everyday for a quick trim and haven&#x27;t had to charge it but once.  That is a selling point for me.  My cheap one I had to charge every 2 days.</li>
            <li> Love the razer. I do wish the #1 settings was a little shorter... but it works great and is solid.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer! I would recommend. Attachments are all you need with the built in length adjuster. Easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> if you are looking to trim your beard, this may not be for you. the way the adjustable tip is setup, everytime i used the thing I ended up with a bald spot on my jawline. it just doesnt keep a consistent length. Works fine for pubes though, lol</li>
            <li> I bought this two months ago and only had to charge it once. I use it about twice a week for about 2 minutes. My old trimmer (a cheap Wahl) would drain in two days just by sitting on my shelf. So yeah, I&#x27;m really impressed by the battery life. If you&#x27;re going on a short trip just give this trimmer a full charge and leave your charger behind. Otherwise, it cuts really well. The blades are very sharp, so be gentle. I&#x27;ve cut myself a couple times but not since my first week using it. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I use this product a few times a week and have for months and only have had to charge it twice the battery holds up great. Also the build quality is excellent I have had zero issues with anything since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever on a single-charge. That alone makes it a worthwhile upgrade from previous models.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer.  I have charged it once, and it has held its charge for months.  The trimmer works great!  It is way better than the built in trimmer on my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it with caution!  It is very sharp and the guard is required when shaving around sensitive areas.  It will nick you if you are not careful</li>
            <li> Went a week without shaving during a June trip to Yellowstone Park and for the first time, my facial hair came in gray.  My wife loved the newly discovered salt and pepper look but wasn&#x27;t a big fan once my stubble went into full Grizzly Adams mode after a week.  Yes, my hair grows in quickly.  Hence, the need for a trimmer with a stubble attachment to keep everything neat.  Did some research on Amazon and after reading hundreds of reviews on a dozen trimmers, went for the Remington MB040.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like:  The height wheel is really nice - at #2 or #3, I get a nice &amp;#34;three day stubble look&amp;#34;.  I use the lowest setting #1 to trim around my mustache and chin area - where the hair tends to get quickly out of control.  The guard also easily removes for precise trimming around the next line and stray hairs in the cheek area.  The battery also lasts a long time.  If I use the trimmer 2 to 3 times per week, I&#x27;m only charging the unit once every couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that the trimmed hair goes everywhere but I didn&#x27;t want a noisy vacuum attachment, so I knew I would have to deal with a mess after trimming.  I suggest you do the trimming in the shower or in front of the sink with a towel spread on the counter.  Overall, excellent buy and my wife is happy.  Happy wife, happy life.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product does all it promises to do and good value for money my grandson loves it</li>
            <li> My old razor i always used without the guard to get the 5 oclock shadow... this one sucks without the guard, if you want the stubble look this is not for you, youll cut your face up for sure!</li>
            <li> Fully charged upon receiving, swapped trimmer head for the small close shave trimmer. I use the plastic cover to just protect the trimmer blades when put away in my bathroom cabinet. I use te trimmer directly to my face for a close nice 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. Love the shaver. Have got about 20 shaves and now need to recharge yet. Love it. Thanks. Excellent price as well.</li>
            <li> It does a terrific job! I love the extra blade options to give you a better shave for the beard. Make sure you use the right blade attachment though as the blades will &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; a little if you don&#x27;t. Otherwise, it moves smoothly and effortlessly, and it gives me a comfortable, clean look. I also enjoy the cordless function. So far, I have used it for 2 weeks on the first charge (using it every other day) and it is still running at full speed. We will see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a couple of months to do a couple of specific tasks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Trim around my ear line and sideburns&lt;br /&gt;- Trim my entire beard if it&#x27;s been a week or so since my last clean shave, because the longer whiskers need to be pruned before using a DE blade, else they get stuck in the razor&lt;br /&gt;- Trimming other body hair, like the back of my neck, etc (close shave; no plastic guard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver excels at each of those tasks, and much better than the back-of-the-electric-razor style trimmers I&#x27;ve used before. I also love the extended battery life. I can go a month in between charges using this shaver a couple of times per week, easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Remington I&#x27;d had for far too long. The short is: I love it. It&#x27;s quiet, cuts clean, has good adjustment levels and holds a charge for a long time. I have a full beard and only trim twice a week, so I&#x27;m hoping for years of use. If it were stolen today I&#x27;d order another one tonight.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco kicked the bucket so I picked this up at Walmart for like $30 bucks or something. I keep my beard pretty short. Number 1 setting on this trimmer. I&#x27;ve never had a trimmer pull your hair so bad. I don&#x27;t know what it is about it, I&#x27;ve tried to figure out if the hair is getting pinched between something (like the guard and the blade) or if the blades need some oil. Who knows. I do know that the shave is crazy inconsistent. I get done and still see patches where it totally missed no matter how many times you go over the same spot. It&#x27;s like it doesn&#x27;t lift the hair to trim it or something. Just a bad trimmer. The batter life is great though. Although, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s truly lasting forever or maybe the fact that I dread using it so it just lasts that much longer from lack of usage. On to the next one for me. I&#x27;m really surprised to see that so many people gave it 5 stars. I just didn&#x27;t have the same experience.</li>
            <li> this is absolutely useless as a beard trimmer. There is no setting, and I mean NO setting, in which the trimmer, with the guard on, will touch facial hair in a way that allows for a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; look. I guess if I had a &amp;#34;Mountain Man&amp;#34; beard and needed to groom it, this would work, but a stubble trimmer it ain&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great battery strength, quick charging, and a powerful motor.  Oh, and very accurate trimming heads (you get 3 of them in various sizes).  I&#x27;m thrilled with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This gives as close a shave with clippers as you can get. Great to get short stubble without any razor burn. Shave every couple days with it for over a year and it&#x27;s still running good.</li>
            <li> Battery charge lasts about a month.  I use it about three times a week for shaving.  I went to this because I was getting a rash from a close shave with a safety razor and I never really liked an electric razor.  This gives me about a days growth look which is hip and at 57 years old, hip is good.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this shaver. It&#x27;s great for trimming around beard and also for taking down extra long stubble between extended shaves. Seems to last a very long time on one charge. Combs are easy to use and the settings for depth also very easy to set and change. No complaints here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First one lasted for 3.5 years. (Battery died) Bought a new one, but took the old one apart and will be replacing the battery so I have two. Everything else is still working on the old one.</li>
            <li> Works perfect and comes with 3 different, easily removable trimming heads. Holds a charge for very long. I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 months using it about once a week and I haven&#x27;t needed to charge it yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does leave a bit of stubble you still need to clean up with a straight or electric razor.</li>
            <li> Purchased November, 2013. No longer holding a charge long enough to fully trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the unit apart and it has a AA-sized battery inside, but it is welded in place and therefore not replaceable without special tools or without permanently damaging the circuit board. Until now, it has been a useful tool and nearly 2 years is pretty good for the price point. Just feels like a waste to discard something that just needs a new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington, make the battery serviceable!</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer  it is perfect</li>
            <li> I purchased this 9 months ago. It has not been on the charger since the first night. I use it minimum of 4 times a week. This trimmer rocks! Consistent, comfortable and keeps a ridiculous charge. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday present for my boyfriend and he loves it! Not bad for the price with all the accssories that come with this product.</li>
            <li> The stubble trimmer kept cutting me.  You would think I would have stopped after the 4th cut, but no, I went for lucky number 5.  Sent it back to Amazon, glad they make returns so easy.  It was very sharp though, and really cut things.</li>
            <li> Cons: UPDATED&lt;br /&gt;- Guard is not rigid, it is flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t come with oil. Although they say it doesn&#x27;t require it, but it is written in the manual that if you clean the blades with water you need to lubricate the blades with oil.&lt;br /&gt;- It will not give you sharp outlines. You better buy Wahl Detailor, or Andis T trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;- Trimming using the guard isn&#x27;t precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Long battery life, with less battery drainage.&lt;br /&gt;- Includes 3 different blades which is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;- Many length settings.&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful motor get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy blades removal.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;- Good grip, and ergonomically designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;- Not great for edging the mustache, and beard, If your beard or mustache was long it would do the job.&lt;br /&gt;- Will not give precise trimming.&lt;br /&gt;- Great battery, that is the biggest pro in it&lt;br /&gt;- This mainly would be good for shaving the entire beard before using a razor blade, line up sideburns, back of head, and over the ears, or if you want a stubble look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 14/06/2014&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only putting this update to rave about the battery life, and performance.&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is no longer being used for my facial hair, it&#x27;s now an armpit hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I had to get a better trimmer which is Andis superliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 20/06/2017&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been been over 3 years with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Works like day one. No battery issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is very impressive, it will not drain much when put on shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 27/06/2017&lt;br /&gt;The battery is almost dead. It charged for 25 minutes, and worked for 3.5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after draining the battery fully, and charging it. It will charge for 5 minutes then, the led turns off, as if it&#x27;s fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;then, after 2~3 minutes, the led turns back on by itself, as if it&#x27;s charging. I waited for 1 hour, and disconnect it.&lt;br /&gt;So, I turned on the trimmer, and it worked for only 3 minutes. So, the battery is almost dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has served me for 3 years, and 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ll head to the store, and buy a 14500 lithium ion battery, and replace it. Hope everything goes back to normal.ty. - Isn&#x27;t water proof. - Doesn&#x27;t support 220v. Only 110v - loud sound. - Guard is not rigid, it is flimsy. I think it is less durable. Cruzer 6 guard is better. - Doesn&#x27;t come with oil. Although they say it doesn&#x27;t require it, but it is written in the manual that if you clean the blades with water you need to lubricate the blades with oil. - If your beard or mustache is short, edging results will not be satisfying, but for longer hair like sideburns it would do the job. - Trimming using the guard isn&#x27;t precise. Look to my update down bellow.  Pros:  - Long battery life, with less battery drainage. - Includes 3 different blades which is helpful. - Many length settings. - Powerful motor compared to Cruzer 6. - Better trimming in the neck, but needs several passes. - Easy blades removal. - Easy to clean the trimmer. - Good grip, and positioning of blade. When I was using Cruzer 6 the trimmer head wasn&#x27;t easy to use it to do precise trimming. To be more clear, I don&#x27;t have a good view of what I am trimming, the braun cruzer 6 [ Face shaver model ] trimmer head is placed in a weird position that I have a difficult time seeing what I am going to trim. I&#x27;m not saying it is hard, but MB4040 is easier, that&#x27;s all.  I cannot make a professional review, since I am not a hairstylist. I am a person who doesn&#x27;t wan&#x27;t to waste he&#x27;s time at the barber shop. So in order to make my review more helpful I compared it to another beard trimmer.  I will update my review with time.  UPDATE: 3/2/2014  I have tried to use this trimmer for trimming my beard ( not shaving it ) with the guard. When I trimmed my sideburns on level 5 the result was good. BUT, when I trimmed the hair under my lips the result were OK. I Said to myself to push the the trimmer head a little bit, and the hairs were shorter. I thought maybe when I was not pushing it too hard the result wasn&#x27;t accurate, but when I pushed a little bit it trimmed shorter. So, I said why not push more? The result was horrible. Some of the hairs were short, and are gone, some isn&#x27;t equal in height to other hairs! I knew the reason before I started trimming, you wanna know why? Because the trimmer guard is FLIMSY, NOT HARD, ISN&#x27;T ENGINEERLY WILL DESIGNED! So, my recommendation to those people who ( only/main reason ) needs this product for trimming their beard is DON&#x27;T BUY IT. Reason? The guard will not give you a smooth accurate length of hair. As humans we might press strongly in this spot, and press gently in another spot while trimming, right? So, the product will not satisfy you in what you need it to do. As for my needs, this product fulfills them :), and the 5 stars remain :)  If you read this REMINGTON, then please change the guard to a new one, with a rigid structure.  UPDATE: 14/5/2014  My initial review was influenced by my past bad experience with Braun Cruzer 6. So, it was giving you the impression that I am happy about the product, which I was at the beginning. Because I have Braun 790 I wasn&#x27;t paying attention that this product lack the precision, because the shaver cleans the small hairs after it.  So, it&#x27;s down to this:  - Edging sideburns is good, because the hair is usually long, so it&#x27;s easy to edge it. - Edging the mustache is NOT precise if your mustache is not long. I mean if it&#x27;s around 5mm. You would try to edge it multiple times, and you still would not get the perfect result. Because I have Braun 790, it will clean those small hairs, and would give me a better shave around the edges of my mustache. It would look cleaner than before.  Bottom line: - Not great Edging of the mustache, and beard &amp;#34; If your beard or mustache was long u wouldn&#x27;t notice much, but if it was short you would notice &amp;#34; - Great battery, that is the biggest pro in it - This mainly would be good for shaving the entire beard. - Not aimed for a professional shave. Yes, with only this machine, you will not feel that you got the same shave you&#x27;d get at a barber shop.  This is not a good trimmer, but it&#x27;s decent.  If you got the money then consider two companies, Andis &amp; Wahl. They have great trimmers, especially those wired ones. Yes, many would like wireless, but the wired ones have the power to edge, and trim with breeze. Go to YouTube, and see.  I am thinking to go with the Andis T Trimmers &amp;#34; T-Outliner &amp;#34; or &amp;#34; Superliner &amp;#34;. As they edge way better from seeing at YouTube. Till now I don&#x27;t know if they can trim for specific lengths. Still asking. They would cost you extra 20$.  I left only 2 stars, because of the battery. Can&#x27;t say I hate it. It&#x27;s a decent trimmer.  Update: 14/06/2014  So, since using this trimmer for 7 months, it paid for itself, and more! I bought Andis Superliner 4820 Model which supports both 110v + 220v, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00791CU6K/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 It came with attachments: 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, and 3/8. Which exactly what I want. I have a review there that you can check it out :)  Comparing the two trimmers is not fair since they are in a different categories.  But, for letting you know what was the difference between the two, or let&#x27;s say between this and a wired trimmer that is from Andis or wahl, and can be zero gapped: Andis Superliner resolve all the complaints I said about the MB4040. With blade factory setting you can get as close as 0.1mm which will give you great edging, and when you zero gap the blade you would get a more precise edging, or closer shave. Blade cuts with less passes compared to MB4040 Attachments are better because they are rigid plastic not flimsy like MB4040 guard.  Now, I will never think of buying a trimmer. Andis superliner seems that it will serve me for years, will, let&#x27;s hope so :)  Conclusion:  MB4040 I would recommend it for people who travel. Battery, and decent trimming will definitely get the job done until you come back home. Or maybe with the collaboration with another razor you would get a stylish beard &amp; mustache.  Happy styling :)  UPDATE: 25/02/2015  This trimmer is working strong. Battery is AWESOME. I am really impressed with the battery life. You will get to the point that you will forget that this battery actually need to be charged! INCREDIBLE battery life.</li>
            <li> Battery Life seems good. Easy to adjust the length guard.</li>
            <li> The shaver worked marvelously at keeping my coarse, curly beard orderly for about 3 months. Then the battery stopped charging. I can&#x27;t find a contact number for Remington in the US, so taking advantage of the warranty is proving cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale at a department store to replace the older [[ASIN:B0009OMU0A Remington MB-200 Beard Trimmer]] I own, because its battery is wearing out. But I&#x27;m going to be returning it the next time I go to the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a \\&quot;defective\\&quot; unit, but I doubt it. Both the beard blade and the stubble blade randomly and repeatedly pulled at my beard hairs (which is quite unpleasant). The [[ASIN:B0009OMU0A Remington MB-200]] doesn&#x27;t do that at all. And something about the slippery design of the plastic guard made it completely impossible to get a consistent trim. I tried shaving over the same areas MANY times and from multiple angles, but this thing just would *not* trim certain areas. The guard seems to just flatten the hairs down, instead of lifting them up into the blades. Despite how hot the bearded model is in the product photos, *I* ended up looking like I tried to shave with a blindfold on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got out my [[ASIN:B0009OMU0A Remington MB-200]] and it cleaned up the mess left by this trimmer with zero hassle. So, I&#x27;ll just buy a new one of those instead. I sure wish it had the Lithium battery though.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this, being able to easily remove each cutting blade with the push of a button, the trimming guide snapping on easily, and the ergonomics are pretty great.  I don&#x27;t know if I just have exceptionally stubborn stubble or what, but I charged it up for the 24 hours, snapped on the stubble blade, and proceeded to pull out the hairs that have been making me look like an amish barnraiser.  I checked the box to make sure I bought a trimmer and not an epilator, then tried again and yep, the trimmer just kept yanking hairs by the root instead of shearing them off.  So beware on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten used to the tricks now, it looks like this trimmer only goes one way.  If I push it up my neck toward my jaw, everything cuts fine, but if I try to make a second pass by pulling the blade down my face, it&#x27;s like some medieval torture device that only knows how to irritate my skin and make my eyes water.  I know my beard can be a little majestic at times, but you&#x27;d think the &amp;#34;lithium ion&amp;#34; power would be enough to keep those whiskers at bay.</li>
            <li> Been pulling my hair out when I shave.  I have a cheaper shaver that isn&#x27;t as nice but it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out so I am using that instead. I feel like I wasted my money on this. I would have returned it but I never got around to it and my turn in window expired.  Plus I was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t pull my hair out with some oil and cleaning but it still did.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a wide range of shavers/trimmers from expensive Phillips and Braun to as cheap and disposable as Wahl&#x27;s. I had this one for over a year now. As you might have guessed it, it is very reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, the blades on this thing are top notch. Also the adjustable trimming height works perfectly. It is not water proof and you are discouraged to clean it under water, but I have done it several times (since it&#x27;s not that expensive if I have to replace it) and I have no issues. It hasn&#x27;t rusted and the trimmer still works electronically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing holds its charge like no other. Every other month or so I charge it because I think it shouldn&#x27;t have any charge left because I use it at least once per week if not more and each time I operate this thing for at least 20 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I do not know if there are any better trimmers out there. I used bleeding tech shaving/trimming stuff upwards of 300, and easily this is still the best. I am sure not everyone would agree with me but that is my personal opinion. If this stops working, I won&#x27;t even look for another brand/model and buy this with no hesitation even if it costs 100 bucks (realistically it won&#x27;t cost that much anyways).</li>
            <li> i bought it for my husband and he says it works great. With all the interchangable heads it does all you could ask for!</li>
            <li> This shaver has an amazingly long battery life. Used every other day, it lasts for up to a month, which means I can take it on trips without the charger. It&#x27;s also light enough to travel easily. And, of course, it does a good job beard trimming!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this trimmer. I am very picky about what I use to shave and trim my beard with, out of the many I have been through this is the best I have had so far. The charges do last a long time, I use it two - three times a week. to keep work happy. I other wise would have a long and thick beard.</li>
            <li> Read several reviews and they were all spot on.  I&#x27;d done some research and this product was rated among the top five on various sites.  The unit holds a charge very long and it really works well.  I have not used any of the other blades it comes with, as I read somewhere that you should not use without the guide.  Really nice razor.</li>
            <li> Works good. I wish the teeth were finer for the neck area.</li>
            <li> The battery life on this thing is great. It&#x27;s been about 2 months since it&#x27;s last charge and it&#x27;s still going just fine</li>
            <li> i love it, haven&#x27;t had to charge it ye,t the best beard cutter i had yet.</li>
            <li> I have used this 4 times now and have been pleased with its performance.  I use it primarily to trim my mustache, eyebrows and neck hair. It performs flawlessly. I like the easy way to adjust the trim level and it is a breeze to clean. Holds a charge for months.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Easy to use. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> Met all expectations. Like the manual height  adjustment as opposed to the automatic one I had on another model. Hopefully battery will last longer too.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li> I got this march 8th, and it is 1 week from September and I have yet to plug this in to charge once. I shave once every 3 days probably? Battery life is insanely good. The clippers without one of te size heads on it is very close to the skin where I have nicked it once or twice. Other than that I get a great stubble shave. I don&#x27;t grow a full beard at all so short stubbly is the only look I can pull off and this does the trick very well. Even a very very close shave is doable without the heads on it. Gives you that I shaved yesterday morning closeness.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to, but now that I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile it&#x27;s easy to use and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous model, the plastic guard on this one gets caught in my beard and pulls at my hair. I hope they update this and make the plastic guard more like the previous models.</li>
            <li> Been using for over a month to trim my goatee.  Still full power on its first charge.  Easy to clean too.  Fantastic trimmer.  Update 4/17/2016 Eight months later, I&#x27;ve still only charged this thing once.  Crazy power.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Trims well.</li>
            <li> Works great in the tight spots.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a month, then the battery would only run for about 2 minutes and died a few weeks after that.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy unit, with good heft. The battery seems to last forever compared to the last two trimmers I&#x27;ve had. Received at the beginning of January, charged it and it&#x27;s still going strong 3 weeks later after using it at least 4 or 5 times. The adjustability is great. Haven&#x27;t had a need to swap blades yet but the two screw setup should make it a snap. As for actually trimming, it does a very good job. As with most trimmers, trying to find the right method to do your mustache can be more difficult than the rest of your beard and I haven&#x27;t quite figured out the optimal use for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it a 5 but you don&#x27;t get a stand or case for it like every other unit I&#x27;ve ever purchased, which I found very odd. So you have the shaver, the blades and brush that you have to figure out what to do with between usages. My concern is that the blades will get misplaced.</li>
            <li> Have used it 3 or 4 times now, still haven&#x27;t charged it since the 1st long one when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded from the pg350 (cheaper built model with lots of attachments).&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a very close shave because I get rashes from using a blade. This unit cuts closer than the top of the line Wahl which my work colleague has, so that trimmer was off my list.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are very sharp, but don&#x27;t nick/cut my skin like my old ones did (maybe the old ones cut a tiny bit closer).&lt;br /&gt;The edges of the cutting head are smooth and don&#x27;t irritate if pressed along the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse hair on my face. This shaver does not slow down even when I try to make it down and push it fast. It is quite thorough, it does not pull/pinch the hairs, and on a second run over the same area you can hear that there is minimal hair being removed, meaning many passes are not required (not like my last one). I am impressed by the power of the lithium battery and so far have not found the maximum number of shaves her charge. It takes me about 10mins now (using the closest full width head attachment with no guide attached), down from about 15 for my old one (although my old ones closest cut attachment was a 17mm head).&lt;br /&gt;It is very light, which feels cheap. But I did not subtract any stars in my rating because it does give a very close shave, has a lithium battery, and is less than $35. I knew it was made in China and am happy with my product.&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the product is a little more curved than I was expecting, but does not impede any area of clipping, probably helps get under the chin on an upward stroke.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco beard and mustache trimmer pulled hairs a lot and I had to go over my beard a good 8 times to make sure nothing was missed.  It finally got so bad with the hair pulling that I ordered this...what a world of difference.  It must be the battery type or something but this thing you can just hear how much faster the blades move.  It saved me a good 5 minutes on trimming.  Really glad I ordered it, having hair yanked out really sucks.</li>
            <li> love it! so easy to use probably one of the best! def a good buy if you shave alot lol</li>
            <li> I upgraded from the $20 range trimmers which get dull with my thick facial hair too quickly.  Seems very powerful, well designed and time will tell about blade integrity.  3 are included for different preferences.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a good job...</li>
            <li> Less then 1 year old and will run for only a few minutes</li>
            <li> Arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my horse for last minute touch up&#x27;s while at the show.  Perfect to use on the other &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; in my life!</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in the hand and contours easily around the face.  Leaves a stuble look as advertised. Recently purchased and so far holds a charge over three shaves now.&lt;br /&gt;Good price and good product.</li>
            <li> Does the job of both direct trimming and thinning with the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that it is rechargeable and that it works well without the cord.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer. Holds a charge real well. have had it for months now and havent had an issues with it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> # This replaces an older Remington model with nicad battery finally failed after 12+ years.&lt;br /&gt;# Bought this four months ago, in March, 2014, for $29.99.&lt;br /&gt;# This one has good battery life, I&#x27;d estimate I can trim my beard 6+ times before needing a recharge, at roughly 5-10 minutes per use.&lt;br /&gt;# The length guide is easily adjusted or removed. The blade heads are easily swapped (I don&#x27;t use the third narrow goatee trimmer).&lt;br /&gt;# The fine head trims edges, neck and stubble more closely, and, being middle aged, it trims random ear and nose hairs well (note to self: use only the fine head for trimming, as the regular head can nick corners of nostrils).&lt;br /&gt;# The regular blade head for trimming my beard works well enough but doesn&#x27;t quite cut it all, literally. I set the guide to &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; -- with &amp;#34;9&amp;#34; being longest. The main issue I have is that it randomly misses a dozen or so hairs scattered most noticeable around the upper lip, mouth edges and under the lower lip, even if I go over areas multiple times from different angles. I have to spend some extra time finding and trimming these with scissors for a couple of days. This was not a problem with my previous Remington.&lt;br /&gt;# A minor issue is that it snags or pulls hairs once or twice when I trim my beard. It&#x27;s like plucking a hair with tweezers. Annoying.&lt;br /&gt;# I give it a score of 3 of 5 due to the missed hairs and snagged hairs. I&#x27;ll probably use this until it wears out after years of use, but then I&#x27;ll likely try a different trimmer.</li>
            <li> My battery failed, however it was great little trimmer while it lasted. I purchased the trimmer on December 1, 2013.  I threw it away July 23rd (8.5 months later)  because the battery would not hold a charge long enough for me to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> Works great ,good battery life.really like recharging instead of replacing them. Cuts well, length adjusts accurately and quickly.wordy rating is a pain.</li>
            <li> Cuts smooth and evenly. It has six trim settings and three trimming heads for a variety of trims. I have been using it for over a month and have not had to recharge it yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many shavers in the past, and this one really seems to be the cream of the crop. So far so good</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my hair short and it really works great and simple to use. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer on February 24th of this year and I&#x27;ve only charged it twice; once when I first received it, and today (8-30-2013). I only use it once or twice a week to trim my beard, but I still can&#x27;t believe the battery lasted 6 months without needing to be charged. It has plenty of power and trims nice and neat. Thanks Remington, for a great product!</li>
            <li> Roll the dice and hope you get one that works. Mine was fine but then it suddenly stopped working after about a month. It just won&#x27;t turn on at all now. And I didn&#x27;t drop it or anything.  Piece of junk. Throwing it in the garbage at this very moment. Moving onto another brand. Later Remington.</li>
            <li> i like its grip, its function. its battery holds for long period of time even without use.&lt;br /&gt;recommended product.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and cuts great...Even use it to cut the back of my wife&#x27;s hair on her neck-line.  Great Product!  BLESSINGS in HIM!</li>
            <li> works well and says charged a long time with the Lith Bat - cant really see a big dif in the change out heads so I just use the one that was installed when it showed up.</li>
            <li> The battery life on this trimmer is amamzing!!! And the attachments stay firmly in place no worries about over trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> I had no idea which brand to buy for a Christmas gift -- now I&#x27;m glad I went with the Remington.  It does a great job.</li>
            <li> great product!&lt;br /&gt;excelent battery</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  Powerful and easy to adjust.  Just what I was looking for.  It even came charged right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning to make my mustache and goatee neat.  Just find the proper setting for the length you want and the trimmer does the rest.  It cuts the stray hairs and those that have grown too long for the setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remove the guide, turn the trimmer over, and you can trim along your lip line, leaving a clean and neat appearance.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever had. Very easy to use and battery last for ever! Very sharp and my beard has never looked so good!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent trimmer. It holds a charge for a long time and I have used it for several weeks - 1 -2 times per week- without having to recharge. It takes a little time to get the hang of the various blades and the adjustable comb but follow the instructions and it works very well. A fine purchase indeed!</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful glide throug my rough scruff. Very good charge. good price. easy adjustment of lengh. three blades a bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this over 2 years and used it to trim my beard and even shave my head.  Use 3 or more times a week.  Holds a charge for at least a couple weeks.  It is not cutting as well but after 2 years what do you expect.</li>
            <li> Good clippers, but after a few uses it started tugging on my hair. After a good cleaning/oiling, it works better than it did out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2-ish years later, the clippers will no longer charge, and are useless.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this trimmer...</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Remington beard trimmer. All the others have batteries or chargers that have died or are in the process of dying.  Ok, but why do I keep buying them? The reason I like the trimmers is that they have a very short length setting -- which suits my preferences.  I was excited to see a Lithium-Ion version but I was disappointed on two significant counts.  First, the shortest setting (1) is equivalent in length to the 2 or 3 setting on my other Remington trimmers.  I think they took a giant step backwards here.  The other problem is that after coming out with a 220V compatible charger on my previous Remington trimmer charger, this Li-Ion version has reverted to a 110V only.  I travel a lot internationally and this is my ONLY electronic product that is not compatible with most of the world.  Another giant step backwards.</li>
            <li> Nice soft blades. Makes a lot of noise. Cuts uneven on facial hair</li>
            <li> I had a pretty big beard for No Shave November and now I like to keep it trimmed so I bought this. Excellent shaver. Once you adjust the height it stays in place, unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned. Battery life is good so far and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the best one I have bought so far, the best thing about it is the battery, I can&#x27;t believe how long the battery last, it&#x27;s easy to use and clean, I have no problem trimming  my beard and mustache, I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great and cuts low enough that I do not have to use a razor!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He loved it so much that when he accidentally left his at a hotel, he just purchased another one. Solidly built and holds up well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now and I&#x27;m still on the first charge. Quality design and simple to use.</li>
            <li> Clippers worked fine, but very disappointed in the battery&#x27;s life. Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long. Completely died after about nine months. No replacement available. If the latter were available, I&#x27;d not buy it due to what might be a relative cost issue.</li>
            <li> I was buying the really cheap shavers in the drug store and the blades would go quickly and they wouldn&#x27;t stay charged. I spent a few dollars more on this nice Remington and am so glad that I did. I have been using it a few months now and I look forward to using it each time. The charge never goes down and I forget to plug it in all the time. Great battery. Looks great too. Looks really expensive. Nice and solid. Great price I thought for something of quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Remington for years and this is well made just like all my previous trimmers. And the Li+ rechargeable won&#x27;t memory out.</li>
            <li> Crap.  Purchased about a year ago.  Height  adjustment clogs and is poorly designed.  The battery was weak from the start, and now will not hold a charge.  Trimmer will not work on 110 only.  Buy a Phillips; I&#x27;m heading g out to buy one now.  Ugh.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, The blades included are great. I bought it to use on my dogs for quick trims of the feet and around the face on my poodle. It has done a good job for what I wanted it for. I also liked that it didnt come with a whole bunch of combs and things I didnt need.&lt;br /&gt;Simple but good!!!!!</li>
            <li> The blade continuously pulled and yanked on the hair on my face.  If I would use it to line up my beard line it would always scratch my neck and even give me knicks that would bleed.  I thought it would get better with a couple uses but it never did and had to return it.  Had the potential to be a great item though.</li>
            <li> It does more then I had expected, in fact, I used it for a slight buzz cut, which in one cut saved my $15.00 on going to the shop to get my hair cut. It did it with no problem, I am really happy with it, and it holds a charge for what seems like forever.  Clippers are sharp, easy to use, could not have made a better purchase.</li>
            <li> I used this to trim my beard and to keep my hair line clean. It holds a charge for a very long time. The settings are easy to adjust and has a good grip.</li>
            <li> I have charged this thing ONLY 3 times since I have had it. It holds a charge for a long time. Now I do not use it every day, but at least 3-4 times a week for trimming. It works great as well. The charging cord could be made a lot better. It is one of those cords that will eventually break right near the part tha plugs into the shaver if you are not careful. I charge mine, then hide the plug in the drawer until next charge. Charging light would be nice if it would tell you when the battery is about to die, or show what the remaining power is, but for the price, that is no big deal. The final thing is that it will not charge while using it, which means, if it dies, you can&#x27;t use it until it is charged.  Battery life is the biggest plus. For $29, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Battery stopped working after 2 month, this product is useless, horrible battery.</li>
            <li> Works Great. I like the three different cutters. Holds charge very well.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  Fast shipment.  A++</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very noisy&lt;br /&gt;No speed adjustment&lt;br /&gt;Shape is kind of awkward&lt;br /&gt;I am planning to buy the 4550</li>
            <li> 10/26/14 - Worked great as a trimmer, but now 1.5 years in the battery will no longer hold a charge. Says 2 years warranty, will try to see how my luck goes getting it repaired.    Update  10/28/14 - Called Remington as the comment below recommended, and in less than 5 minutes a replacement trimmer is on the way at no cost to me, with a pre-paid return shipping label. Great customer service! Have modified review from a 3-star to a 4-star. Will update if situation changes but I expect to be a satisfied customer and will buy Remington from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Really good battery life, but it pretty much ends there  - at least for trimming short beards.  The &#x27;slide up &amp; down&#x27; guide is bulky and the hair grooves are ineffective.  Doing stubble or close trimming requires blade changes.  My old $9 trimmer with snap-on guides was far easier to use and also was gave more consistent results.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied as it didn&#x27;t work after few months. I went back to India and there is no customer service centers [i should have checked this first].</li>
            <li> Amazing battery life.  One full charge will last months (with occasional use.)&lt;br /&gt;Nice cut.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  Bought it to replace a Norelco that finally broke that I couldn&#x27;t find again to buy.  This one will run forever on one charge.  Absolutely forever.  I don&#x27;t trim my beard but once or twice a week but this will go months and months without having to charge.  I&#x27;ve got a thick beard and it works great on it.</li>
            <li> I had an older Remington trimmer for years and loved it, but the battery finally died. So I decided to buy another Remington, however this one failed me right out of the box. I have a thick beard and it would get caught on some of my wiskers and just pull them...OUCH! I gave it a second shot another day with the same results. I&#x27;m not one to write 1 star reviews, but it completely doesn&#x27;t work for me. Luckily I can send it back and get a full refund.</li>
            <li> It works well. Easy to clean and adjust. Blade width is a good compromise between precision and getting the job done.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day and I love the attachments and the ability to trim my beard to a certain length. The best part of this is the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable. The charge on this trimmer last forever I have only charged it once with almost 2 months of use on it. Very good buy and I highly recommend this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 5/4/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I have had it just over 3 months now, and I have only had to fully charge it twice. That is pretty dang good if you ask me. But I do want to add some details. The shave using the blades is not super close but good enough for a good stubble. But hair will often find its way inside under the blades where they then get stuck in the factory applied grease so that is kind of a pain. That will eventually get gummed up but nothing too bad. Also want to add that the plastic attachment for trimming you beard to a specified length, the plastic attachment is kind of flimsy and even if you apply just a little more pressure it will trim to a shorter length. Furthermore the trim length selection wheel is easy to accidentally bump while trimming causing it to fly down to the shortest length. I did that once, and then I just had to shave my beard real short. I was not happy. So in general it is a great beard trimmer with amazing battery life. but the hair can gum the inside of the trimmer up, and the plastic beard trimmer is flimsy, and last the wheel for selecting trim length needs a lock feature to prevent someone from accidentally turning it while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;Multiple attachments&lt;br /&gt;Trim selection wheel&lt;br /&gt;Good shave&lt;br /&gt;Fast&lt;br /&gt;Powerful motor&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change blades&lt;br /&gt;Sleek look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Hair can gum up under the blades&lt;br /&gt;Loud&lt;br /&gt;Flimsy plastic beard trimming guard (want to add that if you trim with the wrong angle using this you will shave to the skin)&lt;br /&gt;Trim length wheel needs a lock feature to prevent changing when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a great buy for the price!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE PLEASE READ!!!! THIS IS TO THE MANY THAT RATE THIS LOW STARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok after spending some time reading the low reviews I want to add a few things.&lt;br /&gt;First there are 3 blades with this trimmer. Below I will describe them for further use in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok looking at the pictures on this amazon product description page I will refer to the 3rd picture from the top in the description.&lt;br /&gt;So the 3 blades are as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Beard Trimming Blade. (This is the big blade with the wide teeth)&lt;br /&gt;2. Goatee Trimming Blade. (This is the one with the small cutting blade with fine teeth)&lt;br /&gt;3. Stubble Trimming Blade. (This is the one with the same length blade as the Beard Blade but it has finer teeth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so many users complain that they cut themselves when using this trying to shave their bare skin. So use this guide line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beard Trimming Blade is only supposed to be used with the plastic guide for TRIMMING YOUR BEARD NOT SHAVING YOUR FACE.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the stubble blade on my neck, but I don&#x27;t care for that blade much.&lt;br /&gt;After trimming my beard a little with the Beard Trimming Blade AND THE PLASTIC GUIDE. I then use the GOATEE TRIMMING BLADE TO SHAVE TO MY BARE SKIN, so I use the GOATEE Blade to shave my neck and the edge of my chin strap to keep it styled. And I HAVE NEVER BEEN CUT USING THE GOATEE BLADE I just shave strips under my neck until I am finished. So ONLY USE THE BIG BEARD BLADE WHEN YOU ARE TRIMMING, AND NOT SHAVING YOUR BEARD, AND YOU HAVE TO USE THE GUIDE WITH THIS BLADE. 2. USE THE SMALL GOATEE BLADE FOR ALL OTHER SHAVING THAT INVOLVES SHAVING TO BARE SKIN LIKE UNDER YOUR CHIN AND ON YOUR NECK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also there are some general guidelines to use when dealing with lithium ion batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First don&#x27;t let them drain all the way that can ruin the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Also don&#x27;t let them sit for a long time without charging doa maintenance charge like once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t post links but just Google how to charge and maintain lithium ion batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow these few rules and you won&#x27;t cut yourself when using this. And at least look into how to safely use and charge lithium ion batteries. Not all things are maintenance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/27/2016!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for a little over 2 years now, and have only charged the battery less than 10 times. In fact, I haven&#x27;t even charged it yet this year. I use it about once a week to trim up my beard, and it always works. I have read several bad reviews regarding the battery. Make sure when you buy it to follow the directions and FULLY charge it when you open the package. After that, I only charge it when it is dead or very low, and that seems to do the trick for me. This is the best beard trimmer I have ever used. Two years later, and I still highly recommend buying this, and just read the instructions and follow them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/20/2017!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS LASTED ABOUT 3 YEARS. It&#x27;s dead now. The battery won&#x27;t even hold a charge for more than 20 seconds before it strains to cut hair. Still 3 years isn&#x27;t too bad for a $30 beard trimmer. I need to find another one to buy. Not sure if I will buy the same one. Maybe I&#x27;ll look for some that have replaceable rechargeable batteries. Like phone batteries.</li>
            <li> Without the attachments this works fine, but if you want to trim to a certain height using the attachments, you&#x27;ll have to work extra hard. Unless you have a beard that stands straight up, the thickness of the plastic basically pushes your hair down so that it only trims half the hairs each time, very uneven and you have go over the same area multiple times, trying to go against the grain as much as possible to catch as many hairs as possible (even then I sometime have to take the attachment off ad try to catch a few remaining hairs very carefully) .</li>
            <li> best trimmer I have ever gotten. no problems, battery last forever, easy to clean, and powerful motor. I have had it about 3 years still kicks ass. plan to buy it again when it does quit. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After trying several different trimmers, this Remington MB4040 has met my needs.  Long charge life, powerful motor, easy to clean and lots of setting options.  Don&#x27;t waste your money with other trimmers.</li>
            <li> This works very well for me.  I&#x27;ve tried several, but didn&#x27;t like them for one reason or another.  Gave the rejects to my sons, so they are happy, too.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my 19 year old Remington MB30.    It does everything that did, but with better batteries and more cutting head options.   If it lasts half as long as my old one I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> This thing is almost entirely useless and I&#x27;ll tell you why: THE GUARD. It only comes with the one and it sucks. As a positive, it seems like it does a good job at the detail of my goatee in that it looks neat and there aren&#x27;t as many visibly stray and messy hairs. However, I bought this to TRIM the goatee, not just style it and in that respect it fails. I have it all the way down on the closest setting, which isn&#x27;t close enough. If you look at the trimmer with the guard on the guard rests about an inch higher than the blade, not flush on the blade. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s guarding itself from the guard. Meanwhile my goatee is still as thick as it was, just neater. Sure I can take the guard off but then what&#x27;s the point of the guard if it&#x27;s useless?</li>
            <li> The husband is very pleased with this product. It is exactly what he was wanting.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Have had this for over three years. I use it to trim my short beard once a week. It has to be charged maybe once every four months and is still running strong. Great product.</li>
            <li> My beard is older than a lot of people that I work with. I have been trimming for a long time and have worn out a lot of trimmers and scissors. Where has this trimmer been? It works great and does a great looking job in less time than I am accustomed to. Beard looks good, trimmer cleans up easily, lasts a long time on a charge. Can&#x27;t say how long it will last but I hope it lasts for years. Easy to use and adjust.</li>
            <li> charger stopped working, so the product became useless</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for a 8+ year Remington trimmer that the battery was failing on. Works just fine. My beard length is about 1/4&amp;#34; long and keeps it trimmed properly. Charged battery fully upon receipt and have not charged it since.  It&#x27;s been at least 2 months and still going. Would buy another.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just another shaver with few bells n whistles. I didn&#x27;t seen anything special. The attachment for styling beard is not effective. There are no other attachments that can give you fine detailing options. The biggest pain in the wrong place is the stupid placement of the on and off switch. Where your thumb rests is NOT the one. That&#x27;s the depth adjuster. Grr! How many times have I got confused with that. So took off a star for that. Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Works great, I use on my cat that has fine long hair, that gets matted close to her skin. Works well on me too. Caution if you stand blade on end it can be quite bitey and will draw blood.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer was a Remington and I had used it with no problem for about 8 years. I still had no problems with it but decided to upgrade anyway. I chose another Remington because of the quality of the first and I have been very happy with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better beard trimmer.  It&#x27;s sleek, easy to handle and does a great job.  I keep my beard light and find that I don&#x27;t need any adjustment at all to the depth  level adjustment feature.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer mainly for the stubble trimmer feature... And it works great! Perfect 3 day look in seconds. Makes me wish I had retired my old trimmer long ago.</li>
            <li> Does good job on my mustache and beard, long charge life for a reasonable price. But not very good on stubble.&lt;br /&gt;And as always great service and quick shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for about a 1 1/2 years now. I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. I use mine every other day for not much more than a minute or two on my moustache and goatee. I haven&#x27;t had to charge it more than 3 times in the time I have owned it. I think that is incredible. The 3 heads that come with it make it very flexible to any type of trimming. I am convinced you can&#x27;t find a better trimmer regardless of how much you spend.</li>
            <li> No, really.  This thing worked about as well as a something you&#x27;d buy off a street cart sandwiched between fake purses and burnt Steven Segall DVDs.  Stick with Wahl.  This thing literally fell about (cheaply glued together) when taking it out of the box.  Never made it past the two minute mark.</li>
            <li> My husband asked for this for his birthday. It&#x27;s very nice and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Be careful be careful what setting this item is on otherwise thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of the Remington MB line of trimmers over the past 10-years to groom my full beard.  The old trimmers had a bad habit of losing the ability to correctly hold a charge after a couple years.  This unit works exactly as the old trimmers did: with 9 length settings for triming, a simple on/off switch, and a guard that easily comes off for cleaning the unit of cut hair.  There&#x27;s no loud vacuum included, there&#x27;s no useless secondary trimmer to pop open randomly, and -- most importantly -- there&#x27;s no useless touch screen included in this model.  I charged my unit overnight after receiving it and have been using it for a couple weeks now without it needing a recharge.  It moves effortlessly through my beard and seems to trim it well, arguably better than the old units.  In addition to \\&quot;classing up\\&quot; the design of this unit, the weight has been re-balanced so that the head is heavier than the handle, which makes shaping a beard (particularly cutting in the direction of growth, for a longer beard) nearly effortless.  I love this trimmer and hope I never have to buy another one again now that it&#x27;s using Li-Ion batteries.</li>
            <li> The Mustache and beard trimmer works perfectly, especially when you are travelling. The trimmer is small, effective and very convenient.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid when I looked at the pictures of this product. It has 3 different heads for trimming different things which is really nice but it looks like you have to use a screwdriver to switch out each head. Thankfully this isn&#x27;t the case. Each head is screwed into a plastic case which easily snaps into the main trimmer device. To take it out you push a button and pull it out to easily replace it with a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic protector feels smooth against my skin as I trim my goatee. I love how easily it trims and how close of a shave I get when doing the sides of my face.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is versatile, easy to use, and generally a good trimmer (especially for the price). At the beginning, it charged quickly and held a charge for quite a while. However after a year, it stopped holding a charge at all, and cannot be powered through the wall charger. I&#x27;ve had to replace it.</li>
            <li> Worked once after purchase. Failed to hold a charge afterward. Completely dead now. Avoid at all costs</li>
            <li> THE BEST TRIMMER EVER I NEVER HAVE TO CHARGE IT EITHER SERIOUSLY THIS THING IS THE BOMBBBB! GOT IT FOR MY HUSBAND HE LOVES IT SO MUCHHH!</li>
            <li> The prior model which I used for several years is my preference. This model has more cutting heads but the comb is not as effective, it is harder to clean and I have managed to cut myself twice (something that never occurred with the prior model I used). In fairness the new machine may have a superior battery but time will tell.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Battery Life&lt;br /&gt;  2. Power&lt;br /&gt;  3. Rotary wheel trim length adjustment&lt;br /&gt;  4. Relatively easy head changes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Width of device makes fine trimming difficult, even with the smaller trimming blade&lt;br /&gt;  2. Uneven length when using adjustable feature&lt;br /&gt;  3. To achieve more evenness, I use longer length setting &amp; back-shave. Makes a mess.&lt;br /&gt;  4. Nice even trim above lip virtually impossible for me to achieve so far. Looks like ends are cut to two different lengths.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift but decided to try it out for myself. It had a great ergonomic feel to it. I may have to replace my old unit. I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This thing actually cut me, I&#x27;ve never had an electric trimmer do that to me. I think the blades are too sharp. Also with the guide on, it doesn&#x27;t cut short enough if you want that 1 day stubble look. I also found the angles you have to hold it awkward.</li>
            <li> Sara&#x27;s husband:Great trimmer, finally a suitable replacement for my old Norelco. I did not want a trimmer that requires changing the guides, so I was pleased to find this one with an adjustable guide. I thought I would miss the pop-up trimmer, since this one has a separate small cutter to use for trimming tight areas. However I have found I can use the fine tooth regular cutter to do everything. I do my hair ( I don&#x27;t have much ) and beard with the guide on and the close trimming with the guide off. The excellent power and battery life are a bonus!</li>
            <li> After about 5 months, I retired the unit and purchased a Philips QG3270/41&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts cleanly--no pulling&lt;br /&gt;Decent battery life&lt;br /&gt;Well constructed for its price&lt;br /&gt;Includes charging light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good for very short stubble; does not cut as closely as other trimmers (from Wahl and Philips)&lt;br /&gt;Very bulky: Hogs shelf space and not the most convenient for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Heavy compared with other units. For a lithium powered shaver, even the A/C adapter is large and heavy&lt;br /&gt;Limited accessory set. Some units come with a large number of junk accessories, but the Philips has genuinely useful fine trimmers, etc.</li>
            <li> good to handle for a hair cut , but to trim a beard is not so good .....is cutting the beard to short !</li>
            <li> This trimmer/groomer is light weight  and easy to use.  Adjusting the cutting head to the desired length is easy.  I find that trimming my beard takes only a minute or two.  I would have rated this with five stars but I find that I have an occasional pull on a hair during use, which is really uncomfortable. This may get better as I use the trimmer more and learn to avoid positioning it so this pulling takes place.  I have used a corded trimmer in the past and like the cordless feature of this unit a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The cutting head stays cool to the touch and the unit is quiet.  This is an excellent value at this price.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of Beard trimmers , but this one is too much , great power , perfect handling . Is Superb .</li>
            <li> Great performance and accessories.  The length knob is very easy to use for multiple lengths on different parts of my beard.  The only downside is the hair goes absolutely everywhere.</li>
            <li> After 6 months the battery lasts about 3 minutes.  Even if left plugged in the power dies.</li>
            <li> I have been using this one from a long time...its working great for me. One full charge will give up to 7-10 trims. It does not have a option to close trim the hair and it may not be good if we do not have enough hair to trim.</li>
            <li> Had a nice Wahl trimmer and it dies :-(. Bought this as it was $30 whereas a replacement for the one I had was over $50.&lt;br /&gt;I should have paid for the Wahl. While this trimmer is ok, the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow blade is more like a 5am blade. It leaves my hair a bit longer than I&#x27;d like so because I am already starting out a longer length, I have to trim sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Live and learn then stick with what you love.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy a $200 trimmer until you&#x27;ve tried this $30 one and hated it (you won&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stepped guard and simple design of this trimmer have been useful for quite some time to me.  It recharges quickly and the battery seems to last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not shave frequently, so I can&#x27;t say that if you sprout facial hair like a chia pet and simply have to cut it off daily that this thing will last, but I&#x27;ve seen no indication of wear and tear on mine and I&#x27;ve had it for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And honestly, you were probably looking at some $200 trimmer, and i&#x27;ve had like 3 of those, and they all break, and yeah, maybe they are pretty nice, but at somewhere around $30, this thing does the trick quickly and good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Powerful and great little trimmer. Worth the price and keeps a strong charge.</li>
            <li> First: I wish the #1 setting was shorter.  I like the 3-day stubble look and the guard on #1 is too long, so I remove the guard and just use the stubble attachment (blade) and that is TOO short IMHO.  Kind of a bummer.  Not worth knocking a star for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, very happy.  3 metal interchangeable blades/heads.  Very quiet based on the Panasonic I had before.  Long battery life.  Quick charge.  LED indicator when charged. Wish it said something about when and how to oil/grease it.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer almost everyday for clean up.  The battery last forever and the trimmer works great.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned !!</li>
            <li> For me it stopped working after 2 weeks If you are buying it for fixing you beard or mustache look for something else. The viewing angle is really bad ( you cant really see what you are doing)&lt;br /&gt;on the plus side battery does last a long time (as long as mine was working) and fit and finish is great.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer for beard and mustache!</li>
            <li> This is the best rechargeable trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. Great combination of battery life, compactness, versatility, and usability. It&#x27;s sharp, powerful, adjustable, keeps a charge for months at a time, is compact and it doesn&#x27;t have a million useless parts in a bag.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Haven&#x27;t had to recharge for almost three months!</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a very long battery life. The first charge lasted so long that I honestly don&#x27;t know how long that it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with three different types of blades for different types of trimming, which change in only a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I have would be directed towards the designers of this unit. It would be perfect if the power button was at the top instead of under the guard height adjustment. It&#x27;s in kind of an odd position for turning on and off quickly. I invariably hit the height adjustment wheel when I&#x27;m trying to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this is the best trimmer that I&#x27;ve owned. I definitely like the Lithium-ion battery. Ni-cad batteries blow, so this is a major improvement.</li>
            <li> After about a month of twice/week use, I am still pretty happy with the trimmer.  I like the guard, although the thumb wheel is a little difficult to turn.  That isn&#x27;t a BAD thing- it makes it very hard to accidentally slip to a different setting while in use- it just takes an extra second or two to adjust it.  Seems to hold a charge very well, I have yet to recharge it.  Lots of little hair clippings seem to get into the area under the changeable blade, but again, doesn&#x27;t detract from the quality of the device- at least, not yet.  Overall, it&#x27;s not the best designed clipper, but it gets the job done &amp; very nicely.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts forever. I came from an old school Wahl so I am exited about this being cordless, lighweight and does a nice job of manscaping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco G390 grooming kit for a number of years. I&#x27;ve been happy with it as a beard and mustache trimmer, but the time between charges is getting shorter, it will not work on AC, and the battery is not replaceable. I welcomed the chance to try the Remington MB4040.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike my old Norelco, the Remington MB4040 is intended only to trim and groom facial hair. It comes with three heads: beard, goatee, and stubble. There is a grooming comb that can fit over any of the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the Remington MB4040:&lt;br /&gt;- The grooming comb slides into a pair of channels and is then adjustable using a thumb wheel.&lt;br /&gt;- It is a little bit bigger and noticeably heavier than the Norelco, which makes me think it probably has a more powerful motor  and a higher capacity battery.&lt;br /&gt;- The heads appear to be well-designed and are nicely finished. Since they are held together with screws, you could probably dissemble them for a through cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;-The MB4040 uses a lithium-ion battery, which does not have the memory-effect problems of Nickel Cadmium and is less toxic when it comes time to dispose of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I prefer about the Norelco:&lt;br /&gt;- The beard grooming guide comb is flexible, which makes it easier to get an even cut while following the contours of my jaw line and chin.&lt;br /&gt;- A base was included that has spaces for the trimmer, the five extra heads, the hand comb, and the cleaning brush. I have drawers in my bathroom counter that are deep enough to hold the base with the trimmer standing up, making it easy to keep all the parts together without keeping it on the counter or a shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple of minor issues with the Remington MB4040:&lt;br /&gt;- It does not include a travel bag or any other type of container. At the very least, it should come with a small bag or plastic box to hold the two extra trimming heads.&lt;br /&gt;- When you open the box, the first impression is that the item has been previously opened and then re-packaged with the inside packaging sloppily stapled back together. In a crowded category of items likely to be given as gifts, the last thing you want  is something that looks like it&#x27;s been sold and returned or maybe even used and returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, however, the Remington MB4040 seems to me to be a solid performer that does the job it was designed to do and which should have a fairly long life.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried the stubble beard before and wasn&#x27;t sure what would be the best tool, but after reading reviews this one was recommended and it works fantastic!</li>
            <li> Razor replaced another brand that I had for several years. I hated to part with it but I&#x27;m very happy with this Remington razor.</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts really well, and the accessories and range of trimmer lengths make it an excellent product. But my favorite feature is its battery. I ordered this back in August. I have a beard that I trim with a 5 or 6 clip, every 2-3 weeks. This takes me about 10 minutes to do. That being said, I have only charged it once. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Battery life is excellent. Does a great job at trimming goatee to a precise length.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have a Remington similar to this one and have had it for I guess five years or maybe more and it&#x27;s still going but I can tell the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to but that&#x27;s normal.I WILL buy another Remington when this one quits.I know a co-worker told me to buy a Braun.But after pricing them I decided WTF?Why should I pay $100 for a Braun when it probably will not last much longer then Remington and even if it does look how many Remington&#x27;s I could buy compared to a more expensive foreign brand.I&#x27;ll stick with what I know last a long time for my money.</li>
            <li> Great product, smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and the motor works great! It got 3 stars because the plastic to adjust the length of your hair trim is cheap and breaks very easily..</li>
            <li> The battery system on this is fantastic.  You can go a long time between charges and it feels like it has a ton of power.  My only concern is that without a guard in place, the blades can easily &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; you, for example the top of your lip.</li>
            <li> I have a goatee and like to keep it trimmed reasonably short and edged away from my mouth.  I was using a barber trimmer and found that the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; attachments were either a bit too deep (leaving the beard too long) or a bit too shallow (cutting it too close) with no in-between.  With this razor, the ability to ratchet the comb up and down in very small increments using a thumb dial on the body makes this a perfect solution to that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use the full size blade, so I can&#x27;t comment on the smaller blade, but the full size cuts adequately, requiring only the occasional second pass to catch a stray hair or two.  It&#x27;s relatively easy to keep clean (see next paragraph) and is small enough to store in the medicine cabinet above the sink so it is ready for instant use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away one star for a small (but, to me, important) design glitch.  I like to trim/finish my beard away from my mouth (a nod to my wife&#x27;s not liking to &amp;#34;kiss beard&amp;#34;).  In order to do that fine a trim, I need to pull the comb off the head all the way and this isn&#x27;t particularly smooth or efficient.  The comb snaps into the guide and I feel like I&#x27;m forcing it to do something it wasn&#x27;t designed to do by pulling the comb out of the guide.  And when I go to replace it in the guide, the design of the barrel of the razor and the placement of the guides doesn&#x27;t naturally allow this to happen without stopping and perfectly aligning everything.  Even if you don&#x27;t do the fine trimming like I do, you still need to pull the comb off to fully clean the razor so I know I&#x27;m not doing anything wrong.  It just feels like it is wrong and eventually going to hurt the razor/comb function in some way.  I wouldn&#x27;t call this a show stopper.  Just something to be aware of in an otherwise well designed grooming aid.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this rechargeable trimmer.  Big bang for the buck, quality and its multi purpose exchangeable heads are on par with more expensive units.</li>
            <li> This is a bad ass beard trimmer.  This thing is powerful and cuts my hairy face with ease.  Better than my old Remington which I saved for what reason I have no clue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked my Remington MB-200, which has lasted me about four years, until recently the clipper assembly has started coming loose. Not a bad performance lifespan for a $25 trimmer. So, I figure I would treat myself to the \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; model MB4040 as a replacement... and I couldn&#x27;t be more sorry for it. First, as others have described, the lowest guard setting is simply not short enough. When I compared, setting the MB4040 guard to #1 (the shortest) it was the equivalent of the MB-200 setting of #3. Second, you can&#x27;t comfortably use the MB4040 without the clipper guard attached. If you do the clipper teeth snag on your stubble, cut the skin and the bare metal faceplate heats up to nearly burning temperatures. Third, I&#x27;ve gotten very inconsistent trimming length all over my face. I always end up with patches of disproportionately long hairs even after multiple passes. Lastly, albeit the least of problems, the MB4040 is sold within the most annoying product packaging I&#x27;ve ever experienced. You have to literally rip and destroy the box it came in to get it and its accessories out, making a return impossible if you change your mind (as I have). So, in the end I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and am going back to buy a new MB-200 instead, as I should have in the first place.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with the vacuum feature of my previous trimmer and wanted to try something different, so I gave in to the 4.5 stars for this product, my first Remington product ever. Almost from the beginning it has pulled hair when trimming my beard and no matter what I have tried I can&#x27;t get through a trim without several hairs getting yanked. I am going back to Norelco!</li>
            <li> Nice looking. Fits my hand nicely. Easy attachment removal. The adjustable trimmer head is great for me. Hols a decent charge.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard trimmer. I liked it very much. It trims the beard perfectly. Battery lasts longer time. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I just grew my facial hair back after years of being clean shaven. I figured I would shave it off because of the hassles of keeping it neat. I got this trimmer and love how easy and effective it is. The compliments I&#x27;ve received convinced me this trimmer is the reason I keep the beard.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome razor, it is well made and it just feels sturdy compared to some of the other razors I looked at.  My husband appreciates the adjustable guard.  He doesn&#x27;t have to switch them out or try to keep up with a bunch of pieces.  Once fully charged, he said he can use it for more than week without recharging.  With the overall quality and the price, this razor is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a dying Wahl beard/mustache trimmer.  Very happy with this one especialy since the Wahl would no longer hold a charge for more than a day at most.  I normally use it without the comb on the end and it is very sharp and does a wonderful job.  Glad that it also has a lithium battery, that was one of my main reasons for buying it.  I have found the lithium battery technology in my power drills to be long lived and quite impressive.  This was a very good buy at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> It does the trick and saves time. Huge improvement over what I had. Still in initial usage, but seems to be good on battery life</li>
            <li> This adjustable clipper is working well, it charges fine and cuts well (i dont have a thick beard, so it cuts fast and clean). When its done i&#x27;m happy with the results and I&#x27;ve yet to recharge it since i recieved it a month ago. I clean it using the brush supplied and store it in a ziplock (since I have it in a bathroom and prefer it not rust, a little rice pouch seems to keep it in a dry micro-environnment). the adjusting of the clipper is fine, but when i press it to my face it bends, so you can get uneven cuts. It may be that i&#x27;m pressing down too hard but if i dont then i dont get good contact... doesn&#x27;t bother me as i&#x27;d rather keep it on the shorter side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;Fast charging, and long life of charge&lt;br /&gt;Great cuts, when set at shorter lengths&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;The clipper tends to bend at longer lengths. i.e. if you want a longer beard this isnt for you.</li>
            <li> For all of you hairy-faced and often misunderstood bearded fellows, behold the power of the MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer! (With that long name, it has to be perfect right?). This is the facial hair trimmer -and possibly other, non-facial hair trimmer, that would be entirely up to you- you have been looking for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MB4040 is easy to hold in your hand, not too heavy, not too light, ergonomically designed to make your life easier while holding it to go over your face with ease while you make yourself handsome. The 9 different easy to select positions I guess will fit almost anyone needs, from the ZZ Tops out-there to the Indiana Jones. In my case I use it for a 4 setting beard, which I maintain every 3-4 days, and the job is very easy to complete with this machine. The slim body also allows it to go into hard to reach places, and the interchangeable heads for stub, beard and goatee gives you a wide array of possibilities and combinations for different looks. It also charges very fast and the battery last for hours and hours and it is as powerful as Remington claims and trimming is very precise indeed. Seeing its flexibility and wide array of options, I fail to see someone not happy with this trimmer, although there will always be the one that complains that it is missing the moisturizer spreader or that beard-length-self-maintainer button that will be oh! so useful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you are a regular guy, not insanely picky and on a budget, proud of his beard and ready to fight the naysayers anti-facial hair punks on the streets every day, this is the trimmer for you. Ah, and I haven&#x27;t tried to maintain \\&quot;The Mighty El Insecto\\&quot; look with this thing. Maybe that&#x27;s its flaw?</li>
            <li> My husband used this to trim his beard about 2-3 times per month for almost a year. It held a charge well, and worked well. But suddenly it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore and couldn&#x27;t even be used plugged in. He threw it away.</li>
            <li> Battery Stopped Working after 3 months.  A year old and it only goes 30 seconds on a full charge.  Takes an hour to do a simple shave.</li>
            <li> I have probably owned eight or ten beard trimmers over the past thirty years but this one is heads above all of the others and considering its modest $30.00 price represents a real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had the opportunity to use it a few times but so far I am very impressed. It will most likely prove to be a five star trimmer but it’s just too early to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade is sharper than I expected, it cuts extremely smoothly, and the motor is very quiet. The comb easily adjusts using the thumb wheel and it locks securely in the selected setting. The Lithium battery charges quickly and should provide a good ling run time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to note is that when changing the blade it is very difficult to line it up into the correct position and the nylon snaps seem a little flimsy for frequent use. I will only be using the one blade so it is not really an issue for me but if you change blades often it may be something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I thought that the Lithium battery would hold up under long term storage I would purchase another one as a backup trimmer for use when this one no longer operates properly.</li>
            <li> Works well, just takes a bit of getting used to the weird blade angle.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time and it may work well to trim beards.  It is unsatisfactory for trimming a mustache.  The blades do not make a clean sharp line and they do not cut close to the skin where I want to clean up the edges.  Others mention blades cutting their faces.  Mine is not sharp enough.  Maybe Remington responded to those remarks and stopped sharpening the blades as much.  In any case I have used this over a month and will attempt to return it to Remington as I believe I have used it too long to return to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I definitely love this trimmer !!!!  It&#x27;s slim design is easy to handle and control. It has plenty of power and the adjustable comb gives you the precise  length you prefer. I like the trimmer attachment with the smaller teeth that are closer together, it gives you nice straight edges when outlining, of course you must  take the comb off.  Iv&#x27;e had it for almost two months now and would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This item is extremely sharp and easy to use.  I also like the fact that it does require being plugged in constantly.</li>
            <li> As far as battery life goes, I&#x27;ve never had a shaver quite like this. I charged it the day I got it, and using it once or twice a week in the three months since I haven&#x27;t had to re-charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this trimmer without the plastic comb attachment is great. All three blades work wonders on my facial hair, whether it&#x27;s a beard that&#x27;s been growing in for three months or a few days&#x27; worth of stubble. The goatee trimmer is perfect for edges, and the stubble trimmer is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing holding this trimmer back from a fifth star is the plastic comb attachment. It&#x27;s a great idea in theory: rather than having a ten detachable plastic combs (one for each length), the one attachment slides over the blades, and a dial on the trimmer moves it up or down to adjust length. Labelling the dial \\&quot;1\\&quot; through \\&quot;9\\&quot; instead of the actual lengths (e.g. \\&quot;1/8\\&quot; or \\&quot;1/4\\&quot;) is a bit confusing, but the big issue for me is that using the comb 1-3 times results in an uneven trim. I don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; problem some other people seem to be having; I just have to go over the same area 10 times to be reasonably sure it&#x27;s even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if beard management is your thing, keep that in mind. But for maintaining stubble or edging your facial hair, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great and does just what I needed in a trimmer.  It is very easy to maneuver and trims evenly.</li>
            <li> I read almost all of the reviews for almost all of the trimmers out there. I was replacing my Phillips Norelco T980 due to durability issues, so I was looking for a tough trimmer that was easy to use and handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month, I can say that this trimmer is awesome. I like the easy trim-height adjustment with a very solid feedback and nice, solid on/off switch that is not easy to accidently turn off. I like the shape and grip. I love that from my fine head on top, to my coarse hair on my chin, I have never pulled a hair. My only feature wish would be that it had a vacuum function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must also agree with several of the reviewers that the plastic used for the guide is way too fragile. I am handling it very gently. One word of advice for those having a problem putting the guide back on: notice that there is a bit of an angled \\&quot;target\\&quot; space. Angle it on as you gently push,, and it&#x27;s perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s hoping that this is my last trimmer for a long time!</li>
            <li> This trimmer far exceeds my expectations by light years. I LOVE IT!  I cannot begin to explain how this is so superior to anything I&#x27;ve come across. I have used 2 trimmers over the past 30 years or so.  One used AA batteries and lasted until the last month or so.  30 years is a long time for a trimmer and it worked great.  Then I bought a  bargain rechargeable and just threw it away because on a full charge you could not finish a trim before the batteries run down.  But theRemington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer. IS AMAZING and the ultra long lasting lithium batteries and self sharpening blades make this the best pick out there!  Correction, the ONLY PICK out there. Thanks Remington for making my day.  I predict this trimmer will far outlast my original too. But I may have to pass it down to the next generation and to my children&#x27;s&#x27; children before this one wears out.</li>
            <li> The charger lasts, lasts and lasts. I use it trim my goatee every week and the original charge has lasted months.</li>
            <li> One of the trimmer parts broke within the first few weeks of buying this product, I think from it being dropped on the floor. It would be better if the attachment pieces that make the trimmer vibrate were made of metal instead of plastic. But otherwise it works great.</li>
            <li> Im not expert on beard trimmers but this is a great product for the price! I couldnt be happier with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Very functional trimmer.  Maintains charge for long periods of time.  I would have liked one lower setting, but it works well enough as is.</li>
            <li> after searching everywhere ..and reading all the reviews .. I decided on this one..and am so very glad I did..It delivers as promised. does what it&#x27;s supposed to do ...with ease.</li>
            <li> I will change the rating if I get any response from customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this new in september of 2014.  it&#x27;s january of 2015  and this guy refuses to work.  it won&#x27;t even attempt turn on.  I charged in for 4 days solid and nothing.  changed the charger 3 different times to see if it was the charger.  still nothing.  the light comes on like it&#x27;s charging then goes off after a couple hours.  but it&#x27;s dead as a doughnut.  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually try to stick with brands with which I have had good success (Panasonic, Braun). Remington is at the bottom of my list of quality products. But, I tried this trimmer from Remington and true to form the beard blade assembly broke the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> the battery so far is excellent, which is why i bought this trimmer. however, i have stubble instead of a beard, and on the shortest setting, this trimmer misses a lot of hairs, leaving my stubble very uneven. it&#x27;s a pretty poor trim. another trimmer i bought for half the price did better.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer, very pleased with everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took me a few seconds to figure how to get the adjustable head to attach correctly, it will go on you just have to angle it on.</li>
            <li> Was great for the first few months and now the battery does not charge</li>
            <li> Had this for a couple of months now and it really does work well. Holds charge for a week or more. removing the plastic front it is so neat and effective for trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li> Nice razor.  Two blades.  Really holds a charge (much better than my older one).  Only suggestion would be a battery lite when it&#x27;s getting old....</li>
            <li> I must say, this trimmer works very well, over the years I had purchased a number of trimmers and by far this one is the best yet. I am not trying to write a book, just my personal review. I do hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has worked exactly as I expected it to. No problems with it at all. Recharging is a snap and it lasts far longer than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, &amp; works as expected.</li>
            <li> It is an affordable trimmer that is great for trimming your beard, &#x27;stache, or any manscaping needs that you may have!!!!</li>
            <li> No nose hair attachment, but doors have the interchangeable blade sizes. They swap out do easily with a button on the front just below the blade. Blade guard adjustment is done with a wheel on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery came charged. Adverb fully charged, battery hold enough charge for me to trim my beard once every few weeks without needing a recharge for months. Your mileage may vary, but I never need to think about charging.</li>
            <li> The quick change trimmer heads is a huge selling point. Cleaning is so easy. My only complaint is that the trimmer heads can and do occasionally pull on hairs. Minor issue on an otherwise exceptional product.</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful and trims without pulling or snagging on your beard.  The height guard delivers a consistent length, even around jawbone and chin.  You can leave it plugged in without overcharging, so it is always ready.  It is also supposed to run for over two (2) hours without recharging.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what I need it to do: trim my beard many times without running out of battery.  Very satisfied; especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This thing is definitely on the best trimmers I have had.&lt;br /&gt;I had brought this with me to snowmobile for a week,&lt;br /&gt;It worked the whole time no recharge.  Great design,&lt;br /&gt;doesnt have the blade adjustment that you have to&lt;br /&gt;store.  It has an all in one design.  You wont regret it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this trimmer.  It&#x27;s easily adjustable, easy to clean, and the battery life is really great.  I took it with me travelling for 6 days and didn&#x27;t need to bring the charger.  I was able to use it still 2 days after I returned without needing to charge.</li>
            <li> Finally a trimmer that does it all. I have a goatee and this works great. With the different shaving heads that comes with this trimmer it is a home run. I also use it to trim ear hairs and a slight touch up on my hair in between haircuts. With the long time run of 120 minutes it is just what I needed in a trimmer. Others I have used in the past would not hold a charge for more than 20 minutes. With the ease of removing the trimmer heads for cleaning makes this a great deal. I have read many of the reviews and the one point that stood out was the distribution of the weight more towards the trimmer head makes this trimmer comfortable to hold and control during trimming. With the Lithium Ion battery that does not maintain a memory, it will last for many years. I like the self-sharpening heads and self lubricating. Recommend to any guy who wants a great trim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that you do have to go over a few spots when trimming but it never bothered me. Only thing is this thing is sharp which shouldn&#x27;t be a shocker but it got me a few times. But does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> I love this.. just spin a wheel and get the depth of cut that I want.. I don&#x27;t have to find 10 different clips. It also has multiple blades for different needs. When I get lazy and don&#x27;t shave my head for a few days I remove the comb attachment and buzz it back down to make shaving easier. Well work the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought the MB-4040 to replace my old MB-200.  I clip my scalp and trim my beard every other day.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about three and a half months now, and it&#x27;s been great.  I think I&#x27;ve recharged it one time in that 3.5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Great battery life.&lt;br /&gt;* The power switch is lower-profile than on the MB-200, so it&#x27;s less likely to turn itself on and drain the battery if you pack it in your luggage.&lt;br /&gt;* The adjustment seems to stay put a little bit better than on the MB-200, not that I ever had a problem with the MB-200 slipping.&lt;br /&gt;* The clear plastic used in the adjustable spacer looks like it may be more resilient than the that of the MB-200 (a tooth snapped off the MB-200 spacer head when I dropped it in the bathroom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* The chromed plastic looks cheesy (entirely subjective).&lt;br /&gt;* The power button could be recessed to help even more in preventing it from turning on when packed into luggage.  Or perhaps a separate travel lock of some sort.  It really sucks when you arrive at your destination and realize your trimmer&#x27;s dead, especially if you were trying to save weight by leaving the power adapter at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews that mentioned snagging and pulling hair.  I&#x27;ve never experienced any hair pulling with the MB-4040 or the MB-200.  This clips at least as fast an smoothly as the MB-200.  Perhaps if you&#x27;re trimming a very long, curly beard, and you get a hair wrapped around the spacer teeth?  I don&#x27;t see how any similar product could avoid that possibility.</li>
            <li> I really lïke the device. Only issue is power adapter. It is labeled as 110volts. Now I&#x60;m traveling in Europe and really confused about it. Should i use it in 220 volts outlet or no. Please response</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this line of Remington MB trimmers (I like the scroll to change clipping length - prevents accidental switching and a very strange shave stroke on your head/face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for cutting my hair (short guy hair with not much to worry about).  They last a few years usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one (for some reason) is all &#x27;decked out in shiny chrome and plastic&#x27; which actually makes the whole thing look much cheaper and shabby than the long design history of the MB trimmers (silver to black).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But works great, and come with 3 blades (never had that before) and the guide goes on and off for cleaning very easily.</li>
            <li> I really like that this is the lithium ion powered trimmer, as the batteries seem to hold a charge much longer than the older nimh or nicad rechargeables.  This does a great job of trimming mustaches and beards, and the only thing I found lacking was a charging base - for some bizarre reason, it has no stand that you can put it in to charge it - it just lays on the counter.</li>
            <li> Read many reviews and considered a number of products.  This has been an excellent replacement for an old trimmer that ran out of being able to hold a charge.  More attachments than I can use.  My main use is for trimming a goatee beard.  Holds a charge for a very long time.  Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with a case or soft bag.  I had a soft bag saved from an old shaver and an able to put all the parts in that, including cleaning brush and comb i use with it.</li>
            <li> Great battery life and sleek design. Easy to clean and maintain. Lacking in trimming to a stubble and detailing. Can&#x27;t comment on the trimming of longer/fuller beards bc I keep mine short to a stubble.</li>
            <li> The first of these I received stopped working (charging) shortly after I received it.  To their credit the manufacturer replaced it promptly and the replacement is working well.  It gives appropriately short cuts, seems to hold a charge well and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I am so far very happy with this trimmer!  I had an older (and much cheaper) Remington, and it was not good at all, and a cheap plastic piece finally broke and I upgraded to this one with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life - I&#x27;ve been using it 2x per week for my goutee and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since January&lt;br /&gt;Nice trimmer lengths&lt;br /&gt;Good accessories - for beard, stubble, and goutee&lt;br /&gt;Good quality unit - meaning good weight, thicker plastic, blades titanium or something, feels much stronger.</li>
            <li> I use this on my beard and its work great. The charge holds for a long time so I don&#x27;t have to keep it on the charger.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer does its job. It trims very close.&lt;br /&gt;Good for maintaining a short beard, goatee, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;The product is listed as having a &amp;#34;washable design&amp;#34;; however, the packaging clearly indicates that the mechanism itself should not come in contact with water. Only the blade/trimmer and plastic piece may actually be washed.</li>
            <li> The different heads made this perfect no matter if you&#x27;re rocking a beard, stache, goatee, or whatever else. The different styles allow me to shave down stubble, trim my goatee and mustache, and it all looks perfect when I&#x27;m done. It allows for an incredible amount of detail, straight lines, and clean professional look. Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s also very safe, never nicks my skin or cuts me.</li>
            <li> Unit doesn&#x27;t work 40 days after purchase.  Not worth the extra $ paid for the shaver. Consider buying another product.</li>
            <li> This is useless as a goatee trimmer.  The guard is terrible!!  The guard moves down when there is any pressure on it making impossible to have an even trim and it doesn&#x27;t a horrible job of directing the hair to the trimmer.  I would return it but threw away the packaging before testing it because I used to have the MB 40 and it was perfect so i assumed this would be just as good with a better battery.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong!</li>
            <li> Wow!  The one thing I regret is not having upgraded my trimmer to this one sooner.  The battery is always there for you when you need it.  I trim about 3 times a week and after using it for over a month have yet to charge it.  Furthermore, the trimmer itself is comfortable on your skin and trims nice and evenly.</li>
            <li> It was awesome to begin with. The 1st few months it worked like a champ. Then attachments began breaking. I wasnt too concerned as i didnt use them much anyway. About 1 year in, it stopped taking a charge. Game over. This will be my last Remington.</li>
            <li> For around $20 bucks you cannot beat this little trimmer! It works great and the heads are really quick and easy to replace and the charge lasts awhile. I&#x27;m in the Arrmy and had my buddy give me a fade the other day and it work great. I like how you can change the length setting on the guard with just a push of a button. Great product! I read some of the other negative reviews and I didn&#x27;t have any of the issues the other buyers were talking about.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son-in-law to replace his old one. Specifically bought for ease of handling as he was stricken with MS almost 2 years ago and has some difficulty with his hands at times of MS flareup. He is thrilled with it and wants everyone to know what a wonderful product this is.</li>
            <li> Purchased 01/21 &amp; it&#x27;s 04/15 &amp; I STILL have not charged it (outside of the initial charge). Sucker sounds just as strong as the day I purchased though I only trim once or twice a week. Great product, sharp blades, easy to clean. Best trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased to date...</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver. I keep it set at 4 to keep the beard looking good and use it once or twice a week. As others have mentioned, sometimes I have to go over the same area a few times. But, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 weeks now and it is still running strong from the initial charge. I feel like it was a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a stubble trimmer and it was terrible. You have to shave without the guard to get that stubble look and it&#x27;s really easy to cut yourself. I stopped using it for that and instead got the ConAir iStubble, which is awesome. But the iStubble isn&#x27;t good for hard to reach places like under the nose and it sucks at doing the neck line. So now I use this in combination with the iStubble. This is perfect for reaching tight places and cleaning up the neck line. I use the iStubble for that five o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> Are you looking for pain?  For facial torture?  For hairs being ripped out of your tender skin leaving bloody trails?  Well then, you&#x27;ve bought the right clipper set.  This torture device is PERFECT for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the absolute worst facial grooming tool I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve owned two other Remington products with great success.  When the last died, I bought this because of the reviews and it supposedly would work while charging (versus needing a full charge to work like my last one).  Does it work while charging, yes, and that&#x27;s awesome.  But the blade grabs the hairs on your face and rips them out with such violence, I&#x27;m just not sure I can take it anymore.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like it a little rough, but this is insane.  I&#x27;m used to a nick or two when shaving with a blade, but the pain this groomer causes and the multiple blood letting blobs you&#x27;ll have after using it, well, it&#x27;s just not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the different heads, no difference.  The length of the guard doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference either.  I don&#x27;t know, maybe I got a bad clipper, but it&#x27;s going to the trash pile, because I can&#x27;t take the pain anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to the Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer.  It&#x27;s about 1/2 the price and does the job 100% better.  I&#x27;ll deal with the fact that you can&#x27;t use it until it&#x27;s fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  April 2015.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s past the return date, so I&#x27;m out about $40 bucks and Amazon won&#x27;t do a return.  But this thing (yes, I&#x27;m still using it because I haven&#x27;t ordered another one yet) continues to perform poorly.  It&#x27;s now gurgling between sounding like an airplane taking off and a low hum.  The sound is atrocious.  As well, when you get above a &#x27;3&#x27; on the guard, it seems to stop working/clipping.  I&#x27;ve got plenty of hairs to clip, it just won&#x27;t do it.  But it&#x27;ll still yank em out easy enough.  I cannot say enough terrible things about this clipper.  I&#x27;d like to send it back to all the beards at Remington corporate and see what happens when they run it across their faces.o all the beards at Remington corporate and see what happens when they run it across their faces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for about 4 months now.  I don&#x27;t trim as often as I should, so lets call it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole this is a decent trimmer, that gets the job done.  There are a couple of things I, personally, don&#x27;t care for about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Not really sure that I&#x27;ve noticed a difference between the \\&quot;beard\\&quot; blade and the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; blade&lt;br /&gt;2)  I like to keep my beard/goatee really short, almost to stubble length.  The shortest length on this is still a little long for my tastes.  Wish there was one more shorter&lt;br /&gt;3)  I *hate* that the charging port is on the bottom.  This means that I can&#x27;t just stand the trimmer up while in a corner when not in use.  My old Norelco trimmer had a flat bottom and a side charging port which I had gotten used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally leave it plugged in all the time so I can&#x27;t comment on the battery life, but this exacerbates point # 3 above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side it works.  I&#x27;d have to agree with some other reviewers that it sometimes takes several passes to get all the hair trimmed, but I have an exceptionally thick goatee and that has been the case for every trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it the Cadillac  of trimmers, but it&#x27;s certainly no Yugo either.  Call it a dependable Kia.  It&#x27;ll get the job done, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few days, and it is working great. Lots of power, and the blades are nice and sharp. It is what it is, a good trimmer at a good price.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved this. He is always grooming his face and this was just the greatest thing for him to get as a gift. He is such a hard person to buy for. He really likes the way it trims.The lithium battery keeps a charge for such a long time, not messing with a corded trimmer is the way to go for anyone.</li>
            <li> Was a gift and the reciever was very happy with it...............I have no more words for it .too much trouble</li>
            <li> I love it!  I don&#x27;t have to go to the barber shop any more.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and excellent battery life. I&#x27;ve only charged it once and owned it almost a year.</li>
            <li> Only reason it&#x27;s 3 stars is because the shave is uneven, (flat cheek+ neck-hair cuts further from the skin than the curve on the jaw line) must go over the surface MANY times, especially at different angels to get an even look</li>
            <li> Very good results after some practice with a trusted brand name product. Excellent price/value.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that delivers a close shave and clean lines.</li>
            <li> The battery life is definitely longer than its predecessor, but WHY ON EARTH did they change the blade guard from their previous model? It&#x27;s cheap plastic and constantly pulls on my hairs, giving me an annoyingly painful experience. In addition, I agree with the others who are saying that some hairs are left untrimmed, forcing you to go over your beard three or four times before it gets them all. Overall an annoying product. I give it two stars because they finally got the battery life correct. Otherwise skip this one and go for a different trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Good number of attachments for my needs. Keeps me lookin classy for the ladies. I&#x27;ve had no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I will research a product online &amp; in stores ceaselessly ! I read all the reviews good &amp; bad.  I used to own the previous Remington Trimmer, which I thought was SO good I couldn&#x27;t find anything to replace it. But Battery life was the only issue with it.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t use it unplugged,  but loved the dial-a- length and Ergonomic feel.&lt;br /&gt;Sent back a Norelco ! Except for the Battery,  the Designer should get a Medal ! Then I found the MB4040. It did not trap hairs like someone said.&lt;br /&gt;I love the new powerfull Motor.  I can now shave unplugged and I have the BEST shaver out there which always makes me feel 1- Up !</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. My son loves this.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. the battery holds a charge for multiple days. the changeable tops come in very handy</li>
            <li> I like the week old stubble look and while this gets reasonably close, it&#x27;s not close close.  The plastic guide and dial settings limit the closeness.  That said, it&#x27;s a much better system than having a dozen different attachments, just roll the wheel and it adjusts quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself feels as if it&#x27;s built well, has a quality feel for plastic and the blades snap in nicely and feel secure.  It has good power and charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only using the stubble blade, based on others reviews (thanks) and it shaves great with no cuts even without the guard.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of a fantastic experiences with my ancient Remington beard trimmer. After a week of use, the stubble blade on this unit is falling apart and slicing my face up. My old unit is over a decade old and I have never been sliced by it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so much disappointed in this product. I used to own a Phillips Norelco which I just loved. This Remington trimmer is just not what I want. It makes my beard look so ugly as many hair stick out after a trim. with the Norelco every trim was so fine and polished. I cant buy that again as Philips discontinued that trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I have ended up with a comb and shears :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care about battery life so much as its not a very important feat in a trimmer which you will mostly use in you bathroom where you have the ability to keep it charged most of the time.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Remington MB4040 and was very excited to give it a try. Sadly, I was disappointed when I tried it and found that it cut a bit too close, nicking my upper neck several times and drawing blood when used without a blade guard. Note: this happened with the stubble blade and the regular blade.  One thing I did like about the MB4040 was the mustache/goatee blade, which worked great for trimming my mustache.  Also, I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it can&#x27;t be powered by the charger, so if your battery runs out, you have to wait for it to get some juice before you can finish your trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After returning the MB4040, I purchased the [[ASIN:B00ARF428O Philips Norelco QG3360/42 Multigroom Plus]], as my old trimmer was a Philips and had performed very well for the past 5 years. I was much more pleased with the Philips Norelco than the Remington. At first, I trimmed my whole face and neck down with the regular blade, which did a pretty good job of getting the hairs down pretty short. No nicks or cuts this time, so I was well pleased. A few days later, it was time for some more stubble trimming, and I decided to try the \\&quot;detail trimmer.\\&quot; I found the detail trimmer got the stubble down to just where I like it without any nicks or hair pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the Philips won out, but for others the Remington might work better.  You just have to give each one a try to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the way this clipper holds a charge and never seems to lose power.  It has a consistent cut and doesn&#x27;t tug any hairs.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver love it</li>
            <li> except that it didn&#x27;t contain the convenient plastic tray for all the attachables</li>
            <li> Works great, Battery life is unbelievable</li>
            <li> I trim my beard twice a month. The product seemed well built, had very sharp blades, was quiet and had plenty of battery to complete a trim.  Then within about 2 months I noticed battery life was slipping.  I do not leave it plugged in between uses so I knew I was not overcharging.  In about 4 months the trimmer would not run long enough to finish trimming my beard.  Let&#x27;s do the math, 4 months, trim 2x per month, that&#x27;s 8 uses of the trimmer and it&#x27;s already failing.  I&#x27;m writing this review a year after purchase. I charged it and I tried it again today and it runs for about 20 seconds and dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Remington, you build a very nice trimmer and put a crappy battery in it.  What does that leave you, a crappy product!!!  Consumers if you buy this product you will love it the first couple of months, after that maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2 years later (Jan 2017)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two years now since Remington replaced my trimmer under warranty and I have to say it&#x27;s working remarkably well.  Battery life is no longer an issue and it is still working like it is brand new.  The blades are sharp and it trims my beard without tugging, pinching, or hurting in any way.  Since Remington resolved the battery issue it&#x27;s the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Thanks for the good service.  I&#x27;m updating my rating from 1 star to 4 stars, it would have garnered 5 stars had I not had the battery issue on the first unit I received.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites. The adjustable length helps me with all of my needs and it is not painful on the skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> works like a charm, recommend this to anyone looking for a trimmer. get one you will be happy you did.</li>
            <li> Adjustable, Re-chargeable and lasts a long time on a charge.  Trimmer does everything you need it to. Can trim and shape easily</li>
            <li> Looks better on pic than real life - lots of plastic. Had to read reviews to figure out to place cover on top to get the trim installation to work. For the price it&#x27;s ok, but nothing more.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet... it&#x27;s been months since I got it.  Cuts well, heads are easy to change.  Only complaint is no stand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first beard and I didn&#x27;t want it to grow out of control. So I started looking on Amazon, of course, and found this trimmer! I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect, but it gets the job done. It doesn&#x27;t tug or pull, nothing bad happened, yet..(knock on wood!). I do have to go over it a few times to really get it all trimmed down correctly, maybe that&#x27;s just me though. For the price, I really like it. I would recommend it to a beginner who doesn&#x27;t want anything too fancy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my dad after his old one finally gave out after 10 years (different brand). So far so good, dad is happy with this new trimmer.</li>
            <li> It works just fine. Keeps my beard trimmed perfectly. And stays charged alot loonger than my old one. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This will not disappoint. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good beard trimmer for years. Buy it! You will be pleased!</li>
            <li> Cuts even and easy to adjust the settings, but I have only had it for a week now.  I would reccommend for a cheap trimmer performs well.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy review: Great trimmer, Very good attachments.&lt;br /&gt;3 different blades plus a large guard.&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life and it will work while plugged in.</li>
            <li> Got for my dad- 92 years. Easy for me to use on him and does very nice shave!</li>
            <li> Please read the content and understand that it is aimed at the manufacturer rather than the specific device before you flame this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me first thank Amazon for their generous return policy. They&#x27;re great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how well this product works. I never will. If I had seen a picture of the packaging, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it, because it comes in a ridiculously complicated clamshell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why am I taking this much time to write a negative review? That&#x27;s the fault of the manufacturer for creating shelf-friendly but user-unfriendly packaging. I never saw it on the shelf, obviously, but I&#x27;m sure the package looked great, with the razor and attachments gleaming through plastic clamshell for passers-by to inspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I open dozens of packages like this every year. I don&#x27;t have ham fists or mental impairments that keep me from opening them properly. [Insert flame comment here] I go at things carefully, slitting the tape on the sides and top with a pocketknife and then pulling the inside packaging out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s describe this particular one. There are two items loosely fit in plastic at the top of the large clamshell. When removing the clamshell from the packaging, these two things fell out onto the table. (The shaver unit itself, and then the plastic cover with the beard comb attached to it.) Turning the package over reveals the power cords and instruction manual underneath. I then ask myself where the other grooming attachments are. Oh - they&#x27;re still stuck into the top of the package. They&#x27;re underneath another layer of plastic that is stapled to the inner cardboard shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stapled. Interesting. Well, I guess we just pop the staples out since the manufacturer didn&#x27;t include a staple remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my pocketknife to pry off the staple on the side where the attachments are. The two shaving attachments -- which were more or less stuck to the plastic clamshell that I was trying to pry open -- then fly out of the packaging and onto the floor. Each attachment consists of two blades, one on the front and another on the back that is held in place with a spring and a plastic assembly. Falling to the floor immediately causes them to spring apart, effectively breaking the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could I try to put these pieces back together? Probably. Should I have to? No. It&#x27;s the manufacturers fault for creating idiotic packaging that would cause significant damage to necessary parts just by opening the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s wrong with a simple box that has a picture of the item on the cover? I can even deal with clamshell plastic provided it can easily be separated to get at the parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington - you and others who do this kind of thing need to understand this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been most pleased with the Remington MB4040.  It&#x27;s not in the least bit anemic, and each blade fullfills its purpose well.  It has done a good job of holding its charge.  I know in other reviews there were concerns about the total life of the battery.  I&#x27;ve only had the trimmer for a few weeks, so can&#x27;t speak to that issue.  Overall, it&#x27;s been a really good investment.</li>
            <li> The battery was already charged when delivered and like other people have said, it lasted for a long time. This is my first cordless trimmer and it makes a huge difference not having to deal with the chord, a lot better this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length settings are really good, although when you choose the smaller ones it can be hard to follow the shape of your head and get an even trim. Without the length attachment it works even better, although I do recommend changing the small hair head to the big one, since I felt I was trimming my skin (the blades get REALLY close to your skin with this head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to change the head gives it a big advantage to clean it properly and making it last longer. It&#x27;s really easy to clean and like it says, it has self-oiling blades (not sure how that works but its awesome).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, easy to carry. Would be even better if it had some case or pouch to carry all the accessories but it&#x27;s still a great trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I&#x27;m not sure about is if you can know when the battery is completely recharged, although I didn&#x27;t really read the manual so this could be a personal problem.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this! Yeah</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have ever owned, totally more than worth the price!</li>
            <li> Item just as described, shipping on time, and satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about two months now. It&#x27;s very good, but I have found that regardless of the way I shave, the trimmer always cuts the hair on my chin and face shorter than the hair on the sides of my faces. I think it&#x27;s something with the blade guard and how its positioned in relation to the hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, this is a very good trimmer and I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love it! works great and holds a charge very long. Got as described in good condition. I use it for beard trimming and for trimming prior to shaving. Works great! Had it over a year now and love it!</li>
            <li> Works as promised. Hold a long charge. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer..........</li>
            <li> Ie only used it once and I love it!  The curved design really helps for trimming, you can see what your cutting better in the mirror especially, as opposed to the straight design clippers. Seems to be sturdy construction.  Cool attachments. Mine came charged and ready out of the box.  Speaking of box, it seems they could greatly improve the packaging!  I mean who uses staples?  You basically have to destroy the packaging to extract the item.  So keep that in mind if you&#x27;re riding the fence on a decision...  You would have to make sure you could return it with the packaging in pieces!</li>
            <li> works very well, very satisfied</li>
            <li> After owning this trimmer for about a year and a half, I have come to appreciate its uniquely vicious personality. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a case of Stockholm syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the remarkable ability to rip nearly as many hairs from my previously tender flesh as it successfully cuts. The last year and a half has been amazing for my face: that fine, feminine, sensitive skin has been replaced with a manly leather capable of tolerating the violent removal of hair over and over and over again with barely a wince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m grateful for the thin, patchy look it has added to my beard, which women find so attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the long-lasting battery and my being too cheap to replace it, I will get to enjoy its hair-rending talents for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, ow.</li>
            <li> I phreakin LOVE this trimmer. It is perfect for what I need. I&#x27;ve been wanting a trimmer like this for awhile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Amazing trimming ability&lt;br /&gt;*PHENOMENAL Battery life. I&#x27;ve charged this once when I first got it and have used it literally for about 2 months on the same charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an EXCELLENT beard, goatee, stubble trimmer, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two blades, one more wide for trimming stubble which is what I use it for and one smaller for intricate beard trimming.</li>
            <li> I had one of this for 3 months and then my brother took it from me because he loved it. Now i bought another one and its working totally fine. i love the adjustable option in it. the 9 length of the trimmer is even more good about it. i don&#x27;t have anything to say about it but i just love it and the battery lasts for more than a month once you charge it.</li>
            <li> Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington MB4040 looks, feels, and operates like any other cordless trimmer. The main difference is that the MB4040 has a Li-Ion battery pack and these tend to last a LOT longer than the cheaper and more common Nickel Cadmium batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The titanium coated blades offer long-lasting sharpness, but many of the other cordless trimmers like the ones from Philips, also feature titanium coated blades. The MB4040 does have interchangeable blades designed for a variety of tasks from trimming beards to maintaining goatees, and trimming hair. The blades are easy to change, but they come fairly well oiled which makes cleaning somewhat messy because the oil attracts the hair shavings and requires some scrubbing with soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is total rubbish. The blister pack is stapled to the cardboard, and it made it difficult to remove the trimmer. It does not include any type of storage for the extra blade heads, so I ended up throwing the other blades into a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included adjustable comb is very innovative and easy to use. A few clicks on the thumb wheel will raise or lower the comb. However, the design of the comb allows it to grab my short hair at times. It is too flexible and should have been made more rigid without the open edges that can grab at hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging LED will shut off to indicate a full charge, which is a nice feature. NiCd cordless trimmers and razors tend to keep charging, while the Li-Ion trimmers/razors usually provide a full charge indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars, there&#x27;s nothing truly revolutionary about the MB4040. It&#x27;s a convenient cordless trimmer with a Li-Ion battery pack that allows it to perform better for a longer period of time versus the cheaper NiCd trimmers. I don&#x27;t like how the comb can grab at my hair, and there&#x27;s no storage for the extra trimmer heads.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has lots of Power, and the charge lasts a LONG time.  It doesn&#x27;t pinch or slow down.  Great trimmer!</li>
            <li> Once again I read some of the reviews on this trimmer and went for it!&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say I believe it was a good choice.  I saw a similiar Remington at WalMart for almost the same price but the WalMart trimmer was lacking some of the heads plus I believe it didn&#x27;t have the L-Ion battery.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for handling this particular product.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is great to deal with, and my Prime membership has paid for itself.</li>
            <li> i have owed it for about six weeks and find it does the job very well. I bought it to trim my beard but my wife used it to give me a haircut. It does better for the beard but in a pinch can also do a complete haircut. I did not expect any plastic parts from the description but the one plastic piece has functioned well and I have no complaints</li>
            <li> This is a descent trimmer that does what it is supposed to. This is my first trimmer so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to see a battery life indicator or even a battery getting low light so you are not caught off guard when it dies.  You can usual tell from it slowing down but you always think you can get \\&quot;one more\\&quot; out of it but it usually dies mid-use.</li>
            <li> NIce shaver, I got in a timely fashion and it works great. I have nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I bought the razor to trim my beard and I found no difference in the level 1 length setting and the level 9 length setting.  It does not work the way it is advertised.</li>
            <li> Love the new Lithium battery, keeps the trimmer running at full speed continuously! I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet. The beard trimmer does pull every once in a while, makes your eyes water a bit. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more about learning how to use it vs my last version. The fact that it comes with three different attachments is new for me, haven&#x27;t really used the others so I can&#x27;t opine on any trimmer attachment other than the beard option. Otherwise, a great tool.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need anything fancy.  Just wanted a stubble trimmer that was simple and cheap.  This was the perfect product.  It works well and does a good even cut.  Haven&#x27;t used all of the attachments yet but they seem really solid. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is SHARP. Be careful when not using the guard and pressing too hard. Otherwise, no complaints!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d owned a Remington clipper before that had a special pop up for trimming moustaches, so when it died I searched for another Remington..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase a mistake !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the beard trimmer works, I often find my beard hair is pulled and pinched but what bothers me the most is trying to trim the moustache area without cutting myself. Yes this unit comes with swappable trimmer attachments but who the heck wants to get a screw driver out and swap just to do a moustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind your beard hair being pulled and cutting yourself while trimming your moustache.. buy it because it does hold a charge really well. But candidly the rest of it is marginal at best</li>
            <li> I have used the mb200 for years and years and really like it. I was hoping to get the improved version of the md200 with better battery. The battery may be better, but the cut is way worse. They are both stated to have the same length settings, but I have always used a setting of 1,2, or 3 to maintain my stubble on the mb 200. This is not possible on the mb4040. The settings are way off, none of these settings even touch my hair. they are way too long. In fact, going from setting 1 to 2 on the mb4040 there is absolutely zero change in the length, and then when you adjust to a 3 setting it makes a huge jump. I don&#x27;t know if I got a faulty product or if this is just the crappy standard. Will return. Going to try the panasonic wet/dry with 19 length settings.</li>
            <li> This is great and the charge lasts forever.  I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve had it for nearly 6 months now. It&#x27;s one of the better groomers I&#x27;ve had. The only other two I&#x27;ve owned were a Norelco and a Wahl. The MB4040 beats both of them. I particularly like that it only has one piece and a dial/wheel for length adjustment. I find that using just the &amp;#34;Beard&amp;#34; head works for me. I never use the other two heads/cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my other trimmers had multiple heads and plastic length attachments. They were a pain to carry everywhere. The Norelco seems to have had a more professional cutter, but this one does okay as well. This one has the Li-ion where the Norelco only had Ni-cads. The Wahl was alkaline. The batteries last a lot longer with this Remington. It holds charge longer and I can get several shaves per charge while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I maintain about a 1/2&amp;#34; beard length, give or take. Not a heavy beard either. This shaver works well at about the &amp;#34;7&amp;#34; setting for me - occasionally &amp;#34;6&amp;#34;. As long as I don&#x27;t go too fast it doesn&#x27;t pull. I do need to make a lot of passes, but when I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;ve always been satisfied with length and even-ness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Self-sharpening &amp; self-oiling are pluses as well. Only reason I didn&#x27;t go 5 stars is because I lack a lot of experience with other brands. There might be better out there I haven&#x27;t tried. For the money, I don&#x27;t think you can wrong by giving this one a shot.</li>
            <li> It was not what I wanted.  I have used it a few time and , it is ok.  I took a while to figure it out.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have always used Remington but I had to switch to Norelco because of battery issues with my previous Remington model. Honestly, I did not like Norelco a lot and I had to use it for some months. I even got some cuts in the lips when trimming under the nose.When I saw Remington back with Lithium Ion battery, that solved my problem again. The only issue. Level adapter does not get properly fixed to the number you select unless you select a higher one (3 in my case) and then go to the lower (2) From 1 to 2 it gets stuck. It is a minor issue, that is why I am not rating 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The battery and motor seem powerful, and the unit feels solid and substantial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of this unit is that it yanks hairs out of your face during each use. I am not a morning person, and this does not help!  Spend $10 more and get a competitor that has a better blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a different brand of clipper for several years (until the battery died off) and never once had a  hair yanked out.  Some mornings I hate this machine, but it does still cut most of the hair.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer worked perfectly the one time I used it. I don&#x27;t grow beards very often, but when I do, I need to keep them well groomed in order to be presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed the blade once to clean the interior out and since then, the blades do not cut anything anymore. I&#x27;ve followed videos online to make sure that I am putting the trimmer back together, but the device is fairly fool-proof. It doesn&#x27;t cut hair anymore, it just pulls it. I&#x27;ve taken off the guard in order to try cutting against my skin but nothing works. I&#x27;m terribly disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> This razor has plenty of torque and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; at my beard like some other under-powered units I had in the past. Li-Ion&lt;br /&gt;battery really lasts (I don&#x27;t bother to pack the charger whenever I go on trips). I only wish Remington would make plastic combs out of sturdier material instead of flimsy clear plastic.</li>
            <li> I returned this only because it doesnt offer the range of stubble that I was looking for. I could tell after a few uses that this motor was solid. It cut cleanly and efficiently, far better than any razor I have owned. Unfortunately it  doesnt offer enough range for trimming stubble. Even the longest setting seems to be closer than a 5 oclock shadow.</li>
            <li> This is actually a really good trimmer. The &#x27;action&#x27; or the way the blades move is smoother than others I&#x27;ve tried and I haven&#x27;t had any of the snagging problems that have happened with others.  The jog dial moves the blade part very, very slightly - I can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference but that doesn&#x27;t matter because I think it cuts just right for the day after shaving look.  The way the blades change out is super cool and super easy. I keep forgetting which is which, so it would be nice if they had some markings to tell the difference; you have to remember which shape does what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s the smoothness of the shaver that I really like and can recommend.  Also, it&#x27;s pretty light and doesn&#x27;t tire your hand if you&#x27;re shaving your neck or back.</li>
            <li> Have thoroughly enjoyed this trimmer.  My old one was very cheap, didn&#x27;t hold a charge for long and didn&#x27;t cut very well.  I have had this for about three months now and have not had to charge the unit beyond the initial charge.  It does take some getting used to the settings of the guard, as I normally trimmed on a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; with my previous trimmers but this one took it very short on a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34;.  I have only used this on a soul patch though so I am not sure how it would handle a full beard or head.  Without the guard, this works great at trimming hair very close to the skin.  This was exactly what i was looking for.  Overall, not many, if any, drawbacks that I have discovered.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy and every once in awhile need a razor that can trim arm/leg/chest hair. This razor trims well enough. The problem is that the hair gets caught up in the plastic guard AND underneath the trimmer blade itself very easily. Removing the plastic guard and putting it back on is not the easiest thing to do, and seems like it will break soon. The trimmer blade must be completely removed frequently to clean it out. I had another Remington trimmer where the trimmer blade would pop up easily, but stayed connected on the back side of it to the body of the trimmer, making it very quick and easy to clean. That was the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. This one is okay, but again too much effort to clean it out for what I use it for. May be fine for other users.</li>
            <li> very nice trimmer, im on 2 months on my first full charge. The adjustable guard works great as well as the changeable blades. the only complaint i have is when you try use guard level 1 and try to go down to a stubble it often grabbs and pulls and that sucks. I just wont push down so hard. Other than that i think is a excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Remington MB4040 Trimmer after my old trimmer (not Remington) finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. I narrowed my choices to the Wahl and this Remington, both for the same price. I wanted a lithium, hoping the battery would be an improvement over old trimmers. My old trimmer had a bunch of attachments, like the Wahl, so it would adapt to many uses. The Rimington has a zoom wheel which raises the plastic beard attachment up or down to 9 different settings. I liked the idea of this built-in system instead of the myrid of attachments I previously had for my trimmer. I have used it twice on my beard and had no problems. It cuts quickly without pulling. The adjustment wheel works as I expected and gives a very fine length adjustment for beard, sideburns and around ears. The goatee head allows fine trimming at the lip edges and also cuts quickly and efficiently. I haven&#x27;t had trouble changing heads, you just have to take the time to do it correctly, which is not hard. It is a little hard to clean all the hair out from under the head because it adheres to the lube oil. I use a can of compressed air but still have to take some time to get the hair out. Again, nothing major and nothing&#x27;s perfect. I noticed reviewers complained about the Wahl also. Probably, either trimmer works fine. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is really good! feels substantial in your hand, the three interchangeable blades are of a high quality and it cut through my year old beard with ease! I have read reviews that the head adjustment was flimsy and that there was not much difference from 0-9, not so, if used correctly it delivers exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is noisy, and the mustache blade does not project out far enough, making it difficult to see where one is trimming.  Otherwise the beard trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of mixed success with rechargeable trimmers. Many of them don&#x27;t last very long and some don&#x27;t even work without the charger plugged in. This trimmer lasts so long that I sometimes even forget that it needs to be charged at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works quite well. I&#x27;m not too terribly concerned with \\&quot;precision blades,\\&quot; but the trimmer comes with plenty of options if you&#x27;re looking for something more specific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few potential issues with this trimmer worth noting. The adjustment on the trimmer is not of the highest quality. If you plan to adjust precisions frequently, there&#x27;s a good chance that this might wear out after awhile. It&#x27;s not a particularly expensive trimmer so you get what you pay for to a certain extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Remington Trimmer. It&#x27;s a very good value and it does its job quite well. If you plan of trimming your beard every day, you might want to invest in something a little better, but it&#x27;s very good quality.</li>
            <li> i keep my van dyke trimmed short, and use my normal razor to shape it while i take care of the rest of my face--and so i use the trimmer the way it came out of the box:  with a blade that goes the full length of the machine, and with a built-in length guide.  the additional blades aren&#x27;t useful to me and have joined my cluttered drawer of attachments and cords i never use, but keep just in case...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;something to be aware of:  the built-in length guide doesn&#x27;t really go down to a true stubble.  it&#x27;s not a look that i rock myself, so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me.  if you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer that you can just buzz over your face without worrying if you&#x27;ll take off to much, i have my doubts if this critter will do it.  i freely admit, however, that i haven&#x27;t tried to figure out if there&#x27;s a way to do it or not--because i&#x27;m lazy that way ;-)</li>
            <li> I just ordered another one for traveling.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  Good product but wasn&#x27;t happy with the opened package when I received the shipment.</li>
            <li> AC adapter stopped working after ~2 months. The trimmer itself is fine, however, I can&#x27;t use it anymore. This is disappointing.</li>
            <li> i love this thing! its great for trimming hair everywhere. i like the different heads and the price was worth it. if you are looking for a trimmer get it. you will not be disappointed. and with prime i got it the next day after i ordered it</li>
            <li> Love this shaver! I bought it about 2-3 months ago and I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet! It is easily adjustable for facial hair trimming, plenty powerful and well built. I use it about 3-4 times a week to trim my beard and it keeps everything nice and even. It works well in the other &amp;#34;man shaving&amp;#34; areas as well. good price and value for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this a month ago, mostly because of the Lithium Ion battery,  I try to stay away from the NiCads.  They just don&#x27;t last.  The trimmer is great for trimming my short beard, on a 3 setting.  It has a very solid feel and cuts well. It is a replacement for a Wahl that had no adjustability, just a set of combs, the shortest of which left my beard longer than I wanted it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is *guaranteed* to nick you (painfully) in multiple places if you shave against the grain like many guys do.  Incidentally, this is the VERY reason why I use a trimmer instead of a shaver most of the time--because I don&#x27;t like getting nicked, cut, burned, etc.  In that regard, this trimmer fails miserably.  How in God&#x27;s name can they allow products like this to reach the consumer?  If Remington were a responsible bunch, they&#x27;d pull this product from the market immediately.  I&#x27;m tempted to report it to the CPSC, and I may very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the guard; the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; at the tip of of the guard are sharp enough that they actually dig INTO your hair follicle underneath an untrimmed hair, and when this happens, the oscillating blade inevitably meets your skin and blood starts pooling at the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a trimmer this way for many years, and never once have I nicked myself as frequently and predictably as I have while using this product.  This includes razors and shavers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington, your move...</li>
            <li> So far so good for tending to my goatee/moustach. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Being in the Army the past 7yrs, I&#x27;ve been through a lot of razor/beard trimmers.  This is by far the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard trimmer but it seems to do the job. The comb could be a bit finner as it doesn&#x27;t pick up the hairs that lie flat so it takes a few times over each area to get them all. Oh an beware, the charger is only made for the USA. However Amazon was amazing and fix ling this issue with me.</li>
            <li> Perfect beard or goatee trimmer! last forever on a single charge. Mulitple lengths work perfect! I love it!</li>
            <li> My hustband has had several trimmers over the years and has decided that this one is the one that this is the one that he like the best. I used it on his neck to trim his neck and found it to be very sharp and took little effort to get the back of his neck nice and pretty.</li>
            <li> This is an upgrade from my previous Wahl trimmer.  Easy to use with 9 length settings.  My only complain for now is it didn&#x27;t come with a small bag.</li>
            <li> I use two of the blades that come with it (stubble and the wide main cutting blade).  It works really well.  Charges quickly and the adjustment wheel has a nice solid feel to it.  Decent amount of resistance when you are spinning it and it clicks with a nice slow, firm click.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the batter is completely dead it will not effectively work while plugged in the wall. You must wait a while to let it store up some energy first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend the product and would buy it again if anything happened to mine.</li>
            <li> Works great- lasts forever on a charge. Its super cute and havent had a single issue with it so far.</li>
            <li> This razor actually worked really well for a few weeks but it slipped from a the grip of the user and broke on the first fall, which wasn&#x27;t very far. I&#x27;ve dropped many a razors into the sink and never had one break on me so easily.  The hair removal performance was very good for a rechargeable razor but I expect something of this nature to be more durable.</li>
            <li> I would give it 6 stars if i could this thing is a life saver. Since i don&#x27;t need to plug it in to shave and has a battery i can shave just about anywhere. The thing i like the best is the changeable parts for mustache and beard. I&#x27;m in love with this machine. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Cuts well and holds its charge well.  I have had mine for a couple of months and charged  it once after the first time.  Only negative I can think of is that it is a bit loud.  It can also be used to trim a haircut so you don&#x27;t need those as often.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great and has a great battery life, however I just wish there were a case with it to store it when not in use.</li>
            <li> Awesome clipper, totally satisfied. Cuts like a razor.  Power sustains even if I forget to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;The clip settings are awesome and easy to set.  My only complaint was I couldn&#x27;t turn it up to 11.</li>
            <li> The problem with this is the attachment settings.  A &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; up to a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; setting is not much of a difference at all.  No other attachments come with it (like ears or nose attachments).</li>
            <li> Does a nice job taming my beard. Price is right and holds the charge for a good while. I don&#x27;t trim the length of my beard too often, but haven&#x27;t had to charge it the few times I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> battery lasts forever</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a month and a half ago after my old dependable gave up. Was a little leery about all the talk of not having to charge as much and was I ever surprised. I plugged it in for 24 hours upon its arrival and I have not had to recharge it since then. I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t use it every day but it does get used at least 3 times a week and I find this incredible. Nice sharp blades, no more pulling out whiskers and does a great job of shaving the back of my neck. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this trimmer. Guaranteed!!</li>
            <li> After a few months of sporadic use this trimmer will no longer hold a charge for longer than a minute. I cannot finish trimming my face before it completely dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before it started acting up it did do a good job trimming, but be warned that if used without a guard the pointy prongs will catch in your skin and make you bleed if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Sleek look and works great.  Takes a little work to clean but otherwise works wonderful.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I hoped for</li>
            <li> I bought it 8 months ago from Amazon... I wanted to love it (even tho it kinda nips and cuts my skin when trimming with no guard) until the battery couldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore (Lithium Ion? really?).  I knew it wasn&#x27;t water proof or resistant when I bought it, but I really miss that feature on my old one.  No longer using this guy in favor of a Philips Norelco I&#x27;ve already bought from Costco.  (Love their return policy.)    Update 12/31/14:  I was impressed to see Remington&#x27;s quick and sincere comment on my post.  Today I called the number they provided.  They said if I send the product back (at my cost) they will issue a full refund.  I will update again if I can get around to sending it back.    Update 1/22/15:  Today I received a refund check.  While for me the product didn&#x27;t meet minimum standards, the customer service was way above average.  Originally 1 star review.  Now 4 stars.  They earned it.</li>
            <li> I had something like to his from another company but lost the charger. I&#x27;m glad I did. This one is so much better. Charge also holds a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li> I have had the Remington MB4040 for a year now and I have a thick beard that needs a better than average cutter.  This is the one that works for me.  I love the long charge on the battery and the high R.P.M. of the motor that is not even mentioned in the add or instruction sheet that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, thank you.</li>
            <li> It catches my hair, so I don&#x27;t trust it. The battery lasts quite a long time on a single charge though.</li>
            <li> How could it have taken so long for someone to design such a simple product that works effortlessly and flawlessly</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer yet. I have owned probably a half a dozen different brands to this point, this is the best. Sharp, powerful, easily adjustable, quieter than a lot. Easily 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great for the stubble look.  After trying multiple trimmers, this one is by far the best I have owned so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my fiance to replace one that he&#x27;d had for a good eight years.  This is a great improvement on his previous one.  It works well, is easy to handle and use, and gets a close shave.  And it holds a charge for a long time too, which is great.  It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is the best battery operated beard and mustache trimmer I have ever owned.  I can actually complete a full trim without the battery dying mid- stream.  In fact, I have never had the battery go dead since my purchase on July 26, 2013, even after multiple trims on a single charge. This trimmer is far better than any other trimmer I have ever owned or used, and I have probably bought at least half-dozen different trimmers throughout the years I have worn a beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased this trimmer was to detail the edges (mainly the sides) of my goatee and to even up the bottom of my mustache. Naturally, this was the first task I tried with the trimmer. Starting with the mustache, I had a few hairs that were a little too long, so I gently touched the trimmer head to the hairs, and OUCH, there was blood and pain. I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong. I didn&#x27;t use any pressure, and I just barely touched the hairs as lightly as I could. Nevertheless, I decided to tempt fate and use the device to detail the sides of my goatee so that they were nice and symmetrical. Regrettably, this resulted in more of the same: pain and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Remington&#x27;s customer service number, and I explained my experience. I expected that the representative would provide some suggestions, maybe a certain technique of holding the device or something I should do beforehand to prepare my face -- I don&#x27;t know. Instead, I received a response roughly equivalent to &amp;#34;Yeah, those blades are sharp!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, back into the box and off to the Amazon returns center it went.</li>
            <li> Wish I had opted for this type of trimmer years ago. Have enjoyed it for the past three months and the AC charging unit is so easy to use. Has worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> First, I love that this things charge lasts seemingly forever.  Second, the close but not too close shave head is awesome.  The adjustable shave attachments work great on my beard.  I love that it has the interchangeable heads for different shave &amp;#34;projects&amp;#34;.  Probably the best trimmer that I&#x27;ve come across in my many years.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older model, and I am very happy with it. Delivery was as promised, and the unit functions well.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable in my hand, easy to move around my goatee! Having the ability to keep a clean goatee just got easier.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this trimmer. He mainly uses it to trim down his whiskers without having to shave. What he loves most about this trimmer is the battery life. He can use it every other day, and use it for a couple weeks without having to recharge the battery. That&#x27;s pretty outstanding! If you need to get a trimmer for yourself, buy this one and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Fits my needs and was exactly what i expected. Easy to use and very compact and not very expensive, also easy to clean</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have owned and I have owned at least four others. Easy to use and does a great job. This trimmer has plenty of power and holds a charge for many uses.</li>
            <li> Good product from Remington! I love the adjustable length trimmer that is built on to the device. I always lost the clip on guards so this was refreshing to know that it is adjustable. Excellent buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older model of this type of clipper and I have to say that they don&#x27;t make em like they used to. This is great for beards and such but the hairs get caught in the guard and start to gum it up. I also use it to sometimes shave my head from time to time. It pulls at times and is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for facial hair but that&#x27;s it. The older version was strong and versatile.</li>
            <li> I had to go through a learning cycle to trim my beard. It was jsut because I did not read the documentation well. Once I got the plastic head on it, I loved using it.</li>
            <li> So for the first few times I used this product I would get cut trimming my beard. Recently I&#x27;ve tried switching to one of the other blades that it comes with and since then I haven&#x27;t had a problem.</li>
            <li> Has multiple options and I use it for trimming my side burns too. All that at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> very good to trim..great price.. very sturdy cant beat the price.. remingtons are thee best.... bar none . great and good</li>
            <li> Sometimes the stubble one cuts my skin under my chin but other than that good product, I would buy it again. Good product</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling. I love it and am glad my old one died. I will buy this one again if i ever have to.</li>
            <li> just lucking, but it went a year with just one charge. it is perfect for getting that two day look.</li>
            <li> I come from New Zealand and ordered this shaver online. When i plugged it into the wall socket with adapter it would not charge, it blew a fuse in the charger which is apparently a way different voltage. Just for your info</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust and secure length setting and easy to clean with the included brush. I’ve used mainly the beard trimmer but the goatee blade is nice for precision. The stubble blade I haven’t used so I can’t speak to that.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is absolutely amazing.  Never has my beard looked so good!  The cleaning of the product was pretty easy as well since it is able to be rinsed off.</li>
            <li> After a little over a year of light use, it will no longer charge or work with the power supply.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loved it! But then he used it for his genitals.. and his butt.. and his thighs.. even tho he uses it for that too they do a good job. Its last a long time without being recharged and the blades are still going strong. I recommend it for anyone who wants to keep that manly beard... or other areas trimmed...</li>
            <li> After buying several trimmers that didn&#x27;t hold their charge, this is the one!  Great trimmer that does a great job and doesn&#x27;t crap out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair trimmers in the market. Good to use it for a change. Delivered on time in good condition despite inclement weather. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> If  you intend to use this trimmer use a protective head, which broke in under a week&lt;br /&gt;And if you are using to shave then don&#x27;t be surprised to see your face bleed.</li>
            <li> I tried this trimmer twice and it cut my skin both times. Very harsh rubbing feel on skin. You don&#x27;t want this trimmer to get anywhere close to any sensitive skin areas. I am throwing this trimmer away and going back to my old one. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> It is a solid beard trimmer, it does the job great! Good for all facial hair and trimming to your own specification.</li>
            <li> Powerful, sharp and does the job very quick.  The attachment give a wide range of cuts and is just the right width for precise trimming.  I have used this in the shower with little water splashing on it and it worked fine.  Wont submerge it thats for sure, but it is a bit water proof.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied, for that price it&#x27;s just an awesome product. Good quality for a fair amount of money, that&#x27;s disturbingly rare to find nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer would not hold a charge so I found this model on-line and liked the reviews.  I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for over a month and have only charged it once (Use three times a week)  I like the fact it has three different blades and seems to be well made.</li>
            <li> This the best trimmer I have ever owned. It really keeps a charge and its easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had a carry case.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer! Been using this for a three weeks, three times a week to keep my beard trimmed even. Still on origional charge and holding plenty of power. So yeah great battery compared to older models of this trimmer. Plenty of power to chew through beard.</li>
            <li> Everything great but no charge light when plugged in (unless the shaver is fully charged, in which case I dont know how to ytell either way) and the second thing is the stubble cutting length seems to be its weekest feature. Its either long stubble or nothing. Otherwise robust and good value.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job.  don&#x27;t get other men complaining about the supposedly tacky look on the handle.  that doesn&#x27;t matter at all  the product does it&#x27;s job  that&#x27;s all that matters to me  it&#x27;s certainly worth the money</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband for his birthday. He said this about it, \\&quot;It works well. I&lt;br /&gt;have used it only a few times but it is just what I wanted.  It&#x27;s better than my last Remington I wore out.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this beard trimmer about a month ago.  My lady was coming to town and I was looking for a quick fix to my growing shaggy mess.  This was exactly what I was looking for...it&#x27;s not going to have lots of frilly attachments for things like nosehair or anything like that, but when it comes to powering through your beard and giving you a comfortable, quick trim, this is great.  Highly recommended as a regular grooming tool.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is perfect for my needs.  It replaces another and does everything I need done. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Its pretty fantastic, I have only charged it once in a month or so, so the battery is good, does a great cutting too</li>
            <li> Blades is soo sharp that I almost cut my throat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very well build. Seems solid...nice design..sharp blades...long battery lasting.&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean</li>
            <li> It does every thing a trimmer should .I used a Whal for years and it finaly gave out . This machine is trimming closer and no irritation on my skin. With interchangeable heads it gets closer to the skin when trimming .</li>
            <li> so far no problems at all,  purchesed about year ago, it really works well and have no complains.&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> Battery is holding up well and cut is satisfactory. Very sturdy construction. A tad noisy is only complaint. Would recommend for someone just starting out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for a very old model of Remington beard and mustache trimmer, and it far surpasses my expectations.  It does the job extremely well, with two additional blades for goatee and stubble. Most pleasing is the long battery life and the built in recharger. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have used this about once a month for a year.  It pinches and grabs, and that is unpleasant. I used it anyway.  But now the battery will no longer hold a charge.  I can run it for about two minutes and then it slows down and stops.  Not enough time to trim a beard.</li>
            <li> Product works well but is missing a couple of &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; of higher priced products.  As it was given as a gift, the higher priced models would have been better.</li>
            <li> was a present for my hubby he seems very happy with it much more efficient than his last one so will probably recommend it to friends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v had a few trimmers, and this one is a good one for sure. Does just what its suppose to do...</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for about a year now and I have probably only had to charge it a couple of times. It is used for full body trimming and it does that well. I will definitely buy this particular model again if it ever fails.</li>
            <li> The Remington MB4040 was a great priced trimmer, and I found it to be powerful and sturdy.  Satisfies my trimming needs.</li>
            <li> The plastic beard guard is of a very low quality and tends to bend when I use it, leaving a somewhat uneven trim. Would have given a higher score if not for the cheaply made beard guard. Everything else works ok. Holds a decent charge so you do not have to recharge it too often.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  Too bad I lost the charger and attachments, I&#x27;ll buy another one though since I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> I wear a beard, but I like to keep it close to my face.  This trims it exactly the way I like it, and it was reasonable</li>
            <li> Not bad but not exceptional either. The blades are not as awesome as they appear and they do not have the ability to shave close enough even without the length guide. This is just as good as any other inexpensive trimmer but it isn&#x27;t any better than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Remington because my wahl g-whiz trimmer died. I am going to purchase another wahl g-whiz trimmer because it is a much better trimmer than this Remington. I am giving this Remington away because it is not a good as I need for trimming.</li>
            <li> Wahl and Remington make the best stuff out there.  This Remington is more functional than other comparable shavers, for the price.  The guard is only one piece that is able to be set higher or lower.  It is not as good as the guard system that contains separate guard combs you attach one at a time.  This guard on this Remington misses a few hairs because it is not perfect at sending them up to be cut, but you do the area over, and over once more, and it works.</li>
            <li> Bought it in Jan and it failed in Sept.  After cleaning, the head repeatedly was difficult to put back on and finally it simply refused to go back into place.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in June 2014 and gave it its first charge.  I&#x27;ve used it pretty much once a week since then. It&#x27;s now May 2015, and it&#x27;s still going. It... it seems to defy physics. I would give it 5 stars, but honestly it&#x27;s starting to make me question if any of this is real. I fear I&#x27;ve said too much. They may be listening. Buy this razor, and see how far the rabbit hole goes!</li>
            <li> everything works as it should, I love the lithium power I can go a long time before recharging.</li>
            <li> Works well but don&#x27;t like the on-off switch position.  It&#x27;s hard to work.</li>
            <li> This razor appears to be good quality with a sharp blade, but it still feels like it occasionally pulls the hairs rather than cutting them. I&#x27;ve given up using it as a beard trimmer and only use it when cutting hair and trimming up the back of the neck.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer.  This purchase was to replace an older model and it is just what I wanted.  Good quality and I trust this brand of trimmer.</li>
            <li> This machine surely holds its charge for at least a month without recharging! It certainly surprised me. Good quality machine!</li>
            <li> easy to use, easy to adjust trim length. Easy to charge. Long battery life after single charge.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a few months.  It&#x27;s a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer, my husband loves it! Good variety of attachments and easy to clean too</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality trimmer that feels well built. Lots of power when fully charged and it includes a nice set of blades. Unfortunately after just 6 months, the battery is starting to act up. After been plugged in all night, it works for only several minutes and then it just dies. If you leave it sitting for sometime unplugged, it somehow starts to work again but it kinds of randomly dies. Maybe it is overheating or has some sort of battery memory issue (which I thought Lithium batteries are not supposed to suffer from it). Already looking for another cordless/corded type of trimmer to replace it or maybe repair it under warranty.</li>
            <li> This thing cleans you up !! but man if ur not careful it cuts pretty easily. Only giving it 4 stars because this sucker cuts your damn skin if your not careful.</li>
            <li> everything was good except it didn&#x27;t not come in the box that it shows in the pictures, it just ships in the same box it was packaged in.</li>
            <li> I love it! I use it all the time and I still haven&#x27;t had to charge it. I&#x27;m not used to that. trims very smoothly</li>
            <li> Has some pretty unique power settings so be careful. lol. its awesome and makes you cut and trim anypart of your body with precision.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several beard trimmers most of which were junk. This one has very good battery life, it trims evenly and is very user friendly. Best of all the price is right. Truthfully, out of all the others I wasted money on, this one is a keeper. Used it awhile before I wrote this and yes, &amp;#34;5 star I love it&amp;#34;, isn&#x27;t an over reach</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit confused about the difference in the 2 blades.... the &#x27;stubble&#x27; and the &#x27;beard\\&quot;..... actually you get a third also.... the \\&quot;goatee\\&quot; which is clear that it&#x27;s an edging tool for trimming around a goatee. But the other 2 I have no idea what the difference is.... I tried both with the same results. I had an old cheapo Remington cordless that worked fine for trimming my beard and my head, but the rechargeable battery had given up the ghost. This new Remington took twice as long to trim my beard evenly, and wouldn&#x27;t hardly do my head. It just wouldn&#x27;t cut it. I had to recharge the old one to finish my head. Can&#x27;t figure that one out yet. Good thing its got a significant battery life as it takes so long to get a job finished. I&#x27;m going to send it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old Remington that was not charging anymore.  This is a great until with a great battery life.  I love the attachment that stays on the unit, it makes it very hard to lose it.  It is very powerful and gets the job done.  I recommend this to anyone that needs a good rechargeable mustache &amp;/or beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable head to the trimmer can be a bit to get used to with the fact that the slanted teeth on the attachment do have some wiggle room to them. If you were to take your finger and press down on them with some light pressure they would bend and return to regular position upon release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is true to the description and makes it a great reliable trimmer. the teeth on the bare trimmer are wide enough to make it useful for framing the cheek and neck lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look and feel make it a comfortable use and the different heads come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great general purpose purchase.</li>
            <li> Good razor. Cuts well. But.....6 months later, it will not hold a charge long enough to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> Trims my beard... what else is there to say.</li>
            <li> Have used problem-free for the past year.  Seems to last a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last forever. I rarely charge it. It seems to get a closer trim than any other trimmers I have used in the past (and I have bought a lot of them trying to find one that works well for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this one ever dies, I will certainly replace it with an identical model. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver, very sharp, holds a long charge.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer. Holds a charge for a very long time, cuts well and accurate. Takes a little getting used to using the guide at first.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Jan. 2013.  It died this week and will not charge.  Also, I use it in the shower and the number strip inside the dial started to release.  It performed well while it worked.  One issue was when using the guard and settings 1-4, it would pull hairs a couple times during a trim of the beard.  I will probably try a different trimmer this time around.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband because his other one finally died after many years.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this because he loves this.  He said it shaves nice &amp; battery lasts a very very long time.  He highly recommend this to all men in need of a shaver you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> good price, works great</li>
            <li> Very versatile​ and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works great. Charge lasts long time. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Cuts like a dream! really powerfull! Was a little worried when I took it out of the package, a little light, didn&#x27;t think I was going to be good but works GREAT! Not a lot of attachments but the 9 adjustable lengths and 2 added blade combinations is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li> This device pulls when trimming your beard att imes even when fully charged. It&#x27;s average at best compared to previous models</li>
            <li> I have used many razors and many price points. This will compete with about all...truly close shave and detail oriented trimmer.</li>
            <li> i think the battery is good and its have Good shape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but its can not cut short hair very well ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think i will need another trimmer</li>
            <li> For about two years I owned the Remington MB-300 shaver.  The darn thing couldn&#x27;t hold a battery charge (a common problem if you read the reviews), but darnit, it was the best trimmer I ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dropping the MB-300 more than a few times, I could no longer piece the trimmer together.  It was time to find a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Remington no longer manufactures the MB-300.  Another thing that is unfortunate is that after reading a wealth of reviews on Amazon about available trimmers from the likes of Remington, Wahl and Panasonic, none of them got glowing reviews across the board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ultimately chose this Remington MB404 for two reasons.  First, the battery.  It uses a Li-ion battery which is supposed to get better recharge value.  Second, based on its price, I figured I was getting something better than those $15 trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed to find upon its arrival that this Remington only works on battery power.  The instructions clearly state that it will not operate off AC power while plugged in.  I can&#x27;t totally verify it, as it will run plugged in, but I have a feeling it still may only be operating on battery charge.  I can only tell you what the instructions specifically state.  This is potentially bad news.  You don&#x27;t want to constantly run this thing on battery while at home.  Most would want to save that battery power for travel.  After all, there is only so many times you can recharge these batteries before they totally run out of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next problem is the multiple clipper attachments.  I&#x27;m not a fan of this.  I would rather just have one clipper attachment that doesn&#x27;t need to be interchanged.  A pop-out trimmer attachment on the side would have been much better.  Fortunately, the attachments are very easy to pop in and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there&#x27;s the plastic trim guard.  For those that like their goatee and mustache trimmed very close, the guard does not allow the blade to get \\&quot;close enough.\\&quot;  I feel as if there could have been one more setting to bring that trimmer closer to the face.  It also took me a good 10 minutes to figure out how the trimmer guard fits on the unit.  It&#x27;s a bit of a Rubik&#x27;s cube predicament, but once you figure it out you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the positive things I could say about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s supposed to be self-sharpening and the fact you don&#x27;t need to apply oil to it is a big plus.to get \\&quot;close enough.\\&quot;  I feel as if there could have been one more setting to bring that trimmer closer to the face.

            <li> i love this Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer. and i think is one of the best trimmer you can get at its low price</li>
            <li> Had a well respected name Wahl trimmer before this one.  NO Comparison!&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the battery system IS NOT Ni Cad sold me. Look no further for a beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Hand wheel depth adjustment is perfect.  No qualms in recommending this trimmer at all.</li>
            <li> This trimmer looked just like what I needed.  It&#x27;s cordless and comes with three different blades and adjustable length settings.  The few times I got to use it it worked great.  The third time I changed blades I couldn&#x27;t get any of the blades to snap back into place in the Trimmer.  I ended up having to send it back.  I wouldn&#x27;t want a replacement as the inner workings are all plastic and it looks to me like I&#x27;d have the same problem again.</li>
            <li> Wanted lithium battery trimmer at a lower cost as I don&#x27;t use a trimmer all that often.  Lithium holds a charge longer and charges fast when I need it.</li>
            <li> I got this with the intention of using it as a beard trimmer.  If you enjoy a closer cut on your beard then this is not for you.  I had an older, similiarly priced Nolrelco trimmer which cut more &#x27;consistantly&#x27;.  This trimmer leaves quite a few longer hairs sticking up, and if you want to make sure that all your hairs are even you have to go over your face a LOT- like 20 times.  It may work well for longer hair trimming, but if you like to keep your beard cut at the \\&quot;lowest setting\\&quot; then its a real pain in the butt to get this to do the trick. I&#x27;m going to go back to the Nolrelco.  Luckily they are both fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> I like to use this guy about once a week and trim my beard down to a stubble length.  Eventually the job does get done, it just takes several passes over.  It is easier than shaving, but it&#x27;s a 2-3 minute type of chore either.  I do realize that I have a heavy beard, but still it seems like it should be easier than having to go over the same spot 3-4 times to make sure that everything is at the same length</li>
            <li> Trimmer is pretty sweet, it has a really good system for changing trimmer blades and for changing the head length. Remington brand has done well, the trimmer does exactly what it says it does. It looks great, cuts great, and does not feel cheap at all. The only reason I 4-starred it is because it didn&#x27;t exceed my expectation/didn&#x27;t blow my mind, it just does what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Potential) Con-It&#x27;s not a precision trimmer, so you will still have stubble on your face if you take the head off and just use the fine-tooth blade. It&#x27;s not like a straight razor or typical four blade shaver, so it gets its job done, but you still need to use an actual razor if you&#x27;re looking for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> This works great., Much better than my ten year old trimmer did. very easy to use and a very nice cut . easy to adjust length settings</li>
            <li> I am finding it really hard to navigate product reviews for beard trimmers, because people seem to have a lot of different needs, and they don&#x27;t specify what they bought the product for up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy beard trimmers exclusively to replace shaving, because I have sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t need to be perfectly clean shaven most of the time. Therefore I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments or anything, just the bare beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My priorities are: as close a trim as possible; high power motor for speed and ease; no cuts, pulling hairs or other irritating events (this is also related to motor power). This product fails pretty much on all three of these counts, for me. The closeness of the trim is average at best, the power is down right bad, significantly worse than wahl products 1/3 of the price. And as for irritation, even with the stubble blade the razor pulls hairs, and has nicked me several times, which is very uncommon in my experience with other products.</li>
            <li> Stays charged for much longer than my old trimmer, which ran on NiCad batteries.  The LiOn cells don&#x27;t get a &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; like the old batteries did.  I also find the ergonomic angle of the trimming head to be much better than the classic trimmer style, especially when trimming the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> this has been very strange, but i have yet to recharge this trimmer since i purchased it few months ago. and i use it about 2 to 3 times a week for my facial hair and sideburns. i&#x27;m starting to wonder if i&#x27;ll ever need to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like to try to maintain a natural look with my facial hair, and this trimmer has been great for that. i stopped using my razor all together.</li>
            <li> My old one never held a charge like this one.  Use it at least once a week and still haven&#x27;t charged it.</li>
            <li> Received as a gift, replacing an MB40, that was a number of years old. The batter finally died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MB40 was ok. Did the job. I did not realize what i was missing until I used this. The steel cutter is worlds ahead of the foil cutter. Powers through the beard like nothing. Very quiet (compared), and smooth. No pulls at all. Solid feeling. ergonomically very nice. It is easy to adjust, and to switch cutters. I&#x27;ve not had it long enough to comment on durability or battery life, but useability and function are top-notch. I will update this post if there are any issues as time goes on. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this one I was using a different Remington trimmer from 10 years ago that ran on double A batteries. This trimmer is so much better. It holds a charge very well, the cutting blades move at fairly high speed, and it is powerful enough that it rarely pulls a hair. My only complaint is that the depth guard is a little sharp, but maybe I am just pushing to hard. This works almost as well as my AC powered Wahl hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands I&#x27;ve purchased throughout the years, this one actually holds a strong battery charge for an extended period of time, rather than either having to keep another plugged in or constantly having to recharge it. Sharp and apparently has been reliable for me unlike others. I&#x27;d have given it five stars, but still waiting to see how long it stays sharp and holds up. So far, I&#x27;m rather pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer stopped holding charge after about two months.  Leaving me half-shaved.  I tried cleaning &amp; recharging but to no avail.  Junk.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer! It is very powerful and has no problem trimming a thick beard. It&#x27;s also quiet and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Keeps my beard looking neat with little effort.  Extra shaving heads are a nice plus.&lt;br /&gt;This has a nice solid feel to it.  I have had this razor about 2 months and have not had to charge it since the initial charge when I first received it.</li>
            <li> This was bought for my husband who has a mustache and always has some type of goatee or beard.  He was pleased not only with how well it worked.  He was also impressed with the fact that the trimmer had been been unplugged for three weeks and still had a charge like freshly charged.</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco and a couple of other off brands and this one is better than them all. Easy to adjust and good power.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old trimmer, also a very similar Remington which had a battery that would no longer charge. I stuck with Remington and I&#x27;m very disappointed. This one has a cheap plastic housing, a cheap plastic trimmer guard, and when I use it the hair gets pinched between the guard and the unit, and pulls! Ouch! Very unfriendly, so I am returning it. A great example of how something new on the evolutionary tree is WORSE than what it was intended to update.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my college-age son for Christmas and it works very well.  I has a good, clean cut and seems to hold a charge well.  The only concern is that there are a number of small parts and nothing to hold them.  It would be a good additon to have a small accessories bag with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the plastic sleeve that fits over the top is a bit cumbersome and comes off easily if you are not careful.  Overall a good purchase and he is pleased with it - but there is room for improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once every 2 weeks or so to trim, and after 18 months the battery no longer holds a charge. The charger is not strong enough to run the clippers without a charge. Note that this really sucks when the battery starts to die part way through a trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to throw the trimmer away, but I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a way to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> pros: works well&lt;br /&gt;i just use if for clean up of sideburns and general grooming, not actual beard trimming so the battery lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;so long that i lost the charger and now have to find one online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: the adjustment feels a little cheap and that is what broke on my last one.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, easy to use for beard and mustache trimming. It does seem to miss more hairs in a single pass than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> Been through several Mustache &amp; Beard Trimmers &amp; so happy I finally found one that is to my husband&#x27;s liking!  Mission accomplished!</li>
            <li> Not having owned this but a few months I haven&#x27;t had the chance to fully check it out.  From the uses I have tried I am very happy that this is a very good instrument and will perform as described.Works great for me!</li>
            <li> As a long-time user of beard-trimming devices, I&#x27;ve learned it&#x27;s the emitted sound that reveals their quality. The tone of this one suggests the internals are precision built and that they will last for a long time. The exchangeable blades are a nice touch, especially at this price point. Battery power and life seem leading edge - I am interested to see how this one ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All external pieces with which your hand or face make contact have smoothed/rounded edges, unlike a previous trimmer I endured. The only comfort-related gripe, which overall ranks fairly minor, is the positioning of the on/off switch. It sits very low on the handle, making one handed operation awkward. I felt like I was just about to drop the unit when I turned it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use, I did experience something that another reviewer mentioned: an occasional single hair that does not get trimmed and the high number of passes required to get consistent length over a specific area. After some examination (and comparison to two other trimmers), I believe the culprit is the wide spacing of the teeth on the adjustable comb. Narrower spacing (as found on the others) forces curlier hairs to straighten. On the Remington, there is room between teeth to allow rogue hairs to remain partially coiled or angled away from the meshing blades. Ooops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in short (sorry), extra time is definitely needed for additional passes to achieve truly even beard length - not ideal. It helps to have a fine (..manual..) comb to assist with the straightening duties. And a third hand for the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That adjustable comb is also a bit flimsy. I will be treating it carefully (and making sure to store it at the \\&quot;minimum/No. 1\\&quot; setting) as I don&#x27;t think the attachment  would survive even a single drop onto even a wood (much less tile) floor. Incidentally, setting the adjustment dial to the \\&quot;No. 1\\&quot; setting makes sliding the adjustable comb on or off easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The too-wide tooth issue is theonly flaw - but a serious one - on an otherwise excellent product. Three stars, then.</li>
            <li> When you take off the beard trimmer and try to edge with the blade, this thing will chop you up. I got several deep cuts first time I used it.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard and moustache with a pair of scissors, most times while still half asleep, sometimes resulting in an uneven trim. It was very time consuming.  With this trimmer, once you get the hang of it  trimming is very quick and easy and the results are amazing (even if half asleep). Have not had any problem with this trimmer pulling hairs. Cleaning with the included brush is a snap. Beard never looked so good.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor, it&#x27;s pretty clearly a quality built piece of equipment. I was originally confused by how the beard trimming mechanism worked, however. You need to put the trimmer on, then the size adjustment roller will work.</li>
            <li> product of very poor quality. was purchased on January 21 and use it for the first time on February 27. After 40 minutes of using the computer sounded very hard and strong vibrated. not able to change or return, the period was until 21 February. not recommended. I lost my money.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an old one that had just worn out. I was pleasantly surprised at the new features this one offered. The best thing about it is the adjustable length guard. Instead of have 3 or 4 different guards for different lengths it has just one. You slide the guard to different preset positions - and there is a handy indicator on the razor telling you what length you&#x27;ve selected. Much better design imo. The blades are self-lubricating so you don&#x27;t have to oil them. Battery seems good so far. Like the new design too.</li>
            <li> Hopefully an improvement over the MB200 which was a good design paired with a wimpy power supply (battery). The MB 4040  employes essentially the same design but with what is supposed to be a higher quality battery. If the battery last for a couple of years I would say Remington has the better product in the market. The design works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered for the last year using a crappy shaver that was on its last legs and never held a charge - since I bought it.  This thing thus far is amazing...  I have VERY thick stubble and was looking for something that would keep my shadow look but basically cut the hair as close to your skin as possible, without actually using a razor - which I despise.  Shaves SO close and when you use the broader blade you NEVER get hang ups where it pinches you and feels like someone stabbed you in the face.  Overall, I&#x27;m completely satisfied and stoked I bought this thing.  I&#x27;ll follow up in a year.</li>
            <li> after about three months it started loosing charge quickly barely able to finish one beard trim.  eventually it completely lost it ability to hold a charge,  and now it is useless.  There are several people who have had the same problem .  poor battery life ,  waste of money IMO .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real nice but it will nip you. It&#x27;s perfect for that stubble like shave that you need to get before you use the foil shaver. It&#x27;s very sharp and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> My husband used this for the first time and said he was very happy with it. He has used other shavers but he said this one is one of the best he has ever used. He has very tough beard and he said it takes it off like it was butter and no pulling or pinching. Very happy with this :)</li>
            <li> This will be my third time buying this item (for the same person). I originally purchased it several years ago, choosing it because it had the best reviews. I think it is by far the best available (the recipient agrees). Really, the only drawback is that it has a lifespan of about two years (the same time span as the warranty), so you need to replace it that frequently. But I still believe it surpasses all the others of its kind, so I keep coming back at holiday time!</li>
            <li> Got it for $25.99 with a 4 dollar coupon. This unit trims very nicely and evenly all across the face/neck. Even trimmed my hair with it and worked fine. Charges fully in 3 hours and battery lasts for a long time. Not too noisy as well.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with only 1 adjustable plastic guard with 9 different sizes for custom level of trimming which is a bonus{less pieces laying around}, and 3 different razor heads.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - Very happy with this product, for the price I dont think you can get anything better.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer works great!  Though it&#x27;s my first one (I&#x27;m new to the world of beards), it works just as I expected.  I like that you can adjust the length by dial, and the different trimmers are easy to swap out.  I&#x27;ve used the beard trimmer for the main areas and the goatee trimmer to shape the lower lip area.  Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The reviews I read were accurate about battery power. I have not recharged it in weeks since I&#x27;ve had it. Does a nice cutting job also. I have used many Norelco and other brand trimmers in the past, but this might be the best so far. And less expensive. A good value.</li>
            <li> Decent trimmer. Issues: 6 months in battery is now quick to die. Not enough &#x27;comb&#x27; attachments to help grab all hair (combined with battery life makes this trimmer a pain to use). I have coarse facial hair and I have to go over my face 3-4 times</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  Of course, I have not bought a trimmer for the 15 years even though I shave my beard 2x per week so I have nothing to compare it to.  Trimmers should last a loooong time if maintained well.  Even with regular use.  Make sure you wash and dry the blade after use.  And use 2 or 3 drops of trimmer oil.  I am expecting to keep this trimmer another 15 years.  I will do another review in 2027.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this product. Does exactly what I want it for. Has 9 different settings so easy to find the setting you desire. Nice sleek design and easy to clean. The charge also holds up for a long time. I agree with one of the reviewers that it works better on long hair than short hair. I sometimes feel a pinch when hair trimmed down but very rare. Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to give as a Christmas gift.  It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t exactly what he wanted, but he kept it anyway.</li>
            <li> This is the worst beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  Constantly pulls beard hair on 4/5 guard length, never had a trim without this happening.  use at your own risk.</li>
            <li> The Remington I had before never, ever pulled hairs when it cut. This one does often enough to make me slow down the trimming process hoping to avoid the painful yanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous one died and though I tried to replace its NiCd battery, it proved to be just about impossible (bad!). Hoping for better life from this one&#x27;s Lithium battery.</li>
            <li> Was a replacement for an old nickel cadmium that lost it&#x27;s charge.  The lithium ion battery is holding it&#x27;s charge for over a month so far and is working great.</li>
            <li> So far so good , haven&#x27;t had it long enough to rate it any higher.</li>
            <li> The battery on this machine lasts a lifetime. I&#x27;ve only charged it a handful of times, and I&#x27;ve probably used it dozens to get the job done on my beard. It is simple to operate. I like the variety of heads, and the blade guard is effective. Who needs fancy stands and what not when it only needs to be charged every once and a while?</li>
            <li> The best i have bought. Does a brilliant job.!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended.A++++</li>
            <li> Even shave. Gets the rough to reach spots. Enough length settings for anybody. Great battery power. Very durable. All around quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> Loved this product and used it sparingly for 10 months. Now it won&#x27;t charge.  Quality is not up to par.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer that I&#x27;ve ever owned. I use it evry 2-3 days and only have to charge it every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> First thing I was amazed by was the packaging of the product itself. Works excellently and does it&#x27;s job. I have no problems with it so far and the fact that the blades are titanium is just a plus. Charges fast and last really long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design is small and compact, easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> I use it once per month. It works well. She maintains the load of the battery well. A little noisy. Well sharpening. I suppose that any one more expensive it should be sort of more delicate in every sense.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver. Have had it for some time and had to charge it VERY FEW times. Very happy with the quality of the blades.</li>
            <li> Sturdy shaver....easy to change shaving heads (comes with three different heads and a brush).  I put less than a drop of oil on each of the three heads before using the first time.  Very smooth on goatee upkeep.</li>
            <li> This a good trimmer that I use when I&#x27;m running late and I realize I don&#x27;t have time for my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is that it comes with 1attachment but it does cut consistently and cleans easily. Very long and reliable charge holding.&lt;br /&gt;Feels sturdy and the length adjustment roller is very sleek.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son-in-law. He has told me it has been an excellent implement and I can attest that his beard and mustache are looking great..</li>
            <li> Good if you are grooming a beard, but it doesn&#x27;t work to keep a nice stubble look. In general terms it does the job.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t plug this trimmer into 240v.  I didn&#x27;t look at the charger first as most transformers work with either voltage. I took this one to Africa and now it doesn&#x27;t take a charge.  Otherwise the trimmer is awesome. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the angle of the head seems backwards to me.  The battery lasts a long time and the blades are of good quality.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great and has a long battery life. The adjustable guard is easy to adjust and is way better than having multiple guards all over the place in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> The razor function worked really great but the battery failed within a year and it was impossible to replace. I think that they used a really low quality battery. No lithium battery should ever fail so quickly, Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Good size, holds a charge, cuts off my face hair. If you need to get rid of a full beard, this will do the job.</li>
            <li> there are many pieces, all fragile, the money spent on the accessory blades would be better put toward making the primary blades not rip your hair out, and after minimal use it died about a year after later</li>
            <li> Awesome battery life and just as awesome power to match. My old one lasted for about 2 or 3 uses and this one lasts for WEEKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only annoyance is that it doesn&#x27;t come with anything to hold all the attachments and the cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a great job and holds a charge for a long time.  I&#x27;ve only charged it once and it still fires up as if I&#x27;d never used it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and would have been better it it had a case for the interchangeable parts.  Can&#x27;t grumble too  much as the item is such good value for money</li>
            <li> My husband is the main user of this trimmer, but as a licensed cosmetologist (hairstylist) who often cuts his hair and helps him trim his beard with it, I am pleased with this product considering it&#x27;s price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you can spend many times more on a professional trimmer like the ones used in salons, but this is a great at-home alternative. The battery seems to last a long time between charges, the blade attachments are nicely sized and function fine, and it&#x27;s a fairly quiet trimmer. My husband has a chin strap style beard and I like for it to be clean cut with a crisp edge and this trimmer works well enough to acheive that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not flawless and fantastic like my professional salon quality plug-in trimmer, at times it requires a few extra runs over a spot to get all the hair, and the blades aren&#x27;t AS precise as I&#x27;d like (many of us hairstylists really love a t-blade) this is still a great, inexpensive choice for at-home grooming. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, especially as the price is great and it&#x27;s fully functional. Feel free to post any questions in the comments below, I&#x27;ll do my best to answer them.</li>
            <li> Very good blades.  Very good power.  Nice hum.  I had a similar previous version of this trimmer that did a great job while it was running.  However the battery recharged less than 2 years and then died.  I sincerely hope this type of rechargeable battery will last a lot longer and not end up as another \\&quot;disposable\\&quot;.  If the battery is that good, then it deserves all 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10-28-2013:  The battery IS that good!  It lasts MUCH longer between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE  9-27-2014:  Still going strong!</li>
            <li> When I used the trimmer for the first (and only) time, I learned that the guard is made out of cheap flimsy plastic.  The plastic on the guard bends, and does not let you get an even trim.  When trimming around the point of my chin, and along my jaw line, the gaurd bent to the contour of my chin and caused a bald spot...totally ruining the entire beard.  I&#x27;m sure the battery last a long time, and the handle is nice and shiny, but those 2 aspects have to the only 2 postive factors with this cheaply made Remington trimmer.  I&#x27;ve owned a Norelco for 10+ years and never had this problem.  I think I know where I&#x27;m going back to next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using beard trimmers for many years, and most have been usable but (a) poorly constructed, (b) have poor battery life, and (c) don&#x27;t last very long.  I&#x27;ve been using the Remington for about two months now, and so far really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Well designed-easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;-Appears to be well made&lt;br /&gt;-Powerful battery, easy to recharge&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Confusing settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to the Remington lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before. Amazon has always sold awesome items- I never needed to post a review until today. DO NOT BUY this trimmer! It&#x27;s horrible, I&#x27;ve never had a trimmer cut my face! Literally I had scratches on my face after shaving which looked like someone had cut my face with a knife.</li>
            <li> This trimmer seems to work very well. I do like the adjustable plastic thing that fits over the blades. You can pretty much set it at any length you want to by the adjusting wheel. Also the 3 sets of blades are easily changeable. The trimmer has an odd shape that takes a little getting used to, but I guess that&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with the trimmer is that if you want to trim the hairs on the back of your neck, it&#x27;s somewhat sharp on the neck, leaving red marks. If you&#x27;re careful, it&#x27;s not too bad and with a little patience I can maybe round off the tips so they&#x27;re a little easier on the neck. Yes I do recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> For those of us who take our hair down to near-skin level, the product itself works well.  You may find that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t stand the test of time.</li>
            <li> Cuts smoothly, doesn&#x27;t bite.  Love the way the length adjust works.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and tried changing the cutting head that was on it. After I removed it I could not get it back on the body of the shaver. Trying to get it on the blades fell apart and could not be put back together. Very poorly made and not at all user friendly.</li>
            <li> Battery life is forever.  Went two months 3 times a week use atleast 10 minutes of use. It wouldn&#x27;t die. The blades cut great. I don&#x27;t know what others are talking about.  That is 5 o&#x27;clock shadow after using this thing with no guard.  I have a very thick beard I use this to groom and clean up. The comb is alright but not amazing.  Because of this it does take a little more time to get cleaned up. But consistent with other products.  I have ZERO cuts from this trimmer without a guard. I use on my eyebrows too. Can&#x27;t beat this for the price.</li>
            <li> Battery sucks, does not even last a whole shave. It seems like it doesn&#x27;t want to charge to begin with as the yellow charging light goes off rather quickly. If the battery was as good as other reviews say, then this would be a good trimmer, as it is mine is not useable.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers I have had. I have only charged it once and that was the initial charge out of the box. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Feels good in the hand and delivers a great shave! Also packs a lot of power along with its good design.</li>
            <li> I love this new version of the remington trimmer. It is very well built. I previously had a very cheap remington that had lived its life after many years of beard trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like all the adjustable sizes although I don&#x27;t think they equate to a standard size like at the barbershop. This model comes with three different trimmer heads. I read the book on them but to be honest, I don&#x27;t know whats different about them. Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a well-built, cheap beard trimmer. This is it.</li>
            <li> It pulls hairs. I tried all the extensions.</li>
            <li> Quality blades/head, and works wonderfully.  The metal heads make a big difference in quality.</li>
            <li> Works great. Watch out for the shortest cutter, it will tear your face up. The other 2 cutters are good though. The battery rocks! I can get about 2 weeks worth of use out of it on one charger!</li>
            <li> High quality. Works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve owned.  It appears to be more powerful than other razors I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but somehow a couple of the teeth broke off on the trimming head and I had to buy a second one.</li>
            <li> Works well but is a little large for beard trimming</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product! Not so much as to give it a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; but certainly a solid &amp;#34;4&amp;#34;! The different trimmer heads is a great idea, however I did make the mistake of using the wrong head to shave without the guard on to get really close to my skin. My old trimmer did that too and I love it! You just have to get the heads down and you&#x27;ll be okay! Last time I used it I used the correct trimmer head and trimmed my under pits and my neck with no nicks! The battery life I am not sure about I will have to use it more, but it is comfortable in your hands and is nimble not like my old Norelco!</li>
            <li> Yeah it works well whne it has power, however I have be unable to recharge the battery. So that&#x27;s kind of useless. So no I won&#x27;t be recommending this to my bearded mates. Has the form but not the function. Come on how hard can it be!!!!</li>
            <li> this works ok, pulled a few beard hairs at first but has stopped since then. Includes different metal shave heads</li>
            <li> As long as you let it discharge once in a while (I use it twice a week and charge it once a month) it works well, and after a year is running and hold a charge as well as day one!</li>
            <li> While this is not an electric razor, it is plenty sharp enough to shave a stubble look on my tough, course beard.</li>
            <li> I recently started to grow beard but wanted to trim it for that &amp;#34;Cool&amp;#34; look of a few days of stubble. This tool at a very reasonable price gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Remington beard trimmer for the past 25 years and when it quit, I was hoping I could find a like product, and I did. The Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer is everything I had enjoyed for so many years and more.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research looking for something to trim well.  I could not be happier with this unit. The charge has lasted for a couple of months with trimming on a daily basis.  Cut very well with no pull and the different blades makes the job easy.  Recommended</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  Goes almost a year without recharge. I have had it almost 2 years. Love it.</li>
            <li> Fits good in my hand. Seems to have plenty of power.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried the various heads yet but the beard trimmer does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;Would have given it 5 stars but my old Remington, and I do mean old, had a feature that vaccumed the cut whiskers into a holding pocket built into the unit which captured 99% of the clippings. The new ones do not have this feature which I sorely miss. Made clean up a breeze. But the new one works pretty good, just messy.</li>
            <li> Worked OK for about 6 months then stopped working.  It would just stall in the middle of trimming if I turned it a certain way.. That kind of hurts.. Would not reccomend</li>
            <li> This is my first beard trimmer, so can&#x27;t compare to any other products. Bought it because of the glowing reviews about battery life. Happy to report that it is doing a great job. I keep my beard trimmed down to the lowest level possible with the guard installed and I use it every couple of days.  I do take the guard off to trim the neck line -- here&#x27;s a tip: use the stubble trimmer if going directly against the skin. The coarser \\&quot;beard trimmer\\&quot; blade will bite into the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this Remington trimmer.  It&#x27;s easy to use and clean....  holds a charge for longer than any other cordless trimmer I have used.  The only drawback to this product....it has no stand with compartments for the extra attachments.  I was disappointed that item was not included.  That being said.....it is still a wonderful product and well worth the amount paid.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product, Very well made and seem to last long...</li>
            <li> Facial hair has been a hobby of mine throughout the years. More than that, I also cut my own hair.  So, I&#x27;ve become familiar with a wide variety of cutters and trimmers and suchlike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past fair while--well since I got married a few years ago--my hobby has become a bit limited.  It&#x27;s not only my face now.  Fortunately, my wife prefers the unshaved look and feel, but not so much the mustache or beard.  So, I keep some stubble, never shaving smooth, never letting it long enough to be itchy.  That means I trim it about once a week, sometimes more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an older set of hair clippers, with no guard. That has worked fine, but the battery is pretty old and it&#x27;s not quite as powerful as it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement, something that isn&#x27;t made for hair trimming and isn&#x27;t as narrow as most beard and mustache trimmers. This fits perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lithium ion battery keeps the battery charged for a long time, without loss of power when unused.  It&#x27;s quite powerful and cuts well.  The beard/mustache trimmer attachment is adjustable.  The other parts aren&#x27;t as much as attachments as different replacement blades which offer different levels of closeness/size. They aren&#x27;t adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I thought the stubble attachment was the way to go, only it ended up being a pretty close cut indeed Too close! It looked like I had used a cheap electric razor. The beard attachment actually made a better stubble.</li>
            <li> We purchased this for the ion battery which is working fine so far - we&#x27;ve had it for less than a month, but my husband loves it&#x27;s power and sharp precision.</li>
            <li> Great product I really like that these clippers can be rinsed off with water! Makes cleaning them much easier, all the real fine hair washes right out.</li>
            <li> I read all the bad reviews, but I bought this anyway. I figured &amp;#34;How bad can this be?&amp;#34; It&#x27;s...just as bad as they are saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for one week (like two shaves) and it worked wonderfully. And then, one day, my cat decided the shaver belonged on the floor. And after a three foot drop, it was. That was the end of my shaver. The adjuster piece broke so that I could no longer adjust the length of the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, this is just as bad as everyone says. I don&#x27;t know that there is anything better available, but that doesn&#x27;t make this piece of junk any better.</li>
            <li> Everything works as expected. I even dropped it once and it still woeks great. Blades are also in great condition.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome trimmer.  I charged it on the first day I got it (December 25th) and it still doesn&#x27;t need a charge in mid February.  The blades work well and I just cant find anything bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, does excellent job of maintaining the &amp;#34;3-day stubble&amp;#34; I was trying to achieve. My wife does not like beards, but loves the stubble look. This trimmer makes it possible to keep my stubble at the length she likes. Best part is the cost, a true value.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a beard any more, so I can&#x27;t comment on the beard trimming aspect, but I do still have a mustache that needs trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this trimmer works, it did a real nice job thinning out my mustache.  Starting from the longest setting and moving in, I never felt I was going to destroy my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t explain why it feels cheap to me, maybe too much plastic.  But this is about the only complaint I have with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer attachment took a few seconds to understand and set, but once I did, that is put it all the way on and use the dial instead of sliding it up and down (like my last trimmer), it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade is easy to remove (and reattach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> My husband has been complaining about how much work it takes to maintain his goatee. I was therefore relieved to give him this shaver for the holidays. His review is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: the battery life. Hubby used it several times before needing to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel-friendly: it&#x27;s cordless and amazingly lightweight, not heavy like his old Remington. He says it&#x27;s like holding a banana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades are easy to remove and switch: right now, hubby is only interested in the detail blade for his goatee but likes how easy it is to pop the other blades in if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to dial settings that lock: hubby says the nine settings are a bit much and can&#x27;t see that much difference between one level and the other. Still, he likes the fact that the wheel locks, ensuring that the trim length is consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: hubby says the plastic casing feels cheap. It&#x27;s lightweight but durability is another matter. Hubby thinks the titanium blades may outlast the shaver itself. However, the item comes with a generous 2 year warranty, which means it should last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to see numbers on the dial: hubby says he had to squint to see the numbers, so they could have been a little bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, he says it&#x27;s a good trimmer and just wishes it felt a little more durable.</li>
            <li> This is a good economical trimmer which is user friendly and not too expensive either. It doesn&#x27;t have too many fancy gadgets like some of the more expensive devices have nowadays but it does the job and does it pretty well. Recommended.</li>
            <li> The Remington MB4040 Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer produces a really smooth shave.  My husband says that it is better than any other beard shaver he has had.  He has had a beard for 32 years, so that is saying something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the adjuster built in is a more sturdy design.  Most other shavers, the adjuster is a plastic attachment which almost always breaks.  Being built it, looks like it will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way that they could improve the product would be to add a bag to hold all the little pieces that come with it.  We had to use one from a previous trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the lack of the bag, I would give the unit a 4.5 rating if it were possible; however, it is too good a trimmer to deserve a four star rating.  I recommend it</li>
            <li> Other than that, its OK</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product has so many good reviews.  I can&#x27;t get longer than 2-3 mins out of the battery fully charged .. not even exaggerating!</li>
            <li> I ordered this one in spite of reading some negative reviews. I had assumed that those people were just being picky. After receiving the item, much to my surprise, it appears that I am now one of the picky people. This trimmer for some inexplicable reason just doesn&#x27;t trim well. Numerous passes over the same area are required, and even then, a few stray whiskers will just sit there and laugh at you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is that the shortest setting is not short enough for a true short stubble look. I could have lived with a slightly longer beard, but the inconsistent trimming killed that option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sending it back to amazon. Thanks amazon for the excellent return policy!</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t have any major complaints. Definitely sharper than my old Norelco; I even managed to get a couple nicks trimming my neckline. This guy is powerful, and seems well built. It&#x27;s heavier than the old Norelco, probably because of the better battery. The dial to select a size is nice because it really keeps your setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the plastic comb a little annoying to attach - I can never get the grooves perfectly aligned. Also, I&#x27;m not a fan of the curved ergonomic shape - to me it&#x27;s a tad awkward, but not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve gotten over my concerns with the shape. The comb is slightly annoying to attach still, but overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This one is far better than other similar products that I have tried in the past. You can go for this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect, Quick, Easy, and ready to go right out of the package.  It made my ManBeard into AwesomeBeard. All the Lady&#x27;s Love it!</li>
            <li> I have gone through several trimmers over the last few years and none have been satisfactory. The Remington MB4040 is the first unit that both works well and is built to last. I&#x27;ve only used the unit for a couple of weeks, but so far it is excellent. Solidly built, easily adjusted, and great results. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is inexpensive, sturdy, well made, easy to clean and battery is just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it could give me a clean shave, but it is just a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> lots of power, smooth cut, long battery life, NICE trimmer. I always used cheap trimmers $15-$20 price range.  Cots a little more but oh what a difference in the cut !!! the small detail blade is great for eyebrows and ears too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an easy to use beard trimmer.  Holds a charge forever.  Cleaning is simple, the head just pops off and you can brush out the inside.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the purpose of keeping a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (around 2mm&#x27;s in length) but you can&#x27;t cut that short with this unit. It probably does a good job for longer beards but that&#x27;s not why I bought it so don&#x27;t expect to be able to keep your stubble trimmed short.</li>
            <li> Worked great and I got a close enough trim that I didn&#x27;t need to shave (which I hate). Problem is that this thing died on me today mid-trim. It sounded like the motor was going out. Tried using it with the charger and still nothing. Flipped the on/off switch many times but that didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it&#x27;s passed my 30 day window to return it amazon so I&#x27;m trying to get a replacement from Remington directly. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for decent trimmer from a while, finally I found this product. This product is excellent, trims perfect, battery life is too good. I highly recommend and you won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> This  shaver  is  very  light  weight  and  feels  cheaply  built.  It  was  noisy  with  a  small  vibration.&lt;br /&gt;The  shaver  is  large  in  size.  The  off /on  switch  is  low  on  the  handle  so  is  a  little  awkward  to  turn  off  and  on  with  one  hand.&lt;br /&gt;I  have  returned  this  shaver.</li>
            <li> This Remington Trimmer is awesome. It has a lot of power. So, it does not do the \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; of beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I should mention is, though it came with 3 trimming heads, I could not differentiate between the \\&quot;beard\\&quot; head and the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; head, both of them looked exactly the same to me. May be, they made a mistake while sending it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that, it is a great trimmer. It met my requirements and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> This razor cuts nice. It has multiple settings and 2 other cutting heads.</li>
            <li> It  it a great beard trimmer the only thing that I could see going wrong is the adjustable part breaking if u drop it or something but all and all a great beard trimmer haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my son a couple of years ago and he loved it. That is until he dropped it in a sink full of water.  He had been wanting another one and then this one became available and he is a happy camper again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as trimmers go, this has got to be the best for the price and the performance of the trimmer.  It is easy to clean and to switch out the headers with no muss or fuss.  The battery only takes a short time to charge up but the best part is the charge lasts a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature of the trimmer is the size and shape of it.  Most men have larger hands and some trimmers are too small and are awkward for men to us.  The Remington is perfect for the size of a man&#x27;s hand so they can manipulate the trimmer to where they need it.  It does a great job and I have recommended this trimmer to others and so has my son.  You will not be disappointed with this trimmer even though there may be other trimmers a lot more expensive.  This is the one to buy!!</li>
            <li> I was actually looking all over the place for this am so happy I found since it&#x27;s amazing and i love having a beard it&#x27;s freaking awesome:P</li>
            <li> Best buy ... thoroughly recommended ... Excellent product. Delivers what it promises</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first 9 months...I&#x27;m lucky now if the run time lasts for 5 minutes on a charge.</li>
            <li> Works very good just wished to would collect the trimmings. It has 3 different clippers so it does everything I want it to do. I got this at the end of April and now its July and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet so I think battery life is very good.</li>
            <li> After just 4 months this device cannot hold a full charge. The trimmer completely depletes itself during one session and to make matters worse, plugging it in does not allow the device to run on AC power - it still uses the battery! A huge design flaw. Really disappointed with the Remington MB4040.</li>
            <li> Handy and works. Cordless is neat and size works with small bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> It was good enough -- cheap and flimsy but got the job done -- when I first started using it, but 8 months later it won&#x27;t hold a charge long enough for even a quick beard trim.</li>
            <li> Garbage!  This razor broke within only a few months. My husband doesn&#x27;t even use it that often but it won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. What junk!  Sorry that we bought it and since we only have a 30-60 day return window we are now stuck with it.  So disappointing!</li>
            <li> Garbage. It pulls your hair out rather than cutting it.</li>
            <li> Finally society has caught up with me. I had a stubble-beard before it became in vogue. This is a great machine. It keeps the stubble at a specific height-range from 1 to 9. Comes with various cutting heads and keeps an electric charge for a long time (saves energy) without a reduction in cutting power. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  It comes with three different shaving adapters.  Good for facial grooming, notgood for a full a shave. The battery fried after a few months.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge great and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned!!</li>
            <li> Battery didn&#x27;t last. It was great at first, but now that I&#x27;m almost at a year I can&#x27;t finish shaving beard on single charge.</li>
            <li> Works great although it does not like really thick/long hair. Perfect for grooming/trimming, not so great for cutting significant length. It will do it...eventually.</li>
            <li> Never very comfortable. Seemed to tug at my beard with painful pulled hairs rather than an efficient trim. Ultimately the head fell apart after 3 months of intermittent use. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend. It&#x27;s cheap, but I would go for a higher quality shaver next time since in this case it seems like I got what I paid for...not much.</li>
            <li> I wish I could have given this a four, or even a five star review, but after almost exactly one year of use, the battery is almost completely dead. I get a bit less than full power for about 20 seconds, and then it slowly fades for another 40 seconds or so, then it quits. So there&#x27;s why it&#x27;s at three stars (maybe 3.5 would be more fair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this battery situation, I really liked this trimmer. I&#x27;ve only had it grab a couple times, and the length selector stays where it&#x27;s set. I really only use the basic tip and plastic guard, but it&#x27;s been good enough for my simple needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy another one, though. $40 a year seems a little much for me.</li>
            <li> I am spoiled. I brought this in to use for my shortly kept neat beard, I have an old Remington MB 300 that works fine after, this will be a guess, 10 or so years. Problem is that one of the plastic pieces that goes over the blade has chipped off and I am not feeling comfortable depending on this. I have spent far to many hours on line researching clippers, I tried the TRYM11, did not come close to being able to clip my beard, nor did this clipper at the lowest adjustment, where the MB 300 really does and I use it on number 2 for my beard and 3 or 4 for mustache and sideburns. So the 4040 while probably a very suitable clipper just does not clip short enough, and I am not a stubble guy. Good luck in your search if you are like me, I narrowed it down to a Norelco that starts as low as .5mm and the Conair iStubble. I have brought in the iStubble and have tried it quickly once, you have to be careful not to keep it on the default and very low setting but it has a wealth of settings and trimming my beard will not be an issue at all with this.</li>
            <li> I actually use this on my little Lakeland Terrier who need constant close trimming around her eyes.  It is quiet so it doesn&#x27;t scare her, and clips quickly an easily.  The small head is just right for tight, delicate areas.  The light weight and slender shape make the shaver easy for me to handle.</li>
            <li> This is a great medium sized trimmer. It is very powerful, hold its charge for a long time and is very easy to use. It has a built in adjustable trimmer gauge that allow you to easily adjust the closeness setting. You should be very happy with this unit.</li>
            <li> I have a thick, wiry beard that needs constant maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer whips through that tough fur, doesn&#x27;t bind or snag.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charger for over 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;Length-wheel adjustment is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY wish I would have is for a vacuum stubble-catcher like my old trimmer had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it hihly.</li>
            <li> Not a powerful as it could be.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheaper trimmer from a Walgreens, it was OK. Then, I felt like it wasn&#x27;t trimming as well anymore. So I bought another one of the same. Again, it was just OK. But when I saw this item on sale, I had to give it a try - now I think those other trimmers were not even up to the standards of OK - This guy is quick, easy and rechargable. I&#x27;ve used the included extra blades to help shape my beard, and I&#x27;m amazed there is such a difference.</li>
            <li> I had one of the old remingtons (Remington MB300DT/2 Titanium PrecisionPro) for almost 4 years and finally the guard height adjustment mechanism broke. So I decided to stick with the brand I knew and buy this.&lt;br /&gt;First the pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life has so far been nothing short of amazing&lt;br /&gt;- The blade swap is way better than having that horrible pop up fine trimmer in the old one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The grip is horrible. The old remingtons had a rougher grip so the hand wouldn&#x27;t slip. This is also seen in with the power button which is metallic and slick and my finger keeps slipping on it.&lt;br /&gt;- Just cannot use this without the guard - it keeps making me bleed all over the face from the nicks. Over 4 years I didn&#x27;t get a single nick from the old one.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not seem to cut as well as the old remingtons with the guard on. Needs about double the number of passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I wish there was a model that just stuck a Li/ion battery into the Remington Titanium Pro - this feels like a step back in design and function. At least the height adjustment works, but I wanted to replace the old trimmer, not keep using it for close trimmings and this one for adjustable trimmings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got about 5-6 uses on this thing so far. It works well, feels sturdy in the hand and delivers on its value in my opinion. One small gripe would be that it takes numerous passes to get my stubble-style beard to look even without any random long hairs. That being said, I&#x27;m keeping it as it performs much better than the cheaper beard trimmers out there.</li>
            <li> if you want a close shave, a very short beard i doubt this is for you. i have to run over my face with the attachment off to get a short cut, i wish i could cut a little shorter with the attachment, but oh well. the battery was the selling point for me, my old one died while i was using it every time. this one its been two months and i havent charged it at all. IDK where the charger is even.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved, here are the reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Easy to use: This is the first electronic shaver device I have ever had and since the first use got the results I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Quick charge: Got to use it right out of the box and fully charged really fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Variety and options: The trimmer comes with three different blades, really easy to change&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why no 5 stars? a case!!! if the manufacturer had added a case for the trimmer, the blades and the charging cable I would give it 10 stars!</li>
            <li> Great Trimmer, versatile with the 3 different blades and various setting heights.  Replaced a Wahl and provides a cleaner, neat cut.</li>
            <li> having had several beard trimmers over the years, i can state confidently that this is, by far, the best.  fast, comfortable.</li>
            <li> Initially, I loved this trimmer. The trim head was easy to replace, the trimmer length was easy to set, and it was light yet sturdy. One year later, it won&#x27;t hold a charge. I charge it fully, and it is lucky if it can make it through one trimming of my beard.  UPDATE: I contacted Remington directly, and they sent me a replacement unit. I appreciate their responsiveness, and I didn&#x27;t expect a whole new packaged unit, just a battery. I still wish the original battery had worked better.</li>
            <li> Battery life is great but no attachments like WAHL products normally include. Things like nose and ear trimmers, attachments for sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li> good but snipped someones neck! likes it...would recommend, just would like to know how to adjust it in the directions.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it. has all the trimmers that he needs. Only down fall is there is to much plastic and not enough metal.</li>
            <li> This was my first beard trimmer purchase, since I&#x27;ve only had a beard for a two months.  I had been trimming my beard with hair clippers at first, and finally decided to try something designed for beard trimming.  Maybe I just don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing...but it seems like the trim is very uneven around my chin and jaw.  The guard seems to bend really easily, so mabye I&#x27;m just unevenly applying pressure while trimming.  I&#x27;m actually using my hair clippers again to trim my beard.  Even though I can&#x27;t get as specific with the guard length on them, they give an extremely consistent and even trim across my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the battery life, I did use this beard trimmer multiple times without having to do a single recharge, so I have zero complaints on the battery life.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this as a gift for Christmas and it works great. It has plenty of flexibility as to the depth of the trim. Good product.</li>
            <li> Worked only for a week on an initial charge and then just stopped working as it would not charge. May have been a faulty device. Remington usually make reliable products. Quite disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Used it one time before the battery failed. It did not hold the original charge, and could not be recharged.</li>
            <li> lightweight, well made, feels good in the hand and has a long lasting lithium battery. have only had to charge once in 6 months (use 1-2x week). interchangeable heads are a nice bonus, good for detail work. the adjustable guard works great. a huge improvement over the cheap wahl i used before. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great product, great price. dial in your personal &amp;#34;hey, i didn&#x27;t shave (because i&#x27;m creative/outdoorsy/apathetic/lazy) level for the day and fine tune the areas you do want to refine. it&#x27;s light, easy to handle, multiple heads and the battery lasts forever. i love this product.</li>
            <li> charger spoild on first day, batt charge for 2 days can use max 10 mins then need to charge.&lt;br /&gt;please check the review before buy.</li>
            <li> 6/19/14&lt;br /&gt;Update 2:&lt;br /&gt;Well, the company was kind enough to send me a replacement blade, complementary. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/4/14:&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for 4 months so far. It&#x27;s nice and portable--both lightweight and wireless. The battery life is great. Even getting it in from the factory, I went for a long time without having to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing is, I discovered about 3 teeth on the stubble blade broke off, and I only use this thing once a week at most. Now I&#x27;m wondering if I want to pay another $8 for a replacement or try the other blades first.</li>
            <li> Worked so good the first time, my beard never got out of line again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good product, battery lasts a long time and the trim tool things are good too.</li>
            <li> Better than expected !</li>
            <li> Worked better than  advertised. Great service from vendor</li>
            <li> I was impressed by how long the charge last on this, and its also easy to switch clips.If o r when this stops working, Im going to buy another one. because its  the best trimmer Ive owned , by far.( I&#x27;ve owned about ten of them.)</li>
            <li> Works great, I&#x27;ve been using for over a year now. Still going strong.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast. I gave it as a gift and he seemed to like it.</li>
            <li> The guy who used this really liked it.  He has a goatee and has had trouble keeping it trimmed, but found this product to work wonderfully.  It as simple to use, easy to clean, and cut evenly.  The battery life is great and he would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I am using this trimmer almost 7 days per week, and it&#x27;s been excellent. The battery really lasts a lot. It&#x27;s possible to select the size of the beard with 9 selectable positions in the trimmer, and various intermediate sizes in between those nine. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After trimming my beard with the MB4040 people thought I had had my beard professionally trimmed, a comment I never got after using a different trimmer (a Wahl model)for years. Even my grandchildren, ages 2 and 4, commented that my freshly trimmed short beard felt smoother after I trimmed it with the MB4040, a comment they never made after I&#x27;ve used other trimmers that leave my beard feeling \\&quot;scratchy.\\&quot; Using this trimmer results in a neat, clean, fine-grained trim with all the trimmed hairs even in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like my cordless Wahl, the MB4040 has a rechargeable lithium ion battery. I&#x27;ve owned the Wahl for 5 years and the battery continues to recharge, hold a charge and work like new, so I consider it a real plus that the Remington MB4040 has the same type of battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MB4040 has nine length settings which give users an excellent range, especially compared to trimmers that only allow one to choose between very short, medium and relatively thick lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a well priced cordless trimmer that works very well for me.  Love the power and sharpness of the blades.  Love, love the cordless feature and the long lasting battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the holidays, I let my beard grow out longer than I usually do, I then proceeded to use this product to trim my beard at many different levels.  Like a transformation every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I just used the trimmer to keep a long beard well trimmed.  I found the plastic head and the beard adjustment to be easy and intuitive.  Though I thought the number readout (as you adjust the beard trimmer length) was so hard to read as to be useless.  I kept trimming my beard shorter and shorter after a week of leaving it long and found the trimmer worked very well at a short trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no issue with taking off the plastic piece to trim around the edges of my beard (saw some reviewer complaining about cuts... no cuts here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, I tried the no plastic piece trimmer with a different blade to get the stubble effect... didn&#x27;t look good on me (still no cuts) so I ended up starting over again and growing out the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall.. its been fun.  It is nice to have a good beard trimmer now.</li>
            <li> Before: I was always complaining to hubby that his beard was just so messy. I understand that he wants to grow it out but I still think that it should be well kept and trimmed. Plus since hubby works in retail his appearance matters and having a really shaggy beard (picture the wolf man)in my opinion is not the best look for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now: His beard is trimmed down on the sides and at the chin it is groomed at the length at he wanted. His mustache is now not all over his top lips and overall his appearance is very well kept. In fact he has had so many compliments about his trimmed bread that he now wonders where this trimmer has been all these months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the trimmer: He thought the instructions to use the trimmer where very easy to follow. Charging and battery life are long lasting as he really took his time with his beard and had no problems with the battery. In fact the next day he went a little bit closer on the sides and the battery was just as strong as before. Cleaning out the trimmer was very simple, even when removing a lot of hair. What he really enjoyed about it was the fact he could set so many different sizes for beard length. On the sides he wanted a more rugged look (but clean) and in the front he wanted to keep his length. Not only did this trimmer provide him the ease of switching between lengths but it really helped with cleaning up the front of his beard. Plus he says it does it fast so he can keep up with his look even if he doesn&#x27;t have much time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I am thrilled with this trimmer because that means the Wolf Man has left the building and in his place is a much cleaner looker hubby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Remington!</li>
            <li> A very good product - just not what I needed. It&#x27;s great for clipping hair and shaving down to a stubble but I had hoped it came with clipping attachments for beard styling.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He was tired of keeping up with the different combs that his old one had so I found this all in one for him and he loves it!</li>
            <li> in general I like this product. It has a strong motor and cuts nicely. My only complaint is having to switch heads for different cuts. The regular blades are much to heavy to use for gentle trimming like on top of my bald head. I have to switch to the lighter blade. But all in all, it provides an excellent cut.</li>
            <li> This is just what we were hoping for for a trimmer for my son&#x27;s use, which is to keep his beard at a tidy length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. My son especially likes the scroll feature that allows length adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;2. I also think the different attachments are a win, and that this should be handy for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;3. I think it&#x27;s an attractive device.&lt;br /&gt;4. Love the rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. I wish it had come with a bag to keep all the pieces from wandering off.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he&#x27;s only really used it for a month now, but so far he really likes it and it seems to work well and was exactly what he needed (right now he has a full beard and wanted this to trim it). I&#x27;ve only heard good things about Remingtons. I just hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This item works beautifully</li>
            <li> Bought this in December and I use it 2 or 3 times a week... haven&#x27;t charged it since the initial charge in December! Great product!</li>
            <li> Works as expected and a good reasonably priced replacement piece.  If that&#x27;s your goal, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming my mustache &amp; goatee.I even use it to shave, gives the stubble look.</li>
            <li> This little shaver works fine for trimming beards or sideburns and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> The snout on this thing is very poorly designed. With the guard in place, the clipped portion of the hairs VERY quickly build up on the blade head. This makes it very difficult to do more than minor trimming. I have pattern baldness, left with only the ring, and I like to use a trimmer like this to do my hair. But this thing builds up so quickly that I had to go over my hair three days in a row to make sure I didn&#x27;t look like an idiot. My old Remington, that would no longer hold a charge, cost me much less and did a MUCH better job. I wish I could have this battery in that trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is my second one...The first one only lasted 8 yrs., and you can&#x27;t do better than that. If u need a trimmer, this is it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent mustache and beard trimmer, and it has two separate attachment cutters for different uses. I like Remington products, and this is a top-of-the-line unit!</li>
            <li> A little too loud; otherwise best I&#x27;ve tried - I&#x27;ve tried em all!!!</li>
            <li> The think is high powered, long lasting battery, price is right, no complaints.  Watch out thought because at first it can cut your neck as you have sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li> My son research several items online and decided this was the best. A quality product that does the job very nicely!</li>
            <li> Finally! NO MORE BATTERIES!! Self lubing, self sharpening, 9 adjustable positions. AND THE PRICE IS AWESOME!! DOESNT GET BETTER THAN THIS</li>
            <li> I used it once or twice and then I shaved off my mustache and beard for my wife&#x27;s birthday.  A yearly occurance.  It worked like a charm until then and I still use it for sideburns.  I&#x27;ll have to get back to you on that when the facial hair returns next winter.</li>
            <li> Gives a very smooth shave and easy to handle. Blade is sharp so must be careful not to press too close to skin.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t have a pop up/out sideburn/edge trimmer.  It does come with three different blades though.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacment for my old Remington trimmer.  I have only charged once since I got it (2+ months ago) and it still operates at full-speed.  I probably use twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about nicks &amp; cuts based on other reviews, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any (yet) and hopefully won&#x27;t!  I am extra careful (probably due to the comments I read), but so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/10/13:  The initial charge lasted me about two months, using once to twice per week.  Still very few nicks or cuts, despite all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I too want to jump on the \\&quot;this product is not good at all\\&quot; bandwagon.  I have been very impressed by the strength of the MB-200 but it seemed to run out of batteries, and then not hold charge after a few months.  Which was a big disappointment- I think it is discontinued but you can still find it on Amazon. I bought the mb4040 thinking this was a successor to the mb-200.  This is just not strong at all.  Maybe my hair is too thick, I dont know, but I could not get the power needed for a good trim.  It just seemed weak and their shortest trim(with attachment) was no where near short enough.  All in all a disappointing product.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Remington model I&#x27;ve had for a few years. Works well, doesn&#x27;t pull. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with battery life, and I don&#x27;t charge it very often. Overall pretty pleased with it. Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I used a Remington trimmer before and this trimmer pretty much does what I expected it to. The guided lock-in settings are great if you grow long beards or (in my case) want to trim your sideburns to a desired length. I have used the trimmer for one month with no complaints with the blade quality. The real kicker however is the lithium ion battery. I have been using the trimmer for more than two months now, using it about thrice a week, and I HAVE RECHARGED IT ONLY ONCE SO FAR, which was when I received the product and  had to charge it completely for the first time ! I haven&#x27;t recharged it since and the battery still continues to drive the blades fast. I expected the charge to last a while, but this has left me quite surprised. If you, like me, forget to recharge the battery on your trimmer every few days and wake up to find the trimmer not working, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/22: I lost my charger about 8 months ago and I charged the trimmer about a month before I lost the charger. But I am using the trimmer to this day, without having charged it once over the past 8 months, and continue to use it twice a week. The battery is a beast!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; safe for use</li>
            <li> It does not trim a mustache closely enough.  I question whether it was designed to actually do it.&lt;br /&gt;Is their an alternate that you can suggest?  I would happy to return the original and replace it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Engle</li>
            <li> Used only once for complete, short haircut and longer, shaped beard trim.  Quiet running but it did get hot against my skin.  I have used two previous models of this trimmer and this one is by far the best.  Yes, I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Seems to hold a charge for a long time. Haven&#x27;t charged it for a while and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer for my husband and he loves it.  Shaves closely and my husband is very happy with this product.  Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a very clean cutting trimmer.  Only 1 or 2 swipes are needed to straighten the mustache.  Keep a steady hand, or you&#x27;ll alter the landscape in a hurry!</li>
            <li> Does the job and apparently holds a great deal of power since it took more than 2 hours to run down so I could recharge it as you need to do periodically.</li>
            <li> For everything this trimmer does and features, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money. I had absolutely no problems changing blades, using the removable comb, or charging the unit.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son. Very easy to use and it gets the job done. Recharger works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth buying.</li>
            <li> I have had many, many trimmers since I tried shaving as a kid. the concept of rechargeable and trimmer never worked out well until now. The trimmer works great. Weather you want that 2 day beard or want to groom up the wild beard you rock to keep your face warm or to be the lasted hipster icon. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would</li>
            <li> This trimmer is simply great. I have been looking for a nice trimmer for a while and this one does the job very well. It won&#x27;t pull any hair and give a smooth trimming. The this trimmer has got the best battery compared to other trimmers I&#x27;ve used. It can certainly hold the charge for months. I would recommend this product to all. This was the best investment in trimmers I did so far.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will.  Trims your beard and mustache quite well.  I have a fairly short beard and use this twice a week. I went from August 2012 to March 2013 without once having to charge it.  Great battery life.  Plastic guard looks kind of cheap, but hey it works.  Highly recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> AND it was less expensive!  Every year or two I go through the process of finding another beard trimmer.  I didn&#x27;t want to shell out $50-60 for one, so bought in the $20-30 range at the store.  I will no longer have to shop around!!  This is it.</li>
            <li> I have been a avid regular razor user sense I was a lad.  Just not long ago I was getting fed up with the razors, Lather, Shave, and possible accidental nicks. So I bit the bullet after looking at some grooming razors and decided on the remmington here,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta say watch what setting you use, i thought setting two was going to leave more then it had, So do a small number test beforehand if you like some gruff to your beards. It also worked surprisingly well on the ol&#x27; stache as well.  It&#x27;s functioned as promised and I have yet to have a problem. If I do I will change this heading.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer overall.  Especially the dial feature which adjusts the trim length without having to swap attachments.  The only issue I have, and it is fairly minor, is if you plan to do detailed trimming, it is not that great.  For example, I needed to trim around my teens ears for his ROTC regulation haircut which requires no hair touching the ear.  The blade position is not very good for detailed trimming such as this.  The smaller blade that is include is also awkward to use for many applications.  Had to use my old Norelco which I never really cared for.  But it was better designed for detailed trimming.  Overall, this is a good trimmer and is powerful and sharp enough and should last a while.</li>
            <li> It is efficient and great for sideburns and goatee. What I like best is that loose hairs do not stick to the handle - I had a pervious trimmer that had a soft rubber type grip that trimmings stuck to like glue.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Norelco T990 with this Remington since Norelco doesn&#x27;t make that model anymore (I tried another Norelco model first and it was really bad). I&#x27;m glad I did. This is a quality beard trimmer. The settings are easy and it is powerful. Yes, you have to go over your beard several times with it. But, I find that to be the case with all of the beard trimmers especially around the chin. No complaints here. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I even bought a second one.</li>
            <li> Construction is a bit on the light side when compared to my 3 year old Remington titanium trimmer. But battery life is good and there have been no pulled hairs. Multiple head are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Well \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; is apparently a thing now and some women expect it.  A recent girl I&#x27;ve been dating requested I trim my pubes so I accommodated.  Well it works.  I decided not to make a video review since that would be inappropriate.</li>
            <li> Working great...easy to use</li>
            <li> Until now I would buy cheap trimmers that I would have to replace at least once a year. When my last cheap one broke, I knew it was time to actually drop some money on a trimmer. I did my research and decided I wanted to get the Remington MB4040 without looking at the price. So I looked it up and it just so happended to be on sale the day I bought it. So I bought the best trimmer I could find for the price of the cheap trimmers I was buying before. It has been great for me. It has great power and glides across my face smoothly.</li>
            <li> This has a smooth and powerful motor and cuts very precisely. I have a rather full beard at the moment, but to keep it&#x27;s shape I only need to make a few passes with the correct setting. Also good for a little over-the-ear and sideburns trim. I don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; look, but I&#x27;m sure this would work perfectly for that as well. A high quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have had Wahl beard trimmers for years. The build quality has deteriorated over the years so I&lt;br /&gt;was looking for something new. The Remington trims accurately every time is easy to adjust, and&lt;br /&gt;changing cutting heads is a snap. I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> worked great for a year then the battery life went downhill quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this back in January and charged it when I took it out of the box. I have only had to charge it once since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite features is the adjustable guard. It slides off to clean and the blades come out easily (I have some difficulty putting the blades back on since they have a weird angle, but that may be just me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard itself is sturdy, but has some give and has smooth edges. No more feeling like the guard is trying to cut your face off with sharp edges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read in another review about it pulling hair. I had no trouble up until the last month or so. It seems to be that if you try to cut off too much (by letting your hair get too long and then trying to take more than 1/3 of an inch or so it does pull some, but that seems to be the only times it is an issue.)</li>
            <li> Never was able to charge up the battery, so never got a chance to use it. However, I was able to return it and get a full refund - thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Replaced a 25 year old AA model with this. I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t shave on a schedule, so when I&#x27;m shaggy this gets me ready for blade or foil. This also has a nice dial for the adjustable hair length comb. Much better than a handful of clip-ons.</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer.  So far I have not had any problems with it.  Seems to hold its charge for several weeks.  We shall see how long the battery lasts.  My last one (an older model Remington) died after about 2 years of normal use.</li>
            <li> This sucker is nice.  It does the job well without being too fiddly.  The charge lasts longer than my previous trimmers and the blades do their job nicely.  My only complaint is that my old trimmer required a small amount of pressure to get a complete cut when trimming my neck.  This trimmer doesn&#x27;t require that at all.  In fact as I&#x27;ve learned the hard way, any pressure at all and you may cut yourself.  Just be careful when switching from an older trimmer to this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this beard trimmer about 3 weeks ago.  I read a lot of the reviews on this and similar products and after a while the old adage that &amp;#34;you can&#x27;t please everybody&amp;#34; seems as true as ever.  This is a great trimmer and the battery runs strong and lasts a long time (still working from my initial charge).  The battery performance alone makes trimmer worth buying.  Add to that the easily adjustable depth gauge (just one so you don&#x27;t have to manage a collection of 8 different attachments).  It runs long and strong, is stylish and does it&#x27;s job well.  Just buy it and unless you are in the &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll bet I can find something to complain about&amp;#34; crowd, I think you will be as satisfied as I am!</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimer for my husband several months ago and he has had no problems with it at all, he likes the fact that is more powerful than his previous Remington and does hold a charge for a long time. The only negative is that it does not come with a stand, but he was able to use his old one to hold the trimmer even though it will not hold the attachments.</li>
            <li> I rarely write a review although I purchase often on Amazon.  I feel obligated to say something this time.  Like some other reviews on this trimmer I had it for a year, actually less, when the battery stopped taking a charge. I tried a couple different methods to see if I could &#x27;restore&#x27; the battery&#x27;s ability to hold a charge, but without success.  What is irritating is that  And I had followed the user&#x27;s manual direction and fully discharged the device after six months and recharged for 24 hours.  It worked fine afterwards but in less than 12 mos old it no longer holds a charge and operates for only a minute or two before dying.  Very disappointed and I assume it is the lithium battery.  I previously had Remington NiCad battery trimmer and it lasted for years.  Recommend to everyone that you stay away from Remington Lithium models and stick to NiCad versions.</li>
            <li> I received it today, a day earlier than promised. I was a little worried after reading some negative reviews here. The package was not hard to open, the unit is solid, not flimsy and it worked well right out of the box. The attachments are very easy to remove and install. It does the goatee trimming very well. My old Remington was dying, so I got this. It&#x27;s like night and day. Just be careful the first time you use it. It cuts very well.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. Exactly what I wanted for my beard upstairs and downstairs. The power is great, and so is its precision.</li>
            <li> I use to have a Panasonic trimmer (THE BEST). When I decided to get a new one I got this one. every time I use it I end up with several scratch marks and bleeding spots although using the protection cap. Another thing you CANT trim/shave on zero level, the blades will cut through your skin (happened to be the first time).&lt;br /&gt;I wish payed more for another panasonic trimmer!!</li>
            <li> as the headline says, this thing has an outstanding battery life, doesn&#x27;t overcharge, and has very high quality, and easily interchangeable, blade heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i only knock it a star because the length guide&#x27;s connection to the device is a liiiiiittle flimsy. sometimes you attach it and move from 1 to 2 and the guide doesn&#x27;t move. at longer lengths it&#x27;s more responsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and be careful when the guide is absent.. i cut myself where my skin was a little wrinkled (no, not there). strong blades!</li>
            <li> I had an epic beard that needed to come off and these clippers chewed through it like a beaver in a pine forest. Solid build, great battery life, and very sharp blades.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I just finished a quick trim about 20 minutes ago and thought that I should update my review to reflect the additional six months since I began using the trimmer. Really, just a reiteration of what I wrote earlier in the year: hands-down, without question and undeniably the very finest beard trimmer that I have ever owned. In the six or seven months that I&#x27;ve owned this Remington trimmer, I have only charged it once. Trimmers that I&#x27;ve owned in the past – Panasonic, Norelco, etc. – couldn&#x27;t hold a charge for two weeks, much less six months. I don&#x27;t know much about Remington but the user manual is great, as is the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can highly recommend this trimmer to any of my fellow bearded comrades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forty years ago when I first became serious about growing a beard, I don&#x27;t believe that there existed anything like a &amp;quot;beard trimmer&amp;quot; – I just used a comb and sharp barber&#x27;s shears. Some were plug-in models and some were battery operated. Some were better than shears and a comb and, as the years, they got better but not perfect. As my Panasonic trimmer, purchased three years ago, was no longer holding a charge, I came to Amazon and started shopping. When I came across these Remington&#x27;s, I read quite a few of the reviews and was intrigued by some of the features. I had owned, it seemed, everything but a Remington brand in the past. So I purchased it (I actually purchased two, one as a gift). And it has been far better than any purchased previously. The strength of the motor is better than any battery charged unit that I&#x27;ve used previously, the blades much, much sharper. I&#x27;ve only used it three times in the past two weeks, but the first time was on my beard that hadn&#x27;t been trimmed in over four months (long story there) and, after getting rid of all that rubbish, actually getting some shape into what was remaining and using the bare blade to get rid of the stubble so that I could partially shave a bit of my neck and cheek so: and all that in the first go with the device. So far, no more charges needed, and I&#x27;ve used it weekly just to keep things in shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous beard trimmers have lasted from one use to three years. I&#x27;m betting that this device will outlast that three-year mark. I simply could not be more pleased with the craftsmanship, the ease of use and the results. I hope, however, that I never have to tackle another four-month growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well - two years and five months have passed and I&#x27;m still using this trimmer, every week or so, and it continues to work splendidly. With so many men&#x27;s grooming devices available now it has become more difficult to choose &#x27;the best&#x27; amongst the many. I will not say that this Remington brand is the very finest of the bunch but, for me, it has proven to work very well. Yes, I made the foolish mistake of using the standard blade directly on my skin and, yes, I had four distinct wounds and a bit of blood gushed from each. I am a stubble-faced now, after 40-years of being the full-beard type, and I have to say that the slight beard is so much cooler in the hot summer months. I am still a very pleased user and certainly recommend this trimmer for any man with the slightest facial hair that needs to be tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer continues to be the very best that I have owned. Someone (and I don&#x27;t know who) slipped another brand&#x27;s trimmer into my bathroom mirror and I (mistakenly) gave it a whirl: do you wish to see the photos of my toilet-papered face? Well, I&#x27;m not posting any!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should I run across any trimmer claimng to be better than this Remington or claiming to be better than any trimmer available, then I would certainly try it. But for the present, I&#x27;m sticking with my Remington.t in the first go with the device. So far, no more charges needed, and I&#x27;ve used it weekly just to keep things in shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous beard trimmers have lasted from one use to three years. I&#x27;m betting that this device will outlast that three-year mark. I simply could not be more pleased with the craftsmanship, the ease of use and the results. I hope, however, that I never have to tackle another four-month growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well - two years and five months have passed and I&#x27;m still using this trimmer, every week or so, and it continues to work splendidly. With so many men&#x27;s grooming devices available now it has become more difficult to choose &#x27;the best&#x27; amongst the many. I will not say that this Remington brand is the very finest of the bunch but, for me, it has proven to work very well. Yes, I made the foolish mistake of using the standard blade directly on my skin and, yes, I had four distinct wounds and a bit of blood gushed from each. I am a stubble-faced now, after 40-years of being the full-beard type, and I have to say that the slight beard is so much cooler in the hot summer months. I am still a very pleased user and certainly recommend this trimmer for any man with the slightest facial hair that needs to be tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer continues to be the very best that I have owned.

But for the present, I&#x27;m sticking with my Remington.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product. It functioned as intended and performed as advertised. After using a Wahl for many, many years, I needed to upgrade to something that was new, sharp, wouldn&#x27;t grab my mustache hair, and would cut cleanly and thoroughly through my goatee. This product did that, so I&#x27;m happy. Haven&#x27;t used the two additional blade attachments yet, so may update this later.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the power, sharpness, shape, design, plastic guard, Lithium battery, and especially the thumb roller adjustment for blade height/depth. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for my personal grooming needs. Good job Remington! Recommend.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well and comes with 3 blades.  There are 9 preset depth settings.  The lithium ion battery holds 120 minutes of run time before needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li> Much easier to provide shape to my beard or moustache with this beard trimmer.  Great product and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works great cleans up easily,&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had a carry case</li>
            <li> Still kicking it years later! Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> 14 years ago I tried my first Remington with the easy adjustable length (it was a twist adjuster).  The problem with the new model is that it snags my beard several times each shave.  I have not had this problem with any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned, including my original Remington shaver 14 years ago.  Something in the design of the new head causes it to snag in medium length beards (5 on the dial).  If I knew this beforehand, I would have chosen something else.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Product has plenty of power to cut through anything and hasn&#x27;t had to be recharged after several uses.</li>
            <li> completely agree with the comment of Seth A. Zehler. This item is not good for closer cuts. i dont know how it works for longer hair, but even having the trimmer run 10 to 15 times over my face it leaves lots of unevenly cut hair which is very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 24.05.2013 (from two stars to four): all in all, this trimmer does the job. i guess any and all trimmers need to be moved over the face area several times - it&#x27;s not the issue of this particular trimmer. complaint about inability of low cut still remains and plastic comb is not steady enough - it bends as u push trimmer against the face. and you cant avoid applying at least some pressure in order trim normally. guess like u just need to get used to... not bad trimmer with some improvements required - mainly concerning plastic combo, its regulation and fabrication material.</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer I ever bought.</li>
            <li> I love the battery life of this charger.  Others have ran out of power before a task was completed.  this one works for a long time with no perceived reduction in power or cut quality.</li>
            <li> Trimmer cuts fairly close to the skin, but the guard is too big, even on the lowest setting, especially if you want a shortly trimmed, but still visible beard</li>
            <li> Replacement for 10 year old Remington. Love it! Cuts great, very powerful, stayed charged for over three weeks before first recharge.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a beard trimmer. It was tired of using hair clippers. The Remington MB4040 does a nice job and the battery seems to be holding up well. The trimmer attachments, adjustments, and etc are easy to use and to clean. I would recommend this product to any guy who sports facial hair. I should have purchased a cool trimmer like this years ago.</li>
            <li> Once you charge this it works for a really long time, countless beard trimmings, at least several dozen.  However, it does pull hair on occasion, plus you have to go over and over every area to get an even shave.  Other trimmers i&#x27;ve had trim much better and faster, altho the cordless batteries last only through 1 trim.</li>
            <li> Another excellent product. This is the 4th trimmer I have used. I have had it for a couple of months and still have not recharged it, and it does not pull the hair in my beard like so many other trimmers do. Does need its own storage stand.</li>
            <li> A very nice improvement over the older model i had that recently stopped working.</li>
            <li> After having owned trimmers before, I like this trimmer better than anything I have owned. Holds a charge a very long time. It is simple and does a great job. Very easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> Very nice and simple to use.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer. Couldn&#x27;t live with a beard without it.</li>
            <li> The first one of these I got worked like a charm for close trims (it was confiscated by TSA so I needed to buy a second). The second cut my skin every time I used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for everyday shaving</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular brand/model when a previous Remington model (which I had owned and used practically forever) finally failed to keep a charge. My experience with this newer model (MB4040) left me asking that age-old question -- why do manufacturers insist on &amp;#34;improving&amp;#34; products that already work just fine? The MB4040 didn&#x27;t require recharging as frequently as my older model, but other than that, I don&#x27;t have much good to say about it. It proved less easy to clean, it didn&#x27;t trim nearly as well, as now (after using it for little more than half a year) the blade has broken, forcing me to purchase another trimmer. This time around it will not be a Remington.</li>
            <li> remington special puted in the product box 120 wolt adapter, i did not know this end swiched this in 220 wolt, end adapter did break.... this is  ...   T H E  C H E A T I N G  .....</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened - but I purchased this a little over a year ago and it has completely died.  I did like how it held a charge for a very long time, and I rarely had to charge it, but just recently, I went to re-charge it, and stayed on for about 5 seconds and just dies with the switch still in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position.  Seems like something may have come loose as it works when you hold the blade facing up, but if you flip it upside down, it dies.  Un-usable.  It is only about $30 though - but not sure it&#x27;s worth investigating a fix - or just buying a new, better one.    UPDATE:  So within hours of posting the review above - Roseann at Remington responded to it and asked me to reach out via email or phone to discuss.  By the next day, she&#x27;s sending me a brand new one and a pre-paid shipping label to send back the old one.  THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Thanks, Remington!    So yes - battery died after a year - but that&#x27;s pretty incredible that they&#x27;re taking care of their customers this way.  Well done.</li>
            <li> The MB4040 model replaced my older Remington that I used for 15 years. For the 15 years I used it I never nicked my face or had a hair yanked not even one time. Now I can&#x27;t even get through a trim without having a few hairs yanked, which hurts. Last night I nicked my earlobe and was left with a piece of dangling skin in blood. This item is garbage.</li>
            <li> On time exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Great buy, but I don&#x27;t have a thick beard.  Charge it maybe every few months.  Love that it&#x27;s water proof!  FYI, pretty much only good for facial trimming, really nothing else if you know what I mean...</li>
            <li> love all the settings but stoped being able to hole a charge after about 2 months</li>
            <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve owned yet.  Accurate control and long life between charges.</li>
            <li> The battery only lasted 5 months. After it is fully charged, it only lasts a few minutes. The trimmer is fine enough for the price, but the battery is terrible. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I looked and looked for a electric trimmer before finally settling on this Remington (which was in many ways similar to my old Norelco that is still being used by my son).  I am satisfied with it and like the removable adjustable guide, which makes cleaning easy.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric mustache trimmers for over 30 years and this is the best one I have had. The lithium ion battery only needs charging every 6-8 weeks. Along with the price this is a great value.</li>
            <li> After extensive research I finally went with the Remington Trimmer.Works great and has a loooooooong battery life compared to other trimmers.Cleans easily too!</li>
            <li> Appears to be well made with good trim lines but this product is not for people keeping thin/fine beards . I have an older version MB 85 which has lasted me for years and also has the mustache trimmer which this model lacks. When I use the setting #2 or #3, it simply does not work. I made multiple passes without success. I even tried the goatee blade but that didn&#x27;t help me either.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product for people wanting the stubble look. Had to return the product.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple weeks , I think that it is a very nice groomer and works great for what I use it for , and that is trimming after a haircut or goatee trimming , and would work great for other areas . The only problem with the trimmer , is the plastic adjustment attachment that determines the depth of the cut . It is a little bit cheap and seems to be the first thing that would wear out . It slides down the sides of the trimmer and locks in place , but it needs to be removed for close trims. It will eventually wear out from the constant removal.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that , there is no problem with this trimmer . Much stronger and holds a better charge that any other that I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li> This trimmer offers excellent value, with two extra trim heads, sensible design and good battery life. Compared to fancier and more fragile products, this was a real relief. It does not offer easily clogged vacuum features, and thus is a good choice for beards that have gotten too long and need a \\&quot;brush cutter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My husband had the same problem others did with the model which preceded this one - after 2 years of use, the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge. Got him this one hoping the rechargeable lithium battery wouldn&#x27;t have that issue. Time will tell. I was a little concerned when I read some of the reviews which mentioned how it felt in the hand and pulling of the hair, but he seems 100% satisfied. I held the trimmer, and it seems well balanced, and his beard looked GREAT after he used it - not too short like it sometimes looked with the other model. I think this is a wise purchase, especially if you&#x27;re looking for a nice Christmas/Hannukah gift for a man in your life! For the money, it&#x27;s a beautiful item.</li>
            <li> I have this and the older (and cheaper) MB-200.  But because I have a short beard, I find myself using the MB-200 more because the plastic guard allows for a closer cut.</li>
            <li> The blades themselves are fine, but the plastic mounts that hold the blades are apparently fragile. The mounts on my beard blade failed after about a year, making the entire blade useless. I visited Remington&#x27;s website and they wanted $7.99 + tax and $5.99 shipping to get a replacement. $15 is exactly half of the cost that I paid initially for the trimmer itself. No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Remington. I am cutting my losses and trying someone else.</li>
            <li> The most noticebale first impression offered by the Remington MB4040 beard trimmer is that its motor is powerful enough to provide a very clean cut.  The second thing I noticed, though, is that the plastic guard that comes with the trimmer does not have a setting that works well for those wanting to keep their beards relatively short.  I found, however, that it is still easy enough to get a smooth, even trim by using the trimmer without the guard in place...so that works out OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am particularly pleased that the trimmer is powered by an ion lithium battery that provides up to two-hours of usage time without requiring a recharge.  Too, this type of battery does not suffer from a stubborn memory problem and can be \\&quot;topped off\\&quot; whenever the mood strikes without eating into the number of recharges older-style recharables are capable of taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning: the three detachable heads can be taken apart for cleaning or resharpening but they are much harder to get back together than to take apart.  I inadvertently disassembled the underside of one of the blades and found it difficult to get the clips high enough to put things back together.  In fact, when using one of the other heads as a \\&quot;guide,\\&quot; I managed to push that one out of place, too (Yeah, I know...it&#x27;s me).  But with a little patience, they do go back together so, if this happens to you, don&#x27;t give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the light weight of the trimmer, not having to use an electric cord, and the specialized uses of the blades included with the trimmer.  This is my third trimmer in roughly 10 years, and it will probably be my trimmer-of-choice for a good while to come.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Whal Groomsman. This Remington trimmer cuts much better and the trim height setting works great. I like to keep my beard tight to my face and this does it nicely.</li>
            <li> This was a great trimmer (especially for the price) but after just over a year, it died.  The battery seems to have stopped charging.  I got very light use (once a week or so) and, frankly, infrequent charging for that reason.  But the last few weeks it has gotten weaker and weaker before finally refusing to charge at all.</li>
            <li> I chose this trimmer because it seemed a good balance between quality and low price.  I have been quite satisfied.  The charge lasts a long time, it cuts nicely, and seems durable.</li>
            <li> I have now used this trimmer for over a year and I am completely satisfied with it. I use it to trim my beard and mustache. The different blades interchange easily and I am amazed by how long the battery lasts. It was a replacement for a previous trimmer with older battery technology and it performs 100% better.</li>
            <li> I needed a trimmer to cut the very short hair on my head, and this was perfect answer. It&#x27;s a solid trimmer, with accurate, visible adjustment settings and lots of power. I finally charged it after about 5 haircuts, as I felt it was time, but not because it was showing any signs of slowing down. The plastic, multi-length attachment comes on and off easily, so I can adjust for different lengths on the side and back, then take it off to buzz the top of my head. it&#x27;s wide enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like a beard trimmer and does the job quickly and easily. I don&#x27;t use any of the other accessories except the blade cleaning brush. I had a Remington for many years prior to this and was quite happy with it. The technology has obviously improved and I&#x27;m very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Did what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> I got this model for a few reasons: 1) The adjustment wasn&#x27;t a cheap plastic guard, it uses Li-Ion batteries for long run-time and quick recharge and 3) it was a reasonable price. While I can see the price almost doubled in the two weeks since I bought my trimmer (shame on the seller!). I am very picky when it comes to my electronics and health products, so it says something that I am very pleased with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like the best is that since the guard adjustment is in the trimmer itself, it is extremely sturdy and there is no way it will slip out of your desired guard number. The blades themselves are also very heavy-duty and feel like they are quality made. It powers through beard hair easily and is really easy to clean. I charged it out of the box and have used it twice for my face and armpits with no loss of power. My old shaver couldn&#x27;t even make it a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only warning: I don&#x27;t think Remington means for you to use the beard blade directly on your face, only with the guard on it. While I don&#x27;t go for the stubble look, I run the trimmer blades over my face directly instead of actually shaving since my skin is sensitive. Using the &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34; blade ended up with a few cuts on my face and neck because of the wider-pitched teeth on the blade. A few days later, I re-shaved with the &amp;#34;stubble trimmer&amp;#34; blade and had no problem. It actually cuts pretty close itself. Mark the stubble blade because the only difference between it and the beard blade is how far apart the teeth are on the blade itself. I don&#x27;t plan on using the beard blade directly on my face again. Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s a slick device, feels like a quality device, and hopefully will last me a long time. Don&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34; blade on bare skin or you will end up nicked and bleeding.</li>
            <li> Iuse this shaver not for a beard but for my hair so this review is based upon mostly hair and some facial hiar. I charged this trimmer and it ran for almost 2 months being used 2-3 times a week to cut hair. The only downside is that sometimes the attachments feel flimsy but they will last.</li>
            <li> I got this for my bf and he loves it. He said it trimmed evenly, it felt great on his face, and gave him a smooth trim. He said the attachments were easy to remove too. He said it was a little heavy but nothing he can&#x27;t handle. I&#x27;d recommed this to all the ladies trying to find their guys the perfect gift!</li>
            <li> I have only used twice, so far so good. no issues. I will take more time before being able to give a good review.</li>
            <li> i like it&lt;br /&gt;this is my first experience of shaving at home&lt;br /&gt;I use this machine remington&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a great&lt;br /&gt;Priced very appropriate&lt;br /&gt;nice</li>
            <li> Have yet to have to charge this...lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Bought it to upgrade the battery, but I prefer the old one with the nickel cad battery better in terms of shape and ease of use.</li>
            <li> Nice feel, comb does not allow for close shave and trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco I had  a wider range. seem sto be very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Also liked that it came with the extra shaver heads and they were a nice heavy quality metal. Not like some of the other brands where the whole thing just feels cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Good job and a great price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with dial in trim height.  Take the trim guard off and it becomes a precision trimming unit for jaw line and mustache definition. Unit also holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> Could not be happier.  Would recommend to all of my friends and family. This is a great buy for sure.</li>
            <li> Works better than my previous trimmer, a more even trim without having to go over and over and over for  fifteen minutes this trimmer does it in about five minutes, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Trimmer worked well for about 4 months.  Then, as experience by many other reviewers who gave the trimmer 1 star, the trimmer stopped holding charge and eventually died.  It&#x27;s a good trimmer when it works, but its life is too short.  Poor way to spend $30.</li>
            <li> I really like several features of this trimmer. I find it very easy to adjust the length by rolling the adjustable wheel. The number displayed also lets me know what length I want for different uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Easily Adjustable&lt;br /&gt;+ Numbered Length&lt;br /&gt;+ Cuts Easily and Does Not Pull Hair&lt;br /&gt;+ Great Battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Curved Shape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this trimmer for maintaining simple beard lengths. Other trimmers provide many attachments for other purposes. I do not consider this trimmer multi-purpose. I would recommend looking elsewhere if you want a muli-purpose trimmer. The curved shape feels very strange and it makes it difficult for me to trim with precision. I like everything about this trimmer and would give it 5 stars but I give 4 stars because of the awkward shape.</li>
            <li> Clean cuts, long battery life - have used it once a week (2 minutes per session) for 3 weeks, still going strong, have yet to charge the battery.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable trimmer guard works fine, a little cumbersome reattaching as there are two groves which must be aligned - not a big issue mildly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer operates at a seemingly high RPM which generates more noise than anticipated - would not operate if someone was sleeping in the next room.&lt;br /&gt;Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a really good beard trimmer.  I don&#x27;t keep up with my beard much and don&#x27;t do fine detailing but want a nice fast cut when I do trim and this does the job.</li>
            <li> I have to admit the product is a very nice trimmer and since it is a Remington I expect it to last a good long time. The extra blade attachments are going to come in handy where others just have one fixed blade and you must either rely on a steady hand and a comb. The adjustable length attachment on the MB4040 is a nice feature as it just take a little dial to change the height so it should be the same each time.&lt;br /&gt;Alright, those being the Pro&#x27;s here come the Con&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through quite a few beard trimmers generally stepping up in price or brand and have used Remington products in the past; this, however, is the first one I&#x27;ve ever purchased that didn&#x27;t come with at least a small vile of blade oil. The MB4040 comes with several attachments and yet there is nothing to put them in to store them nor to keep them all separate and protected during travel. It comes with a nice long charging cord but no stand to put the trimmer on and yet in the &amp;#34;warnings&amp;#34; it makes certain to tell you NOT to get it wet, especially while charging, so it&#x27;s expected that just placing it on the side of the bathroom counter is protection enough. Not everyone that purchases this has a big fancy house with an abundance of bathroom counter space. In this aspect of the Remington design teams infinite wisdom they really dropped the ball. Would it have cost them so much more to create a small tray of some kind so the unit could be stored safely in a drawer or to travel with? At least they could have supplied a plastic cap for the spare blades and a bag to keep everything together.&lt;br /&gt;That is my reason for the 4-stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> Bought this because the battery on my last trimmer was dying.  Hopefully the lithium battery lasts longer (no memory effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use all 3 cutters and they all work great.  Stubble trimmer is fantastic for when I don&#x27;t feel like shaving (most of the time).  I use the other cutters for goatee (length 4) and mustache (length 2).  Been using it for a month (about twice per week), and I haven&#x27;t had to go over my facial hair multiple times, nor have I needed to recharge the battery yet.</li>
            <li> Takes way too many passes over my beard to actually trim it.  The plastic attachment is way to difficult to put on and it also very bulky when trimming against my beard.  Also, this has 9 length settings but on mine length #2 doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is acceptable</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace another Remington whose battery stopped taking a charge.&lt;br /&gt;It seems that they could make them so that the batteries can be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;This unit works very well, and doesn&#x27;t spread whiskers all over the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;The previous trimmer had a collection system that only half worked.&lt;br /&gt;the new with no collection chamber the whiskers just fall down into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that it does not stand up in my medicine cabinet. A flat bottom or a stand would be a help.</li>
            <li> Was great while it lasted but it broke after a few months of use. I purchased it a long time ago but am just now writing the review. I got one for my dad also and his still works so I suppose it&#x27;s hit or miss. But while it worked it was perfect. The plastic guard thing is more of a gimmick than actually useful though.</li>
            <li> After having a great experience with the previous model, I thought it would be a no-brainier to get the newer one with Lithium Ion batteries, but I was wrong. I chose to ignore the negative ratings that mentioned uneven trimming for close shaves thinking it would be a user error. Unfortunately, I have the same experience (I use setting 1) and am not happy with the trimmer at all. Wish I had bought the older model. Bottom line: If you like close trims don&#x27;t get this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to shave down to stubble level, and it&#x27;s fantastic.  I put the stubble blade on, set it to the closest setting, and I get a great, easy shave that leaves me with what looks like 1-2 days of stubble growth.  I had a Phillips stubble trimmer before this, and really liked it, but I like this one even better because it&#x27;s more powerful.  I shave once a week, so when I shave my whisker growth is significant, but this trimmer cuts right through, easily.  With the Phillips I&#x27;d have to go over things several times, but this gets everything the first time.  If you&#x27;re looking for a stubble trimmer I&#x27;d definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer.  Comes with three different attachments (cutter blades) for various situations.  I like how they are easily changed by  a simple snapping mechanism.  It has a powerful motor and the battery life seems to be good.  Solid construction; doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  Great quality.  If I had to buy another trimmer, this would be it.    Update October 31, 2014.      So I have used this trimmer for about 1.5 years.  It performed flawlessly until one day, it suddenly wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  I could let this thing charge for several days and it would only run maybe 30-60 seconds.  Not enough time for me to do what I had to do.  So I contacted Panasonic to claim a warranty on this item, because it came with a 2-year Warranty.  They promptly sent me a new one and asked me to return the old one via a prepaid mailing label.  Received the new one two days ago.  Top notch customer service on part of Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I love remington products and had been holding on to my old shaver long past when I should have for fear of not liking anything else. This thing is awesome. The interchangeable heads just pop right on and off without any screwdriver or anything like it kind of looks like.</li>
            <li> Normally I purchase Norelco products, but have always bought Remington trimmers. Finally with a Lithium Ion battery it runs forever before needing a recharge. Full charges takes 8 hours, but a use in the morning and I simply leave it on charge for the day till I return. Great form and function. Trims neatly and precisely, and even tough enough to handle my son&#x27;s trucker gnarly beard. Great buy and a great value.</li>
            <li> after about a year, it doesnt hold charge anymore</li>
