            <li>Loved this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even feel the need to use the balm afterward but did anyway just for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, it did not.</li>
            <li>Luckily it worked great for removing hair on my top lip.</li>
            <li>I read tons of reviews, seeing so many people saying they have sensitive skin, but that this product was awesome.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t allergic to any of the ingredients, because I made sure and called my doctor.</li>
            <li>I have found it works BEST when left on for 8-9 minutes.</li>
            <li>BUT, better that than a mustache, I always say. :)</li>
            <li>I really wish I could say something good about this product, but I just can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would advise you to stay away from this product unless you do fine with Nair, etc.</li>
            <li>By this point I felt like this really was an amazing product.</li>
            <li>really really smal, always check sizes but perfect for last minute inconvenience!</li>
            <li>Even the cool water was unbearable on the skin.</li>
            <li>I wish I had a good experience with it, but definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews that made it very clear that you must follow the instructions WORD FOR WORD, so</li>
            <li>So now, here I am with a red burning face, now slathered with antibiotic ointment and still with as many hairs as I started with.</li>
            <li>First of all:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because it had been recommended with rave reviews from a group of people who claimed to have highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>pretty much painless&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I was ready to try it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>So much pain.</li>
            <li>My skin is left feeling smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to leave in on your face for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>but I bought it for a family member that has a little fuzz on the top of this person&#x27;s lip.  </li>
            <li>Thinking this would be normal as the cream is suppossed to have some chemicals.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Do not use this if you have sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll regret it!</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions step-by-step, the test patch was perfectly fine, and only left it on my upper lip and chin for 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;+ worked on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>But as I started taking off with a soft cloth, I felt as if I was peeling a layer of my skin.</li>
            <li>My whole face (except the forehead) was blood red!!!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After trying several different products, I finally found one I am loyal to.</li>
            <li>so I can only use sensitive products and this one was recommended to me by an aesthetician.</li>
            <li>It actually did just the opposite and irritated my skin so much that it turned red and bumpy after the second time using.  </li>
            <li>I dabbed a little at first to my upper lip expecting it to burn.</li>

            <li> I have PCOS and have to shave every single day.</li>
            <li> The only issues I&#x27;ve had is when recovering from a cold, it really breaks out the area between my nose &amp; upper lip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ minimal smell&lt;</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> Also, I never had reaction to any other creams I used before I waited for 5 minuted and started wiping is as per the instructions that came along with the product.</li>
            <li> It takes about five minutes and it gets deeper to the root of the hair, versus other products, and leaves no scars.</li>
            <li> Works well and minimal fuss and mess.</li>
            <li> Have noticed softer and less hair regrowth</li>
            <li> Was skeptical after reading previous reviews as i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Waited a few seconds..still not even a tingle.</li>
            <li> because it is just as harsh.</li>
            <li> I thought since the hair removal cream is designed specifically for face it will not be harsh.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This product is way too harsh.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The red flaky skin is peeling, leaving behind dark brown spots!!</li>
            <li> my upper lip did start to sort of tingle and become uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I usually don&#x27;t even use the aftercare balm.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to try this product because of a terrible reaction to Nair years ago, but again, being desperate I finally gave</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work as well as I expected - it did not remove all the hair despite applying it twice as directed.  </li>
            <li> The nerves of trying it for the first time are the worst part of this product.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and in pain at the same time.</li>
            <li> I hate that it gets stubbly hours later</li>
            <li> And the calming balm made the burning even worse.</li>
            <li> Do NOT leave it on longer than they say - you&#x27;ll be sorry.  </li>
            <li> Well, unfortunately, this product did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> It actually burned horribly while it was on my face!</li>
            <li> ** bad.</li>
            <li> My lip stung and it made me look like I had really bad acne.</li>
            <li> but the stinging is quite painful from what I have heard.</li>
            <li> I am terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wonder if I can get a refund....  :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t base your judgement of this product on your experiences with Nair or any like product</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple of minutes with the cream on, my lip started burning real badly!</li>
            <li> And the cream smells awful!</li>
            <li> burned me so bad!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It got here on time but I dislike it... the smell,the redness, no hairs removed</li>
            <li> I do not used this personally but I bought it for a family member that has a little fuzz on the top of this person&#x27;s lip.  The product works but not after a stinging sensation that tells you to take off the cream.  The stinging is enough to deter you to want you to use the cream again.  I gave it 3 stars because it does remove facial hair but the stinging is quite painful from what I have heard.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because it had been recommended with rave reviews from a group of people who claimed to have highly sensitive skin. I have PCOS and have to shave every single day. It&#x27;s embarrassing and unsightly. I hate that it gets stubbly hours later and I wake up with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I should have known better than to try this product because of a terrible reaction to Nair years ago, but again, being desperate I finally gave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hopeful! My spot test turned out great, no irritation, etc. So I was ready to try it. I dabbed a little at first to my upper lip expecting it to burn. Amazingly, it did not. So getting braver I went ahead and applied to my entire upper lip area. Waited a few seconds..still not even a tingle. By this point I felt like this really was an amazing product. I finished the application and waited 7 minutes. Around 5 minutes my upper lip did start to sort of tingle and become uncomfortable. I thought, no problem, I will go ahead and take it off from my lip. When the 7 minutes was up, I removed from my chin. As I was removing the product from my face that is when the burning started and then my face was red as a coke can. By the time I was done I felt like my face was on fire. I was thinking to myself that maybe a little redness and burning was the price to pay for hairless skin only low and behold I had the same amount of hair as when I started!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. So now, here I am with a red burning face, now slathered with antibiotic ointment and still with as many hairs as I started with. At this point I can&#x27;t even remove the hair with a razor. I am terribly disappointed. I would advise you to stay away from this product unless you do fine with Nair, etc. because it is just as harsh.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Was skeptical after reading previous reviews as i have sensitive skin. Luckily it worked great for removing hair on my top lip.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Have used it for years for around lips. Started to use on chin and cheeks and it works great. No lingering smell, no rash or discomfort. Honestly, I usually don&#x27;t even use the aftercare balm. Very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> First of all:&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. I can&#x27;t even use any soap but Dove on my skin, so I was reluctant to try this product.  I had used Nair years ago on my legs and it burned to no end, so the thought of putting that stuff on my face terrified me (that&#x27;s what she said). But I went ahead and tried it anyway. I read many reviews that made it very clear that you must follow the instructions WORD FOR WORD, so I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it on the area below my ankle and accidentally left it on for 20 minutes (whoops!). Since that didn&#x27;t do anything to my skin, I figured &#x27;why the heck not.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only was it painless, but the smell was minimal to none. All the hair above my lip disappeared with one swipe of the damp towel I used to remove the cream. I didn&#x27;t even feel the need to use the balm afterward but did anyway just for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT WAS GREAT. I&#x27;d definitely give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ pretty much painless&lt;br /&gt;+ minimal smell&lt;br /&gt;+ worked on my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;+ removed all hair from upper lip area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The nerves of trying it for the first time are the worst part of this product.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t base your judgement of this product on your experiences with Nair or any like product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ginger so I can only use sensitive products and this one was recommended to me by an aesthetician. I followed the instructions step-by-step, the test patch was perfectly fine, and only left it on my upper lip and chin for 6 minutes. Some of the hair is gone, but the blasting chemical burn is unbearable and looks bonkers. So much pain. I can&#x27;t even put make-up on over it, it hurts so ***** bad. Just don&#x27;t do it. DON&#x27;T DO IT.</li>
            <li> really really smal, always check sizes but perfect for last minute inconvenience! saves your life!</li>
            <li> This cream just burn my skin.  I tried others Gigi products before and they are just the same garbage. Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work as well as I expected - it did not remove all the hair despite applying it twice as directed.  The hair grew back as though the product had not been used.</li>
            <li> I thought since the hair removal cream is designed specifically for face it will not be harsh. I started off with a patch test on my jaw. Not reaction so I went ahead and applied it to my entire face.  As soon as I applied I started having the burning sensation. Thinking this would be normal as the cream is suppossed to have some chemicals. Also, I never had reaction to any other creams I used before I waited for 5 minuted and started wiping is as per the instructions that came along with the product. But as I started taking off with a soft cloth, I felt as if I was peeling a layer of my skin. My whole face (except the forehead) was blood red!!! Even the cool water was unbearable on the skin. It felt like 2nd degree burn. I tried ice pack, lactocalamine lotion, and burn relief gel, but, nothing helped except diaper rash cream!!! Yes, surprisingly it reduced the burning sensation. To add to it, the cream did not not any wonders as listed on the package. It has been a week now. The red flaky skin is peeling, leaving behind dark brown spots!! Please, please do not use the product even if the patch test does not show any reaction. You are better off with hairy skin then brown, spotty skin !!!</li>
            <li> I really wish I could say something good about this product, but I just can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten this product to use for my upper lip. I read the directions and followed each step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of minutes with the cream on, my lip started burning real badly! And I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin! I still waited until my time was up to wipe it off. I studied my upper lip in the mirror. No hair had been removed. At all. I was disappointed and in pain at the same time. I was in pain because the skin on my lip was red and blotchy! My lip stung and it made me look like I had really bad acne. I wasn&#x27;t allergic to any of the ingredients, because I made sure and called my doctor. And the cream smells awful! Wasted my money. I wish I had a good experience with it, but definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Works well and minimal fuss and mess. Have noticed softer and less hair regrowth</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use to remove facial hair. It takes about five minutes and it gets deeper to the root of the hair, versus other products, and leaves no scars. My skin is left feeling smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Works great!  No negatives to report.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and I thought it was for legs lol</li>
            <li> This is a refill.  This works good.  I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful.  Do NOT leave it on longer than they say - you&#x27;ll be sorry.  Just sayin&#x27;....</li>
            <li> I would give no stars. DO NOT BUY!!!! burned me so bad!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, it did remove the hair.  Yes, I understand beauty is pain.  If you don&#x27;t mind searing, skin melting pain, than I guess this is for you.  This product is way too harsh.  Won&#x27;t use this again.  Beware.</li>
            <li> After trying several different products, I finally found one I am loyal to. I have found it works BEST when left on for 8-9 minutes. The only issues I&#x27;ve had is when recovering from a cold, it really breaks out the area between my nose &amp; upper lip. BUT, better that than a mustache, I always say. :)</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful about this product as I have had a recent burst of facial hair within the last few months.  Well, unfortunately, this product did not work for me.  It actually did just the opposite and irritated my skin so much that it turned red and bumpy after the second time using.  I ended up having to go to the dermatologist for a prescribed cortisone RX to kill the inflammation and hopefully the discoloration.  I wonder if I can get a refund....  :(</li>
            <li> Works great I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Just be careful not to leave in on your face for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. My skin hates everything except water. I read tons of reviews, seeing so many people saying they have sensitive skin, but that this product was awesome. Well, it removed the hair, but severely burned my cheeks. I did this about 4 or 5 hours ago and my face is still on fire. It actually burned horribly while it was on my face! And the calming balm made the burning even worse. Do not use this if you have sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll regret it! I hope these burns don&#x27;t scar &#x3D;,(</li>
            <li> I did not like because he burned my face nor removes hair, but hair is cut and burn the skin and makes it red not advise one Bstamalh for he does not function on facial hair removal</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all.  Even left it on longer than what the directions read.  Waste of money.</li>
