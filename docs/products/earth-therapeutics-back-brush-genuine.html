            <li>- just marvelous!!</li>
            <li>PURE JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The brush in the picture has a handle that appears to be about 6 inches, and would have been perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>so I thought this brush would be great.</li>
            <li>The brush worked great, for 4-5 times.  </li>
            <li>The brush looks great as a wall ornament, but if you try to use it, it&#x27;ll just fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is very nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush and attractive but hanging it in the shower</li>
            <li>, it feels good and exfoliates well.  </li>
            <li>You know you have a good product by the amount of time you are using it.</li>
            <li>I like the brush, it does a good job.</li>
            <li>so I could take a good shower.</li>
            <li>The softness of the brush is great and very comfortable to use in every region of my body.</li>
            <li>Oh, and there is a nice loop on the end</li>
            <li>It was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li>Get a good scrub and clean feeling - just what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this brush recently and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is the best and easiest to use back brush!  </li>
            <li>The brush appears to be OK for those who can use it.</li>
            <li>This was a need that I put off getting for some time, but, so glad that I purchased this brush.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I did not use it more than fifty times .</li>
            <li>This is the perfect balance, length, and stiffness for my personal scrubbing needs!</li>
            <li>(Only those two \\&quot;issues\\&quot; keep it from being perfect).</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love the feel and</li>
            <li>so I will try to get one with a better shipping price.</li>
            <li>Never felt so clean!</li>
            <li>I am just glad that I do not have a huge cut.  </li>
            <li>Great length and shape and the hanging cord is a nice touch, also the bristles have great texture, but they started falling out at an ever faster pace after the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>This has to be the most poorly, cheaply made body brush ever created.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to handle, doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin and after having it for sometime time now, hasn&#x27;t shown any water damage.</li>
            <li>The plastic material might as well had been sand material at how easily it was coming off.</li>
            <li>I retired a bath brush that had provided more than five years of loyal service by buying this Earth Therapeutics brush.</li>
            <li>Cheap price, cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>It started to fall apart after just 1 month of light usage.</li>
            <li>I have OCD so getting clean in the shower with just a wash cloth never makes me content.</li>
            <li>Still, the brush is nicely made and it&#x27;s a relief finally to be able to properly clean my back.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to grip and just the right length for me.</li>
            <li>well the plastic cracked and good by bristles all over my back.</li>
            <li>It felt good on my back, cleaned well, etc</li>
            <li>Good thing I used American Express for this transaction since they have purchase protection.  </li>
            <li>The bristles and handle are of good quality, but when you put the item in your cart, it shows a different brush.</li>
            <li>, I now have the most beautifully clean back in the USA!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs to be somewhat more STIFFER.....</li>
            <li>dries quickly as well; would recommend it to others</li>
            <li>use it regularly and and very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this back brush.  </li>
            <li>Coupled with a nice scrub, this brush really softens up my skin, and helps reach the spots on my back that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to reach otherwise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know I have a clean back.  </li>
            <li>brush is wooden which is nice and the bristles are on a plastic piece.  </li>
            <li>My opinion is that most people would find this brush too soft.</li>
            <li>I used this back brush a couple times, and liked it.</li>
            <li>The brush is perfect for scrubbing:  not too stiff, not too soft.  </li>
            <li>I did get the right brush.</li>
            <li>So I jumped in the shower right after it arrived.</li>
            <li>It is soft, yet the long handle is great when alone</li>
            <li>The only thing that I wished that I have done is to buy an extra one because I really like this product and the cost is very fair.</li>
            <li>one year later with very light use if any the bristles are falling off and the plastic cracked</li>
            <li>Lather it up with some body wash and your back will love it.  </li>
            <li>The brush would be a better hair brush than a back brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, I know that is a lot to say about such a product, but I do!</li>
            <li>I threw the first brush out thinking that it was a fluke</li>
            <li>Absolute junk!</li>
            <li>The first few days I used it, I noticed a fair amount of bristles falling away.</li>
            <li>Well, I should have read the description more closely, because what I received was a brush with a handle that is 12 inches long.  </li>
            <li>There are no such brushes available at retail in my area, even in the large bed-and-bath stores.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic BACK BRUSH - along with the Loofa Brush</li>
            <li>and I had to throw the whole thing away.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product  because I wanted something that could help me clean my back.</li>
            <li>The brush I&#x27;m reviewing here is also not perfect, but it&#x27;s much more useful as the handle is nice and long.  </li>
            <li>The plastic bristle retainer cracks under normal use and the bristles fall out.  </li>
            <li>(I do plan on using it because for $7, it isn&#x27;t really worth sending it back).  </li>
            <li>And, by the way, if anyone does know of a good body brush, I&#x27;m all ears because it looks like all the ones offered on Amazon are poorly rated.</li>
            <li>A nice brush, but disappointing that it broke so easily.</li>
            <li>I only used the brush at most once per week, and it has always hung to dry on the wall (not exposed to the shower).  </li>
            <li>The stiffness/softness of this brush is just right for us for washing the back.  </li>
            <li>length is good but could be a little longer even though I am not a very tall guy.</li>
            <li>I am not tall, have delicate skin, and use this to scrub both my back, and, surprisingly to me, my feet.</li>
            <li>Although the listing did not give measurements, I know it is my fault for not demanding a length from the sellers before buying, but Most brushes I have purchased in the past were 16 to 22 inches.</li>
            <li>And with a large back (near 7ft tall), it gets a work out!!</li>
            <li>I am petite, so I was looking for a brush with a shorter handle since the back brushes available at the store all have long handles, which are cumbersome for me.  </li>
            <li>and it dries and is ready for the next time.  </li>
            <li>but overall it is very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>So much so that the plastic that cracked fell off and scratched my back.  </li>
            <li>Bristles went soft in no time.</li>
            <li>Once wet though, it&#x27;s great, just abrasive enough to clean but not harsh enough to be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that what you are buying is not what is currently shown in the product picture, and if you want a back brush with a shorter handle, this is not it.</li>
            <li>There is a slight curve to the angle of the handle and the length is just right to reach everywhere.  </li>
            <li>When dry, it feels like it&#x27;d be rough on your skin - pretty much like a regular loofah does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I contacted the seller for an exchange, and they just told me &amp;#34;no returns on personal items.&amp;#34;  The brush is clearly defective, and I will be filing a claim with my credit card company.  </li>
            <li>I assumed that because it was new it was simply shedding some stray, loose bristles...until I cleaned nearly a handful out of my shower.</li>
            <li>I have been able to find similar brushes online, mainly right here at Amazon.com; they have a proper brush head, with very stiff bristles, but their handles are so short that, for me, they&#x27;re nearly useless for those hard-to-reach areas of the back.    </li>
            <li>I am spending good money after bad by paying to returning it.</li>

            <li> I am spending good money after bad by paying to returning it.</li>
            <li> For decades, I&#x27;ve been searching for a back brush like the ones easily available in the 1950s and 60s, with a long handle and thick, stiff pig bristles.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are just right for me, not too stiff but stiff enough to get my circulation going.</li>
            <li> With a 4.5 inch grip that only leaves 9.25 inches to \\&quot;reach\\&quot; center.</li>
            <li> The brush was never dropped or otherwise abused, the only explanation I can come up with is that the wood block the plastic plate is glued to expands quite a bit when it gets wet which stresses the plastic to the breaking point.</li>
            <li> Extremely long handle for this brush as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the back brush I had previously owned is no longer available.</li>
            <li> I looked more closely at the brush and realized that the plastic base was disintegrating completely and releasing the bristles.</li>
            <li> but my personal taste is for something a little stiffer.  </li>
            <li> Not too rough.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble reaching my back and washclothes just didn&#x27;t do it</li>
            <li> my suggestion is not to purchase this product, it was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as if it was sitting in the wet</li>
            <li> I only rated mine a three as it has a crack in the wood already from getting wet and drying out a few times.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the other one will last a little longer.</li>
            <li> The handle might have been a little longer but this is not a major problem.  </li>
            <li> I guess only small people wash their backs.</li>
            <li> coming  apart when  he uses  it  other then that  said he likes it</li>
            <li> I have had brushes that are hard and scratch at your back, but not this one.</li>
            <li> With the price going down to 6.00 we just got another 6 in case they do break.</li>
            <li> I would wish for the bristles to be slightly stiffer and the brush itself slightly longer in length,... another inch or preferably two,...</li>
            <li> Within a week, the plastic that holds the bristles cracked, and it has lost half of it&#x27;s bristles.  </li>
            <li> Less than two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> My only quibble is that the bristles, though reasonably stiff, are not as thick and stiff as I would like.  </li>
            <li> I would have gave it five stars if the handle had been a little longer,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>

            <li> The stiffness/softness of this brush is just right for us for washing the back.  It has been used just 4 times, so don&#x27;t know about durability yet.  With the price going down to 6.00 we just got another 6 in case they do break.</li>
            <li> Feb 7th 2012:&lt;br /&gt;The brush is wooden which is nice and the bristles are on a plastic piece.  There is a slight curve to the angle of the handle and the length is just right to reach everywhere.  Now, for some the bristles on this might hurt - they are a bit stiff and pointy.  I like it, it feels good and exfoliates well.  Lather it up with some body wash and your back will love it.  Get a good scrub and clean feeling - just what I needed.  Oh, and there is a nice loop on the end so I can hang it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISED:&lt;br /&gt;12/30/12 - one year later with very light use if any the bristles are falling off and the plastic cracked - see my pictures posted.  This brush is going in the trash -</li>
            <li> It was nice while it lasted. It material that holds the bristles cracked and the bristles started coming out rendering this useless in just two weeks. Avoid this!</li>
            <li> The brush is perfect for scrubbing:  not too stiff, not too soft.  Exfoliates skin well and seconds as a back scratcher. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use it regularly and and very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not too rough.  It works like it should.  I only rated mine a three as it has a crack in the wood already from getting wet and drying out a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the really hard bristles that some brushes have so I thought this brush would be great. Unfortunately this thing is just too soft and does not provide a descent scrub, a shame.</li>
            <li> There is nothign \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; with the brush but my personal taste is for something a little stiffer.  My opinion is that most people would find this brush too soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush recently and I am very happy with it. The handle is easy to grip and just the right length for me. I would definately recommend it to those of you that can&#x27;t reach our backs anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the best and easiest to use back brush!  I have trouble reaching my back and washclothes just didn&#x27;t do it but with this brush no more missed spots.  Just hang it up and it dries and is ready for the next time.  Never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> Fantastic BACK BRUSH - along with the Loofa Brush, I now have the most beautifully clean back in the USA!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs to be somewhat more STIFFER.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise - just marvelous!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to open the package to know the brush was too short. It measures 13.75 inches tip to tip. I can reach the center of my back only by stretching my shoulder in a painful way. With a 4.5 inch grip that only leaves 9.25 inches to \\&quot;reach\\&quot; center. Although the listing did not give measurements, I know it is my fault for not demanding a length from the sellers before buying, but Most brushes I have purchased in the past were 16 to 22 inches. I am spending good money after bad by paying to returning it. Whether I get my money back or not I am still returning it. The brush would be a better hair brush than a back brush. I guess only small people wash their backs. The brush appears to be OK for those who can use it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, I know that is a lot to say about such a product, but I do! It is soft, yet the long handle is great when alone and no one is there to do your back for you! I have had brushes that are hard and scratch at your back, but not this one. You know you have a good product by the amount of time you are using it. And with a large back (near 7ft tall), it gets a work out!!</li>
            <li> This was a need that I put off getting for some time, but, so glad that I purchased this brush. It&#x27;s easy to handle, doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin and after having it for sometime time now, hasn&#x27;t shown any water damage.</li>
            <li> I just touched this brush with my fingers and thought \\&quot;how could anyone use this to bathe with?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> When dry, it feels like it&#x27;d be rough on your skin - pretty much like a regular loofah does. Once wet though, it&#x27;s great, just abrasive enough to clean but not harsh enough to be uncomfortable. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to scrub my back. What happened it feel apart and I did not use it more than fifty times . poor product quality!! for the bristles are connected to plastic and the plastic is nailed to the wooden handle. well the plastic cracked and good by bristles all over my back. my suggestion is not to purchase this product, it was a total waste of money. maybe I can use it to play ping pong, no just throw it out. PURE JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried two of these now and the second one failed one day after use.  The plastic bristle retainer cracks under normal use and the bristles fall out.  I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush and attractive but hanging it in the shower now I have to glue it back together.  It&#x27;s not as if it was sitting in the wet but I guess just having moisture around was not within its capabilities.</li>
            <li> The plastic behind the bristles cracked after a couple uses and I didn&#x27;t think anything of it, but it just kept getting worse and finally fell apart altogether with the bristles falling out.  I would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> The plastic base at the bottom of the bristles cracked after only a few weeks of use, despite the fact that I never dropped it or abused it.  Thus, the bristles started coming out and I had to throw the whole thing away.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brush.</li>
            <li> I used this back brush a couple times, and liked it. It felt good on my back, cleaned well, etc.. I dropped it in the shower, and cracked the material that seems to be some sort of ceramic, which holds the bristle plugs in position. One plug of bristles fell out, then another. I decided to stop using the brush before it fell apart. A nice brush, but disappointing that it broke so easily. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brush again.</li>
            <li> After about 6 weeks visible cracks formed in the plastic plate which holds the bristles, which started to fall out.  The brush was never dropped or otherwise abused, the only explanation I can come up with is that the wood block the plastic plate is glued to expands quite a bit when it gets wet which stresses the plastic to the breaking point.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect balance, length, and stiffness for my personal scrubbing needs! I am not tall, have delicate skin, and use this to scrub both my back, and, surprisingly to me, my feet.</li>
            <li> Great length and shape and the hanging cord is a nice touch, also the bristles have great texture, but they started falling out at an ever faster pace after the first few weeks. Try a different one.</li>
            <li> Product has fallen apart, the head cracked and the bristles just started falling out all over... even in places where the headpiece hadn&#x27;t cracked.  Extremely long handle for this brush as well.</li>
            <li> The brush is very nice.  My only two complaints --&gt;&gt; I would wish for the bristles to be slightly stiffer and the brush itself slightly longer in length,... another inch or preferably two,... but overall it is very satisfactory.  (Only those two \\&quot;issues\\&quot; keep it from being perfect).</li>
            <li> I have OCD so getting clean in the shower with just a wash cloth never makes me content. I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and unfortunately some of the bristles have flatten down but I love it. It gets the job done 100x quicker. Its a bit hard in the beginning but I let it soak to soften it up.</li>
            <li> For decades, I&#x27;ve been searching for a back brush like the ones easily available in the 1950s and 60s, with a long handle and thick, stiff pig bristles.  There are no such brushes available at retail in my area, even in the large bed-and-bath stores.  I have been able to find similar brushes online, mainly right here at Amazon.com; they have a proper brush head, with very stiff bristles, but their handles are so short that, for me, they&#x27;re nearly useless for those hard-to-reach areas of the back.    The brush I&#x27;m reviewing here is also not perfect, but it&#x27;s much more useful as the handle is nice and long.  My only quibble is that the bristles, though reasonably stiff, are not as thick and stiff as I would like.  Still, the brush is nicely made and it&#x27;s a relief finally to be able to properly clean my back.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this back brush.  The handle might have been a little longer but this is not a major problem.  The bristles are just right for me, not too stiff but stiff enough to get my circulation going. I also use it on my arms and legs and leave the bath tub feeling invigorated.  It&#x27;s nice to know I have a clean back.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, even a back brush can be faulty!  I bought two of these and the plastic that holds the bristles on both brushes has cracked.  I threw the first brush out thinking that it was a fluke but once I started using the second brush the plastic began to crack as well.  So much so that the plastic that cracked fell off and scratched my back.  I am just glad that I do not have a huge cut.  This is obviously a faulty production and the vendor is trying to dump them.  Amazon should not be selling this product!</li>
            <li> The brush worked great, for 4-5 times.  Then I started noticing bristles coming off, and upon closer inspection, I saw that the plastic holding the bristles was cracked and coming off of the head.  I only used the brush at most once per week, and it has always hung to dry on the wall (not exposed to the shower).  The soap I was using is standard body soap.  The brush looks great as a wall ornament, but if you try to use it, it&#x27;ll just fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller for an exchange, and they just told me &amp;#34;no returns on personal items.&amp;#34;  The brush is clearly defective, and I will be filing a claim with my credit card company.  Good thing I used American Express for this transaction since they have purchase protection.  I will no longer purchase anything from this seller.</li>
            <li> got  in  time  just like they said  the thing is  got for son and he just told me that the handle  keeps  coming  apart when  he uses  it  other then that  said he likes it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;company delivered on time  and  don&#x27;t blame them for the handle problem</li>
            <li> I bought this product  because I wanted something that could help me clean my back. I love the feel and length is good but could be a little longer even though I am not a very tall guy. The softness of the brush is great and very comfortable to use in every region of my body. The only thing that I wished that I have done is to buy an extra one because I really like this product and the cost is very fair. The shipping price is double the price of the brush so I will try to get one with a better shipping price.</li>
            <li> I am petite, so I was looking for a brush with a shorter handle since the back brushes available at the store all have long handles, which are cumbersome for me.  The brush in the picture has a handle that appears to be about 6 inches, and would have been perfect for me.  Well, I should have read the description more closely, because what I received was a brush with a handle that is 12 inches long.  I can&#x27;t comment on the brush&#x27;s performance yet as I have not used it (I do plan on using it because for $7, it isn&#x27;t really worth sending it back).  Just be aware that what you are buying is not what is currently shown in the product picture, and if you want a back brush with a shorter handle, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Can not recommend. Absolute junk! Plastic splits &amp; bristles falling out immediately. I purchased two of this item. Hopefully the other one will last a little longer. Obviously you get what you pay for with this product. Cheap price, cheaply made product. Unfortunately, the back brush I had previously owned is no longer available.</li>
            <li> This item was really disappointing. It started to fall apart after just 1 month of light usage. The plastic material might as well had been sand material at how easily it was coming off. look for something else!</li>
            <li> Within a week, the plastic that holds the bristles cracked, and it has lost half of it&#x27;s bristles.  Cheaple fabricated, probably in China.</li>
            <li> I like the brush, it does a good job. I would have gave it five stars if the handle had been a little longer,&lt;br /&gt;but I like it anyway.</li>
            <li> Bristles went soft in no time.</li>
            <li> The bristles and handle are of good quality, but when you put the item in your cart, it shows a different brush. I did get the right brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles fell out within 3 weeks Terrible workmanship&lt;br /&gt;Used to purchase this but they changed the design Shame.&lt;br /&gt;They should of stayed with quality.</li>
            <li> Helps exfoliate the skin on my back, which is really necessary for me in preventing breakouts on my back. Coupled with a nice scrub, this brush really softens up my skin, and helps reach the spots on my back that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to reach otherwise.</li>
            <li> I retired a bath brush that had provided more than five years of loyal service by buying this Earth Therapeutics brush. The first few days I used it, I noticed a fair amount of bristles falling away. I assumed that because it was new it was simply shedding some stray, loose bristles...until I cleaned nearly a handful out of my shower. I looked more closely at the brush and realized that the plastic base was disintegrating completely and releasing the bristles. Less than two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> this actually works well and reaches all areas of my back!!  dries quickly as well; would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> This has to be the most poorly, cheaply made body brush ever created. Couldn&#x27;t wait for it to get here so I could take a good shower. So I jumped in the shower right after it arrived. I wasn&#x27;t even in there 5 minutes when the entire face of the brush began to crack and the bristles started all falling out. Unbelievable. Save yourself the time and money and invest in something that might actually last a while. And, by the way, if anyone does know of a good body brush, I&#x27;m all ears because it looks like all the ones offered on Amazon are poorly rated.</li>
            <li> My Son uses the back brush only..It&#x27;s Now falling apart. We had the same brush for years &amp; it NEVER did this..</li>
