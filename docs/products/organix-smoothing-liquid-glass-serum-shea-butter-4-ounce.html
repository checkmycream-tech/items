    <ol>
            <li>(Plus it smells great!)</li>
            <li>I called the wonderful people at customer service at Amazon &amp; they refunded my money almost immediately!  </li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>smells great too!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>great for shinning hair</li>
            <li>My hair was incredibly silky and shiny and smelled amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also best if your hair is damp and CLEAN.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, very light, not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Works magic on my hair!</li>
            <li>Just like with my review of the vanilla, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I love this product is excellent and my hair is very soft and feel like silk!!!</li>
            <li>Love this on my hair smells amazing and healthy</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be the most moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>Better than the organix oil.</li>
            <li>but I just have to share how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>i have been using this brand of hair serum for many years.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>, so I was really glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it has disappeared from store shelves.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff....</li>
            <li>I have tried their vanilla and coconut serums and without a doubt, this Shea butter serum is the best for my long curly hair and humid environment.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works great for keeping my hair from frizzing!</li>
            <li>Like with the vanilla, there is a funny undertow to this as well, but the blow out result was so amazing that I will be buying again.</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous and moisturizes my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If you just squeeze some into your hand and slather it on the top of your head, it&#x27;s going to be greasy, sure, but the same is true with any product like this.</li>
            <li>but it leaves my hair really oily and the smell is really strong....</li>
            <li>Works great for my dry hair, between washing my hair at the gym and at home it gets dried out and this stuff keeps it looking good.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and it keeps my dry straight hair looking shiny &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good for African American hair!</li>
            <li>I love this product because it makes my hair soft and manageable after washing (no tangles).</li>
            <li>but the smell wears off soon enough to still be able to enjoy the day.</li>
            <li>I do like it, but if I put in near the top of my head it makes it look greasy.</li>
            <li>It has worked fine so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to make your hair shiny, when all it really does is make it look greasy!</li>
            <li>But if you have thick hair and want shiny, straight hair in hot, humid weather (and not break the bank), this is a great product, just use sparingly and don&#x27;t play with your hair.</li>
            <li>I used this to blow out my hair too, and it left my hair super shiny and soft to touch, and it smelled fantastic.    </li>
            <li>A little too oily for my taste and the smell is not that nice</li>
            <li>Despite the other customer complaints, I didn&#x27;t find this particularly greasy; in fact, my hair still felt light and clean after applying it.</li>
            <li>In the summer this serum helps my hair from reverting when i wear it straight.  </li>
            <li>I recommend using it while your hair is damp, before styling, and really rub it into your hair.</li>
            <li>if it feels greasy, you used too much.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I used it twice, and both times it made my hair feel really greasy.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair really oily.</li>
            <li>It is this oil REALLY.</li>
            <li>I think other products from Organix work way better (like the coconut or the Moroccan oil)</li>
            <li>but this one is my favorite for getting a soft air dry.</li>
            <li>But keep in mind it is pretty heavy so go light or skip it entirely if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Hours later, my hair continues to look and feel gorgeous, another small miracle; with most similar products I usually feel like I need to reapply before too long to keep my hair looking good.</li>
            <li>It is better on dry hair, not wet hair.</li>
            <li>The serum it self is amazing (at least the ones Ive bought that</li>
            <li>I would easily recommend this over more expensive alternatives any day.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would say it necessarily outperforms other products, but it definitely does what it says it does, and at a good cost to boot.</li>
            <li>I like to try new hair products from time to time, and decided to give Organix Shea Butter Liquid Glass Serum a try.</li>
            <li>we new).</li>
            <li>but i can live with it -</li>
            <li>It was like I had dumped olive oil or something directly on my head.</li>
            <li>leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Really does make the hair look &amp;#34;like glass&amp;#34;; almost like a keratin treatment without all of the extra heat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use near my roots and concentrate on the ends.  </li>
            <li>My hair dries smooth, soft and fluffy without the use of heat tools.  </li>
            <li>Really helps my dry hair, and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and it comes out looking very silky and straight and usually with out</li>
            <li>My one complaint about this product is that you have to really be careful not to use too much, because if you do it makes your hair super greasy.</li>
            <li>The second day I used half as much and got essentially the same results.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I only use on the days I can blow dry.</li>
            <li> The first day, I used one pump&#x27;s worth and my hair felt really bad all day.</li>
            <li> I applied a small amount of both to freshly washed, towel-dry hair, then simply used my hair dryer as usual.</li>
            <li> which doesn&#x27;t make sense because the cap is a locking one and it takes a few pumps to get started, also it was in the old packaging and the plastic label was scratched and peeling</li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning my hair I put this in the blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> and I use after I blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Use it on my wet hair before I blow dry it, even works when I air dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is excruciatingly dry and needs a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this serum with other leave ins to air dry 3b relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this oil; I sort of overdid it with three silver dollar sized helpings and my hair</li>
            <li> I have seen the other ones</li>
            <li> Put very small amounts on the tips of your fingers and apply it carefully in different places throughout your hair.</li>
            <li> This serum is a little oily for my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Pomegranate and Green Tea anti-frizz solution.</li>
            <li> was heavy and &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; for a day or so.</li>
            <li> This was a wasted purchase.</li>
            <li> I also use it when I&#x27;m curling my hair, it makes the curls look shiny and stay in place without the frizz and loads if hairspray that&#x27;s makes my hair look stiff.</li>
            <li> What a Mess!</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and VERY thick and usually just soaks up whatever I put on it.</li>
            <li> I have always used Matrix Biologe smoothing serum but had a hard time finding it which led me to try this.</li>
            <li> for the serum itself, it is really thick, so use sparingly, and don&#x27;t bother using if you have thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if you touch your hair a lot, you can feel the product on your hands.  </li>
            <li> Already Unhappy!</li>
            <li> , it seemed used, it was totally disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried their vanilla and coconut serums and without a doubt, this Shea butter serum is the best for my long curly hair and humid environment.</li>
            <li> This product made my over processed hair finally shine again. This is my #1-go to product for shine.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Pomegranate and Green Tea anti-frizz solution. I applied a small amount of both to freshly washed, towel-dry hair, then simply used my hair dryer as usual. The result? My hair was incredibly silky and shiny and smelled amazing. My hair is very long and VERY thick and usually just soaks up whatever I put on it. Hours later, my hair continues to look and feel gorgeous, another small miracle; with most similar products I usually feel like I need to reapply before too long to keep my hair looking good. I don&#x27;t know if I would say it necessarily outperforms other products, but it definitely does what it says it does, and at a good cost to boot. (Plus it smells great!) I would easily recommend this over more expensive alternatives any day.    Despite the other customer complaints, I didn&#x27;t find this particularly greasy; in fact, my hair still felt light and clean after applying it. If you do, you&#x27;re probably using too much, and applying it too heavily in one spot. My advice? Put very small amounts on the tips of your fingers and apply it carefully in different places throughout your hair. It&#x27;s also best if your hair is damp and CLEAN. If you just squeeze some into your hand and slather it on the top of your head, it&#x27;s going to be greasy, sure, but the same is true with any product like this.</li>
            <li> Works great for my dry hair, between washing my hair at the gym and at home it gets dried out and this stuff keeps it looking good.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it makes my hair soft and manageable after washing (no tangles). I use it on my elbows and knees as well.  This serum has shea butter and I love that. I works for me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum with other leave ins to air dry 3b relaxed hair. I have seen the other ones but i stick with the shea one to avoid protein in my products. This one seems to be the most moisturizing. My hair dries smooth, soft and fluffy without the use of heat tools.  In the summer this serum helps my hair from reverting when i wear it straight.  I use a seperate serum for a heat protectant but this one is my favorite for getting a soft air dry.</li>
            <li> When I 1st Got my package, I opened it up &amp; the bottle had leaked! What a Mess! Already Unhappy! Then when I was able to try the product, things got even worse! I put a very small amount on my hair and right away I could tell that I was going to have to wash my hair again. It was like I had dumped olive oil or something directly on my head. Thankfully, it was not a time when I had to be anywhere. It&#x27;s supposed to make your hair shiny, when all it really does is make it look greasy! I called the wonderful people at customer service at Amazon &amp; they refunded my money almost immediately!  Thank You Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  Never never stop producing it! Will buy it by the case.  Better than the organix oil.</li>
            <li> Awesome! It arrived within days!</li>
            <li> I dont often take time to do review but I just have to share how much I love this product. I have always used Matrix Biologe smoothing serum but had a hard time finding it which led me to try this. I will never got back and cant wait to try the shampoo and conditioner from this line!</li>
            <li> My one complaint about this product is that you have to really be careful not to use too much, because if you do it makes your hair super greasy. I recommend using it while your hair is damp, before styling, and really rub it into your hair. Other than that it works great for keeping my hair from frizzing!</li>
            <li> leaves your hair soft and shiny. if it feels greasy, you used too much. smells great too! would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used this a couple of times since receiving it promptly in the mail. It has worked fine so far. Really does make the hair look &amp;#34;like glass&amp;#34;; almost like a keratin treatment without all of the extra heat. It is quite fragrant (fruity?) but the smell wears off soon enough to still be able to enjoy the day. A little goes a long way with this oil; I sort of overdid it with three silver dollar sized helpings and my hair was heavy and &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; for a day or so. I was wearing my hair straightened (afrotextured hair).</li>
            <li> I love this product is excellent and my hair is very soft and feel like silk!!!</li>
            <li> I could not find this product anywhere.I looked all overland still looking for the spray .., Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Just like with my review of the vanilla, this stuff is amazing. I used this to blow out my hair too, and it left my hair super shiny and soft to touch, and it smelled fantastic.    Like with the vanilla, there is a funny undertow to this as well, but the blow out result was so amazing that I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I like to try new hair products from time to time, and decided to give Organix Shea Butter Liquid Glass Serum a try. I have shoulder length, medium-thickness hair. I used it twice, and both times it made my hair feel really greasy. The first day, I used one pump&#x27;s worth and my hair felt really bad all day. The second day I used half as much and got essentially the same results. This was a wasted purchase.</li>
            <li> great for shinning hair</li>
            <li> Love this on my hair smells amazing and healthy</li>
            <li> i have been using this brand of hair serum for many years. they do not test on animals. helps protect my hair from heat.</li>
            <li> Love this item. After washing and conditioning my hair I put this in the blow dry my hair and it comes out looking very silky and straight and usually with out this product it&#x27;s comes out as an Afro. I also use it when I&#x27;m curling my hair, it makes the curls look shiny and stay in place without the frizz and loads if hairspray that&#x27;s makes my hair look stiff. I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I used a pump and I put it in my hair, brushed it, and let it air dry. my hair was oily and gross.</li>
            <li> Really helps my dry hair, and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;The stores I had been purchasing it from discontinued it, so I was really glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> When I got this it was open and everywhere which doesn&#x27;t make sense because the cap is a locking one and it takes a few pumps to get started, also it was in the old packaging and the plastic label was scratched and peeling, it seemed used, it was totally disgusting. And it took forever for it to come. The serum it self is amazing (at least the ones Ive bought that we new). But keep in mind it is pretty heavy so go light or skip it entirely if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love this. It smells amazing, and it keeps my dry straight hair looking shiny &amp; healthy. Use it on my wet hair before I blow dry it, even works when I air dry.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, very light, not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;As for the serum itself, it is really thick, so use sparingly, and don&#x27;t bother using if you have thin hair.  I have very thick, wavy hair and I use after I blow dry my hair.  I don&#x27;t use near my roots and concentrate on the ends.  Unfortunately, if you touch your hair a lot, you can feel the product on your hands.  But if you have thick hair and want shiny, straight hair in hot, humid weather (and not break the bank), this is a great product, just use sparingly and don&#x27;t play with your hair.</li>
            <li> I like it but it leaves my hair really oily and the smell is really strong....probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it has disappeared from store shelves.  I was so excited to find it on Amazon.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Works magic on my hair!</li>
            <li> A little too oily for my taste and the smell is not that nice but i can live with it - I think other products from Organix work way better (like the coconut or the Moroccan oil)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really oily. I only use on the days I can blow dry. Otherwise it is way to oily</li>
            <li> I do like it, but if I put in near the top of my head it makes it look greasy.</li>
            <li> This serum is a little oily for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is excruciatingly dry and needs a leave in conditioner.  It smells fabulous and moisturizes my hair.  I use it every day after my shower. It is better on dry hair, not wet hair. I always get compliments on my glowing blonde color.  It is this oil REALLY.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff....it&#x27;s very good for African American hair!</li>
