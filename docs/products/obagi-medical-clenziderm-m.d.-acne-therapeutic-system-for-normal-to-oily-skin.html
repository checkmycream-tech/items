            <li>That&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>I am so happy with Amazon to help me find this product and happy with Obagi Medical Clenziderm M.D. Acne Therapeutic System For Normal</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for about a week now, and I love how it makes my face feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and it was too strong.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>I was complimented on my skin all of the time and my friends noticed a HUGE difference by the time I was done with the system.</li>
            <li>(meaning I missed several morning or nightly applications) and still got great results.  </li>
            <li>and i have not felt my cheaks this smooth in years.</li>
            <li>Clenziderm system was pricey at the dermatologists office so, I was very happy to find it here on Amazon for half the price!</li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>For zits, it speeds up the healing time significantly.</li>
            <li>its more clear free of acne!  </li>
            <li>Your face feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for that special acne solution.</li>
            <li>In the beginning I was super excited because it was getting rid of scars I had on my face.    </li>
            <li>I had so much congestion under the skin, on top of the skin and all in between, nothing has cleared it but</li>
            <li>my oldest son who&#x27;s in his early twenties inherited acute cystic acne and it&#x27;s been severe for him since he was 11 yo.</li>
            <li>My face felt cool non swollen.</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as it used to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The face wash really tingles, and the toner might be too strong for some to handle.</li>
            <li>and I will be ready!!</li>
            <li>I started off using the product very lightly because my skin is a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using this system now for a little over a week, and already I have had amazing results</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.   </li>
            <li>and my fiance said to me the other night that my skin looked really good.</li>
            <li>thank you 101 med spa for offering this AMAZING product at such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I have not used this piece of the kit in the past but heard great reviews</li>
            <li>Finally my skin looked healthy.</li>
            <li>I use Obagi for acne and the first week I used no. 3</li>
            <li>I knew that at the first week</li>
            <li>I have been trying many different products for years and none of them have worked.  </li>
            <li>it seemed to work at first but never came close to clearing my skin.</li>
            <li>it dries at first</li>
            <li>be consistent, don&#x27;t skip a treatment unless you&#x27;re drying too much (just skip step 3).</li>
            <li>I brought the Clear #3 from the Nuderm system to help fade the hyperpigmentation and that stuff Really works!!</li>
            <li>The steaming helped everything to come to the surface so much easier.</li>
            <li>and now my face is almost ready to go out without makeup.</li>
            <li>Pimples heal lightning fast and no scarring.</li>
            <li>Ive been using some moisturizer to combat this, so I think I may just need to use the set everyother day or so to avoid drying out my face too much.</li>
            <li>Its really minty and gets you awake in the morning.</li>
            <li>This product seems to really get to the root of the problem, unlike the results I had with Proactiv.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>Even though I still have a few minor breakouts that are healing, just knowing that I am on the road to having a beautiful complexion</li>
            <li>At first I thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t going to work because my face started breaking out a little bit more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased three systems so far and will continue to purchase more as long as it continues to work...</li>
            <li>Breakouts came back full force.</li>
            <li>His skin went from red, irritated and bumpy to completely clear and smooth</li>
            <li>Mt older sons skin cleared up as well...</li>
            <li>On top of that I have super sensitive skin and tend to break out into little bumps when I use something too strong, plus I get under the surface acne a few times a month.</li>
            <li>and it was a little better.  </li>
            <li>My normally oily skin dries out at times, but lotion combats that.</li>
            <li>M.D. Acne Therapeutic System For Normal</li>
            <li>This was new for me.</li>
            <li>all brand new stuff</li>
            <li>: make sure you used very little of the number 2 otherwise will burn your face or irritate your skin,follow directions.  </li>
            <li>The first week I saw smaller pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same product...</li>
            <li>We then spent a year using the Proactive extra strength then about 3 months using Neostrata which was better but still didn&#x27;t clear the acne but added the Obagi serum</li>
            <li>my skin got red at first but that went away after about 1-2 weeks of using this product.   </li>
            <li>, my face has cleared up of any breakouts I had had, and my blackheads are even clearing out, which is no small thing</li>
            <li>I feel like the system works to clean the skin by purging the pores of impurities, but the purging effect is not as severe as other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Sometimes clear, sometimes not.</li>
            <li>My skin did clear up somewhat.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been about 4 months now and my skin is almost completely clear.</li>
            <li>From the time I was 11 years old I have suffered from acne.</li>
            <li>I am 33 year young, and have been plagued with acne since I was 26.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t usually sensitive</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>My youngest sons acne completely went away within 10 days of dedicated use.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how well this product worked clearing my mild/moderate acne up in a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>A pimple over a pimple and the pain that came with it; not even in my teens or my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>First, my skin became so DRY that it hurt to move my face.</li>
            <li>Once I staring using   Obagi Medical Clenziderm M.D. Acne Therapeutic System For Normal To Oily Skin</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and haven&#x27;t had a single large pimple.</li>
            <li>Its definately helped with clearing up a lot of the trouble spots I have and it drys up the pimples or acne really quick.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of oils under the skin which create lots of tiny bumps, and they usually turn into more problematic white heads or zits.</li>
            <li>My skin is finally starting to clear up.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been having these problems my entire adult life.  </li>
            <li>You know when people say they&#x27;ve tried everything, yah I literally have, I worked at a makeup counter and tried all the department store brands, tried all the drugstore brands, and tried a couple of the \\&quot;internet\\&quot; brands as well to no avail, and SO much money spent.</li>
            <li>first time in my life I would describe my oil slick of a face as being dry, I bought a moisturizer to use twice a day because I REALLY needed it using this system.</li>
            <li>my skin gets pretty oily on my nose and on the sides of my nose, and just a little oily on my forehead.</li>
            <li>The downside to Obagi is it is SUPER drying, I mean like......</li>

            <li> Its definately helped with clearing up a lot of the trouble spots I have and it drys up the pimples or acne really quick.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of oils under the skin which create lots of tiny bumps, and they usually turn into more problematic white heads or zits.</li>
            <li> My skin is finally starting to clear up.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been having these problems my entire adult life.  </li>
            <li> You know when people say they&#x27;ve tried everything, yah I literally have, I worked at a makeup counter and tried all the department store brands, tried all the drugstore brands, and tried a couple of the \\&quot;internet\\&quot; brands as well to no avail, and SO much money spent.</li>
            <li> first time in my life I would describe my oil slick of a face as being dry, I bought a moisturizer to use twice a day because I REALLY needed it using this system.</li>
            <li> my skin gets pretty oily on my nose and on the sides of my nose, and just a little oily on my forehead.</li>
            <li> The downside to Obagi is it is SUPER drying, I mean like......</li>
            <li> If you think you can buy this product and use it every day twice a day, you can&#x27;t, end of story (at least at first).</li>
            <li> However, this product makes your skin real real dry in such a way that one layer of skin just peels out.</li>
            <li> If one does pop up, they are minor in size and go away within a day.</li>
            <li> and so I was surprised at how harsh it was on my skin.</li>
            <li> -this kit lasts a long time, 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> Then I cut down the third step and used only Step 1 and Step 2.  </li>
            <li> My younger son who&#x27;s 14 yo has your typical hormonal teenage acne.</li>
            <li> I actually had tears in my eyes the other night after washing my face because I couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw.</li>
            <li> -you have to do all 3 steps every single am or pm, whichever you chose (i chose pm</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s amazingly handsome with model quality looks but, his poor skin makes him self conscious and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> what I realized is that as my face broke out and healed, the black heads and pimples were not coming back.</li>
            <li> but   your skin will get used to it and balance back out and be less oily   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about the benzol yet, my bottle is partially solidified and its very hard to apply being that the pump is broken.</li>
            <li> I thought if anyone in the world could it would be me, thinking there was nothing ever that could dry me out, but think again, this stuff will do it, so only start out every other day or even less, just give it time for your skin to gradually get used to it!</li>
            <li> But the products were so harsh that I can really only use them once a day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely frustrating to try so much and never have anything work.  </li>
            <li> I figured, with all the money I&#x27;ve spent on those other products</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product because I have used Retin-A and other products from my doctor.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about buying it due to the cost, but I broke down and purchased anyways.</li>
            <li> the accutane worked but the side affects were not worth it.</li>
            <li> We broke down and purchased this kit.  </li>
            <li> For a facial background, I&#x27;m what Clinique calls type 4, meaning my entire face is oily to the point of uncomfortable, I have terrible breakouts mostly on the surface due to my pores getting clogged, there is just not a way my face can be exfoliated enough to deal with the mass amounts of oil my face produces.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t waste my money on any other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less pimples at the surface.</li>
            <li> This system has helped control my breakouts and has made the bumps less visible.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re just paying $50 less.</li>
            <li> The low price is due to the broken pump on the benzol bottle.</li>
            <li> I usually skip step three every other night until the dryness clears up.</li>
            <li> It cracked and left behind burned skin.</li>
            <li> I even try proactive; all those products and money wasted.</li>
            <li> We received this product within a few days of ordering.  </li>
            <li> But during my pms stage I had a small breakout.</li>
            <li> There can be excessive drying on parts of your skin.</li>
            <li> Another week later, my face had broken out the worse</li>
            <li> oh by the way, if you are wondering why this product is about 60% less than buying it anywhere else, mine came with a broken pump, which is i&#x27;m guessing why,</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin or is prone to bad breakouts.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend Obagi Clenziderm for anyone who suffers from acne.</li>
            <li> I had tried everything; and I mean everything.</li>
            <li> The hyperpigmentation it leaves behind...</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> but the pump must have broken during manufacturing.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I broke out like crazy, it was bringing everything to the surface, I was discouraged but kept with it</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone that also suffers from persistent acne flare ups.</li>
            <li> i had really bad breakouts on my cheaks and jawline.</li>
            <li> I had a real bad acne on my skin.</li>
            <li> my skin progressively got worst.</li>
            <li> It is terrible!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This might just be the best acne solution ever!!! I have used just about every acne product there is out there. From the time I was 11 years old I have suffered from acne. I have even done 2 rounds of Accutane and even after that the acne still came back. So for 20 years I have been searching for a system that actually works and this is it. At first I thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t going to work because my face started breaking out a little bit more but I stayed with it and what I realized is that as my face broke out and healed, the black heads and pimples were not coming back. It has been about 3.5 weeks and my fiance said to me the other night that my skin looked really good. We have been together for 3 years and he has never complimented me on my skin. Even people at work are asking me what it is I am using on my skin because it looks so smooth and has a nice healthy glow to it. I actually had tears in my eyes the other night after washing my face because I couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw. Finally my skin looked healthy. Even though I still have a few minor breakouts that are healing, just knowing that I am on the road to having a beautiful complexion I was so excited. If there is anyone out there like me this is the product for you.    Just to let you know when I say I have tried every product out there here is the list.  Proactive, Oxy, Clearasil, Peter Thomas Roth, Dermatologics, Murad, P8N8, Healing Desert, Neutrogena skin id, even went for glycolic acid peels every week, regular Neutrogena acne washes and creams, Nature&#x27;s Cure, Monocycline and Accutane.  It was always the same result. The acne would somewhat go away but there was always more brewing under the surface.</li>
            <li> I am 33 year young, and have been plagued with acne since I was 26. My sister sent me an email of this product, because I complain about my face constantly. She used the Nuderm system and loved the results. I was hesitant about buying it due to the cost, but I broke down and purchased anyways. I have tried every acne system out there. I figured, with all the money I&#x27;ve spent on those other products, what&#x27;s it gonna hurt to buy this system. It has been about 7 weeks, and my face now looks 95% better!! Thank you obagi!!! I had so much congestion under the skin, on top of the skin and all in between, nothing has cleared it but this product. I even have gotten multiple facials, microdermabrasion and nothing worked like this. I brought the Clear #3 from the Nuderm system to help fade the hyperpigmentation and that stuff Really works!! You cant go wrong with this product. If like me you have alot of congestion, I would also recommend you steam with each wash until all the gunk is gone. The steaming helped everything to come to the surface so much easier. Good luck everyone!! This is the best! Oh yeah, FYI until week six I broke out like crazy, it was bringing everything to the surface, I was discouraged but kept with it and now my face is almost ready to go out without makeup. I give it another week and I will be ready!!</li>
            <li> I have to say. The first week I saw smaller pores. Less pimples at the surface. I saw a lot of drying so I eased off a couple days and was even able to go a week without makeup! But during my pms stage I had a small breakout. I will tell you the healing phase is tripled. Pimples heal lightning fast and no scarring. My pores are significantly smaller and my skin is smoother. So overall I am very pleased. I guess nothing can be a miracle. But obagi has been the closest thing to it. Good luck!!!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about a week now, and I love how it makes my face feel so clean and refreshed. The only thing I&#x27;m having an issue with is some dryness/flakyness around my chin area and eye brows. Ive been using some moisturizer to combat this, so I think I may just need to use the set everyother day or so to avoid drying out my face too much. Its definately helped with clearing up a lot of the trouble spots I have and it drys up the pimples or acne really quick. I like the smell too. Its really minty and gets you awake in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had troublesome skin my entire life. I&#x27;ve tried Proactive, perscription meds and over-the-counter products. This line is wonderful and was recommended to me by a woman I see for facials and chemical peels. This product seems to really get to the root of the problem, unlike the results I had with Proactiv. There can be excessive drying on parts of your skin. I usually skip step three every other night until the dryness clears up. All in all, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and haven&#x27;t had a single large pimple. If one does pop up, they are minor in size and go away within a day. This product is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I had a real bad acne on my skin. I read about Obagi and purchased it from Amazon. It worked great and my acne started disappearing in the first week even without a mark or a blemish. However, this product makes your skin real real dry in such a way that one layer of skin just peels out.</li>
            <li> Ever since I had my daughter (who is now 7) my skin has been OUT OF CONTROL. Sometimes clear, sometimes not. The hyperpigmentation it leaves behind...always there. I used to use the Obagi Nuderm System and LOVED it. I was complimented on my skin all of the time and my friends noticed a HUGE difference by the time I was done with the system. As soon as I stopped using it (ran out on vacation) my skin progressively got worst. Breakouts came back full force. And so I turned to the Clenziderm system. Not happy. First, my skin became so DRY that it hurt to move my face. It cracked and left behind burned skin. This was new for me. My skin isn&#x27;t usually sensitive and so I was surprised at how harsh it was on my skin. The system needs to come with a moisturizer. My skin did clear up somewhat. But the products were so harsh that I can really only use them once a day and so it doesn&#x27;t work as well. I am going to go back to Nuderm ASAP.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of oils under the skin which create lots of tiny bumps, and they usually turn into more problematic white heads or zits. I also have a lot of blackheads. This system has helped control my breakouts and has made the bumps less visible. For zits, it speeds up the healing time significantly. The face wash really tingles, and the toner might be too strong for some to handle. It&#x27;s definitely not for those with sensitive skin. My normally oily skin dries out at times, but lotion combats that. I feel like the system works to clean the skin by purging the pores of impurities, but the purging effect is not as severe as other products I have tried. I love the system and rely on it!</li>
            <li> I love this product...My teenager daughter and I use it and we do see the changes in our skin...its more clear free of acne!  PS: make sure you used very little of the number 2 otherwise will burn your face or irritate your skin,follow directions.  Its a great product and great value.</li>
            <li> Both of my boys suffer from acne... my oldest son who&#x27;s in his early twenties inherited acute cystic acne and it&#x27;s been severe for him since he was 11 yo. He&#x27;s tried just about everything on the market... from drugstore shelf products to prescribed accutane... the accutane worked but the side affects were not worth it. He&#x27;s amazingly handsome with model quality looks but, his poor skin makes him self conscious and uncomfortable. My younger son who&#x27;s 14 yo has your typical hormonal teenage acne. I use the Obagi Nu-Derm line for aging skin and am very pleased with it so, when I ran across the Clenziderm line at my dermatologists, I decided to get it for my boys and give it a try. WOW... what a huge difference it made!  My youngest sons acne completely went away within 10 days of dedicated use. His skin went from red, irritated and bumpy to completely clear and smooth and he&#x27;s thrilled. Mt older sons skin cleared up as well... he still has the occasional cystic breakout but, it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clenziderm system was pricey at the dermatologists office so, I was very happy to find it here on Amazon for half the price! It&#x27;s the exact same product... you&#x27;re just paying $50 less. I&#x27;ve purchased three systems so far and will continue to purchase more as long as it continues to work... both boys have been using it for two months now and I won&#x27;t waste my money on any other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend Obagi Clenziderm for anyone who suffers from acne.</li>
            <li> I love this product, when I purchased from amazon it came promptly. The low price is due to the broken pump on the benzol bottle. I have not used this piece of the kit in the past but heard great reviews so I wanted to try it. I love the cleanser and pore therapy and have been using that for about 4 months now. I&#x27;m not so sure about the benzol yet, my bottle is partially solidified and its very hard to apply being that the pump is broken. I will definitly continue to purchase the cleanser and pore therapy, love, love, love, those 2 products.[[ASIN:B001CJE0UO Obagi Medical Clenziderm M.D. Acne Therapeutic System For Normal To Oily Skin]]</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how well this product worked clearing my mild/moderate acne up in a couple of weeks.  I didn&#x27;t even religiously apply it (meaning I missed several morning or nightly applications) and still got great results.  I would recommend to anyone that also suffers from persistent acne flare ups.</li>
            <li> I use Obagi for acne and the first week I used no. 3 and it was too strong.  Then I cut down the third step and used only Step 1 and Step 2.  I love this product because I saw an improvement in my skin in a week.  You must continue to use it for future pimples.  I do recommend this product because I have used Retin-A and other products from my doctor.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for second time in Amazon. It is an excellent product for my skin...I recommended it if you have acne problems.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I had started breaking out with severe acne. It is terrible! A pimple over a pimple and the pain that came with it; not even in my teens or my early 20&#x27;s I had any acne till I got close to my 30&#x27;s. The face is what every one sees; but when your face is all red and just horrified with acne your self-esteem goes out the window. I had tried everything; and I mean everything. From over the counter and prescriptions to getting my acne extracted every week, the pain and just frustration. I even try proactive; all those products and money wasted. Once I staring using   Obagi Medical Clenziderm M.D. Acne Therapeutic System For Normal To Oily Skin I started seeing results in a day. My face felt cool non swollen. I knew that at the first week or so I would break out more before it gets better. I been using it for a month now and my face is 90% better. I do get two pimples here and there, but two to three are better then 20 and more. I love this stuff had help me keep it under control. I strongly recommended. Oh and the best part Amazon makes it easy to order and at a best price ever!!! I am so happy with Amazon to help me find this product and happy with Obagi Medical Clenziderm M.D. Acne Therapeutic System For Normal To Oily Skin to had help me control my severe acne. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> We received this product within a few days of ordering.  Will be ordering again.  Your face feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product strictly based on the reviews. I am NEVER doing that again!    I started off using the product very lightly because my skin is a bit sensitive. I only was using it one time a day.  In the beginning I was super excited because it was getting rid of scars I had on my face.    About a week into my acne routine I started having severe redness. That&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;m used to that. I cut back on using the stuff that dries your skin. Another week later, my face had broken out the worse it&#x27;s been since I was a teenager. I had to quit using this product and go back to a mixture of Arcona and Neutrogena products. My skin is finally starting to clear up.    I would not recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin or is prone to bad breakouts. I wish I could return it and get my money back because now all this product does it sit on my shelf unused. I&#x27;m still looking for that special acne solution.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!  I have been trying many different products for years and none of them have worked.  This system WORKS!!!!  It is worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> My son was having great luck with Proactive but after a year it stopped working.  We then spent a year using the Proactive extra strength then about 3 months using Neostrata which was better but still didn&#x27;t clear the acne but added the Obagi serum and it was a little better.  We broke down and purchased this kit.  6 weeks later and the acne is almost gone.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> i have been battling acne since 6th grade. i used proactiv for about 5 years. it seemed to work at first but never came close to clearing my skin. so october of 2010 i ordered this system. my skin gets pretty oily on my nose and on the sides of my nose, and just a little oily on my forehead. i had really bad breakouts on my cheaks and jawline. it&#x27;s been about 4 months now and my skin is almost completely clear. it is un-freaking-believable. i just turned 23 and i have not felt my cheaks this smooth in years. i ordered another set today, not because i&#x27;m out but because i probably only have another 2 weeks left of what i have. thank you 101 med spa for offering this AMAZING product at such a reasonable price! bottom line:     -this kit lasts a long time, 4-5 months. well worth the price.   -if you have oily skin, don&#x27;t worry about it drying you out and your skin over-compensating!! it dries at first but   your skin will get used to it and balance back out and be less oily   -you have to do all 3 steps every single am or pm, whichever you chose (i chose pm so it could work all night without being bothered with make up that i use during the day). be consistent, don&#x27;t skip a treatment unless you&#x27;re drying too much (just skip step 3). my skin got red at first but that went away after about 1-2 weeks of using this product.   -don&#x27;t give up if you feel it&#x27;s not working, keep using it! give your skin time to adjust. you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using this system now for a little over a week, and already I have had amazing results, my face has cleared up of any breakouts I had had, and my blackheads are even clearing out, which is no small thing, I&#x27;ve been having these problems my entire adult life.  You know when people say they&#x27;ve tried everything, yah I literally have, I worked at a makeup counter and tried all the department store brands, tried all the drugstore brands, and tried a couple of the \\&quot;internet\\&quot; brands as well to no avail, and SO much money spent. For a facial background, I&#x27;m what Clinique calls type 4, meaning my entire face is oily to the point of uncomfortable, I have terrible breakouts mostly on the surface due to my pores getting clogged, there is just not a way my face can be exfoliated enough to deal with the mass amounts of oil my face produces. On top of that I have super sensitive skin and tend to break out into little bumps when I use something too strong, plus I get under the surface acne a few times a month. It&#x27;s extremely frustrating to try so much and never have anything work.  The downside to Obagi is it is SUPER drying, I mean like......first time in my life I would describe my oil slick of a face as being dry, I bought a moisturizer to use twice a day because I REALLY needed it using this system. If you think you can buy this product and use it every day twice a day, you can&#x27;t, end of story (at least at first). I thought if anyone in the world could it would be me, thinking there was nothing ever that could dry me out, but think again, this stuff will do it, so only start out every other day or even less, just give it time for your skin to gradually get used to it! Hope you all have the same luck as me.    *** oh by the way, if you are wondering why this product is about 60% less than buying it anywhere else, mine came with a broken pump, which is i&#x27;m guessing why, all brand new stuff but the pump must have broken during manufacturing. no biggie for me at those prices, but just fyi!</li>
