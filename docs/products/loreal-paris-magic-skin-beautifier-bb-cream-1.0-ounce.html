            <li>it&#x27;s awesome!)</li>
            <li>It smooths everything out and blends perfectly with my concealer and primer</li>

            <li>it love it!!!</li>
            <li>(I have very fair skin), but when I set it with powder, it looks perfect.  </li>
            <li>It does not give very good coverage</li>
            <li>Very good make-up:</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin that is combination (oily t-zone/normal everywhere else).</li>
            <li>Covers pores and has very good coverage.</li>
            <li>Also it feels incredible.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to wear foundation at all with this stuff - it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li>Good BB cream!</li>
            <li>(Probably not the best for someone who has fair skin.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fair is great!</li>
            <li>and I thought it covered beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I wipe off the remainder and it still looks great.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great</li>
            <li>This is a great product I just stumbled on with a sample from a magazine.  </li>
            <li>and my face isnt really in great shape.  </li>
            <li>It evens it out, covers redness, smooths appearance of skin and great blackhead coverage.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so happy with this drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li>it made my skin look great</li>
            <li>This product is great for the summer months.</li>
            <li>This product was great.</li>
            <li>This product covers great and makes my skin look smoother.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with thus BB cream.  </li>
            <li>but it did a great job at evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Feels like silk on your skin and stays on great.</li>
            <li>This product is really great</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.</li>
            <li>My favorite product I have ever bought!!</li>
            <li>The price is also very nice.</li>
            <li>Both are amazing!</li>
            <li>stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>it was really amazing!</li>
            <li>It gives my face a nice glow and covers all the imperfections that come with age!</li>
            <li>I read so many great reviews about this product that I decided that I had to try it out!</li>
            <li>Excellent, I love it.</li>
            <li>The minute that I put it on my face it turned a bright orange color</li>
            <li>It is light and covers superbly!!!</li>
            <li>I will try the Fair and see how that goes.  </li>
            <li>If Fair doesn&#x27;t work, then I will have to change brands.  </li>
            <li>I did consider writing off my error and trying the fair shade but have decided not to so.  </li>
            <li>would try the fair</li>
            <li>I get this brand of BB cream all the time but the light that I ordered from here came out as bright orange!!!!</li>
            <li>It is good in the summer when I want a tan look, but it requires a lot of blending.  </li>
            <li>And not in a good way.</li>
            <li>Who thought this was a good idea?</li>
            <li>You may find yourself on the cover of a tabloid magazine, and NOT in a good way. ;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself to be fair skinned either.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good for oliy skin</li>
            <li>I got a sample from a magazine add and loved it.</li>
            <li>cream works great as a primer, but it even provides sufficient coverage on its own when I have a hive breakout.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;good qality, good value</li>
            <li>but the light shade works great for me!</li>
            <li>The light tone is perfect.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy if you are caucasian and your complexion is fair.</li>
            <li>and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>so she should know what is good for her.</li>
            <li>This cream is too orangy for someone with fair skin like me.</li>
            <li>If you have medium skin tone I would recommend it but not for fair people.</li>
            <li>I wish that make it truly a fair shade.</li>
            <li>I also like the way it mattified my face which kept my face from looking oily for a good couple hours</li>
            <li>My skin is kind of light/fair, so I want sure which color to get, but fair is perfect.</li>
            <li>so i loved the fair</li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion, but not too fair.</li>
            <li>I tried it anyway and LOVED it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great moisterizing on days when I forget to bring my own</li>
            <li>I have fair skin; I always use a fair foundation and the lightest concealer.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin; I always use a fair foundation and the lightest concealer.  </li>
            <li>I used the Light and it seems to be perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>I am delighted that it is a drugstore item.  </li>
            <li>I feel great putting this on instead of makeup because it feels lighter and  seems better for my skin.</li>
            <li>and I am SO happy I ordered more.</li>
            <li>It also feels real nice and light on my skin.</li>
            <li>Best part is its great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately, however, it is the BEST make-up I&#x27;ve ever used, as it goes on smoothly, stays fresh-looking for many hours, and doesn&#x27;t change color after you apply it correctly (ensuring you cause the micro-beads to release fully).  </li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love it!</li>
            <li>ok if you are using it on it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>This was the top!  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this products and for the first five minutes, was quite impressed with it.</li>
            <li>cause it makes my face have more color!</li>
            <li>This stuff really is MAGIC!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This is the first product that allows me to wear makeup with a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magical!</li>
            <li>my favorite BB cream!&lt;br /&gt;it does the job!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Would love to find a sheerer light-weight BB for oilier skin!</li>
            <li>It provides a perfect &amp;#34;middle of the road&amp;#34; between no make up (which no on wants to see!)</li>
            <li>I liked the Youth Code BB Cream Illuminator so much better!</li>
            <li>I have very light skin and bought the fair shade.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that amazing.</li>
            <li>The combination is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>and she says makeup glides on smoothly and her skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>And my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely and is not oily at all.</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use fair, but more as the &amp;#34;highlight&amp;#34; part when I&#x27;m contouring.</li>
            <li>my skin tone with a nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it would be a good if you need more coverage.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizes nicely and gives a nice even color.  </li>
            <li>I never used a BB cream before buying this one, so I really have no basis of comparison, but it has worked wonderfully for me.</li>
            <li>Good deal, better product.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice finish and with blush and powder is all I need.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own -</li>
            <li>Perfect when you don&#x27;t have alot of time to get ready.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even buy this stuff with any intention of it helping my under eye area, so you can imagine how completely happy I was so see such wonderful coverage (for a BB cream)!&lt;br</li>
            <li>All opinions are honest and original.makeup at all.  </li>
            <li>Puts a nice sheen on my face and adjusts to my skin color.</li>
            <li>Blends beautifully and the coverage is great and natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I apply a SUPER light moisturizer underneath, but I don&#x27;t feel like this is moisturizing for someone who is looking for that type of product - perfect for me since I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old, and my complexion is naturally very good, but today it was just gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I noticed almost right away that my skin tone was beautifully even.</li>
            <li>The color blends perfect and it really looks as if you have no makeup on, just a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Easy application and good coverage.  </li>
            <li>This BB cream truly is &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;: goes on very light, but evens skin tone nicely and has a durable matte finish that makes pores invisible.</li>
            <li>what I loved about it is that, immediately, and for several hours afterward, it eliminated my &#x27;shiny&#x27; skin and gives me this fresh, and flawless skin that looks great in daylight and in pictures</li>
            <li>The color just kind of sits on top of your skin, and makes you look a bit like a greasy orange mannequin.  </li>
            <li>I honestly just put this on with no need of any more make up.</li>
            <li>The fair version is too light for me, but tolerable with using the Avon over it.</li>
            <li>The fair version is too light for me, but tolerable with using the Avon over it.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>The product itself is great and very much to my liking for an unexperienced BB cream user; hopefully the color problem can be overcome.  </li>
            <li>It still gives me that very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>On the positive side it is not greasy, blends easily with good coverage and does a good job of evening</li>
            <li>I wear it alone without foundation most days.</li>
            <li>It is hands-down the most unflattering cosmetic I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>and it was okay.  </li>
            <li>My favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a glow better than a bronzer.</li>
            <li>Love it and wear it almost every day.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>i love it, but I need to order the lighter shade.  </li>
            <li>BEST BB cream available as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>My skin is more light than fair, so I went with the light shade as I did not want to look &#x27;chalky&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy as well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best part about this is it mimics the natural smooth texture of the skin better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I really love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with the product!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily with or without makeup and it feels awesome!</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS BB CREAM</li>
            <li>Love this cream</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t write a review unless I love the product I have purchase.</li>
            <li>im in love with this loreal bb cream.</li>
            <li>Love it love</li>
            <li>Ok type..</li>
            <li>Boo ya enjoy ladies!</li>
            <li>and I think it stays in place better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cream.  </li>
            <li>If I am going out or want a tad more coverage</li>
            <li>I use the L&#x27;Oreal magic nude liquid powder.</li>
            <li>I used to love mineral powder, but it would catch in the peach fuzz hairs and look cakey.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have given this one a shot.</li>
            <li>Still love it, still will repurchase.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my skin look.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this, but make sure it fits your skin tone.</li>
            <li>buying more.</li>
            <li>It just makes my skin look better, which I love.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how this product makes my skin look... except for the color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is way better than the $40-something that I was spending on Smashbox foundation...not to mention primer, powder etc.</li>
            <li>I have always objected to the texture of most foundations, I can&#x27;t stand the feel of them on my skin.</li>
            <li>But those go away and the more you rub the lotion on, the more it changes to its color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure once summer comes around it will even out more for</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This BB cream makes my skin look nice and smooth</li>
            <li>, 0.7-Ounce Shaker top jar (</li>
            <li>This is more of a medium shade.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I get some color this summer I will be able to use it.</li>
            <li>I love BB Cream and I purchase it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Does not have the moisture content that I love with BRCK&lt;</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feels so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Sure, it works well and my skin looks better, but no product is going to make our skin \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; or \\&quot;flawless.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>How many uses?</li>
            <li>Just like the item&#x27;s name, it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I love how the L&#x27;oreal cream changes to match your skin tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about 6 different brands of BB cream and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>Then, to top off the orange-faced clown look</li>
            <li>My skin just looked more even and had a bit of a glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you put it on your skin you&#x27;ll see why it&#x27;s appropriately named &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>So make sure you add a pop of color with blush and bronzer.</li>
            <li>I love it and hope L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t decide to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; it to a CC cream.</li>
            <li>it was more watery</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d use it more on \\&quot;no make-up\\&quot; days and make sure I wash my face before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to wear just this on the weekends when running my errands.</li>
            <li>I love, love,</li>
            <li>I LOVE this BB</li>
            <li>not noticeably so.&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is AMAZING and the formula goes on smoothly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>you will love the change</li>
            <li>, I realize it isn&#x27;t any better than the Mary Kay product that I use already.</li>
            <li>OK, It has helped some.</li>
            <li>Beauty products have changed a lot over the years, mostly for the better, and now, we have options regarding what type of coverage we want.  </li>
            <li>It just helps me get a more even look.  </li>
            <li>So, it stood to reason that I would need the lightest shade of Magic BB cream.  </li>
            <li>I think L&#x27;Oreal foundation is probably better suited to my coverage needs than the Magic BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal, you really did a great job on this one.</li>
            <li>My husband commented right away that my skin looked gorgeous.</li>
            <li>All opinions are honest and original.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Fair color first.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone as it is one of the best skin products that I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good but is not a miracle worker.  </li>
            <li>found that the best way for me to use this product is by first moisturizing my skin as I normally would, then using Magic BB cream in place of foundation.  </li>
            <li>I bought this BB cream and the Maybelline BB cream at the same time to find the best fit for my skin.</li>
            <li>Scared me at first when I got because it comes out a grey color and feels gritty, but it is amazing the color is perfect for my skin tone and makes my skin look flawless!</li>
            <li>Feels a bit gritty going on but that feeling disappears very quickly and leaves skin smooth, hydrated and flawless looking.</li>
            <li>This is WAY darker and more orange than Maybelline&#x27;s BB cream in light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d describe this light as more of a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love about it, is that it is so lightweight and goes on really smooth.  </li>
            <li>Its smooth, the tone is much more even than with Aveeno.</li>
            <li>It blends so well that it does not look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup - which is precisely why I love it, but you can see the color when you wipe your face with a tissue at the end of the day to remove your makeup.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually more of a medium, but I decided to by the light to avoid any make-up marks.</li>
            <li>It covers flaws and makes my skin love fabulous.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how good or not got it is.</li>
            <li>Not to mention I want to get ready quick but still look great.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite product!!</li>
            <li>Oh, and if you don&#x27;t like the color when you first try it, make sure you try another shade!</li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic, whereby it transforms from a creamy, shiny near-white substance into an explosion of color so rich that you would think it has self-tanning properties.  </li>
            <li>This is so easy to thrown on before work</li>
            <li>If it had sunscreen in it, I would easily give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>1st time was great - creamy consistency, second tube was more like water.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to reapply a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I still love this and would recommend as it provides coverage, is smooth and lightweight and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>easy application.</li>
            <li>After that dries I use either Philosophy&#x27;s Keep the Peace corrector as a primer (also helps a little with the redness, but mostly reduces the appearance of pores and fine lines and makes the BB cream glide like silk) or Avon Magix (best primer</li>
            <li>One of the great things about BB Creams is that they (generally) are moisturizers, treatments, primers, bases and SPF all in one.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;light\\&quot; color is too dark for me, so I gave it to a friend and purchased the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; tone... its perfect!</li>
            <li>I actually use a mixture of light and medium and looks good!  </li>
            <li>I am glad that others&#x27; reviews are true, and I will continue to use this bb cream.</li>
            <li>Looks nice at first, but then it turns orange on your skin after prolonged use.</li>
            <li>However, those claims to perfect and correct were also a let down to me, so I need to use spot corrector and undereye concealer, as well as powder.  </li>
            <li>Setting into any fine lines and amplifying a caked-on look, it does quite the opposite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>it is light and blends easily.  </li>
            <li>It matches my neck and chest fine, but the color seems to lack any color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite impressed with the slight tint--</li>
            <li>People noticed that very first day i used it, and more have noticed since.</li>
            <li>Still love it, still will repurchase.heads, but honestly my skin was just adjusting to the new product.</li>
            <li>They say things like &amp;#34;your skin looks so nice, what are you doing&amp;#34; figuring a new vitamin, detox tea or something :)</li>
            <li>I am madly in love with this super light makeup.</li>
            <li>The color of my foundation is fairly light by Bare Minerals, so I really thought this would be the perfect color, because I didn&#x27;t want something way too light.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much !!</li>
            <li>and my face ends up looking flawless - like I&#x27;m wearing little to no makeup at all.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine, okay, but It has NO SPF, so right off the bat</li>
            <li>you made a huge mistake while playing with self tanner.</li>
            <li>it was too light,  </li>
            <li>I then tried the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34;, which was also too light, it was a joke.</li>
            <li>I use the Light in BB cream and it works well.</li>
            <li>It also doubles as a moisturizer which greatly simplifies my daily morning routine.</li>
            <li>It says it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>and I would buy it again, just not in this light color.  </li>
            <li>, It is so light that I don&#x27;t even feel you&#x27;re wearing a foundation.  </li>
            <li>and since then, she has been asking me where I got it and wants her own.  </li>
            <li>I will use the light color in the winter and medium in the summer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The color on me is very orange and looks kind of greasy.  </li>
            <li>It has a smooth matte finish that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even lightly buildable.</li>
            <li>Goes on  smoothly.  </li>
            <li>so I bought the light shade</li>
            <li>It covers a lot of my light acne scars and evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Goes on light, doesn&#x27;t cause pimples.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this BB cream is so light and doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>wear light to light/med Foundation.</li>
            <li>I wear light shade in this brand.  </li>
            <li>I started using a self-tanner and bumped up to the Light.</li>
            <li>, it goes on smooth &amp; leaves my skin amazing/flawless, for a fact I will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li>Its light, oil free and non foundation like cream.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>(Seems to be too light to cover scars.)</li>
            <li>I have light skin</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell where it ends on my face, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>well, the &#x27;light&#x27; makes me look orange.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help smooth my skin out.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap and looks cheap on the skin</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and looks even-toned after use</li>
            <li>Great primer, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Not drying, goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Skin looks smooth and not &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is light and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>it will change color as you smooth it in...</li>
            <li>I was looking for a BB cream that I could use as a light coverage foundation too.</li>
            <li>just lightly powder and sometimes not even blush</li>
            <li>In makeup products, I always wear light.</li>
            <li>I think the texture, although silky smooth, feels mask-like.</li>
            <li>If you have really light skin get this bb cream in the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; shade and not the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; one .</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, I think this product has a lot of potential for some women, but I just do not think it was a great match for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, I think this product has a lot of potential for some women, but I just do not think it was a great match for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin is light to medium with an olive undertone, and the light works well with it.</li>
            <li>Smooth skin.</li>
            <li>while it looked great for the first hour, after about three, it seemed to wear off at a rate faster than just normal cover up.</li>
            <li>Just this (hopefully in the right color) :)</li>
            <li>This is my first BB and been a great experience so far.</li>
            <li>Light, clean feel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and it works very well.</li>
            <li>But when I started using I realized it goes along way, and doesn&#x27;t take much and spreads really nicely and quick.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a Korean BB cream that literally makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>I am not sure this is the best shade for me</li>
            <li>I originally tried using it</li>
            <li>Yes, the price point was cheap, and it is true you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>The only nice thing about this cream is it blends on very smooth.</li>
            <li>Most of the others just seem like tinted moisturizer, but this one covers all the little flaws and makes you look and feel great.</li>
            <li>it covers imperfections feels very light, and takes very little time to apply, one of the best bb creams I have tried , and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I love this product it works beautifully and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your face!</li>
            <li>I love how the bb cream looks more natural.</li>
            <li>90% of my redness disappears and my face still feels clean and matte, which it never does with foundation.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the transformation!It is not heavy like foundation but conceals spots, circles and discoloration of the skin better!</li>
            <li>On a special occasion, I had my daughter try it</li>
            <li>First of all, this cream oxidizes, which is uncommon for asian bbcreams.</li>
            <li>But I do like the primer-like texture (silky) and it gives a light coverage as a foundation, so it&#x27;s good for an everyday use (I prefer more coverage if I go out at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would get this in fair next time.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s going to be that pigmented, Loreal is going to have to use their True Match system to accommodate the variety in skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I will say the feel of the cream is lovely but the orange shading, not so much.</li>
            <li>stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moved on to a different product now, but this is a good one as longs as you wear a moisturizer with sunscreen underneath.</li>
            <li>but I would necessarily consider myself fair esp.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t go on the same way as the Fair</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for younger people who have good skin.</li>
            <li>: I recently purchased the FAIR version of this as my summer tan has faded and this one made me look orange.</li>
            <li>: I recently purchased the FAIR version of this as my summer tan has faded and this one made me look orange.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost a dozen bb creams and this is the only one I really loved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several BB creams, but nothing has turned out as good as this.</li>
            <li>and full make up (which I don&#x27;t want to do on the weekends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the full tube</li>
            <li>it really makes a difference for the better.  </li>
            <li>Although this color was too dark for my fair skin, I still love it.</li>
            <li>Provides just the right amount of coverage, no streaks, no oranginess, just smooth looking skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that might be a plus for some people, but I like my BBs to be a little more rich (and offer better coverage).</li>
            <li>(I tend to be dry but for the t-zone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has simplified my routine and so far I am happy. :-)</li>
            <li>I use it on my legs for a quick tan.</li>
            <li>I recently purchase this awesome BB Cream at my local grocery store under $8.00.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure where locally I would be able to buy it</li>
            <li>So unless you are super orange tan, skip this one.</li>
            <li>I first tried this from a free sample package in a fashion magazine, something I have never done before.</li>
            <li>I bought this product on a whim at a duty free store because I had used other B.B. foundations and loved them.  </li>
            <li>It has a ton of preservatives, parabens and yucky chemicals that I normally avoid so you would expect it to be more stable, but</li>
            <li>I purchased this in light and it turned my skin an orangey tint which was a first for me.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty light colored</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>I just use it everyday in the morning and my skin looks fresh and naturally beautiful.</li>
            <li>I first tried a sample that was in a magazine!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m about ready to throw that out (although its great for sweating in the summer, but makes my nose look dry).</li>
            <li>First, it does not blend well on clean or moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>I had to finally tan myself to get it to match, but it does make my skin look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li>The coverage is light - it adds a bit of color and does even the skin tone and obscure (but not so much cover)</li>
            <li>That along with my thyroid meds was destroying my normally great skin.</li>
            <li>Third, when I take this stuff off my face doesn&#x27;t look nice</li>
            <li>Great product when you have to get ready fast makes your skin glow without all the extra fuss..</li>
            <li>But after trying it I honestly will never go back to another product.</li>
            <li>while everything looked okay in the dim light of my bathroom, the reality is that this cream does not blend very well.</li>
            <li>If you have a different skin tone and type it might look nice on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottomline, it&#x27;s nothing like the Korean BBs I&#x27;ve tried, I wouldn&#x27;t even classify it as the same kind of product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed a bit of the product on my finger, and it looked so light - so innocuous, that I put more on my face than I would have with regular make-up.  </li>
            <li>This light color might actually work for someone who is more tan though.</li>
            <li>This offers better coverage than some concealers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>35 years old, mostly even skin tone.</li>
            <li>Anyway I am positively surprised and love this BB.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite BB so far.</li>
            <li>* Love the natural look it</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but this stuff has worked so well for me that I had to.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still well worth it.</li>
            <li>But when hubby is home, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable going completely makeup free.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t waste it on a makeup free day because it has no spf, but it does act as a good primer substitute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Korean BB creams with some success, except I have darker skin and can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li>: I received a complimentary product courtesy of  SheSpeaks and L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al for review purposes.  </li>
            <li>: I received a complimentary product courtesy of  SheSpeaks and L&#x27;Oréal for review purposes.  </li>
            <li>The color is a tad yellow for me, but I wear a light foundation &amp; bronzer on top of the BB cream</li>
            <li>I rarely go without makeup</li>
            <li>kinda fun to watch.</li>
            <li>Even when a super small amount is used, it feels a bit gross/heavy on my face, surprisingly so for how light the coverage is.</li>
            <li>and it still corrects my redness and gives me great, natural looking coverage that usually lasts me most of the day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34; qualities and rubs right off.</li>
            <li>it  gives just the right of tint of color</li>
            <li>and this one is just right.</li>
            <li>Right color for olive skin.</li>
            <li>Considering I was using this right before attending a formal event...</li>
            <li>The color is right.</li>
            <li>,right?</li>
            <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t really know how this is a &#x27;Light&#x27; Shade.</li>
            <li>I rarely try new products due to sensitive skin, but this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>I tried the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure where all these great reviews are coming from, because my experience with this product was god-awful.  </li>
            <li>Turns kinda dark on my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>thought dark and medium would work for me, even though I have fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Feels like silicone and very fine sand mixed together.</li>
            <li>It covers blemishes and most of my freckles, leaving just a few visibly cute ones.  </li>
            <li>A good natural looking product that replaces using several others in its place.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a different BB such as Pond&#x27;s to anyone looking for a great product and value.</li>
            <li>thank u very much</li>
            <li>it went on smoothly and covered better than any other product i have ever used on my face.</li>
            <li>so when I first started using the product I used Medium</li>
            <li>Looks natural because it&#x27;s light coverage but still can hide some flaws.</li>
            <li>It makes my face so clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I ordered several tubes of it to give to my girls and to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li>Light, but offers coverage and stays on.  </li>
            <li>First off, there isn&#x27;t any SPF.  </li>
            <li>The grittiness is evident from the moment I tried to apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li>Up until recently this was the better of the \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; bb cream products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>This is the only reason I did not give it more</li>
            <li>This is very tan (dark) on my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try it for the first time just before you go out.  </li>
            <li>It should be noted that my skin has more yellow undertones</li>
            <li>So this is the first time i have used a BB Cream</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I am wearing it to bed in a hot summer night in the desert, so I guess I will know in 12 hours if it stands up to the hype.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t contain any sunscreen like many others do, so I have to layer another product on my face.</li>
            <li>I brought it not knowing exactly what it was supposed to do (foundation, primer,concealer, or moisterizer?).  </li>
            <li>But, it blends pretty well.</li>
            <li>(didn&#x27;t want to wear make-up because it was extremely hot)</li>
            <li>apply my rosacea medication (Finacea - which was a dream come true and cleared all the itchy acne rosacea) and 5 minutes later apply a light coating of Lubriderm moisturizer.</li>
            <li>First of all.</li>
            <li>I also have NOT broken out (yet?!)</li>
            <li>Therefore, I was interested in this product because of the promise of an \\&quot;all-in-one\\</li>
            <li>Like most skin makeup, this product does not come in enough diverse skin tones&lt;</li>
            <li>It really does make your skin look dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li>I ordered light and it was too dark, maybe better for summer.</li>
            <li>My face looks ten times better with it.</li>
            <li>I also noticed a lot more white heads after using this product.</li>
            <li>so I love this product as it evens out my red areas and hides pores without looking like I&#x27;m wearing make up</li>
            <li>love Amazon but not enough to pay $10 more for the same product.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this and didn&#x27;t like it at first because it was gray.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this at Target.</li>
            <li>I am definitely buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>but I would probably be willing to apply only this to my skin to run errands and feel confident.</li>
            <li>This is my first BB cream, so I cannot compare with others.</li>
            <li>I am a medium-to-light black hispanic woman and the match was very good overall</li>
            <li>While this is no fault of the product itself, consumers to need to be aware how very light (white really)</li>
            <li>While this is no fault of the product itself, consumers to need to be aware how very light (white really)</li>
            <li>Other then that I really liked the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend to use very little at first to see what the color turns and blend it in a good amount.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it does not feel heavy at all, if feels like you are make up free.</li>
            <li>Because my skin has an uneven tone and color, I most often still opt for a light foundation.  </li>
            <li>fresh face\\&quot; look, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>But this product does pretty much all of that.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and usually use the Ivory shades.</li>
            <li>Fair has never been a color match for me, and not sure I would buy another just to test it.</li>
            <li>The true test is waiting to see if it breaks my sensitive skin out in acne.</li>
            <li>but usually when I wear &#x27;fair&#x27; colored things I look like a ghost...</li>
            <li>I can get a nice dark tan in the summer.</li>
            <li>My skin looked softer, my dark acne spots were muted, and I had a nice matte palette on which to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li>Also, I have oily skin, and within a few minutes time, I experienced major shine breakthrough on my forehead, cheeks, chin, and nose.</li>
            <li>I was soft and silky but for a fair skinner person the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; was still too orange and dark for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and actually covers my adult acne scars and does not look cakey at all!  </li>
            <li>I have large pores and I have redness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53 and have combo skin somewhat large pores.  </li>
            <li>And that is certainly a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And that is certainly a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently had an opportunity to try the new Magic BB Cream from L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li>After the initial application, my skin looked better than it does without makeup, and even with this B.B. cream on, it looked very natural...</li>
            <li>The color was just fine, not to orangey or white.</li>
            <li>Well, when I put it on, it turned from white to super orange!  </li>
            <li>which is huge) and it actually lasts longer when I just wear it on</li>
            <li>I really like the feel and coverage of this product; however, I am struggling with the color.  </li>
            <li>I decided to stop tanning and see where I really was with skin damage, tone, aging, etc.</li>
            <li>I use too much cream accidentally, it is tinted orange.</li>
            <li>I suggest if you order this to get a much lighter shade than your color.</li>
            <li>do like the amount of coverage I get with this product (sheer to medium coverage), and how light weight and nongreasy</li>
            <li>I really believe my skin tone and appearance has improved with this.</li>
            <li>I really dislike wearing makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flattering.</li>
            <li>I took a risk in buying this product, I really had no idea what BB cream was.</li>
            <li>They are still there, but they just don&#x27;t stand out so much</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot, L&#x27;oreal!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>you want the real stuff, stick to korean lines.</li>
            <li>It feels like and smooth, and helps my make-up last through the day.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product.</li>
            <li>It tends to give an orange hue if you don&#x27;t blend it in really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though, I really do like this product.</li>
            <li>I personally really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and sheer, but covers and evens out skin tone</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I was using Clinque foundation for years, and I have very oily skin, and by the end of the day, my makeup would be melted off.</li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t say much</li>
            <li>Of course I think the satisfaction with the product would really depend on your needs and skin type</li>
            <li>It feels so much lighter than a foundation and allows my skin to breathe, while leaving it feeling moisturized and looking evened out and polished.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my sister and I&#x27;ve used the whole tube up.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>* Doesn&#x27;t really help with scars.</li>
            <li>I think I REALLY like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Too much to ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>reason I love this product (so far - it has been a week) is that while accomplishing all that stated above, it really looks like I am not wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li>only use a light moisturizer on my drier spots under this</li>
            <li>use too much.</li>
            <li>It goes on white and becomes invisible and it is light on the skin and it helps the skin feel softer.</li>
            <li>I am 61 and do not wear makeup much because it looks too cakey and sometimes itches.</li>
            <li>How much time?</li>
            <li>Plus the color was very yellowy on my skin.</li>
            <li>THANKS Kandee!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;m not really a fan.</li>
            <li>If a bit too much is applied, it makes my skin&#x27;s texture look rougher instead of smoother.</li>
            <li>I bought the light shade and might bump up one shade as I get further into the summer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel caked or oily.  </li>
            <li>east indian with beige skin (I use revlon photo ready airbrush foundaiton in the shade toast and</li>
            <li>goes on so smoothly and adds moisture at the same time.</li>
            <li>The BB Cream is much darker than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>have rosacea and this evens out the skin tone nicely, without being heavy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to BB creams, so this literally is the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other but none compares to this one.</li>
            <li>This product is extremely matte, and when I go to put my foundation on top of it</li>
            <li>It is different from the sample I originally tried.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; product, but I think it would be better if it came in a more natural shade option, with a slightly denser formula to make application easier.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different foundations - everything from drug store brands to Bare Minerals, Laura Geller,</li>
            <li>It contains micro-beads of pigment, that, when you rub onto your skin, break open to reveal the true color of the make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>The color &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is so dark and orange on my skin that I would not be able to wear it even in the summer.</li>
            <li>The pigment beads blend in pretty seamlessly.</li>
            <li>My normal routine now is to wash my face with a gentle cleanser (I use Neutragena Naturals)</li>
            <li>This is not a bad product but it is white and changes shades after applied.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and absorbs nicely!</li>
            <li>only reason I gave it 4 stars vs 5 is that it can be a bit drying to my skin, because of this I have just ordered the original product that launched all of these new B.B. from Korea.  </li>
            <li>The thing that worked for me was to keep the tip pointed up, and to very gently squeeze the bottle until a small amount of product came to the top.</li>
            <li>m really iffy about trying new products</li>
            <li>LESS IS MORE</li>
            <li>Did a decent job correcting some redness, but not discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li>YOU ARE OLDER THAN YOU ARE.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent at controlling oil too, however I find I still need to touch up with a shine control powder from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>but as I have gotten older I feel like it just doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore</li>
            <li>more expensive, better quality do</li>
            <li>Two of the main ingredients are dimethicone and glycerin.</li>
            <li>The main benefit of this cream is evening and coverage.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve listened to the pros in saying less is more.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I am writing is I have oily skin (even at 42) and this product makes me a bit greasy.</li>
            <li>think one of the reasons I ran into so many problems is that I chose the wrong color of Magic BB cream.  </li>
            <li>think one of the reasons I ran into so many problems is that I chose the wrong color of Magic BB cream.  </li>
            <li>I tried this one in particular b/c a blogger I follow suggested it</li>
            <li>THIS MAKES YOU SKIN LOOKS VERY NATURAL ON AN OLD GIRL!!!</li>
            <li>but I recently bought L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi Primer and will add occasionally for a little more glow.</li>
            <li>Very surprised!</li>
            <li>I use this with a loose powder dusted over for a light coverage.  </li>
            <li>(overwhelming, time consuming, and expensive!), and I need something that is easy and quick to apply in the morning.</li>
            <li>This product has a high color saturation, which has its pros and cons.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>I have high ends BB creams</li>
            <li>But for me it provided very light coverage and dried out my skin.</li>
            <li>It still gives me that very smooth feeling.ly reason I&#x27;m taking 1 star off of this BB cream is because like others said, it definitely is not as light as it could be.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for the L&#x27;oreal BB cream</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I tried mixing a drop or two with my zinc sunscreen and the result was a little better.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t adapt to your skin tone quite as well as some other BB creams claim to, so you definitely need to get a more exact tone</li>
            <li>I purchased the light shade which is a little too dark, next time I will get fair.</li>
            <li>and I have a very polished yet natural look.  </li>
            <li>Overall, while I enjoy using BB cream, I am still suspicious about the BB cream product in general, regardless of brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can definitely build up the amount of product to get greater coverage, however I would probably only recommend that for a person who already has a considerable tan.</li>
            <li>worth noting is, I think I will purchase this a shade lighter next time.</li>
            <li>When I have a date with friends, I refuse to go out with makeup and thus use my normal foundation.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is pretty light with some neutral/slightly yellow understones, but I&#x27;m not super white like a sheet of paper, so I purchased this in the light color.  </li>
            <li>Due to the texture and consistency it settles into your fine lines.</li>
            <li>The color match was nice once it settled in, but it had an odd gritty texture when I spread it on my skin.</li>
            <li>I normally get a light to medium or medium in other brands.</li>
            <li>I ordered the light and it was extremely orange not at all like the color from the sample I got in a magazine.  </li>
            <li>I normally use [[ASIN:B0086HW5TI Avon Extra Lasting Liquid Foundation SPF 12 LIGHT IVORY]]</li>
            <li>I did get a couple of little bumps on my hairline that never formed white heads, but honestly my skin was just adjusting to the new product.</li>
            <li>but I decided to purchase this BB cream since I am a product junkie and want to try out new things.</li>
            <li>I break out the moment I try new things, but I haven&#x27;t with this.</li>
            <li>It is one of the few effective on the tiny lines around my eyes &amp; lips.  </li>
            <li>The packaging wasn&#x27;t very clear on that.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin but no breakout issues with this either.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>This primer evens out my overall tone very, very well.  </li>
            <li>i bought the light and it&#x27;s way too dark.</li>
            <li>Just now I ordered from Drugstore.com and paid $10.95 for first one, and a second for 50% off.</li>
            <li>makeup, especially during the hot and humid summer months.</li>
            <li>I am not one of those women who is willing to buy a lot of different skin primers/powders/foundations, etc.</li>
            <li>Gives me a natural look!</li>
            <li>I bought this product in light at the drug store and find that it is too dark for me.</li>
            <li>It does feels gritty when it first comes out</li>
            <li>My skin looked so dry, and the pigment in the Magic BB cream was concentrated on those areas of dry skin,</li>
            <li>/&gt;2)A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;3)Magically \\&quot;corrects\\&quot; to your own skin color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I switched to the light shade and it seems a bit too dark and orange for my now natural skin color.  </li>
            <li>This one is the firs BB cream I tried and it hands down remains my favorite and the one I use daily.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at my local store for full price for less than what most of the other BB creams cost.</li>
            <li>light skin tone, blackheads in T-zone, dry in the winter, sometimes oily in T-zone,no acne or scars, but occasional pimple here and there.</li>
            <li>I have fairly dry skin and some light freckles, but up until recently didn&#x27;t have any issue with blemishes or discoloration.</li>
            <li>Less actually looks better.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it was white as it came out of the tube but when applied to my face it really did even out my skin tone in a very natural way that seemed to make my skin glow.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a light coverage foundation with little UV protection and an overpriced cost.</li>
            <li>I also use a tiny bit of my Avon liquid foundation if I feel I need a little more cover or evening out as</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this product, I bought it out of curiosity but its not worth the price</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised and had to have a tube.</li>
            <li>You could probably add directly to a sponge and apply to your face, but I felt like the product was wet enough that either a ton would be absorbed by the sponge, or else too much product would end up on my face giving me oompa loompa</li>
            <li>I much prefer an actual BB to a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I look so natural.  </li>
            <li>and I was surprised that this cream evened out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>After I wash my face, my skin feels so soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>Also, I have naturally tan skin</li>
            <li>It only took a dab to do my whole face.</li>
            <li>It does not have SPF in it as far as I know, the tube says nothing of the sort.</li>
            <li>This product cost $10 at the drugstore and you only need a nickle size dollop on your hand to do the whole face.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>I go thru a lot of different make up because I am very picky</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel soft and smooth,its like wearing nothing at all.</li>
            <li>I can wear this completely by itself with nothing else - no primer, no foundation and no powder</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural redhead who&#x27;s hair has turned a brownish color.</li>
            <li>CoverGirl Professional Translucent Face Powder Translucnt Medium(N) 115</li>
            <li>so I went directly to amazon.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a \\&quot;natural,</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>(I have oily and sensitive skin-</li>
            <li>went swimming for the 4th of July and was genuinely surprised at how well my makeup stayed on.</li>
            <li>This product really appealed to me, in the hopes that I could finally get that look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>So far it gave me the coverage and tint</li>
            <li>Looks natural.</li>
            <li>I love it and wish I hadn&#x27;t bought a couple of tubes of a different product a few months ago as this is what I want to wear now.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m a sample addict, and I&#x27;ve tried several BB&#x27;s lately (as these are the trendy things....  </li>
            <li>I am pale and got the light color.  </li>
            <li>but this is very light weight and subtle.</li>
            <li>It is very natural, and others can barely tell whether I am using it.</li>
            <li>Still, though, in very small quantities, it&#x27;s a bit better looking than bare-faced</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 and for the last couple of years have really been struggling with an oily t-zone and dry skin everywhere else, LOTS of redness and large pores from acne rosacea.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup and this product actually covers better than the mineral makeup I&#x27;ve been stuck on for the past couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so it should last a decent time.</li>
            <li>It provides enough sheer coverage that I could wear it alone, but is not so heavy that I can&#x27;t put concealer on top, if I so need (which I frequently do).  </li>
            <li>I would highly, highly recommend this for anyone, especially for anyone suffering from rosacea.</li>
            <li>I started wearing makeup in junior high school, and back then the prevailing mentality was that if you were going to wear makeup, you needed to wear foundation to protect your skin.  </li>
            <li>The texture is gritty and unpleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t smooth over the skin very easily.</li>
            <li>When I use it, my skin looks slightly dewy, fresh, and totally natural.</li>
            <li>I am not dark</li>
            <li>I also found this product does not fail in summer heat &amp; fine during the cold winter months when my sensitive skin tends to get much dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have very light skin, as well as a complex facial complexion.</li>
            <li>(I have dry skin) and I absolutely had to wear a moisturizer under it.  </li>
            <li>then Laura Geller Real Deal Concealer for under eye bags and occasional red spots.</li>
            <li>use this cream daily to go to work as I think my foundation is a bit much for daily routine and just for the office</li>
            <li>I was very nervous, since many are so expensive.  </li>
            <li>About $10 bucks at the major drug stores.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a BB cream that does not contain sunscreen (sunscreen in make up products cause breakouts and major shine on my face).</li>
            <li>My only question is why is the exact same product is $18.99 on Amazon and only $8.00 at the dreaded Wal-mart.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a vague marketing claim that consumers should approach with a healthy skepticism and realistic expectations.</li>
            <li>It makes for a decent primer especially if normal primers cause breakouts or feel too thick on you.  </li>
            <li>Once I blend it out, it looks a little better, but it is still too dark for my face.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal is not a cosmetic I generally buy</li>
            <li>The item arrives much faster than expected.</li>
            <li>if you ever wanted a natural look this will definitely help!</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by the coverage because I never would have thought it would be enough for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;6)Seems to last all day and looks so natural and unmade-</li>
            <li>As a long time user of Lancome foundation and moisturizer, I find myself reaching for this product first over the much more expensive line.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite beauty secret ever.  </li>
            <li>So I was looking for something that was super light weight but would make at least a small difference in evening</li>
            <li>I WEAR IT ALONE AND FEEL IT IS JUST THE RIGHT FINISHING TOUCH WITHOUT ANY HEAVY FOUNDATION WHICH OFTEN MAKES YOU LOOK</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think someone with normal or dry skin would have this problem.</li>
            <li>I also tested it on other parts of my body and the exact same thing happend!</li>
            <li>If you let it sit for a little and dab a little more on trouble areas, you CAN get a little more</li>
            <li>It primes extremely well and is very hydrating without feeling oily.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other BB creams, the L&#x27;Oreal option is reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is, I have light skin</li>
            <li>When I first got this I thought wow what a rip off so small tube.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a bummer because now I have a whole tube of BB cream that is just too dark for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally a fan of L&#x27;Oreal products and this was the third BB Cream that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I am African American and Puerto Rican,  my skin color is not dark,  I wouldn&#x27;t even say tan.  </li>
            <li>I am never able to achieve that dewy, fresh faced look.  </li>
            <li>Studio Secrets Magic B.B. Cream, Light, 1 Fluid Ounce]] is very gritty and is worthless in terms of providing any coverage whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other brands in that time, but found them all to be much heavier and thicker, like foundation, and several made my face break out.</li>
            <li>I wear this and Liquid Eyeliner in black and I am ready to go when I am in a hurry.</li>
            <li>One the plus side, you only have to use a very small amount of product to get visible change in the tone and appearance of skin - however - the color has a pretty strong orange base, so it&#x27;s really easy to go from natural and improved complexion, to looking like</li>
            <li>I have tried several expensive (\\&quot;American\\&quot; - apparently BB creams from Asia are 100x better)</li>
            <li>It is very light, and I think that is the reason it fails to even my skin tone and cover up imperfections.  </li>
            <li>It is very light, and I think that is the reason it fails to even my skin tone and cover up imperfections.  </li>
            <li>I usually wear Light in Maybelline and other drugstore brand cosmetics.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker than a tinted moisturizer, but I really like that</li>
            <li>seems like i am hardly putting anything on, but it really does work at diminishing my old age spots.</li>

            <li> (I have very fair skin), but when I set it with powder, it looks perfect.  </li>
            <li> It does not give very good coverage</li>
            <li> Very good make-up:</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin that is combination (oily t-zone/normal everywhere else).</li>
            <li> Covers pores and has very good coverage.</li>
            <li> Also it feels incredible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to wear foundation at all with this stuff - it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Good BB cream!</li>
            <li> (Probably not the best for someone who has fair skin.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fair is great!</li>
            <li> and I thought it covered beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I wipe off the remainder and it still looks great.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great</li>
            <li> This is a great product I just stumbled on with a sample from a magazine.  </li>
            <li> and my face isnt really in great shape.  </li>
            <li> It evens it out, covers redness, smooths appearance of skin and great blackhead coverage.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so happy with this drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li> it made my skin look great</li>
            <li> This product is great for the summer months.</li>
            <li> This product was great.</li>
            <li> This product covers great and makes my skin look smoother.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with thus BB cream.  </li>
            <li> but it did a great job at evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Feels like silk on your skin and stays on great.</li>
            <li> This product is really great</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> My favorite product I have ever bought!!</li>
            <li> The price is also very nice.</li>
            <li> Both are amazing!</li>
            <li> stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> it was really amazing!</li>
            <li> It gives my face a nice glow and covers all the imperfections that come with age!</li>
            <li> I read so many great reviews about this product that I decided that I had to try it out!</li>
            <li> Excellent, I love it.</li>
            <li> The minute that I put it on my face it turned a bright orange color</li>
            <li> It is light and covers superbly!!!</li>
            <li> I will try the Fair and see how that goes.  </li>
            <li> If Fair doesn&#x27;t work, then I will have to change brands.  </li>
            <li> I did consider writing off my error and trying the fair shade but have decided not to so.  </li>
            <li> would try the fair</li>
            <li> I get this brand of BB cream all the time but the light that I ordered from here came out as bright orange!!!!</li>
            <li> It is good in the summer when I want a tan look, but it requires a lot of blending.  </li>
            <li> And not in a good way.</li>
            <li> Who thought this was a good idea?</li>
            <li> You may find yourself on the cover of a tabloid magazine, and NOT in a good way. ;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to be fair skinned either.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good for oliy skin</li>
            <li> I got a sample from a magazine add and loved it.</li>
            <li> cream works great as a primer, but it even provides sufficient coverage on its own when I have a hive breakout.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;good qality, good value</li>
            <li> but the light shade works great for me!</li>
            <li> The light tone is perfect.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you are caucasian and your complexion is fair.</li>
            <li> and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> so she should know what is good for her.</li>
            <li> This cream is too orangy for someone with fair skin like me.</li>
            <li> If you have medium skin tone I would recommend it but not for fair people.</li>
            <li> I wish that make it truly a fair shade.</li>
            <li> I also like the way it mattified my face which kept my face from looking oily for a good couple hours</li>
            <li> My skin is kind of light/fair, so I want sure which color to get, but fair is perfect.</li>
            <li> so i loved the fair</li>
            <li> I have a fair complexion, but not too fair.</li>
            <li> I tried it anyway and LOVED it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great moisterizing on days when I forget to bring my own</li>
            <li> I have fair skin; I always use a fair foundation and the lightest concealer.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin; I always use a fair foundation and the lightest concealer.  </li>
            <li> I used the Light and it seems to be perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am delighted that it is a drugstore item.  </li>
            <li> I feel great putting this on instead of makeup because it feels lighter and  seems better for my skin.</li>
            <li> and I am SO happy I ordered more.</li>
            <li> It also feels real nice and light on my skin.</li>
            <li> Best part is its great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately, however, it is the BEST make-up I&#x27;ve ever used, as it goes on smoothly, stays fresh-looking for many hours, and doesn&#x27;t change color after you apply it correctly (ensuring you cause the micro-beads to release fully).  </li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love it!</li>
            <li> ok if you are using it on it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> This was the top!  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of this products and for the first five minutes, was quite impressed with it.</li>
            <li> cause it makes my face have more color!</li>
            <li> This stuff really is MAGIC!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> This is the first product that allows me to wear makeup with a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical!</li>
            <li> my favorite BB cream!&lt;br /&gt;it does the job!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Would love to find a sheerer light-weight BB for oilier skin!</li>
            <li> It provides a perfect &amp;#34;middle of the road&amp;#34; between no make up (which no on wants to see!)</li>
            <li> I liked the Youth Code BB Cream Illuminator so much better!</li>
            <li> I have very light skin and bought the fair shade.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that amazing.</li>
            <li> The combination is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> and she says makeup glides on smoothly and her skin feels great.  </li>
            <li> And my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely and is not oily at all.</li>
            <li> Nice color.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use fair, but more as the &amp;#34;highlight&amp;#34; part when I&#x27;m contouring.</li>
            <li> my skin tone with a nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it would be a good if you need more coverage.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizes nicely and gives a nice even color.  </li>
            <li> I never used a BB cream before buying this one, so I really have no basis of comparison, but it has worked wonderfully for me.</li>
            <li> Good deal, better product.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice finish and with blush and powder is all I need.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own -</li>
            <li> Perfect when you don&#x27;t have alot of time to get ready.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even buy this stuff with any intention of it helping my under eye area, so you can imagine how completely happy I was so see such wonderful coverage (for a BB cream)!&lt;br</li>
            <li> All opinions are honest and original.makeup at all.  </li>
            <li> Puts a nice sheen on my face and adjusts to my skin color.</li>
            <li> Blends beautifully and the coverage is great and natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I apply a SUPER light moisturizer underneath, but I don&#x27;t feel like this is moisturizing for someone who is looking for that type of product - perfect for me since I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old, and my complexion is naturally very good, but today it was just gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> I noticed almost right away that my skin tone was beautifully even.</li>
            <li> The color blends perfect and it really looks as if you have no makeup on, just a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> Easy application and good coverage.  </li>
            <li> This BB cream truly is &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;: goes on very light, but evens skin tone nicely and has a durable matte finish that makes pores invisible.</li>
            <li> what I loved about it is that, immediately, and for several hours afterward, it eliminated my &#x27;shiny&#x27; skin and gives me this fresh, and flawless skin that looks great in daylight and in pictures</li>
            <li> The color just kind of sits on top of your skin, and makes you look a bit like a greasy orange mannequin.  </li>
            <li> I honestly just put this on with no need of any more make up.</li>
            <li> The fair version is too light for me, but tolerable with using the Avon over it.</li>
            <li> The fair version is too light for me, but tolerable with using the Avon over it.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> The product itself is great and very much to my liking for an unexperienced BB cream user; hopefully the color problem can be overcome.  </li>
            <li> It still gives me that very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> On the positive side it is not greasy, blends easily with good coverage and does a good job of evening</li>
            <li> I wear it alone without foundation most days.</li>
            <li> It is hands-down the most unflattering cosmetic I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> and it was okay.  </li>
            <li> My favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a glow better than a bronzer.</li>
            <li> Love it and wear it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> i love it, but I need to order the lighter shade.  </li>
            <li> BEST BB cream available as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> My skin is more light than fair, so I went with the light shade as I did not want to look &#x27;chalky&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy as well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The best part about this is it mimics the natural smooth texture of the skin better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I really love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily with or without makeup and it feels awesome!</li>

            <li> LOVE THIS BB CREAM</li>
            <li> Love this cream</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t write a review unless I love the product I have purchase.</li>
            <li> im in love with this loreal bb cream.</li>
            <li> Love it love</li>
            <li> Ok type..</li>
            <li> Boo ya enjoy ladies!</li>
            <li> and I think it stays in place better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream.  </li>
            <li> If I am going out or want a tad more coverage</li>
            <li> I use the L&#x27;Oreal magic nude liquid powder.</li>
            <li> I used to love mineral powder, but it would catch in the peach fuzz hairs and look cakey.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have given this one a shot.</li>
            <li> Still love it, still will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin look.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this, but make sure it fits your skin tone.</li>
            <li> buying more.</li>
            <li> It just makes my skin look better, which I love.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this product makes my skin look... except for the color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is way better than the $40-something that I was spending on Smashbox foundation...not to mention primer, powder etc.</li>
            <li> I have always objected to the texture of most foundations, I can&#x27;t stand the feel of them on my skin.</li>
            <li> But those go away and the more you rub the lotion on, the more it changes to its color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure once summer comes around it will even out more for</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This BB cream makes my skin look nice and smooth</li>
            <li> , 0.7-Ounce Shaker top jar (</li>
            <li> This is more of a medium shade.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I get some color this summer I will be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I love BB Cream and I purchase it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does not have the moisture content that I love with BRCK&lt;</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feels so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Sure, it works well and my skin looks better, but no product is going to make our skin \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; or \\&quot;flawless.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> How many uses?</li>
            <li> Just like the item&#x27;s name, it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I love how the L&#x27;oreal cream changes to match your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 6 different brands of BB cream and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> Then, to top off the orange-faced clown look</li>
            <li> My skin just looked more even and had a bit of a glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you put it on your skin you&#x27;ll see why it&#x27;s appropriately named &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> So make sure you add a pop of color with blush and bronzer.</li>
            <li> I love it and hope L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t decide to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; it to a CC cream.</li>
            <li> it was more watery</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d use it more on \\&quot;no make-up\\&quot; days and make sure I wash my face before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to wear just this on the weekends when running my errands.</li>
            <li> I love, love,</li>
            <li> I LOVE this BB</li>
            <li> not noticeably so.&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is AMAZING and the formula goes on smoothly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> you will love the change</li>
            <li> , I realize it isn&#x27;t any better than the Mary Kay product that I use already.</li>
            <li> OK, It has helped some.</li>
            <li> Beauty products have changed a lot over the years, mostly for the better, and now, we have options regarding what type of coverage we want.  </li>
            <li> It just helps me get a more even look.  </li>
            <li> So, it stood to reason that I would need the lightest shade of Magic BB cream.  </li>
            <li> I think L&#x27;Oreal foundation is probably better suited to my coverage needs than the Magic BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>

            <li> They should hire me to endorse for them! :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal, you really did a great job on this one.</li>
            <li> My husband commented right away that my skin looked gorgeous.</li>
            <li> All opinions are honest and original.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Fair color first.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone as it is one of the best skin products that I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good but is not a miracle worker.  </li>
            <li> found that the best way for me to use this product is by first moisturizing my skin as I normally would, then using Magic BB cream in place of foundation.  </li>
            <li> I bought this BB cream and the Maybelline BB cream at the same time to find the best fit for my skin.</li>
            <li> Scared me at first when I got because it comes out a grey color and feels gritty, but it is amazing the color is perfect for my skin tone and makes my skin look flawless!</li>
            <li> Feels a bit gritty going on but that feeling disappears very quickly and leaves skin smooth, hydrated and flawless looking.</li>
            <li> This is WAY darker and more orange than Maybelline&#x27;s BB cream in light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe this light as more of a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love about it, is that it is so lightweight and goes on really smooth.  </li>
            <li> Its smooth, the tone is much more even than with Aveeno.</li>
            <li> It blends so well that it does not look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup - which is precisely why I love it, but you can see the color when you wipe your face with a tissue at the end of the day to remove your makeup.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually more of a medium, but I decided to by the light to avoid any make-up marks.</li>
            <li> It covers flaws and makes my skin love fabulous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how good or not got it is.</li>
            <li> Not to mention I want to get ready quick but still look great.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite product!!</li>
            <li> Oh, and if you don&#x27;t like the color when you first try it, make sure you try another shade!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic, whereby it transforms from a creamy, shiny near-white substance into an explosion of color so rich that you would think it has self-tanning properties.  </li>
            <li> This is so easy to thrown on before work</li>
            <li> If it had sunscreen in it, I would easily give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> 1st time was great - creamy consistency, second tube was more like water.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to reapply a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I still love this and would recommend as it provides coverage, is smooth and lightweight and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> easy application.</li>
            <li> After that dries I use either Philosophy&#x27;s Keep the Peace corrector as a primer (also helps a little with the redness, but mostly reduces the appearance of pores and fine lines and makes the BB cream glide like silk) or Avon Magix (best primer</li>
            <li> One of the great things about BB Creams is that they (generally) are moisturizers, treatments, primers, bases and SPF all in one.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;light\\&quot; color is too dark for me, so I gave it to a friend and purchased the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; tone... its perfect!</li>
            <li> I actually use a mixture of light and medium and looks good!  </li>
            <li> I am glad that others&#x27; reviews are true, and I will continue to use this bb cream.</li>
            <li> Looks nice at first, but then it turns orange on your skin after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> However, those claims to perfect and correct were also a let down to me, so I need to use spot corrector and undereye concealer, as well as powder.  </li>
            <li> Setting into any fine lines and amplifying a caked-on look, it does quite the opposite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> it is light and blends easily.  </li>
            <li> It matches my neck and chest fine, but the color seems to lack any color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite impressed with the slight tint--</li>
            <li> People noticed that very first day i used it, and more have noticed since.</li>
            <li> Still love it, still will repurchase.heads, but honestly my skin was just adjusting to the new product.</li>
            <li> They say things like &amp;#34;your skin looks so nice, what are you doing&amp;#34; figuring a new vitamin, detox tea or something :)</li>
            <li> I am madly in love with this super light makeup.</li>
            <li> The color of my foundation is fairly light by Bare Minerals, so I really thought this would be the perfect color, because I didn&#x27;t want something way too light.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much !!</li>
            <li> and my face ends up looking flawless - like I&#x27;m wearing little to no makeup at all.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine, okay, but It has NO SPF, so right off the bat</li>
            <li> you made a huge mistake while playing with self tanner.</li>
            <li> it was too light,  </li>
            <li> I then tried the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34;, which was also too light, it was a joke.</li>
            <li> I use the Light in BB cream and it works well.</li>
            <li> It also doubles as a moisturizer which greatly simplifies my daily morning routine.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> and I would buy it again, just not in this light color.  </li>
            <li> , It is so light that I don&#x27;t even feel you&#x27;re wearing a foundation.  </li>
            <li> and since then, she has been asking me where I got it and wants her own.  </li>
            <li> I will use the light color in the winter and medium in the summer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The color on me is very orange and looks kind of greasy.  </li>
            <li> It has a smooth matte finish that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even lightly buildable.</li>
            <li> Goes on  smoothly.  </li>
            <li> so I bought the light shade</li>
            <li> It covers a lot of my light acne scars and evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Goes on light, doesn&#x27;t cause pimples.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this BB cream is so light and doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> wear light to light/med Foundation.</li>
            <li> I wear light shade in this brand.  </li>
            <li> I started using a self-tanner and bumped up to the Light.</li>
            <li> , it goes on smooth &amp; leaves my skin amazing/flawless, for a fact I will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> Its light, oil free and non foundation like cream.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> (Seems to be too light to cover scars.)</li>
            <li> I have light skin</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell where it ends on my face, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> well, the &#x27;light&#x27; makes me look orange.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help smooth my skin out.</li>
            <li> It feels cheap and looks cheap on the skin</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and looks even-toned after use</li>
            <li> Great primer, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Not drying, goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Skin looks smooth and not &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is light and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> it will change color as you smooth it in...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a BB cream that I could use as a light coverage foundation too.</li>
            <li> just lightly powder and sometimes not even blush</li>
            <li> In makeup products, I always wear light.</li>
            <li> I think the texture, although silky smooth, feels mask-like.</li>
            <li> If you have really light skin get this bb cream in the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; shade and not the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; one .</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, I think this product has a lot of potential for some women, but I just do not think it was a great match for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, I think this product has a lot of potential for some women, but I just do not think it was a great match for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin is light to medium with an olive undertone, and the light works well with it.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin.</li>
            <li> while it looked great for the first hour, after about three, it seemed to wear off at a rate faster than just normal cover up.</li>
            <li> Just this (hopefully in the right color) :)</li>
            <li> This is my first BB and been a great experience so far.</li>
            <li> Light, clean feel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and it works very well.</li>
            <li> But when I started using I realized it goes along way, and doesn&#x27;t take much and spreads really nicely and quick.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a Korean BB cream that literally makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is the best shade for me</li>
            <li> I originally tried using it</li>
            <li> Yes, the price point was cheap, and it is true you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> The only nice thing about this cream is it blends on very smooth.</li>
            <li> Most of the others just seem like tinted moisturizer, but this one covers all the little flaws and makes you look and feel great.</li>
            <li> it covers imperfections feels very light, and takes very little time to apply, one of the best bb creams I have tried , and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I love this product it works beautifully and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your face!</li>
            <li> I love how the bb cream looks more natural.</li>
            <li> 90% of my redness disappears and my face still feels clean and matte, which it never does with foundation.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the transformation!It is not heavy like foundation but conceals spots, circles and discoloration of the skin better!</li>
            <li> On a special occasion, I had my daughter try it</li>
            <li> First of all, this cream oxidizes, which is uncommon for asian bbcreams.</li>
            <li> But I do like the primer-like texture (silky) and it gives a light coverage as a foundation, so it&#x27;s good for an everyday use (I prefer more coverage if I go out at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would get this in fair next time.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s going to be that pigmented, Loreal is going to have to use their True Match system to accommodate the variety in skin tones.  </li>
            <li> I will say the feel of the cream is lovely but the orange shading, not so much.</li>
            <li> stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moved on to a different product now, but this is a good one as longs as you wear a moisturizer with sunscreen underneath.</li>
            <li> but I would necessarily consider myself fair esp.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t go on the same way as the Fair</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for younger people who have good skin.</li>
            <li> : I recently purchased the FAIR version of this as my summer tan has faded and this one made me look orange.</li>
            <li> : I recently purchased the FAIR version of this as my summer tan has faded and this one made me look orange.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost a dozen bb creams and this is the only one I really loved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several BB creams, but nothing has turned out as good as this.</li>
            <li> and full make up (which I don&#x27;t want to do on the weekends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the full tube</li>
            <li> it really makes a difference for the better.  </li>
            <li> Although this color was too dark for my fair skin, I still love it.</li>
            <li> Provides just the right amount of coverage, no streaks, no oranginess, just smooth looking skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that might be a plus for some people, but I like my BBs to be a little more rich (and offer better coverage).</li>
            <li> (I tend to be dry but for the t-zone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has simplified my routine and so far I am happy. :-)</li>
            <li> I use it on my legs for a quick tan.</li>
            <li> I recently purchase this awesome BB Cream at my local grocery store under $8.00.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure where locally I would be able to buy it</li>
            <li> So unless you are super orange tan, skip this one.</li>
            <li> I first tried this from a free sample package in a fashion magazine, something I have never done before.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim at a duty free store because I had used other B.B. foundations and loved them.  </li>
            <li> It has a ton of preservatives, parabens and yucky chemicals that I normally avoid so you would expect it to be more stable, but</li>
            <li> I purchased this in light and it turned my skin an orangey tint which was a first for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty light colored</li>
            <li> My new favorite.</li>
            <li> I just use it everyday in the morning and my skin looks fresh and naturally beautiful.</li>
            <li> I first tried a sample that was in a magazine!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m about ready to throw that out (although its great for sweating in the summer, but makes my nose look dry).</li>
            <li> First, it does not blend well on clean or moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> I had to finally tan myself to get it to match, but it does make my skin look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> The coverage is light - it adds a bit of color and does even the skin tone and obscure (but not so much cover)</li>
            <li> That along with my thyroid meds was destroying my normally great skin.</li>
            <li> Third, when I take this stuff off my face doesn&#x27;t look nice</li>
            <li> Great product when you have to get ready fast makes your skin glow without all the extra fuss..</li>
            <li> But after trying it I honestly will never go back to another product.</li>
            <li> while everything looked okay in the dim light of my bathroom, the reality is that this cream does not blend very well.</li>
            <li> If you have a different skin tone and type it might look nice on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottomline, it&#x27;s nothing like the Korean BBs I&#x27;ve tried, I wouldn&#x27;t even classify it as the same kind of product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed a bit of the product on my finger, and it looked so light - so innocuous, that I put more on my face than I would have with regular make-up.  </li>
            <li> This light color might actually work for someone who is more tan though.</li>
            <li> This offers better coverage than some concealers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> 35 years old, mostly even skin tone.</li>
            <li> Anyway I am positively surprised and love this BB.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite BB so far.</li>
            <li> * Love the natural look it</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this stuff has worked so well for me that I had to.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still well worth it.</li>
            <li> But when hubby is home, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable going completely makeup free.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste it on a makeup free day because it has no spf, but it does act as a good primer substitute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Korean BB creams with some success, except I have darker skin and can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> : I received a complimentary product courtesy of  SheSpeaks and L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al for review purposes.  </li>
            <li> : I received a complimentary product courtesy of  SheSpeaks and L&#x27;Oréal for review purposes.  </li>
            <li> The color is a tad yellow for me, but I wear a light foundation &amp; bronzer on top of the BB cream</li>
            <li> I rarely go without makeup</li>
            <li> kinda fun to watch.</li>
            <li> Even when a super small amount is used, it feels a bit gross/heavy on my face, surprisingly so for how light the coverage is.</li>
            <li> and it still corrects my redness and gives me great, natural looking coverage that usually lasts me most of the day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34; qualities and rubs right off.</li>
            <li> it  gives just the right of tint of color</li>
            <li> and this one is just right.</li>
            <li> Right color for olive skin.</li>
            <li> Considering I was using this right before attending a formal event...</li>
            <li> The color is right.</li>
            <li> ,right?</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t really know how this is a &#x27;Light&#x27; Shade.</li>
            <li> I rarely try new products due to sensitive skin, but this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> I tried the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where all these great reviews are coming from, because my experience with this product was god-awful.  </li>
            <li> Turns kinda dark on my fair skin.  </li>
            <li> thought dark and medium would work for me, even though I have fair skin.  </li>
            <li> Feels like silicone and very fine sand mixed together.</li>
            <li> It covers blemishes and most of my freckles, leaving just a few visibly cute ones.  </li>
            <li> A good natural looking product that replaces using several others in its place.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a different BB such as Pond&#x27;s to anyone looking for a great product and value.</li>
            <li> thank u very much</li>
            <li> it went on smoothly and covered better than any other product i have ever used on my face.</li>
            <li> so when I first started using the product I used Medium</li>
            <li> Looks natural because it&#x27;s light coverage but still can hide some flaws.</li>
            <li> It makes my face so clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I ordered several tubes of it to give to my girls and to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li> Light, but offers coverage and stays on.  </li>
            <li> First off, there isn&#x27;t any SPF.  </li>
            <li> The grittiness is evident from the moment I tried to apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li> Up until recently this was the better of the \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; bb cream products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> This is the only reason I did not give it more</li>
            <li> This is very tan (dark) on my fair skin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try it for the first time just before you go out.  </li>
            <li> It should be noted that my skin has more yellow undertones</li>
            <li> So this is the first time i have used a BB Cream</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I am wearing it to bed in a hot summer night in the desert, so I guess I will know in 12 hours if it stands up to the hype.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t contain any sunscreen like many others do, so I have to layer another product on my face.</li>
            <li> I brought it not knowing exactly what it was supposed to do (foundation, primer,concealer, or moisterizer?).  </li>
            <li> But, it blends pretty well.</li>
            <li> (didn&#x27;t want to wear make-up because it was extremely hot)</li>
            <li> apply my rosacea medication (Finacea - which was a dream come true and cleared all the itchy acne rosacea) and 5 minutes later apply a light coating of Lubriderm moisturizer.</li>
            <li> First of all.</li>
            <li> I also have NOT broken out (yet?!)</li>
            <li> Therefore, I was interested in this product because of the promise of an \\&quot;all-in-one\\</li>
            <li> Like most skin makeup, this product does not come in enough diverse skin tones&lt;</li>
            <li> It really does make your skin look dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li> I ordered light and it was too dark, maybe better for summer.</li>
            <li> My face looks ten times better with it.</li>
            <li> I also noticed a lot more white heads after using this product.</li>
            <li> so I love this product as it evens out my red areas and hides pores without looking like I&#x27;m wearing make up</li>
            <li> love Amazon but not enough to pay $10 more for the same product.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and didn&#x27;t like it at first because it was gray.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this at Target.</li>
            <li> I am definitely buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> but I would probably be willing to apply only this to my skin to run errands and feel confident.</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cream, so I cannot compare with others.</li>
            <li> I am a medium-to-light black hispanic woman and the match was very good overall</li>
            <li> While this is no fault of the product itself, consumers to need to be aware how very light (white really)</li>
            <li> While this is no fault of the product itself, consumers to need to be aware how very light (white really)</li>
            <li> Other then that I really liked the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend to use very little at first to see what the color turns and blend it in a good amount.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it does not feel heavy at all, if feels like you are make up free.</li>
            <li> Because my skin has an uneven tone and color, I most often still opt for a light foundation.  </li>
            <li> fresh face\\&quot; look, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> But this product does pretty much all of that.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and usually use the Ivory shades.</li>
            <li> Fair has never been a color match for me, and not sure I would buy another just to test it.</li>
            <li> The true test is waiting to see if it breaks my sensitive skin out in acne.</li>
            <li> but usually when I wear &#x27;fair&#x27; colored things I look like a ghost...</li>
            <li> I can get a nice dark tan in the summer.</li>
            <li> My skin looked softer, my dark acne spots were muted, and I had a nice matte palette on which to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> Also, I have oily skin, and within a few minutes time, I experienced major shine breakthrough on my forehead, cheeks, chin, and nose.</li>
            <li> I was soft and silky but for a fair skinner person the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; was still too orange and dark for me.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and actually covers my adult acne scars and does not look cakey at all!  </li>
            <li> I have large pores and I have redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 and have combo skin somewhat large pores.  </li>
            <li> And that is certainly a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And that is certainly a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently had an opportunity to try the new Magic BB Cream from L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li> After the initial application, my skin looked better than it does without makeup, and even with this B.B. cream on, it looked very natural...</li>
            <li> The color was just fine, not to orangey or white.</li>
            <li> Well, when I put it on, it turned from white to super orange!  </li>
            <li> which is huge) and it actually lasts longer when I just wear it on</li>
            <li> I really like the feel and coverage of this product; however, I am struggling with the color.  </li>
            <li> I decided to stop tanning and see where I really was with skin damage, tone, aging, etc.</li>
            <li> I use too much cream accidentally, it is tinted orange.</li>
            <li> I suggest if you order this to get a much lighter shade than your color.</li>
            <li> do like the amount of coverage I get with this product (sheer to medium coverage), and how light weight and nongreasy</li>
            <li> I really believe my skin tone and appearance has improved with this.</li>
            <li> I really dislike wearing makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flattering.</li>
            <li> I took a risk in buying this product, I really had no idea what BB cream was.</li>
            <li> They are still there, but they just don&#x27;t stand out so much</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot, L&#x27;oreal!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> you want the real stuff, stick to korean lines.</li>
            <li> It feels like and smooth, and helps my make-up last through the day.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> It tends to give an orange hue if you don&#x27;t blend it in really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall though, I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> I personally really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and sheer, but covers and evens out skin tone</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I was using Clinque foundation for years, and I have very oily skin, and by the end of the day, my makeup would be melted off.</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t say much</li>
            <li> Of course I think the satisfaction with the product would really depend on your needs and skin type</li>
            <li> It feels so much lighter than a foundation and allows my skin to breathe, while leaving it feeling moisturized and looking evened out and polished.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sister and I&#x27;ve used the whole tube up.</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> * Doesn&#x27;t really help with scars.</li>
            <li> I think I REALLY like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Too much to ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> reason I love this product (so far - it has been a week) is that while accomplishing all that stated above, it really looks like I am not wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li> only use a light moisturizer on my drier spots under this</li>
            <li> use too much.</li>
            <li> It goes on white and becomes invisible and it is light on the skin and it helps the skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> I am 61 and do not wear makeup much because it looks too cakey and sometimes itches.</li>
            <li> How much time?</li>
            <li> Plus the color was very yellowy on my skin.</li>
            <li> THANKS Kandee!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;m not really a fan.</li>
            <li> If a bit too much is applied, it makes my skin&#x27;s texture look rougher instead of smoother.</li>
            <li> I bought the light shade and might bump up one shade as I get further into the summer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much and it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel caked or oily.  </li>
            <li> east indian with beige skin (I use revlon photo ready airbrush foundaiton in the shade toast and</li>
            <li> goes on so smoothly and adds moisture at the same time.</li>
            <li> The BB Cream is much darker than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> have rosacea and this evens out the skin tone nicely, without being heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to BB creams, so this literally is the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other but none compares to this one.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely matte, and when I go to put my foundation on top of it</li>
            <li> It is different from the sample I originally tried.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; product, but I think it would be better if it came in a more natural shade option, with a slightly denser formula to make application easier.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different foundations - everything from drug store brands to Bare Minerals, Laura Geller,</li>
            <li> It contains micro-beads of pigment, that, when you rub onto your skin, break open to reveal the true color of the make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> The color &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is so dark and orange on my skin that I would not be able to wear it even in the summer.</li>
            <li> The pigment beads blend in pretty seamlessly.</li>
            <li> My normal routine now is to wash my face with a gentle cleanser (I use Neutragena Naturals)</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product but it is white and changes shades after applied.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and absorbs nicely!</li>
            <li> only reason I gave it 4 stars vs 5 is that it can be a bit drying to my skin, because of this I have just ordered the original product that launched all of these new B.B. from Korea.  </li>
            <li> The thing that worked for me was to keep the tip pointed up, and to very gently squeeze the bottle until a small amount of product came to the top.</li>
            <li> m really iffy about trying new products</li>
            <li> LESS IS MORE</li>
            <li> Did a decent job correcting some redness, but not discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> YOU ARE OLDER THAN YOU ARE.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent at controlling oil too, however I find I still need to touch up with a shine control powder from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but as I have gotten older I feel like it just doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore</li>
            <li> more expensive, better quality do</li>
            <li> Two of the main ingredients are dimethicone and glycerin.</li>
            <li> The main benefit of this cream is evening and coverage.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve listened to the pros in saying less is more.  </li>
            <li> The main reason I am writing is I have oily skin (even at 42) and this product makes me a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> think one of the reasons I ran into so many problems is that I chose the wrong color of Magic BB cream.  </li>
            <li> think one of the reasons I ran into so many problems is that I chose the wrong color of Magic BB cream.  </li>
            <li> I tried this one in particular b/c a blogger I follow suggested it</li>
            <li> THIS MAKES YOU SKIN LOOKS VERY NATURAL ON AN OLD GIRL!!!</li>
            <li> but I recently bought L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi Primer and will add occasionally for a little more glow.</li>
            <li> Very surprised!</li>
            <li> I use this with a loose powder dusted over for a light coverage.  </li>
            <li> (overwhelming, time consuming, and expensive!), and I need something that is easy and quick to apply in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product has a high color saturation, which has its pros and cons.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I have high ends BB creams</li>
            <li> But for me it provided very light coverage and dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> It still gives me that very smooth feeling.ly reason I&#x27;m taking 1 star off of this BB cream is because like others said, it definitely is not as light as it could be.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the L&#x27;oreal BB cream</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I tried mixing a drop or two with my zinc sunscreen and the result was a little better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t adapt to your skin tone quite as well as some other BB creams claim to, so you definitely need to get a more exact tone</li>
            <li> I purchased the light shade which is a little too dark, next time I will get fair.</li>
            <li> and I have a very polished yet natural look.  </li>
            <li> Overall, while I enjoy using BB cream, I am still suspicious about the BB cream product in general, regardless of brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can definitely build up the amount of product to get greater coverage, however I would probably only recommend that for a person who already has a considerable tan.</li>
            <li> worth noting is, I think I will purchase this a shade lighter next time.</li>
            <li> When I have a date with friends, I refuse to go out with makeup and thus use my normal foundation.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is pretty light with some neutral/slightly yellow understones, but I&#x27;m not super white like a sheet of paper, so I purchased this in the light color.  </li>
            <li> Due to the texture and consistency it settles into your fine lines.</li>
            <li> The color match was nice once it settled in, but it had an odd gritty texture when I spread it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I normally get a light to medium or medium in other brands.</li>
            <li> I ordered the light and it was extremely orange not at all like the color from the sample I got in a magazine.  </li>
            <li> I normally use [[ASIN:B0086HW5TI Avon Extra Lasting Liquid Foundation SPF 12 LIGHT IVORY]]</li>
            <li> I did get a couple of little bumps on my hairline that never formed white heads, but honestly my skin was just adjusting to the new product.</li>
            <li> but I decided to purchase this BB cream since I am a product junkie and want to try out new things.</li>
            <li> I break out the moment I try new things, but I haven&#x27;t with this.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few effective on the tiny lines around my eyes &amp; lips.  </li>
            <li> The packaging wasn&#x27;t very clear on that.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but no breakout issues with this either.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> This primer evens out my overall tone very, very well.  </li>
            <li> i bought the light and it&#x27;s way too dark.</li>
            <li> Just now I ordered from Drugstore.com and paid $10.95 for first one, and a second for 50% off.</li>
            <li> makeup, especially during the hot and humid summer months.</li>
            <li> I am not one of those women who is willing to buy a lot of different skin primers/powders/foundations, etc.</li>
            <li> Gives me a natural look!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in light at the drug store and find that it is too dark for me.</li>
            <li> It does feels gritty when it first comes out</li>
            <li> My skin looked so dry, and the pigment in the Magic BB cream was concentrated on those areas of dry skin,</li>
            <li> /&gt;2)A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;3)Magically \\&quot;corrects\\&quot; to your own skin color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I switched to the light shade and it seems a bit too dark and orange for my now natural skin color.  </li>
            <li> This one is the firs BB cream I tried and it hands down remains my favorite and the one I use daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at my local store for full price for less than what most of the other BB creams cost.</li>
            <li> light skin tone, blackheads in T-zone, dry in the winter, sometimes oily in T-zone,no acne or scars, but occasional pimple here and there.</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry skin and some light freckles, but up until recently didn&#x27;t have any issue with blemishes or discoloration.</li>
            <li> Less actually looks better.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it was white as it came out of the tube but when applied to my face it really did even out my skin tone in a very natural way that seemed to make my skin glow.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a light coverage foundation with little UV protection and an overpriced cost.</li>
            <li> I also use a tiny bit of my Avon liquid foundation if I feel I need a little more cover or evening out as</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this product, I bought it out of curiosity but its not worth the price</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised and had to have a tube.</li>
            <li> You could probably add directly to a sponge and apply to your face, but I felt like the product was wet enough that either a ton would be absorbed by the sponge, or else too much product would end up on my face giving me oompa loompa</li>
            <li> I much prefer an actual BB to a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I look so natural.  </li>
            <li> and I was surprised that this cream evened out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> After I wash my face, my skin feels so soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Also, I have naturally tan skin</li>
            <li> It only took a dab to do my whole face.</li>
            <li> It does not have SPF in it as far as I know, the tube says nothing of the sort.</li>
            <li> This product cost $10 at the drugstore and you only need a nickle size dollop on your hand to do the whole face.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> I go thru a lot of different make up because I am very picky</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft and smooth,its like wearing nothing at all.</li>
            <li> I can wear this completely by itself with nothing else - no primer, no foundation and no powder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead who&#x27;s hair has turned a brownish color.</li>
            <li> CoverGirl Professional Translucent Face Powder Translucnt Medium(N) 115</li>
            <li> so I went directly to amazon.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a \\&quot;natural,</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> (I have oily and sensitive skin-</li>
            <li> went swimming for the 4th of July and was genuinely surprised at how well my makeup stayed on.</li>
            <li> This product really appealed to me, in the hopes that I could finally get that look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> So far it gave me the coverage and tint</li>
            <li> Looks natural.</li>
            <li> I love it and wish I hadn&#x27;t bought a couple of tubes of a different product a few months ago as this is what I want to wear now.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m a sample addict, and I&#x27;ve tried several BB&#x27;s lately (as these are the trendy things....  </li>
            <li> I am pale and got the light color.  </li>
            <li> but this is very light weight and subtle.</li>
            <li> It is very natural, and others can barely tell whether I am using it.</li>
            <li> Still, though, in very small quantities, it&#x27;s a bit better looking than bare-faced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and for the last couple of years have really been struggling with an oily t-zone and dry skin everywhere else, LOTS of redness and large pores from acne rosacea.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup and this product actually covers better than the mineral makeup I&#x27;ve been stuck on for the past couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it should last a decent time.</li>
            <li> It provides enough sheer coverage that I could wear it alone, but is not so heavy that I can&#x27;t put concealer on top, if I so need (which I frequently do).  </li>
            <li> I would highly, highly recommend this for anyone, especially for anyone suffering from rosacea.</li>
            <li> I started wearing makeup in junior high school, and back then the prevailing mentality was that if you were going to wear makeup, you needed to wear foundation to protect your skin.  </li>
            <li> The texture is gritty and unpleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t smooth over the skin very easily.</li>
            <li> When I use it, my skin looks slightly dewy, fresh, and totally natural.</li>
            <li> I am not dark</li>
            <li> I also found this product does not fail in summer heat &amp; fine during the cold winter months when my sensitive skin tends to get much dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have very light skin, as well as a complex facial complexion.</li>
            <li> (I have dry skin) and I absolutely had to wear a moisturizer under it.  </li>
            <li> then Laura Geller Real Deal Concealer for under eye bags and occasional red spots.</li>
            <li> use this cream daily to go to work as I think my foundation is a bit much for daily routine and just for the office</li>
            <li> I was very nervous, since many are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> About $10 bucks at the major drug stores.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a BB cream that does not contain sunscreen (sunscreen in make up products cause breakouts and major shine on my face).</li>
            <li> My only question is why is the exact same product is $18.99 on Amazon and only $8.00 at the dreaded Wal-mart.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a vague marketing claim that consumers should approach with a healthy skepticism and realistic expectations.</li>
            <li> It makes for a decent primer especially if normal primers cause breakouts or feel too thick on you.  </li>
            <li> Once I blend it out, it looks a little better, but it is still too dark for my face.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal is not a cosmetic I generally buy</li>
            <li> The item arrives much faster than expected.</li>
            <li> if you ever wanted a natural look this will definitely help!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the coverage because I never would have thought it would be enough for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;6)Seems to last all day and looks so natural and unmade-</li>
            <li> As a long time user of Lancome foundation and moisturizer, I find myself reaching for this product first over the much more expensive line.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty secret ever.  </li>
            <li> So I was looking for something that was super light weight but would make at least a small difference in evening</li>
            <li> I WEAR IT ALONE AND FEEL IT IS JUST THE RIGHT FINISHING TOUCH WITHOUT ANY HEAVY FOUNDATION WHICH OFTEN MAKES YOU LOOK</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think someone with normal or dry skin would have this problem.</li>
            <li> I also tested it on other parts of my body and the exact same thing happend!</li>
            <li> If you let it sit for a little and dab a little more on trouble areas, you CAN get a little more</li>
            <li> It primes extremely well and is very hydrating without feeling oily.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other BB creams, the L&#x27;Oreal option is reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is, I have light skin</li>
            <li> When I first got this I thought wow what a rip off so small tube.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bummer because now I have a whole tube of BB cream that is just too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally a fan of L&#x27;Oreal products and this was the third BB Cream that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I am African American and Puerto Rican,  my skin color is not dark,  I wouldn&#x27;t even say tan.  </li>
            <li> I am never able to achieve that dewy, fresh faced look.  </li>
            <li> Studio Secrets Magic B.B. Cream, Light, 1 Fluid Ounce]] is very gritty and is worthless in terms of providing any coverage whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands in that time, but found them all to be much heavier and thicker, like foundation, and several made my face break out.</li>
            <li> I wear this and Liquid Eyeliner in black and I am ready to go when I am in a hurry.</li>
            <li> One the plus side, you only have to use a very small amount of product to get visible change in the tone and appearance of skin - however - the color has a pretty strong orange base, so it&#x27;s really easy to go from natural and improved complexion, to looking like</li>
            <li> I have tried several expensive (\\&quot;American\\&quot; - apparently BB creams from Asia are 100x better)</li>
            <li> It is very light, and I think that is the reason it fails to even my skin tone and cover up imperfections.  </li>
            <li> It is very light, and I think that is the reason it fails to even my skin tone and cover up imperfections.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear Light in Maybelline and other drugstore brand cosmetics.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than a tinted moisturizer, but I really like that</li>
            <li> seems like i am hardly putting anything on, but it really does work at diminishing my old age spots.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pale skin like me than don&#x27;t bother because you don&#x27;t want to look like a drag queen if you aren&#x27;t one right?</li>
            <li> It offers very minimal visible results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly a wondrous product, and it will last a very long time, even with daily usage.</li>
            <li> Too bad because the consistency is actually quite nice and is actually a CREAM.</li>
            <li> It does last really long.</li>
            <li> B009Z3MG0K Hard Candy Glamoflauge HEAVY DUTY CONCEALER with pencil (Medium Light shade 488)]] to cover pimples.</li>
            <li> I want something that will look natural and feel natural, while covering (or at least obscuring)</li>
            <li> Oddly though I have had no trouble removing it from my face</li>
            <li> It comes out of the tube white, then turns to a reddish, dry something that sits on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The only skin type this MAY not work for is dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, and I don&#x27;t remember it being quite this off when I first got it, but it has always been too dark.</li>
            <li> but I have to rate this very low because it&#x27;s not a real bbcream, and l&#x27;oreal should be ashamed to sell this as such.</li>
            <li> I have to use so little to avoid the orange that it really doesn&#x27;t work in any other capacity.</li>
            <li> (to where the product runs out of the packaging if the tip if facing in pretty much any direction other than directly up) which made it difficult to apply without making a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other BB creams and actually the regular Loreal BB cream and a couple others.  </li>
            <li> I have very red cheeks and this product definitely makes them less red but doesn&#x27;t make me look all one color either...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and liked other BB creams, but this one&#x27;s a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> This offers just a little bit of coverage, covers up any redness, smooths everything out.</li>
            <li> but it shows up very dark and does not look natural.</li>
            <li> ... seems strange.</li>
            <li> and it seems to help that not complete taking away all the sheen from my skin but its a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this a few weeks ago, I have really sensitive skin &amp; i</li>
            <li> undertones fall somewhere between pink and yellow.</li>
            <li> concealers were to thick or just felt too much...</li>
            <li> When I first squeezed it into my hand, I was super disappointed</li>
            <li> My skin has become slightly dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so I&#x27;m not too worried about feeling overly oily.</li>
            <li> However, because my skin is so dry, it almost always looks like I am wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li> Usually make-up isn&#x27;t so dark because I don&#x27;t apply much.  </li>
            <li> It is not for someone who needs a lot of coverage, but is great for me as I hate the feel of a heavy cake.  </li>
            <li> I only used a small amount of the Magic BB cream, as well as a small amount of foundation, but it still looked like I was wearing stage makeup, not a good look.  </li>
            <li> I have had very little irritation (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t want to get made up I just add enough to hide some of my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise</li>
            <li> It is a tiny bottle (1oz), but you use so little, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I recently began developing idiopathic hives, which tend to appear as small red blemishes on my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it a week and so far no unusual breakouts (they usually would occur before now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make up still comes off the same at night, mascara doesn&#x27;t smudge, &amp; my T-zone is less oily.  </li>
            <li> i was super wrong.</li>
            <li> But basically it&#x27;s a rip-off of the Almay smart shade that came out awhile ago.  </li>
            <li> I would then dab tiny little dots around my face, and then use a sponge to blend.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this and actually did a little youtube research before purchasing this product--</li>
            <li> It comes out of the tube white with little purple beads</li>
            <li> Even if I only add a little to my face and rub it in it still looks orange.</li>
            <li> This cream is a hideous, waxy, chalky, orange color that instantly aged me 10 years.  </li>
            <li> you dont like the feel or heavy coverage of regular makeup</li>
            <li> not fit the asian face.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> only reason I&#x27;m taking 1 star off of this BB cream is because like others said, it definitely is not as light as it could be.</li>
            <li> , you have to be careful with this.</li>
            <li> so again, I looked like I was wearing a lot of makeup, despite the fact that this is a minimal coverage</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not really an issue.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling oily and greasy, and I have dry skin!!  </li>
            <li> I like (PALE WHITE GIRL).</li>
            <li> although I typically don&#x27;t b/c I feel I need a little extra coverage for work, going out, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, probably about every other day.</li>
            <li> The other downfall is it does not have any SPF sun protection in it.  </li>
            <li> texture that other reviewers have talked about.</li>
            <li> and i choose this one because of the reviews from other users.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a couple of months and noticed an improvement in skin color and texture, which may be due to the Vitamin E that is \\&quot;infused\\&quot; in the cream.</li>
            <li> I was leary as I&#x27;ve tried other drugstore BB Cream brands that were not at all satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> You only need the amount of the tip of a pencil to do a few spots, it works so well!</li>
            <li> However, while I was at the store there were 1-2 other colors that were lighter then this.</li>
            <li> I just grabbed this one based on the colors of my other makeup&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, while I was at the store there were 1-2 other colors that were lighter then this.</li>
            <li> I just grabbed this one based on the colors of my other makeup&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any other makeup with this; it does it all.</li>
            <li> I also felt that it didn&#x27;t have the staying power of other BB creams -</li>
            <li> BB is nothing like my normal BB and has been a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was confused until I realized it was my new BB</li>
            <li> Boscia was too dry and went on heavy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite thin, white, and almost gritty.</li>
            <li> Very pale but not porcelain white.</li>
            <li> too dark for my daughter&#x27;s skin tone even though she wears this tone in other brands.</li>
            <li> Hard Candy Sheer Envy</li>
            <li> however i accidently got light and thought ya know it cant be that bad</li>
            <li> I got the product in a timely manner but my only complaint is with L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;light\\&quot; is way too dark.  </li>
            <li> It settles a teeny bit dark for me</li>
            <li> I have fought dark rings under my eyes for over 20 years</li>
            <li> it before you buy it, or just get the lightest color, unless you truly have dark skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit too dark for me</li>
            <li> This BB cream was dark for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I kept hearing so much about how well BB cream works, though I&#x27;m usually skeptical of products that have the word \\&quot;magic\\&quot; or claim to \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; your skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dark circles.</li>
            <li> Some said not worth it but saw it at Target today and decided I should give it a try.</li>
            <li> My favorite base makeup.  </li>
            <li> Today was a casual day, just running errands and going to a movie, so I wasn&#x27;t into the whole makeup ritual.</li>
            <li> I use the BB cream, just three dabs on each cheek, and rub it in under the eye, up to the hairline and down to the chin.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you how that went down....</li>
            <li> and i knew loreal wouldn&#x27;t let me down this time either.</li>
            <li> You also have to apply powder to tone down the shine in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> It takes less than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a slight reflective quality</li>
            <li> and my face is less shiny at the end of the day than if I were wearing no makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And at Target, it was less than $10.</li>
            <li> I have a more expensive BB cream that I like, but this one seems very thin and watered down.  </li>
            <li> I have a medium skin tone that has an olive base, and while in small amounts I could bend this really well with my skin tone, I would HIGHLY suggest that people with lighter skin tones do not choose this</li>
            <li> It definitely is not a full coverage item, but it has the fullest coverage I&#x27;ve seen among BB creams.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day, I&#x27;ll add some compact powder a few times over the span of 12 hours, but that&#x27;s way less than I&#x27;ve had to with foundations.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I use a fairly expensive cream foundation by Elizabeth Arden, but it can feel a little heavy.</li>
            <li> My other BB usually helps heal my pimple (doesn&#x27;t take them away, but doesn&#x27;t aggregate them either)</li>
            <li> I do the mascara and liner, a little shadow</li>
            <li> I just use this now, with a little face powder and concealer</li>
            <li> When I apply it, it gives me a little &amp;#34;natural looking&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> little is needed for coverage</li>
            <li> I still like to use a little face powder or mineral veil.  </li>
            <li> Without powder it leaves my face a little to dewy.</li>
            <li> I usually use Aveeno active naturals spf 15 on my face after the shower to prevent peeling and sunburn.</li>
            <li> everything gets thick, very dry, and unblendable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid of using too much.</li>
            <li> This has a texture that would remove some dead skin, it glows, and moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> But since the birth of my daughters, my skin tone has gained a harsh redness to it in the cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have blotchiness, red spots and some broken cappileries</li>
            <li> I tried it without  a primer, with a primer, with a moisturizer and without moisturizer and achieved the same poor results each time.</li>
            <li> The product comes out of the tube as a white thin cream and then as you apply it turns to beige/tan.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is fairly uneven</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always shied away from any sort of liquid makeup as they always felt so heavy, and I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy something that wasn&#x27;t as heavy as a foundation.</li>
            <li> I tried at least 7 other primers &amp; BB creams.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s a very odd consistency.  </li>
            <li> The texture is just very odd.</li>
            <li> It was a sticky shiny mess!</li>
            <li> Since the product claims to hydrate, I also tried using it without first moisturizing my skin; once again, the results were disastrous.  </li>
            <li> I usually stay away from bronzer since I&#x27;m so pale</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see it come out white with blue speckles.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too dark unless I have a serious tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But with this product, it&#x27;s almost mandatory to use at least a LITTLE.</li>
            <li> For a product that claims it moisturizes, it does very little.</li>
            <li> and it is very dark!</li>
            <li> -- it looks angry (red and stuffed up).</li>
            <li> This is a problem I had moved past when I changed my skin routine and hadn&#x27;t seen in months.</li>
            <li> I usually buy loreal make up about 90% of the times</li>
            <li> and I usually wear it alone.  </li>
            <li> so I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> and then a small amount of liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t stand the feel of makeup</li>
            <li> so I am not sure what the status is there</li>
            <li> tube is quite small but</li>
            <li> I took the advise of another reviewer and bought a shade lighter then I usually would.</li>
            <li> not sure how it does it</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel tacky and gave my skin an oil slick sheen.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Nothing tinted has worked for me in the past, always too cakey.</li>
            <li> cream itself is white (which was scary because I thought I would look like a mime) but have no fear..once you start blending it into the skin the shade turns to brown&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time matching my skin tone because it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> im very pale</li>
            <li> Oddly, then, it was rather tough to remove - even after fully washing my face with a sonic cleansing brush, I would wash my face again and still find traces of it.</li>
            <li> Every product is different, but this is disappointing.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s not good.  </li>
            <li> Wrong color, not light.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m fooling myself, but I always thought layering on concelear that is either useless or heavy and cakey and made my circles worse.  </li>
            <li> Since I am in my late 50&#x27;s, that truly says allot about this product!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid it would just be slightly lighter</li>
            <li> However, when I tried this, my makeup looked very thick and caked on.  </li>
            <li> the formula was, but I found the consistency to be too thin and liquidy-y</li>
            <li> I use it under my eyes to cover up if I look tired</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to a friend, but in hopes that they don&#x27;t all go on like the bad one did for me. :-/</li>
            <li> Even after I take off the BB at night, I&#x27;m amazed at how my skin looks, as if I hadn&#x27;t had anything on at all (and my skin is not perfect by any means).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never met a concealer that could handle them without looking completely fake.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I found it lacking in all those areas.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it works as a BB, but I hate the orange tint it gives me.</li>
            <li> I hated it and it was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> Horrible and way to orange, not worth even a dollar.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing make up because it seems artificial to me.</li>
            <li> My face just looked dirty and caked on at the end of the evening</li>
            <li> have started noticing Sunspots on my forehead and my makeup wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  </li>
            <li> My face just feels dirty when I use this.</li>
            <li> and it was just bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup because I hate the feeling of foundation and was using mineral makup</li>
            <li> I payed over $11 for this crap at Walgreens, and it was on sale.  </li>
            <li> BAD DECISION!  </li>
            <li> Ma hated some with a girlfriend</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed in product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still awful.  </li>
            <li> I washed it off immediately because it looked terrible.  </li>
            <li> The worst part about this is the shade.</li>
            <li> THE WORST PART:</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t see it indoors, but as soon as you step and sunlight hits your face... horrible.</li>
            <li> The shimmer is terrible.</li>
            <li> Its not so horrible for me,</li>
            <li> The product packaging makes some outrageous claims (\\&quot;flawless\\&quot;, \\&quot;perfects\\&quot; your skin).</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> This looks terrible on my skin!</li>

            <li> i bought the light and it&#x27;s way too dark. My skin tone falls into the &amp;#34;light-medium&amp;#34; range, but this made me look umpa loompa Orange. Where&#x27;s willy wonka!?</li>
            <li> I normally use a Korean BB cream that literally makes my skin feel amazing. Even after I take off the BB at night, I&#x27;m amazed at how my skin looks, as if I hadn&#x27;t had anything on at all (and my skin is not perfect by any means).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB is nothing like my normal BB and has been a major disappointment. First, it does not blend well on clean or moisturized skin. Second, it&#x27;s too runny. I&#x27;m sure that might be a plus for some people, but I like my BBs to be a little more rich (and offer better coverage). Third, when I take this stuff off my face doesn&#x27;t look nice -- it looks angry (red and stuffed up). My other BB usually helps heal my pimple (doesn&#x27;t take them away, but doesn&#x27;t aggregate them either) -- this BB doesn&#x27;t help my zits at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a light coverage foundation with little UV protection and an overpriced cost.</li>
            <li> Did not think it would work as well as it does! I wear it alone without foundation most days. Since I am in my late 50&#x27;s, that truly says allot about this product!</li>
            <li> too dark for my daughter&#x27;s skin tone even though she wears this tone in other brands. Also, didn&#x27;t blend well at all. Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB on the market.</li>
            <li> This cream is a hideous, waxy, chalky, orange color that instantly aged me 10 years.  The color just kind of sits on top of your skin, and makes you look a bit like a greasy orange mannequin.  It is hands-down the most unflattering cosmetic I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This has a texture that would remove some dead skin, it glows, and moisturizes your skin. I bought the deep tint and it had no color what-so-ever.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely amazing. It is light and covers superbly!!! It feels silky on your face. It is a tiny bottle (1oz), but you use so little, it lasts a long time. My new favorite.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel and coverage of this product; however, I am struggling with the color.  I used to tan weekly so when I first started using the product I used Medium and it was okay.  I decided to stop tanning and see where I really was with skin damage, tone, aging, etc. so I switched to the light shade and it seems a bit too dark and orange for my now natural skin color.  I will try the Fair and see how that goes.  If Fair doesn&#x27;t work, then I will have to change brands.  The product itself is great and very much to my liking for an unexperienced BB cream user; hopefully the color problem can be overcome.  I tried Pond&#x27;s and the color was like chalk.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB Cream ever. I&#x27;ve tried many other but none compares to this one. I just use it everyday in the morning and my skin looks fresh and naturally beautiful. I don&#x27;t even use foundation anymore, just when I need an actual makeup.</li>
            <li> I am African American and Puerto Rican,  my skin color is not dark,  I wouldn&#x27;t even say tan.  I purchased the medium,  it was too light,  I then tried the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34;, which was also too light, it was a joke. I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing make up because it seems artificial to me. I do the mascara and liner, a little shadow and we&#x27;re done. But since the birth of my daughters, my skin tone has gained a harsh redness to it in the cheeks. My skin has become slightly dry and flaky. I use the BB cream, just three dabs on each cheek, and rub it in under the eye, up to the hairline and down to the chin. My skin comes out even colored. It takes less than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use too much cream accidentally, it is tinted orange. I wipe off the remainder and it still looks great. I have fair skin and usually use the Ivory shades. I use the Light in BB cream and it works well.</li>
            <li> I first tried this from a free sample package in a fashion magazine, something I have never done before. I was surprised that it was white as it came out of the tube but when applied to my face it really did even out my skin tone in a very natural way that seemed to make my skin glow. I was totally surprised and had to have a tube. I couldn&#x27;t find it in drugstores and it was always sold out at Target so ordered from Amazon. It also doubles as a moisturizer which greatly simplifies my daily morning routine. As a long time user of Lancome foundation and moisturizer, I find myself reaching for this product first over the much more expensive line. How can you beat this for $7.99 a tube?</li>
            <li> I got the product in a timely manner but my only complaint is with L&#x27;Oreal. It says it&#x27;s light but it shows up very dark and does not look natural. I suggest if you order this to get a much lighter shade than your color. If you&#x27;re pale skin like me than don&#x27;t bother because you don&#x27;t want to look like a drag queen if you aren&#x27;t one right?</li>
            <li> My Go to Beauty supply I love it!!! I wear this and Liquid Eyeliner in black and I am ready to go when I am in a hurry. Great product when you have to get ready fast makes your skin glow without all the extra fuss..</li>
            <li> This product has a high color saturation, which has its pros and cons. One the plus side, you only have to use a very small amount of product to get visible change in the tone and appearance of skin - however - the color has a pretty strong orange base, so it&#x27;s really easy to go from natural and improved complexion, to looking like you made a huge mistake while playing with self tanner. I have a medium skin tone that has an olive base, and while in small amounts I could bend this really well with my skin tone, I would HIGHLY suggest that people with lighter skin tones do not choose this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the amount of coverage I get with this product (sheer to medium coverage), and how light weight and nongreasy the formula was, but I found the consistency to be too thin and liquidy-y (to where the product runs out of the packaging if the tip if facing in pretty much any direction other than directly up) which made it difficult to apply without making a mess. The thing that worked for me was to keep the tip pointed up, and to very gently squeeze the bottle until a small amount of product came to the top. I would then dab tiny little dots around my face, and then use a sponge to blend. You could probably add directly to a sponge and apply to your face, but I felt like the product was wet enough that either a ton would be absorbed by the sponge, or else too much product would end up on my face giving me oompa loompa syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can definitely build up the amount of product to get greater coverage, however I would probably only recommend that for a person who already has a considerable tan. Overall, this is a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; product, but I think it would be better if it came in a more natural shade option, with a slightly denser formula to make application easier.</li>
            <li> I love it so much !! its perfect :D thank u very much</li>
            <li> I love this! No one knows I&#x27;m wearing it and I get constant comments on having a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; complexion. I even think it has caused my &amp;#34;senior freckles&amp;#34; to diminish a bit.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love it! This product is extremely matte, and when I go to put my foundation on top of it everything gets thick, very dry, and unblendable. However, it does work ok if you are using it on it&#x27;s own! I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Looks natural because it&#x27;s light coverage but still can hide some flaws. Looks white when it goes on but blends to match skin tone. It does have a slight reflective quality but I recently bought L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi Primer and will add occasionally for a little more glow. This is my third tube and I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling oily and greasy, and I have dry skin!!  I&#x27;ve attempted to mix it 50/50 with another product and it&#x27;s still awful.  There&#x27;s no highlighting or coverage either!  Rip off!</li>
            <li> My favorite BB cream. It makes my face so clear and smooth. I really believe my skin tone and appearance has improved with this. A little goes a long way and absorbs nicely!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! Goes on nicely and is not oily at all. Nice color. It gives my skin a glow better than a bronzer.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my face look 10 years younger. Love it and wear it almost every day. Would highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> My skin tone is pretty light with some neutral/slightly yellow understones, but I&#x27;m not super white like a sheet of paper, so I purchased this in the light color.  The color of my foundation is fairly light by Bare Minerals, so I really thought this would be the perfect color, because I didn&#x27;t want something way too light.  Well, when I put it on, it turned from white to super orange!  Once I blend it out, it looks a little better, but it is still too dark for my face.  This is WAY darker and more orange than Maybelline&#x27;s BB cream in light. I give this 3 stars not because of the performance of the product, but because I feel that the color is way off.  I&#x27;d describe this light as more of a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; color.  The product itself is great and I would buy it again, just not in this light color.  I would get this in fair next time.  It&#x27;s just a bummer because now I have a whole tube of BB cream that is just too dark for me.</li>
            <li> It makes for a decent primer especially if normal primers cause breakouts or feel too thick on you.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s not good.  The \\&quot;light\\&quot; is WHITE.  I don&#x27;t care what they say about it adjusting to your skin, I still looked like a mime.  If it&#x27;s going to be that pigmented, Loreal is going to have to use their True Match system to accommodate the variety in skin tones.  Too bad because the consistency is actually quite nice and is actually a CREAM.</li>
            <li> I really dislike wearing makeup but this is very light weight and subtle. I do not feel as if I am wearing makeup at all. It&#x27;s very flattering.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim at a duty free store because I had used other B.B. foundations and loved them.  This was the top!  While I had no idea that this cream also added a hint of color, what I loved about it is that, immediately, and for several hours afterward, it eliminated my &#x27;shiny&#x27; skin and gives me this fresh, and flawless skin that looks great in daylight and in pictures, It is so light that I don&#x27;t even feel you&#x27;re wearing a foundation.  On a special occasion, I had my daughter try it and since then, she has been asking me where I got it and wants her own.  I ordered several tubes of it to give to my girls and to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  I will use the light color in the winter and medium in the summer.  Both are amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it as a primer / moisturizer / foundation. It provides all the coverage I need. I took a risk in buying this product, I really had no idea what BB cream was. But after trying it I honestly will never go back to another product. It&#x27;s that amazing. And you can&#x27;t beat the price! This tiny bottle has lasted me about six months! I don&#x27;t use it every day, probably about every other day. I get compliments all the time on my skin and makeup.</li>
            <li> i love it, but I need to order the lighter shade.  It gives my face a nice glow and covers all the imperfections that come with age!</li>
            <li> This made me break out and my face was orange.</li>
            <li> BEST BB cream available as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Light, but offers coverage and stays on.  Does not cake up my mineral wear foundation.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal is not a cosmetic I generally buy but I decided to give it a try.  My skin is more light than fair, so I went with the light shade as I did not want to look &#x27;chalky&#x27;.  That was a mistake...the \\&quot;light\\&quot; is way too dark.  I did consider writing off my error and trying the fair shade but have decided not to so.  As another reviewer stated, there is an orange tint to the cream that comes through.  I will say the feel of the cream is lovely but the orange shading, not so much.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin, as well as a complex facial complexion. Although this color was too dark for my fair skin, I still love it. I had to finally tan myself to get it to match, but it does make my skin look and feel amazing. I&#x27;ll be ordering the lighter color next time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to BB creams, so this literally is the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I was very nervous, since many are so expensive.  Let me say that I am WOWWED by this product!  I haven&#x27;t used foundation once since starting to use this!  It settles a teeny bit dark for me (I have very fair skin), but when I set it with powder, it looks perfect.  It covers blemishes and most of my freckles, leaving just a few visibly cute ones.  Throughout the day, I&#x27;ll add some compact powder a few times over the span of 12 hours, but that&#x27;s way less than I&#x27;ve had to with foundations.  Hope you enjoy as well!</li>
            <li> This is a great product I just stumbled on with a sample from a magazine.  I am over 40 and under 60 and my face isnt really in great shape.  I have blotchiness, red spots and some broken cappileries and this seems to cover 90% of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about it, is that it is so lightweight and goes on really smooth.  The color blends perfect and it really looks as if you have no makeup on, just a healthy glow.  I just use this now, with a little face powder and concealer and I have a very polished yet natural look.  I have not worn makeup since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars vs 5 is that it can be a bit drying to my skin, because of this I have just ordered the original product that launched all of these new B.B. from Korea.  I will update when I start using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you dont like the feel or heavy coverage of regular makeup you should definitely try this.  I swear it has even lightened up my red spots.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this products and for the first five minutes, was quite impressed with it. After the initial application, my skin looked better than it does without makeup, and even with this B.B. cream on, it looked very natural...like there was no makeup on at all. Unfortunately, when I looked at my face in natural light, it looked blotchy and orange...while everything looked okay in the dim light of my bathroom, the reality is that this cream does not blend very well. Also, I have oily skin, and within a few minutes time, I experienced major shine breakthrough on my forehead, cheeks, chin, and nose. I will keep looking for a B.B. cream that works for me, but this definitely isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I like how this product blends but wish it came in a larger size. The product dispenses white and changes color as you blend it over your skin. A good natural looking product that replaces using several others in its place. I have not had any issues with breakouts since using it and I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> First off, there isn&#x27;t any SPF.  Since SPF is one of the basic functions of a BB, I don&#x27;t think this product qualifies.  It&#x27;s basically a tinted moisturizer that&#x27;s been mislabeled to cash in on the BB trend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s a very odd consistency.  It comes out of the tube a gray-white color with gritty bits and feels like an exfoliating scrub.  Then as you rub it on it smooths out and changes color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color on me is very orange and looks kind of greasy.  I can&#x27;t comment on long-term wear, how it lasts, skin condition, etc.  I washed it off immediately because it looked terrible.  If you have a different skin tone and type it might look nice on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline, it&#x27;s nothing like the Korean BBs I&#x27;ve tried, I wouldn&#x27;t even classify it as the same kind of product.  I much prefer an actual BB to a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The worst part about this is the shade. I usually wear Light in Maybelline and other drugstore brand cosmetics. Sometimes I use fair, but more as the &amp;#34;highlight&amp;#34; part when I&#x27;m contouring. The &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade in this is just so, so orange. I&#x27;m a beauty junkie and have tried a hundred tinted moisturizers, bb creams and cc creams over the years, and I&#x27;ve never seen anything so orange in my life. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, and I don&#x27;t remember it being quite this off when I first got it, but it has always been too dark. It has a ton of preservatives, parabens and yucky chemicals that I normally avoid so you would expect it to be more stable, but nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this is it mimics the natural smooth texture of the skin better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. It has a smooth matte finish that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would try the fair but I&#x27;m afraid it would just be slightly lighter orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to upload a photo to show the shade, but there&#x27;s no option to do so... seems strange.</li>
            <li> Hate it. I am not sure how well it works as a BB, but I hate the orange tint it gives me. I have to use so little to avoid the orange that it really doesn&#x27;t work in any other capacity.</li>
            <li> I really love this BB cream.  It goes on very smooth and actually covers my adult acne scars and does not look cakey at all!  I am pale and got the light color.  When I apply it, it gives me a little &amp;#34;natural looking&amp;#34; tan which is awesome.  Overall, very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> This product [[ASIN:B0084A5PVM L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Secrets Magic B.B. Cream, Light, 1 Fluid Ounce]] is very gritty and is worthless in terms of providing any coverage whatsoever. The grittiness is evident from the moment I tried to apply it to my skin. The tube contains a stinging .5 oz. (thankfully) so I didn&#x27;t have to waste too much. I tried it without  a primer, with a primer, with a moisturizer and without moisturizer and achieved the same poor results each time. I would recommend a different BB such as Pond&#x27;s to anyone looking for a great product and value. The color was just fine, not to orangey or white. I have Ivory skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty secret ever.  It does wonders for my complexion and I look so natural.  I have fought dark rings under my eyes for over 20 years (I&#x27;m 34) but this somehow just blends them away. I don&#x27;t use concealer anymore!  I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m fooling myself, but I always thought layering on concelear that is either useless or heavy and cakey and made my circles worse.  They are still there, but they just don&#x27;t stand out so much and I don&#x27;t feel the need for concealer for that or the redness under my nose.  I try every beauty product I can get my hands on, but I am committed to this product. I am subscribing for a regular delivery of this product as soon as I post this message.  Oh, and if you don&#x27;t like the color when you first try it, make sure you try another shade!</li>
            <li> Up until recently this was the better of the \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; bb cream products that I have tried.  On the positive side it is not greasy, blends easily with good coverage and does a good job of evening my skin tone with a nice matte finish.  It comes out of the tube white (with tiny darker flecks) and then turns skin tone colored as you blend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about it is it is not as moisturizing as I would like (I have dry skin) and I absolutely had to wear a moisturizer under it.  The other downfall is it does not have any SPF sun protection in it.  You have to wear a sunscreen under it. This is the only reason I did not give it more stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moved on to a different product now, but this is a good one as longs as you wear a moisturizer with sunscreen underneath.</li>
            <li> Turns kinda dark on my fair skin.  I use it on my legs for a quick tan.</li>
            <li> I get this brand of BB cream all the time but the light that I ordered from here came out as bright orange!!!! Imagine my surprise when I&#x27;m at work and finally someone comes up and points it out. I looked like a clown!!!</li>
            <li> This is very tan (dark) on my fair skin.  It is good in the summer when I want a tan look, but it requires a lot of blending.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this at Target. Bought the deep color. I am a medium-to-light black hispanic woman and the match was very good overall but I have to rate this very low because it&#x27;s not a real bbcream, and l&#x27;oreal should be ashamed to sell this as such. This can only be called tinted moisturizer, if that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems:&lt;br /&gt;- First of all, this cream oxidizes, which is uncommon for asian bbcreams. That&#x27;s fine, okay, but It has NO SPF, so right off the bat I was suspicious...&lt;br /&gt;- For a product that claims it moisturizes, it does very little. It actually made my skin start to flake! This is a problem I had moved past when I changed my skin routine and hadn&#x27;t seen in months. Thanks a lot, L&#x27;oreal!&lt;br /&gt;- The beads, the beads... This thing feels like it&#x27;s exfoliating your face. And not in a good way. The texture is just very odd. Feels like silicone and very fine sand mixed together. Now I see why my face was flaking again.&lt;br /&gt;- Due to the texture and consistency it settles into your fine lines. Couple with the oxidization... My face just looked dirty and caked on at the end of the evening&lt;br /&gt;- THE WORST PART: The shimmer! Why?! Who thought this was a good idea? You won&#x27;t see it indoors, but as soon as you step and sunlight hits your face... horrible. Just horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s see: this claims it does 4 things:&lt;br /&gt;- Primes: Setting into any fine lines and amplifying a caked-on look, it does quite the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;- Corrects: Did a decent job correcting some redness, but not discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;- Hydrates: With sand? No. Just no.&lt;br /&gt;- Perfects: It&#x27;s not even lightly buildable. The shimmer is terrible. Cannot be blended with any powder or concealer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you go. I wouldn&#x27;t gift this to a friend. Happy at least it wasn&#x27;t expensive. - L&#x27;oreal, this is not a bbcream. Stop deceiving consumers that might not know any better.&lt;br /&gt;If you want the real stuff, stick to korean lines.</li>
            <li> I ordered this L&#x27;Oreal product by mistake, intending instead to purchase L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Youth Code BB Cream Illuminator.  I&#x27;d found a sample of the Cream Illuminator in a magazine and was so impressed with it that I had to order it immediately.  Unfortunately, there were so many L&#x27;Oreal creams to choose from that I ordered the wrong one.  This one is just &amp;#34;O.K.&amp;#34;.  I liked the Youth Code BB Cream Illuminator so much better!</li>
            <li> Goes on  smoothly.  Easy application and good coverage.  I love it. Ma hated some with a girlfriend and she&#x27;s ordering it too.</li>
            <li> Alright, it was on sale, so I bought two tubes.  Let me tell you how that went down....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought dark and medium would work for me, even though I have fair skin.  Usually make-up isn&#x27;t so dark because I don&#x27;t apply much.  That logic didn&#x27;t work for L&#x27;oreal B.B. Cream!  This formula is totally different, so you need to take heed of others&#x27; stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed a bit of the product on my finger, and it looked so light - so innocuous, that I put more on my face than I would have with regular make-up.  BAD DECISION!  This stuff is like magic, whereby it transforms from a creamy, shiny near-white substance into an explosion of color so rich that you would think it has self-tanning properties.  It doesn&#x27;t.  It contains micro-beads of pigment, that, when you rub onto your skin, break open to reveal the true color of the make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it before you buy it, or just get the lightest color, unless you truly have dark skin.  If you don&#x27;t, you will look like the \\&quot;Tanning Mom\\&quot;!  Don&#x27;t try it for the first time just before you go out.  You may find yourself on the cover of a tabloid magazine, and NOT in a good way. ;0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, however, it is the BEST make-up I&#x27;ve ever used, as it goes on smoothly, stays fresh-looking for many hours, and doesn&#x27;t change color after you apply it correctly (ensuring you cause the micro-beads to release fully).  It&#x27;s truly a wondrous product, and it will last a very long time, even with daily usage.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  I use it daily with or without makeup and it feels awesome!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how good or not got it is. The color &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is so dark and orange on my skin that I would not be able to wear it even in the summer. I normally get a light to medium or medium in other brands. Fair has never been a color match for me, and not sure I would buy another just to test it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this and actually did a little youtube research before purchasing this product-- however, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I purchased this in light and it turned my skin an orangey tint which was a first for me. I tried mixing a drop or two with my zinc sunscreen and the result was a little better. It should be noted that my skin has more yellow undertones but I would necessarily consider myself fair esp. now that it&#x27;s the summer. This light color might actually work for someone who is more tan though.</li>
            <li> I have not been very happy with this product. I purchased the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; option and it is very dark! I don&#x27;t consider myself to be fair skinned either. The product comes out of the tube as a white thin cream and then as you apply it turns to beige/tan. It does not give very good coverage and I would not recommend it if you are trying to cover blemishes. I would compare it to a tinted moisturizer but without the benefits of a moisturizer. Its also says it has a primer in it which I am not believing. It doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34; qualities and rubs right off. All in all I will not be buying this again, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone either.</li>
            <li> I read so many great reviews about this product that I decided that I had to try it out! The minute that I put it on my face it turned a bright orange color and I had to take it off. I gave it another chance the next day and it still turned orange! I have normal/dry skin so I know it was not my skin that was making it orange AND I was using the lightest shade! I also tested it on other parts of my body and the exact same thing happend! please save your money!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. My skin tone is fairly uneven but once I apply this I practically feel like I could go out of the house with no additional make-up on. It starts out white; the color shows once you apply it to your face. It feels like and smooth, and helps my make-up last through the day.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BB CREAM JUST WISH IT HAS SUNSCREEN IN IT TOO. I WEAR IT ALONE AND FEEL IT IS JUST THE RIGHT FINISHING TOUCH WITHOUT ANY HEAVY FOUNDATION WHICH OFTEN MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE OLDER THAN YOU ARE.  THIS MAKES YOU SKIN LOOKS VERY NATURAL ON AN OLD GIRL!!! LESS IS MORE AT 65</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always shied away from any sort of liquid makeup as they always felt so heavy, and I have oily skin. However, I finally decided to give BB creams a try. I really do like this product. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup and this product actually covers better than the mineral makeup I&#x27;ve been stuck on for the past couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel the &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; texture that other reviewers have talked about. The pigment beads blend in pretty seamlessly. It&#x27;s decent at controlling oil too, however I find I still need to touch up with a shine control powder from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;Also worth noting is, I think I will purchase this a shade lighter next time. It tends to give an orange hue if you don&#x27;t blend it in really well. It doesn&#x27;t adapt to your skin tone quite as well as some other BB creams claim to, so you definitely need to get a more exact tone match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> Love this cream it  gives just the right of tint of color</li>
            <li> I have a more expensive BB cream that I like, but this one seems very thin and watered down.  skip this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product it works beautifully and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your face!</li>
            <li> It has shimmer in it, so it wont hide blemishes or redness at all. I am not dark and i had to use a darker shade., but it&#x27;s good for oliy skin</li>
            <li> Man this thing works!!!...it  is awesome!!! Im always picky about my stuff and I don&#x27;t write a review unless I love the product I have purchase. I just bought it a week ago and im in love with this loreal bb cream. I usually buy loreal make up about 90% of the times and i knew loreal wouldn&#x27;t let me down this time either. I love the fact that it does not feel heavy at all, if feels like you are make up free. I honestly just put this on with no need of any more make up. Love it love it love it!!!</li>
            <li> Ok type.. Not like what I thought ...</li>
            <li> I personally really like this BB cream. I don&#x27;t understand the science -- it&#x27;s light and sheer, but covers and evens out skin tone and it&#x27;s got some sun screen. I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from a magazine add and loved it. I didn&#x27;t like the texture of the cream I got. It is different from the sample I originally tried.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy something that wasn&#x27;t as heavy as a foundation. I was using Clinque foundation for years, and I have very oily skin, and by the end of the day, my makeup would be melted off. I love how the bb cream looks more natural. The only complaint I have is, I have light skin so I bought the light shade and it comes out alittle darker than my skin tone. I&#x27;m not going to exchange it tho cause it makes my face have more color! Boo ya enjoy ladies!</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream. I read a lot of reviews about how BB cream can make your face look greyish. This does a tiny bit but not anything noticeable. It covers a lot of my light acne scars and evens out my skin tone. I feel great putting this on instead of makeup because it feels lighter and  seems better for my skin. I can even wear it to the gym!</li>
            <li> A perfect transaction with no hitches.  Product is perfect too!</li>
            <li> This stuff really is MAGIC! I can&#x27;t believe the transformation!It is not heavy like foundation but conceals spots, circles and discoloration of the skin better! I will forever keep this cream stocked in my cosmetics! The trick is for anyone to find the tone that best fits your skin...</li>
            <li> So this is the first time i have used a BB Cream and i choose this one because of the reviews from other users. The item arrives much faster than expected. But in terms of the product it self, its a hit but my account. I have very oily skin and it seems to help that not complete taking away all the sheen from my skin but its a noticeable difference. Its lite weight from the time i apply it to the time i wash my face after work. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> This offers better coverage than some concealers I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve got a lot of redness in my skin and I was surprised that this cream evened out my skin tone.  It&#x27;s a little thicker than a tinted moisturizer, but I really like that and I think it stays in place better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream.  I have very light skin and bought the fair shade.  I didn&#x27;t have any problem with it not matching my skin tone.  I have to say I don&#x27;t have acne or scars so can&#x27;t say much but I don&#x27;t think it would be a good if you need more coverage.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup because I hate the feeling of foundation and was using mineral makup but as I have gotten older I feel like it just doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore This is so easy to thrown on before work and I usually wear it alone.  If I am going out or want a tad more coverage I use the L&#x27;Oreal magic nude liquid powder. The combination is amazing. Even with both on I feel like I&#x27;m wearing nothing. I have had numerous compliments about by skin.  It evens it out, covers redness, smooths appearance of skin and great blackhead coverage. Of course I think the satisfaction with the product would really depend on your needs and skin type So for comparison here is mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very light skin tone, blackheads in T-zone, dry in the winter, sometimes oily in T-zone,no acne or scars, but occasional pimple here and there. 35 years old, mostly even skin tone.</li>
            <li> My favorite base makeup.  Blends beautifully and the coverage is great and natural looking.  I used to love mineral powder, but it would catch in the peach fuzz hairs and look cakey.  This moisturizes nicely and gives a nice even color.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I never used a BB cream before buying this one, so I really have no basis of comparison, but it has worked wonderfully for me. I have fairly dry skin and some light freckles, but up until recently didn&#x27;t have any issue with blemishes or discoloration. I recently began developing idiopathic hives, which tend to appear as small red blemishes on my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream works great as a primer, but it even provides sufficient coverage on its own when I have a hive breakout. Some days my face just looks blotchy, and the BB cream smooths everything out enough to walk out of the house without scaring the neighbors.</li>
            <li> not fit the asian face. too oily, won&#x27;t recommand to any friends around.&lt;br /&gt;poor package. more expensive, better quality do</li>
            <li> It primes extremely well and is very hydrating without feeling oily.  I have used it for a couple of months and noticed an improvement in skin color and texture, which may be due to the Vitamin E that is \\&quot;infused\\&quot; in the cream. It comes out of the tube white with little purple beads and then when you rub it in, it blends perfectly to your skin!  It provides enough sheer coverage that I could wear it alone, but is not so heavy that I can&#x27;t put concealer on top, if I so need (which I frequently do).  I reviewed this on my blog [...] One of the great things about BB Creams is that they (generally) are moisturizers, treatments, primers, bases and SPF all in one.  This is the only BB Cream that I have encountered that does not have SPF.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product but it is white and changes shades after applied. I am not sure this is the best shade for me but it still does even out skin tones.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;good qality, good value</li>
            <li> Goes on light, doesn&#x27;t cause pimples. I am happy with the results. This is my second tube.</li>
            <li> seems like i am hardly putting anything on, but it really does work at diminishing my old age spots.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this BB cream is so light and doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy by the end of the day. After I wash my face, my skin feels so soft and rejuvenated. Also, I have naturally tan skin but the light shade works great for me! Very surprised! Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have high ends BB creams but I decided to purchase this BB cream since I am a product junkie and want to try out new things. Anyway I am positively surprised and love this BB. Glad to have given this one a shot.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try a beauty balm for a while now, and bought this one today on a whim from Rite-Aid. I usually use Aveeno active naturals spf 15 on my face after the shower to prevent peeling and sunburn. Its the only thing that works on my skin, or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing! It only took a dab to do my whole face. Its smooth, the tone is much more even than with Aveeno. My face is hydrated. The true test is waiting to see if it breaks my sensitive skin out in acne. It does not have SPF in it as far as I know, the tube says nothing of the sort. Its supposed to not clog pores. We will see. Reviews elsewhere on the web states that its melt-proof and smudge-proof. I am wearing it to bed in a hot summer night in the desert, so I guess I will know in 12 hours if it stands up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I wear foundation in \\&quot;creamy natural\\&quot; except for August, when I tan to a \\&quot;buff beige\\&quot;. The light tone is perfect. There is one lighter and two darker (I believe) and this one is just right. There are a bunch of chemicals in it that I cannot pronounce. Two of the main ingredients are dimethicone and glycerin. It has parabens. I&#x27;m not too keen on some of the ingredients, but its the best thing I have ever used on my face to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Two pumps of Aveeno, bottle lasts 6 weeks, $16.00 for the bottle, 38 cents a day to hydrate the face. This product cost $10 at the drugstore and you only need a nickle size dollop on your hand to do the whole face. This will last 6-8 weeks. 21 cents a day to hydrate the face. Good deal, better product. You do the math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing this again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I stepped out into sunlight and looked in a mirror and to my horror I had an orange halo around my face! The \\&quot;light\\&quot; color is too dark for me, so I gave it to a friend and purchased the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; tone... its perfect! I did get a couple of little bumps on my hairline that never formed white heads, but honestly my skin was just adjusting to the new product. Still love it, still will repurchase.heads, but honestly my skin was just adjusting to the new product. Still love it, still will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered the light and it was extremely orange not at all like the color from the sample I got in a magazine.  Very Disappointed in product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Missha, and others from overseas. Ordered Smashbox, and Bobby Brown.  I can&#x27;t believe I am saying this but I&#x27;m so happy with this drugstore brand.  I was leary as I&#x27;ve tried other drugstore BB Cream brands that were not at all satisfactory.  This one competes with all more expensive brands, I have ordered..&lt;br /&gt;I wear light to light/med Foundation. I wear light shade in this brand.  I have very sensitive skin but no breakout issues with this either.&lt;br /&gt;Must add I am even happier when i order at Drtugstore.com for $10.95 a tube, with no s/h.  Just now I ordered from Drugstore.com and paid $10.95 for first one, and a second for 50% off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this L&#x27;Oreal BB cream for a bit over 2 years now. I have tried several other brands in that time, but found them all to be much heavier and thicker, like foundation, and several made my face break out. This one is the firs BB cream I tried and it hands down remains my favorite and the one I use daily. This BB cream by L&#x27;Oreal appears white, but it changes to match your skin tone when you rub it in. It blends so well that it does not look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup - which is precisely why I love it, but you can see the color when you wipe your face with a tissue at the end of the day to remove your makeup.   It feels so much lighter than a foundation and allows my skin to breathe, while leaving it feeling moisturized and looking evened out and polished. It&#x27;s the perfect &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; makeup, especially during the hot and humid summer months. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t contain any sunscreen like many others do, so I have to layer another product on my face. If it had sunscreen in it, I would easily give it 5 stars. I purchased this at my local store for full price for less than what most of the other BB creams cost.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin look.  I wear it in place of foundation on days that I work.</li>
            <li> Very good make-up: blends well and covers blemishes perfectly. It also feels real nice and light on my skin. I would recommend this, but make sure it fits your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Fair color first. I loved it. I started using a self-tanner and bumped up to the Light. It didn&#x27;t go on the same way as the Fair so I was pretty disappointed. I would recommend it to a friend, but in hopes that they don&#x27;t all go on like the bad one did for me. :-/</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you are caucasian and your complexion is fair. This was a total waste of money. Wrong color, not light. ORANGE</li>
            <li> I brought it not knowing exactly what it was supposed to do (foundation, primer,concealer, or moisterizer?).  The packaging wasn&#x27;t very clear on that.  But basically it&#x27;s a rip-off of the Almay smart shade that came out awhile ago.  If you like that type of foundation it&#x27;s fine. But for me it provided very light coverage and dried out my skin. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that allows me to wear makeup with a flawless finish. I have large pores and I have redness. I use this cream as a primer and then a small amount of liquid foundation. I have had very little irritation (I have sensitive skin). No breakouts! I feel beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for younger people who have good skin. I used it on my stepdaughter and it did nothing for her. The main benefit of this cream is evening and coverage.</li>
            <li> I rarely try new products due to sensitive skin, but this product is perfect. I bought it for my sister and I&#x27;ve used the whole tube up. I break out the moment I try new things, but I haven&#x27;t with this. It&#x27;s lights weight, evens out the skin tone and it doesn&#x27;t show at all!!! Best part is its great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this a few weeks ago, I have really sensitive skin &amp; im really iffy about trying new products, I took my chances with this one &amp; wow I adore it, it goes on smooth &amp; leaves my skin amazing/flawless, for a fact I will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite BB so far. It is a bit too dark for me and I have fair skin. But, it blends pretty well.</li>
            <li> if you ever wanted a natural look this will definitely help! used it on a camping trip to the dessert (didn&#x27;t want to wear make-up because it was extremely hot) it made my skin look great it was really amazing! buying more.</li>
            <li> I recently purchase this awesome BB Cream at my local grocery store under $8.00. This is my first BB and been a great experience so far. If you are looking for a BB cream to take the place of your powder or foundations this cream isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heres what I like about the wonderful cream:&lt;br /&gt;* Its light, oil free and non foundation like cream.&lt;br /&gt;* It smooths and blends on the skin really well.&lt;br /&gt;* Right color for olive skin. (Probably not the best for someone who has fair skin.)&lt;br /&gt;* Love the natural look it gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Cons I have is:&lt;br /&gt;* Wish the tube was bigger.&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t really help with scars. (Seems to be too light to cover scars.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 and have combo skin somewhat large pores.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve listened to the pros in saying less is more.  Not to mention I want to get ready quick but still look great.  I&#x27;ve tried some other BB creams and actually the regular Loreal BB cream and a couple others.  When I first got this I thought wow what a rip off so small tube.  But when I started using I realized it goes along way, and doesn&#x27;t take much and spreads really nicely and quick.  I think I REALLY like this stuff.  Leaves a nice finish and with blush and powder is all I need.  I actually use a mixture of light and medium and looks good!  Have reordered.  About $10 bucks at the major drug stores.</li>
            <li> I have light skin so I got the lightest shade, and it was orange when I put it on.  This product doesn&#x27;t work at all!! I hated it and it was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> I go thru a lot of different make up because I am very picky and I keep trying different things I just don&#x27;t like (high-end, low end and in between). I want something that will look natural and feel natural, while covering (or at least obscuring) my flaws, evening my skin tone and not breaking out my skin. Too much to ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, yes. But this product does pretty much all of that. The coverage is light - it adds a bit of color and does even the skin tone and obscure (but not so much cover) a couple blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I love this product (so far - it has been a week) is that while accomplishing all that stated above, it really looks like I am not wearing any makeup. It just makes my skin look better, which I love. Also it feels incredible. I usually can&#x27;t stand the feel of makeup but I don&#x27;t feel a thing with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You sort of have to buff it into the skin when you apply to break the color beads. When you do this it almost bonds to the skin. It does last really long. In CVS I tried a tester on the back of my hand and after a couple hand washings I still had some there. Oddly though I have had no trouble removing it from my face (I use a Clarisonic). It seems to control oil and my face is less shiny at the end of the day than if I were wearing no makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no mention of SPF on this so I am not sure what the status is there (I read the European versions had a low SPF).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is quite small but little is needed for coverage so it should last a decent time. I have been using it a week and so far no unusual breakouts (they usually would occur before now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use a light moisturizer on my drier spots under this and it does keep my skin hydrated all day (I tend to be dry but for the t-zone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has simplified my routine and so far I am happy. :-)</li>
            <li> This product is great for the summer months. I took the advise of another reviewer and bought a shade lighter then I usually would. I purchased the light shade which is a little too dark, next time I will get fair. Other then that I really liked the product. Makes your skin feel soft and smooth,its like wearing nothing at all.</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight cream, a tinted moisturizer rather than a foundation.  It is not for someone who needs a lot of coverage, but is great for me as I hate the feel of a heavy cake.  It comes out white but changes to the proper color on my skin.  I can&#x27;t tell where it ends on my face, which is important to me.  I love it and wish I hadn&#x27;t bought a couple of tubes of a different product a few months ago as this is what I want to wear now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this product makes my skin look... except for the color. My skin is pretty light colored but usually when I wear &#x27;fair&#x27; colored things I look like a ghost... well, the &#x27;light&#x27; makes me look orange. it&#x27;s too dark unless I have a serious tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage with a tiny amount of product. Feels a bit gritty going on but that feeling disappears very quickly and leaves skin smooth, hydrated and flawless looking. I have very red cheeks and this product definitely makes them less red but doesn&#x27;t make me look all one color either...not sure how it does it but it blends perfectly to make my skin look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is way better than the $40-something that I was spending on Smashbox foundation...not to mention primer, powder etc. I don&#x27;t need any of that now. Just this (hopefully in the right color) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use too much. Less actually looks better.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I received a sample from a magazine and I was hooked. It smooths out my skin and reduces my pores. Make up goes on flawlessly. I recommend this to anyone as it is one of the best skin products that I&#x27;ve seen in a long time. It goes on white and becomes invisible and it is light on the skin and it helps the skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this stuff has worked so well for me that I had to. I have tried so many different foundations - everything from drug store brands to Bare Minerals, Laura Geller, Makeup Forever - you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. I&#x27;m 36 and for the last couple of years have really been struggling with an oily t-zone and dry skin everywhere else, LOTS of redness and large pores from acne rosacea. That along with my thyroid meds was destroying my normally great skin. I started using this as a primer to wear under my foundation and gradually realized - OMG! I don&#x27;t need to wear foundation at all with this stuff - it&#x27;s that good! I was really surprised by the coverage because I never would have thought it would be enough for me. I can wear this completely by itself with nothing else - no primer, no foundation and no powder and it still corrects my redness and gives me great, natural looking coverage that usually lasts me most of the day. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily or greasy (which is huge) and it actually lasts longer when I just wear it on it&#x27;s own - although I typically don&#x27;t b/c I feel I need a little extra coverage for work, going out, etc. My normal routine now is to wash my face with a gentle cleanser (I use Neutragena Naturals) apply my rosacea medication (Finacea - which was a dream come true and cleared all the itchy acne rosacea) and 5 minutes later apply a light coating of Lubriderm moisturizer. After that dries I use either Philosophy&#x27;s Keep the Peace corrector as a primer (also helps a little with the redness, but mostly reduces the appearance of pores and fine lines and makes the BB cream glide like silk) or Avon Magix (best primer EVER)and then Laura Geller Real Deal Concealer for under eye bags and occasional red spots. It also works wonders for a red nose if you use a primer on your pores first.(If you have rosacea you need to buy that stuff,like, YESTERDAY...it&#x27;s awesome!) Last - I use the BB cream to finish everything off. It smooths everything out and blends perfectly with my concealer and primer and my face ends up looking flawless - like I&#x27;m wearing little to no makeup at all. 90% of my redness disappears and my face still feels clean and matte, which it never does with foundation. I would highly, highly recommend this for anyone, especially for anyone suffering from rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have always objected to the texture of most foundations, I can&#x27;t stand the feel of them on my skin. This BB cream truly is &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;: goes on very light, but evens skin tone nicely and has a durable matte finish that makes pores invisible. Doesn&#x27;t get greasy over the course of a day&#x27;s wear, either (another objection that I have to standard foundations).</li>
            <li> Purchased for someone else, but she loves this stuff.  Good price and she says makeup glides on smoothly and her skin feels great.  She&#x27;s 60. so she should know what is good for her.</li>
            <li> Horrible and way to orange, not worth even a dollar.</li>
            <li> First of all. I got this for $8 at Walmart. Not $18 as listed here on Amazon! That is INSANE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I originally tried using it I was shocked to see it come out white with blue speckles. But those go away and the more you rub the lotion on, the more it changes to its color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am white. Very pale but not porcelain white. I can get a nice dark tan in the summer. I&#x27;m a natural redhead who&#x27;s hair has turned a brownish color. This BB cream was dark for me. I actually got comments on getting some sun. I was confused until I realized it was my new BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, if it was lighter it would be perfect. But I make do with it. Its not so horrible for me, and I&#x27;m sure once summer comes around it will even out more for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual product. I love it. I use it with [[ASIN:B007QED10E Hard Candy Sheer Envy Primers Primer 137]]. And my skin feels amazing. I also have NOT broken out (yet?!) As I have acne prone skin from PCOS. I normally use [[ASIN:B0086HW5TI Avon Extra Lasting Liquid Foundation SPF 12 LIGHT IVORY]] liquid foundation, and I&#x27;m about ready to throw that out (although its great for sweating in the summer, but makes my nose look dry). This BB cream makes my skin look nice and smooth and I don&#x27;t have to use powder at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to use very little at first to see what the color turns and blend it in a good amount. I also use a tiny bit of my Avon liquid foundation if I feel I need a little more cover or evening out as its lighter then this. I use [[ASIN:B009Z3MG0K Hard Candy Glamoflauge HEAVY DUTY CONCEALER with pencil (Medium Light shade 488)]] to cover pimples. You only need the amount of the tip of a pencil to do a few spots, it works so well! That stuff hides my pimples like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last, if needed I add some [[ASIN:B002VECJ84 CoverGirl Professional Translucent Face Powder Translucnt Medium(N) 115, 0.7-Ounce Shaker top jar (Pack of 2)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m taking 1 star off of this BB cream is because like others said, it definitely is not as light as it could be. However, while I was at the store there were 1-2 other colors that were lighter then this. So there are some out there! I just grabbed this one based on the colors of my other makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11-25-13: I recently purchased the FAIR version of this as my summer tan has faded and this one made me look orange. The fair version is too light for me, but tolerable with using the Avon over it. It still gives me that very smooth feeling.ly reason I&#x27;m taking 1 star off of this BB cream is because like others said, it definitely is not as light as it could be.

The fair version is too light for me, but tolerable with using the Avon over it. It still gives me that very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> It is very natural, and others can barely tell whether I am using it. It covers the flaws without making you too white. I am glad that others&#x27; reviews are true, and I will continue to use this bb cream.</li>
            <li> This cream is too orangy for someone with fair skin like me. It makes me look like I apply an orange tan lotion on my face. This is more of a medium shade. The only nice thing about this cream is it blends on very smooth. If you have medium skin tone I would recommend it but not for fair people. I wish that make it truly a fair shade.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help smooth my skin out. I was soft and silky but for a fair skinner person the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; was still too orange and dark for me. They need to make a lighter version. Maybe if I get some color this summer I will be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I am 61 and do not wear makeup much because it looks too cakey and sometimes itches. This product was great. I will definitely used it from now on.</li>
            <li> I love BB Cream and I purchase it through Amazon. However, the BRCK brand is not being sold through Amazon at this time so I decided just to see what the US is selling (the BRCK is Korean I believe) so I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It comes out of the tube white, then turns to a reddish, dry something that sits on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not have the moisture content that I love with BRCK&lt;br /&gt;3. It feels cheap and looks cheap on the skin&lt;br /&gt;4. To use the product I am mixing it with the BRCK that I have left and that does help its coverage, moisture content but that being said, I do not want to just throw it in the garbage...I bought it so I am determined to use it.&lt;br /&gt;5. I would never ever buy this product again. Yes, the price point was cheap, and it is true you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Looks nice at first, but then it turns orange on your skin after prolonged use. You also have to apply powder to tone down the shine in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical! Makes my skin feels so nice and smooth. Provides just the right amount of coverage, no streaks, no oranginess, just smooth looking skin. I first tried a sample that was in a magazine! And then within 15 minutes I was on amazon buying it. I wasn&#x27;t sure where locally I would be able to buy it so I went directly to amazon. Used prime and had it in 2 days. People noticed that very first day i used it, and more have noticed since. They say things like &amp;#34;your skin looks so nice, what are you doing&amp;#34; figuring a new vitamin, detox tea or something :)</li>
            <li> This product covers great and makes my skin look smoother.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this product, I bought it out of curiosity but its not worth the price</li>
            <li> my favorite BB cream!&lt;br /&gt;it does the job!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I kept hearing so much about how well BB cream works, though I&#x27;m usually skeptical of products that have the word \\&quot;magic\\&quot; or claim to \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; your skin. I am not one of those women who is willing to buy a lot of different skin primers/powders/foundations, etc. (overwhelming, time consuming, and expensive!), and I need something that is easy and quick to apply in the morning. Therefore, I was interested in this product because of the promise of an \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While I actually like this product, there are some pros and cons. When I&#x27;m finished with this bottle, I will likely try another brand of BB cream that has SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Light, clean feel&lt;br /&gt;- I have dry skin, so I&#x27;m not too worried about feeling overly oily. I did not personally find this product to be oily.&lt;br /&gt;- For my skin, the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade blends in nicely&lt;br /&gt;- Skin feels smooth and looks even-toned after use&lt;br /&gt;- I use it under my eyes to cover up if I look tired&lt;br /&gt;- Compared to other BB creams, the L&#x27;Oreal option is reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- No SPF&lt;br /&gt;- Like most skin makeup, this product does not come in enough diverse skin tones&lt;br /&gt;- Overall, while I enjoy using BB cream, I am still suspicious about the BB cream product in general, regardless of brand. There are some brands that claim their BB cream does 11 things, some 10, or 3. The marketing is all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;- The product packaging makes some outrageous claims (\\&quot;flawless\\&quot;, \\&quot;perfects\\&quot; your skin). Sure, it works well and my skin looks better, but no product is going to make our skin \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; or \\&quot;flawless.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;- Additionally, the BB cream claim to \\&quot;improve skin over time\\&quot; is unclear. How much time? How many uses? It&#x27;s a vague marketing claim that consumers should approach with a healthy skepticism and realistic expectations.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with thus BB cream.  It goes on and soaks into my skin like lotion.  I still like to use a little face powder or mineral veil.  It really does make your skin look dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li> BUY IT.  Great primer, especially for the price.  Not drying, goes on smoothly.  It is one of the few effective on the tiny lines around my eyes &amp; lips.  I also found this product does not fail in summer heat &amp; fine during the cold winter months when my sensitive skin tends to get much dryer.  The big thing.....it doesn&#x27;t break me out!!!  This primer evens out my overall tone very, very well.  Make up still comes off the same at night, mascara doesn&#x27;t smudge, &amp; my T-zone is less oily.  My fav foundation is a creamy liquid - this primer makes it go on even easier &amp; blending is a breeze.  5 stars and I tried at least 7 other primers &amp; BB creams.</li>
            <li> Just like the item&#x27;s name, it&#x27;s magic. It&#x27;s very easy to use and it works very well. The price is also very nice. Love it! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Moisturizer, foundation and powder in one. Perfect when you don&#x27;t have alot of time to get ready. Skin looks smooth and not &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this BB cream and the Maybelline BB cream at the same time to find the best fit for my skin. I have very fair skin that is combination (oily t-zone/normal everywhere else). I tried the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream first. It was a sticky shiny mess! It made my skin feel tacky and gave my skin an oil slick sheen. Plus the color was very yellowy on my skin. I had high hopes for the L&#x27;oreal BB cream and it did not disappoint! I usually have a hard time matching my skin tone because it&#x27;s undertones fall somewhere between pink and yellow. I love how the L&#x27;oreal cream changes to match your skin tone. I also like the way it mattified my face which kept my face from looking oily for a good couple hours (I did not set either BB cream with powder). It doesn&#x27;t provide a flawless finish but it did a great job at evening out my skin tone. I will definitely be recommending it to people!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 6 different brands of BB cream and this one is the best.  Most of the others just seem like tinted moisturizer, but this one covers all the little flaws and makes you look and feel great. I don&#x27;t need any other makeup with this; it does it all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely terrible. I&#x27;m not sure where all these great reviews are coming from, because my experience with this product was god-awful.  First of all, I don&#x27;t really know how this is a &#x27;Light&#x27; Shade. I&#x27;m actually more of a medium, but I decided to by the light to avoid any make-up marks. This ended up being darker than my darkest  foundations I have floating around in my bag. Then, to top off the orange-faced clown look I had going on, I had a breakout almost instantaneously. Considering I was using this right before attending a formal event...I was not pleased. I payed over $11 for this crap at Walgreens, and it was on sale.  If you want to look like a puberty ridden Oompa Loompa...by all means, PLEASE buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a BB cream that does not contain sunscreen (sunscreen in make up products cause breakouts and major shine on my face). I picked this up when shopping because sunscreen isn&#x27;t listed on the box. Boy am I glad I did! It&#x27;s perfect. When I use it, my skin looks slightly dewy, fresh, and totally natural. I use it when I&#x27;m just hanging around the house, then dress it up with some mascara and lip gloss when going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a \\&quot;natural, fresh face\\&quot; look, I highly recommend this. It didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, made my skin tone looks even, and made my pores look tiny. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Heard about this from a makeup vlogger on YouTube (KandeeJohnson).  I had no clue something could make THAT big of a difference in the way makeup is applied and lasts.  THANKS Kandee!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have started noticing Sunspots on my forehead and my makeup wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  concealers were to thick or just felt too much... I don&#x27;t like the feeling of a bunch of makeup.  This is light and not greasy at all.  I have even put this on as my foundation and just cannot say enough about it.  Don&#x27;t panic when it comes out one color... it will change color as you smooth it in...</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m a sample addict, and I&#x27;ve tried several BB&#x27;s lately (as these are the trendy things....  Boscia was too dry and went on heavy. And most of the others (the names escape me, sorry) were either so sheer it didn&#x27;t matter, or too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a white sparkly liquid (I did a double take and had to recheck the box)....it is light and blends easily.  Layerable.  And not too matte where it looks unnatural.  My skin just looked more even and had a bit of a glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I break out or react, I&#x27;ll revise, but this was a killer product.  And at Target, it was less than $10.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite product!! It smoothes my face out, and corrects my tone.  My favorite product I have ever bought!!</li>
            <li> 1st time was great - creamy consistency, second tube was more like water.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I was looking for a BB cream that I could use as a light coverage foundation too. I found it! This offers just a little bit of coverage, covers up any redness, smooths everything out. Gives me a natural look! Love it! I ordered light and it was too dark, maybe better for summer. Fair is great! My skin is kind of light/fair, so I want sure which color to get, but fair is perfect.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost a dozen bb creams and this is the only one I really loved. Feels like silk on your skin and stays on great. I wish it had spf but it&#x27;s still well worth it.</li>
            <li> When you put it on your skin you&#x27;ll see why it&#x27;s appropriately named &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junky. I&#x27;ve tried several BB creams, but nothing has turned out as good as this. I&#x27;ve been trying to get a handle on my acne and part of that involves wearing little-to-no makeup. When I have a date with friends, I refuse to go out with makeup and thus use my normal foundation. When I&#x27;m at home alone, I don&#x27;t worry about makeup. But when hubby is home, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable going completely makeup free. So I was looking for something that was super light weight but would make at least a small difference in evening my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this for sale at Walgreens, checked Amazon reviews, and bought it. I LOVE it. It definitely is not a full coverage item, but it has the fullest coverage I&#x27;ve seen among BB creams. My face looks ten times better with it. If you let it sit for a little and dab a little more on trouble areas, you CAN get a little more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And under eyes? Wow. I suffer from dark circles. I&#x27;ve never met a concealer that could handle them without looking completely fake. I didn&#x27;t even buy this stuff with any intention of it helping my under eye area, so you can imagine how completely happy I was so see such wonderful coverage (for a BB cream)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say one thing, you have to be careful with this. I got the lightest color and without a bit of blush and bronzer, I look like a ghost. The color is right. It matches my neck and chest fine, but the color seems to lack any color. So make sure you add a pop of color with blush and bronzer. I usually stay away from bronzer since I&#x27;m so pale and I&#x27;m afraid of using too much. But with this product, it&#x27;s almost mandatory to use at least a LITTLE.</li>
            <li> I used to use another product from another company who &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; it to make a CC cream.  Well it didn&#x27;t provide any color!&lt;br /&gt;I have rosacea and this evens out the skin tone nicely, without being heavy.  I love it and hope L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t decide to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; it to a CC cream.</li>
            <li> This looks terrible on my skin! Even if I only add a little to my face and rub it in it still looks orange. :/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;m not really a fan. I&#x27;ve used and liked other BB creams, but this one&#x27;s a bit disappointing. The texture is gritty and unpleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t smooth over the skin very easily. It offers very minimal visible results. Even when a super small amount is used, it feels a bit gross/heavy on my face, surprisingly so for how light the coverage is. If a bit too much is applied, it makes my skin&#x27;s texture look rougher instead of smoother. Still, though, in very small quantities, it&#x27;s a bit better looking than bare-faced so I&#x27;ll probably finish off the tube I&#x27;ve got, but once it&#x27;s gone, I&#x27;m buying something else.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times L&#x27;oreal BB cream In the stores never had a problem I ordered it this time online and I did not like the quality or the texture of this it wasn&#x27;t like what I&#x27;ve always gotten it was more watery almost like it expired don&#x27;t know don&#x27;t like it will not be ordering from this Sender again</li>
            <li> okay. so i loved the fair however i accidently got light and thought ya know it cant be that bad,right? i was super wrong. it was a medium orange shade. i looked awful. im very pale and it was just bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 4 days now. It&#x27;s does everything that it claims to do. It smoothed my skins texture, hid imperfections some what, moisturized, and evened out my complexion. I noticed after a couple hours my skin felt greasy but did not look greasy. I also noticed a lot more white heads after using this product. My face just feels dirty when I use this. I think I&#x27;d use it more on \\&quot;no make-up\\&quot; days and make sure I wash my face before I go to bed. I haven&#x27;t decided If I&#x27;d buy this again or not</li>
            <li> I read about this product on urbanbaby last night. Some said not worth it but saw it at Target today and decided I should give it a try. Nothing tinted has worked for me in the past, always too cakey. I have replaced foundation with Shiseido SPF 55 because the residue from this product gives the skin a porcelain glow. BB cream sort of does the same at a way cheaper price. Target is way cheaper than the price here btw.</li>
            <li> 1)Inexpensive at Walmart or Target.&lt;br /&gt;2)A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;3)Magically \\&quot;corrects\\&quot; to your own skin color.&lt;br /&gt;4)Really evens out the tone of face AND neck.&lt;br /&gt;5)No oily residue an hour later.&lt;br /&gt;6)Seems to last all day and looks so natural and unmade-up.&lt;br /&gt;7)No transfer to clothing.&lt;br /&gt;8)I just lightly powder and sometimes not even blush needed.&lt;br /&gt;9)Feels like you have nothing on.&lt;br /&gt;10)Absolutely the BEST makeup I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> I have a fair complexion, but not too fair. I bought this product in light at the drug store and find that it is too dark for me. In makeup products, I always wear light. Every product is different, but this is disappointing. The main reason I am writing is I have oily skin (even at 42) and this product makes me a bit greasy. I don&#x27;t think someone with normal or dry skin would have this problem. I think the texture, although silky smooth, feels mask-like. Would love to find a sheerer light-weight BB for oilier skin!</li>
            <li> If you have really light skin get this bb cream in the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; shade and not the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; one . This product is really great it covers imperfections feels very light, and takes very little time to apply, one of the best bb creams I have tried , and very inexpensive. 👍</li>
            <li> This is pretty good but is not a miracle worker.  It comes out and you have to kinda rub it together in your hand to blend the color.  I use this with a loose powder dusted over for a light coverage.  Without powder it leaves my face a little to dewy.</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying my best friend&#x27;s BB cream. I&#x27;m quite impressed with the slight tint--I&#x27;ve been able to wear just this on the weekends when running my errands. It provides a perfect &amp;#34;middle of the road&amp;#34; between no make up (which no on wants to see!) and full make up (which I don&#x27;t want to do on the weekends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan and it&#x27;s a great price. I will continue to buy the L&#x27;Oreal BB Cream. I bought the light shade and might bump up one shade as I get further into the summer.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so I love this product as it evens out my red areas and hides pores without looking like I&#x27;m wearing make up and I have had no issues with the color (medium) and always shake the product to mix before using. It doesn&#x27;t take much and it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel caked or oily.  It does feels gritty when it first comes out but it smooths out almost immediately. My only question is why is the exact same product is $18.99 on Amazon and only $8.00 at the dreaded Wal-mart.  I love, love, love Amazon but not enough to pay $10 more for the same product.</li>
            <li> I tryed it before .I recommend  this</li>
            <li> I LOVE this BB cream!!&lt;br /&gt;I got this at the drug store and was a bit weary about the \\&quot;light\\&quot; tone as this was all they had. I tried it anyway and LOVED it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m east indian with beige skin (I use revlon photo ready airbrush foundaiton in the shade toast and the medium powder)So I thought this would be too fair.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit lighter than I would like, but not noticeably so.&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is AMAZING and the formula goes on smoothly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is white (which was scary because I thought I would look like a mime) but have no fear..once you start blending it into the skin the shade turns to brown&lt;br /&gt;I use this cream daily to go to work as I think my foundation is a bit much for daily routine and just for the office and this cream does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to contain a SPF.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I notice that after about 3 hours it fades and any marks that were once covered shows up again. Maybe I just need to reapply a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I still love this and would recommend as it provides coverage, is smooth and lightweight and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally a fan of L&#x27;Oreal products and this was the third BB Cream that I&#x27;ve tried. The color match was nice once it settled in, but it had an odd gritty texture when I spread it on my skin. I didn&#x27;t feel it afterward, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out why a liquid makeup would be gritty? I also felt that it didn&#x27;t have the staying power of other BB creams - while it looked great for the first hour, after about three, it seemed to wear off at a rate faster than just normal cover up. Oddly, then, it was rather tough to remove - even after fully washing my face with a sonic cleansing brush, I would wash my face again and still find traces of it. I used the full tube but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and didn&#x27;t like it at first because it was gray.  I decided to give it another try, using it with a brush and under bareminerals makeup.  it really makes a difference for the better.  it makes my makeup stay on longer without getting too oily (I have oily and sensitive skin-which is why I don&#x27;t like primers).  I wouldn&#x27;t waste it on a makeup free day because it has no spf, but it does act as a good primer substitute.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It goes on white and adjusts to your skin color. It covers flaws and makes my skin love fabulous.</li>
            <li> I first bought this at Target. I&#x27;ve tried the Korean BB creams with some success, except I have darker skin and can&#x27;t use them. I LOVE this BB Cream. So I ordered it via Amazon. When it arrived some of the label on the front had been rubbed off. I thought &amp;#34;Oh no, did I end up buying a knock off? This is a bummer.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Nope! It&#x27;s the same formula and I am SO happy I ordered more. I keep one tube at home and another in my purse. It&#x27;s perfect and light. If I don&#x27;t want to get made up I just add enough to hide some of my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I use it under my foundation. It&#x27;s a great moisterizing on days when I forget to bring my own moisterizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went swimming for the 4th of July and was genuinely surprised at how well my makeup stayed on. Even my boyfriend commented on how well it looked after swimming around. I am definitely buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I am madly in love with this super light makeup. goes on so smoothly and adds moisture at the same time. One of the best liquid foundations I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> it went on smoothly and covered better than any other product i have ever used on my face. you will love the change</li>
            <li> I tried this from a sample in a magazine and I thought it covered beautifully.  Now that I got the tube, I realize it isn&#x27;t any better than the Mary Kay product that I use already.</li>
            <li> Scared me at first when I got because it comes out a grey color and feels gritty, but it is amazing the color is perfect for my skin tone and makes my skin look flawless!</li>
            <li> It´s OK, It has helped some.</li>
            <li> The BB Cream is much darker than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> I recently had an opportunity to try the new Magic BB Cream from L&#x27;Oreal.  I started wearing makeup in junior high school, and back then the prevailing mentality was that if you were going to wear makeup, you needed to wear foundation to protect your skin.  Beauty products have changed a lot over the years, mostly for the better, and now, we have options regarding what type of coverage we want.  Because my skin has an uneven tone and color, I most often still opt for a light foundation.  It just helps me get a more even look.  However, because my skin is so dry, it almost always looks like I am wearing makeup.  I am never able to achieve that dewy, fresh faced look.  This product really appealed to me, in the hopes that I could finally get that look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic BB Cream says it primes, perfects, hydrates, and corrects.  Sadly, I found it lacking in all those areas.  If something is a primer, to me, that says it can be worn under regular foundation.  However, when I tried this, my makeup looked very thick and caked on.  I only used a small amount of the Magic BB cream, as well as a small amount of foundation, but it still looked like I was wearing stage makeup, not a good look.  Since the product claims to hydrate, I also tried using it without first moisturizing my skin; once again, the results were disastrous.  My skin looked so dry, and the pigment in the Magic BB cream was concentrated on those areas of dry skin, so again, I looked like I was wearing a lot of makeup, despite the fact that this is a minimal coverage products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the best way for me to use this product is by first moisturizing my skin as I normally would, then using Magic BB cream in place of foundation.  However, those claims to perfect and correct were also a let down to me, so I need to use spot corrector and undereye concealer, as well as powder.  And the results?  Well, they look the same as when I wear foundation.  The big difference is I feel like I am not wearing makeup at all.  And that is certainly a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think one of the reasons I ran into so many problems is that I chose the wrong color of Magic BB cream.  I have fair skin; I always use a fair foundation and the lightest concealer.  So, it stood to reason that I would need the lightest shade of Magic BB cream.  When I opened it to use it, however, the cream is nearly white. It is very light, and I think that is the reason it fails to even my skin tone and cover up imperfections.  While this is no fault of the product itself, consumers to need to be aware how very light (white really) the shade is in order to properly match their skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I think this product has a lot of potential for some women, but I just do not think it was a great match for me.  I think L&#x27;Oreal foundation is probably better suited to my coverage needs than the Magic BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a complimentary product courtesy of  SheSpeaks and L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al for review purposes.

            <li> This product is great! It works as a great primer! My makeup lasted all day with this underneath my foundation! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I must have it! Love love love! It feels incredible on your face too! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several expensive (\\&quot;American\\&quot; - apparently BB creams from Asia are 100x better) BB creams to try to find one to even out my red skin tone and act as a primer for my makeup. I tried this one in particular b/c a blogger I follow suggested it and I&#x27;m a product junkie. This product is AMAZING. When I first squeezed it into my hand, I was super disappointed b/c it&#x27;s quite thin, white, and almost gritty. When I smoothed it onto my face and looked in the mirror, however, I was floored. My skin looked softer, my dark acne spots were muted, and I had a nice matte palette on which to apply my makeup. (The &#x27;grit&#x27; is actually tiny color beads, I learned.) The color is a tad yellow for me, but I wear a light foundation &amp; bronzer on top of the BB cream so it&#x27;s not really an issue. I rarely go without makeup but I would probably be willing to apply only this to my skin to run errands and feel confident. The only skin type this MAY not work for is dry skin. I apply a SUPER light moisturizer underneath, but I don&#x27;t feel like this is moisturizing for someone who is looking for that type of product - perfect for me since I have oily skin. Highly recommended. They should hire me to endorse for them! :)</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised by this product.  I had a sample that I had tossed in my makeup drawer, forgetting about it for several months.  I didn&#x27;t feel like wearing foundation today, so I pulled this out and gave it a spin. I love it. My husband commented right away that my skin looked gorgeous. Normally, I use a fairly expensive cream foundation by Elizabeth Arden, but it can feel a little heavy. Today was a casual day, just running errands and going to a movie, so I wasn&#x27;t into the whole makeup ritual. This stuff is very impressive. I used the Light and it seems to be perfect for my skin. I noticed almost right away that my skin tone was beautifully even. There was a sort of candlelight glow to my face, not glittery or shiny, just luminous. Flaws and lines were softened quite noticeably. I am 62 years old, and my complexion is naturally very good, but today it was just gorgeous.  I am buying this stuff from now on.  I am delighted that it is a drugstore item.  L&#x27;Oreal, you really did a great job on this one.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. Puts a nice sheen on my face and adjusts to my skin color. No breakouts, and not oily.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE ORANGE TINT!  I recommend Beyond the Solution BB cream. So far it gave me the coverage and tint I like (PALE WHITE GIRL). So unless you are super orange tan, skip this one.</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cream, so I cannot compare with others. But I do like the primer-like texture (silky) and it gives a light coverage as a foundation, so it&#x27;s good for an everyday use (I prefer more coverage if I go out at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes, but since it does not have uv protection, I apply a moisturizer with SPF before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its color is sort of a shiny lilac, but after you apply it matches you skin color, kinda fun to watch. My skin is light to medium with an olive undertone, and the light works well with it.</li>
            <li> easy application. Covers pores and has very good coverage. Looks natural. Does not settle into wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Good BB cream! Smooth skin. Can tend to look cakey by end of the day</li>
