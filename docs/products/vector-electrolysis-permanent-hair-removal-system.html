            <li>THOSE WHO GAVE THE PERFECT STARS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THEM.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>This is the best thing ever.</li>
            <li>Best to get laser done and save yourself the time and pain and get results for your money!</li>
            <li>Kudos to Amazon for the excellent support.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This a great product, work as is described in the web site.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just add a drop when the gel gets sticky and good to go nuking away for a while.  </li>
            <li>Good luck with whatever you choose.</li>
            <li>Good luck to you and yours if you plan on dealing with this machine and company.</li>
            <li>The salt water is not conductive on it&#x27;s own as you will find so it has to be a mix.</li>
            <li>If I were to do it again, I&#x27;d probably try one of those laser hair removal machines that you can also buy online (but for two to three times the price) because I would like to try them to see if they work any better</li>

            <li>Keep in mind that the laser hair removal things seem to have gotten better reviews than this though. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>i had much more luck dipping the tweezers in the gel and then grabbing the hair.</li>
            <li>MORE 6-7 THOUSANDS.</li>
            <li>When it worked, I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>but I think the company (Vector) is more focused on taking money than quality products and customer care.</li>
            <li>Glad they now include it in the kit.  </li>
            <li>Mind-boggling.</li>
            <li>Your hand easily gets cramped after holding the tweezers for some time, so I&#x27;ve resorted to paying my niece who&#x27;s in her teens to come and do it on me. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>After purchasing a needle holder and a package of needles from Electricspa.com and a good lighted magnifying mirror from Amazon, I found the machine pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li>You need a very steady hand and it seems that, if you don&#x27;t feel any kind of sensation, you probably are not holding the hair in the correct place.</li>
            <li>I give it one star only because Amazon&#x27;s customer services was great to help me.</li>
            <li>Either way, I have a refund coming from Amazon with free return shipping.  </li>
            <li>When I bought mine, the needle-type devices weren&#x27;t available for home use.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to order this</li>
            <li>I use full power, grab the hair and apply power,</li>
            <li>There are 4 patches provided and they quickly lose their stickiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that the laser hair removal things seem to have gotten better reviews than this though. &#x3D;)to a friend, just because I don&#x27;t think most of my friends would really commit to using it, so it would be a waste of their money.</li>
            <li>They also recommended that I take a warm bath shortly before treatment since this would help increase the moisture content in the hair to be treated.</li>
            <li>I find the Vector is only effective after a shower, when the hairs are damp and conductive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is much more efficient to have a professional electrologist remove whatever hairs you want to get rid of.</li>
            <li>Realizing that the process would take much longer than originally thought, I purchased the Vector machine.  </li>
            <li>Then, I tried plucking the hair out again but this time, it came out very easily, leaving no red marks or bumps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, after using the machine, I&#x27;ve realized that you have to grab the hair very close to the skin (and oftentimes I end up electrocuting my skin because of this, even though that is not recommended) and you have to use a special conduction gel (included,</li>
            <li>Amazon tookthree full weeks to resolve the claim, and much to my horror</li>
            <li>if it doesn&#x27;t get a good connection according to the meter try to grab the hair again but closer to the skin and pull slightly away and nuke.</li>
            <li>My hair is blonde, so many types of laser hair removal have not worked.  </li>
            <li>though I added some saline solution to it to make it more liquid) in order to actually get the electricity to enter into the hair follicle.</li>
            <li>So I tried putting more of the electric current into the hair with the tweezers.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re male, the device works but it takes more than one try to remove that beard hair.</li>
            <li>Unless you nuke them like I described ;-]one time will do it.  </li>
            <li>I zapped myself many times, cursed and finally removed one</li>
            <li>You are more likely to zap your skin.</li>
            <li>At first, I tried gently plucking out the stubble hair</li>
            <li>First I thought it&#x27;s not working, then I could  remove some hairs, it takes so much time and result is almost zero.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Do NOT try plucking it with great force because you&#x27;ll end up with a dark red mark.</li>
            <li>when i read previous reviews, i thought that the problem shall be with time, because it take a lot of time to finish job, but after i tried it once i was happy with the results until i saw all my treated hairs grew back again like i had waist my time.</li>
            <li>Had this product for several years, works fine.  </li>
            <li>However, you can also get too much sensation and end up burning / blistering your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very time-consuming device.</li>
            <li>hope I covered everything for others who may have the same questions I did when I was trying to find a detailed review on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very time consuming</li>
            <li>i am very upset with this result.</li>
            <li>Youhave to be VERY patient and you need to have a steady hand.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was sent a replacement and it was the new blue tweezers, which grips onto hair very well; it works much better than the black tweezers.</li>
            <li>probably wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this to a friend, just because I don&#x27;t think most of my friends would really commit to using it, so it would be a waste of their money.</li>
            <li>I felt the tingling sensation of the current once again and saw some more pus-like fluid.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Prior to doing so, I put a lot of warm water on my facial stubble to open up the pores a bit and moisten the hair.</li>
            <li>lesson here is don&#x27;t waste your money go and have electrolysis by a reputable beautician.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, the seller actually sent the item back to me with the message that she had tried it before sending it back and it worked fine for her!</li>
            <li>I used it consistently in accordance with the directions for several months</li>
            <li>It is recommended (but not necessary) to shave the area or wax the hairs first before using the machine.</li>
            <li>Firstly for all the ladies out there you wouldn&#x27;t EVER want to shave your face and secondly rely on this machine to remove the hairs.</li>
            <li>First of all, I should start by saying that I&#x27;m male because there are two types of hair: vellus, which is the fine hair that women have (easy to remove), and there&#x27;s terminal (difficult to remove), which is what males have.</li>
            <li>I know there are some strange reviews for this product that give quirky, bizarre instructions on how to make it work</li>
            <li>A professional uses a tiny needle (or probe) to apply current directly into the hair follicle and kill it quickly.</li>
            <li>and you only really get it through trial and error.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t really afford it, I&#x27;d probably just stick to waxing and individual tweezing.</li>
            <li>and you only really get it through trial and error.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t really afford it, I&#x27;d probably just stick to waxing and individual tweezing.</li>
            <li>The treatments I can do look professional.</li>
            <li>After 6 months of weekly professional electrolysis treatments, I had a bald spot on my chin the size of a dime.  </li>
            <li>When electrolysis is complete, the hair will release from the skin painlessly.  </li>
            <li>Hair is a natural insulator.</li>
            <li>I forgot to mention that I had also called the Vector company while I was trying to make the device work, and all you get is an answering machine promising to get back to you.</li>
            <li>after my first treatment i was left with red spots where i had treated each hair.</li>
            <li>After I slid a nail file between the grippers a few times, the tweezers worked fine (if you do this, be careful not to file too much, as you don&#x27;t want the metal visible).</li>
            <li>and I noticed that there was some pus-like fluid appearing (this is normal in electrolysis hair removal).</li>
            <li>(the only real noise is the sound of the foot pedal which I use on the table in front of me and push down with my other hand).</li>
            <li>Well I could bet most of the bad reviews are for a certain purpose and not to make a real opinion.</li>
            <li>This machine is apparently also used by professionals and can be used with the electrolysis needles (though it says you have to have a license in order to use it with the needles - which are not included).</li>
            <li>turned up and it will zap the bare skin.  </li>
            <li>In early use, you will find that what does grow back is lighter and finer.  </li>
            <li>It was to difficult to grasp the hair follicles with the tweezers and hold effectively.</li>
            <li>If you do it right you will have red bumps and swelling around the follicle in a few minutes and the next day it might scab up</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using the vector system for a few months, and can agree with what most other users say - yes it is time consuming, you must treat each hair individually for about 25 seconds, and due to hair growth cycles, not all hairs are visible at once.</li>
            <li>Today, after several years, I bring it out every two weeks for \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; trimming, as it seems new follicles become active every couple of weeks.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair is blonde, so many types of laser hair removal have not worked.  So, I decided to give this product a try.  I used it consistently in accordance with the directions for several months and it didn&#x27;t work at all for permanent hair removal.</li>
            <li> First of all, when I received this a few months ago, the tweezers wouldn&#x27;t touch because the rubberized grippers were too thick. After I slid a nail file between the grippers a few times, the tweezers worked fine (if you do this, be careful not to file too much, as you don&#x27;t want the metal visible). I was a little worried that the machine would make beeps or other loud noises (I have a dog who becomes obsessed with noises) but it&#x27;s quiet and doesn&#x27;t make any beeping noises (the only real noise is the sound of the foot pedal which I use on the table in front of me and push down with my other hand). As for the actual electrolysis part of it, it seems to work. They recommend you read the instructions carefully before using it and I feel this is a must! Before I got the machine I figured I could hold a hair with tweezers for a minute or longer, no problem. However, after using the machine, I&#x27;ve realized that you have to grab the hair very close to the skin (and oftentimes I end up electrocuting my skin because of this, even though that is not recommended) and you have to use a special conduction gel (included, though I added some saline solution to it to make it more liquid) in order to actually get the electricity to enter into the hair follicle. You need a very steady hand and it seems that, if you don&#x27;t feel any kind of sensation, you probably are not holding the hair in the correct place. However, you can also get too much sensation and end up burning / blistering your skin. This machine is apparently also used by professionals and can be used with the electrolysis needles (though it says you have to have a license in order to use it with the needles - which are not included). And after using the machine, I now understand why electrolysis is expensive and time consuming. Your hand easily gets cramped after holding the tweezers for some time, so I&#x27;ve resorted to paying my niece who&#x27;s in her teens to come and do it on me. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this to a friend, just because I don&#x27;t think most of my friends would really commit to using it, so it would be a waste of their money. If I were to do it again, I&#x27;d probably try one of those laser hair removal machines that you can also buy online (but for two to three times the price) because I would like to try them to see if they work any better / easier. If you do get this, it seems to be easiest to use it at a table or desk. I had been thinking I could maybe do it while watch TV but that is practically impossible for me to do. All in all, it works but takes tons of time and lots of effort and you only really get it through trial and error. If you have the money, go for it. If you can&#x27;t really afford it, I&#x27;d probably just stick to waxing and individual tweezing. &#x3D;) Keep in mind that the laser hair removal things seem to have gotten better reviews than this though. &#x3D;)to a friend, just because I don&#x27;t think most of my friends would really commit to using it, so it would be a waste of their money.

            <li> First of all, I should start by saying that I&#x27;m male because there are two types of hair: vellus, which is the fine hair that women have (easy to remove), and there&#x27;s terminal (difficult to remove), which is what males have. The reason I mentioned that I&#x27;m male is because, as you&#x27;ve probably already figured out, I have terminal hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used Vector Electrolysis, I tested it on my arm hair, but I didn&#x27;t feel a thing and the hair was still difficult to pluck. So I contacted customer service and asked why the power meter on the device doesn&#x27;t go any further than 3 tick marks. They said that the needle on the power meter usually moves 1/5 and 1/2 of the way. They also recommended that I take a warm bath shortly before treatment since this would help increase the moisture content in the hair to be treated. I was about to return the product but I decided to give it a second try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I did: I took a shower shortly before treatment so that my skin would be moist enough for the conductive patch that comes with the device. I decided to try removing some of my facial stubble. Prior to doing so, I put a lot of warm water on my facial stubble to open up the pores a bit and moisten the hair. Then, I pat it dry and applied a generous amount of conductive gel. Next, I just kept trying with the electric tweezers until I felt a tingling sensation and I noticed that there was some pus-like fluid appearing (this is normal in electrolysis hair removal). At first, I tried gently plucking out the stubble hair but I felt that it was still too difficult to pull out. So I tried putting more of the electric current into the hair with the tweezers. I felt the tingling sensation of the current once again and saw some more pus-like fluid. It started to hurt so I stopped the electric current. Then, I tried plucking the hair out again but this time, it came out very easily, leaving no red marks or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very time-consuming device. Youhave to be VERY patient and you need to have a steady hand. Other than that, the product works!! If you&#x27;re male, the device works but it takes more than one try to remove that beard hair. The hair should come out with ease. Do NOT try plucking it with great force because you&#x27;ll end up with a dark red mark. As for the females, if male (terminal) hair can be removed, then your (vellus) hair can definitely be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I covered everything for others who may have the same questions I did when I was trying to find a detailed review on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (6/29/2012): The wire&#x27;s rod that connects to the tweezers broke and got stuck in the tweezers. Fortunately, I was sent a replacement and it was the new blue tweezers, which grips onto hair very well; it works much better than the black tweezers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product over a year ago and used it several times with absolutly no benefit.  I would not recommend the purchasae of this product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using the vector system for a few months, and can agree with what most other users say - yes it is time consuming, you must treat each hair individually for about 25 seconds, and due to hair growth cycles, not all hairs are visible at once. but this is no reason not to purchase! the product works well, but after some time using, i can offer a few words of advice. for one, the times recommended in the user guide were WAY too long. after my first treatment i was left with red spots where i had treated each hair. also, the product states to coat the hair in the conductive gel - i had much more luck dipping the tweezers in the gel and then grabbing the hair. and yes, the tweezers are horrible. i sharpened mine with a sharpener and they were still difficult to use, which brings me to my next point, invest in a needle attachment. the vector system is compatible with any needle probe that uses a banana connector (cost about $40 with enough needles for all over treatment). you don&#x27;t need to use the gel, you can turn the electricity settings way down, and you treat each hair correctly, every time.</li>
            <li> I  tried to use it several times, followed the directions,. I plugged it in several outlets. I called the consumer hotline that came with the directions and got the same recording that the line was not accepting calls. I also sent them an email to the address listed on the directions, without a response. So I got the Amazon return info and mailed it back to you last week.</li>
            <li> I have owned this thing for almost 2 years now. I remember before I bought it reading all the negative reviews and finally decided to take a chance. Well I could bet most of the bad reviews are for a certain purpose and not to make a real opinion. Anyways Using this off and on for a while it works. I am not going to spend hours everyday so I use it when I think about it and figured out a couple tricks.  In addition to the gel, make a small amount of water mixed with salt in a small container. Use the salt water to mix with the gel ON THE AREA you want to nuke. The gel is too thick and the salt water thins it enough so it doesn&#x27;t clump up at the tweezer end. The salt water is not conductive on it&#x27;s own as you will find so it has to be a mix. I just add a drop when the gel gets sticky and good to go nuking away for a while.  The technique I use is similar to the directions however if you don&#x27;t fry that sucker it will never go away. I use full power, grab the hair and apply power, if it doesn&#x27;t get a good connection according to the meter try to grab the hair again but closer to the skin and pull slightly away and nuke. Let it cook, sometimes it takes a little while to start conducting and once the meter maxes out hold it and count to 7. Then don&#x27;t pull but release pressure for a few seconds so it cools off and then pull it out. If you do it right you will have red bumps and swelling around the follicle in a few minutes and the next day it might scab up so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using my method on your unibrow or ladies mustaches unless you can deal with the red marks for a few days.   If you use this method.... Yep it hurts and some would say it hurts a LOT so if you are not into it then don&#x27;t even bother using the Vector unit.. But that&#x27;s why you are reading this no?  That&#x27;s what it takes for thick hairs such as bikini areas or underarms. Like you have read it will take a few times in the same follicle for them to stop forever. Unless you nuke them like I described ;-]one time will do it.  Good luck with whatever you choose.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.When the machine was sent to me the ac  plug that was sent with the machine wouldnt work anywhere in my house.I called the vector company and it says they will call back in two days.Im waited a month and no returned call.I even went out of my way to search for a plug and failed.I called Amazon and told them about it and now I had to return it .Never got to even try it.I give it one star only because Amazon&#x27;s customer services was great to help me.Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this but my tweezers will not grab or pull the hair out, so I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item in hopes that I could finish some remainig hairs that grew back. I had treatment in another country but I had to move (for my job). And what do you know, It didn&#x27;t work! So I shipped it back in hopes that I would get my $199.95 back but guess who was charge a 15% fee to restock item!!! I was refunded $169.96. Good luck to you and yours if you plan on dealing with this machine and company.</li>
            <li> THEN THE HAIRS GROW BACK TO BE THICKERS AND DARKER. ALSO CAUSE YOU TO HAVE INFECTION OF THE HAIRS. I RESALED MY MACHINE ON EBAY WHICH THE STUPID PERSON BROUGHT FOR ME HALF OF THE PRICE. ONLY THE PROFESSIONAL LASER HAIRS OF INSTITUTE WILL HELP YOU FOR HAVING HALF OF THE HAIRS LESS IN YOUR BODY WHICH COSTS ABOUT OR MORE 6-7 THOUSANDS. THOSE WHO GAVE THE PERFECT STARS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THEM.</li>
            <li> For anyone wishing to purchase this machine let me assure it is a waste of time. I removed 1 hair in about half an hour (on my face). I zapped myself many times, cursed and finally removed one and then I don&#x27;t know if I just pulled it out accidentally. You are more likely to zap your skin. It is recommended (but not necessary) to shave the area or wax the hairs first before using the machine. Firstly for all the ladies out there you wouldn&#x27;t EVER want to shave your face and secondly rely on this machine to remove the hairs. (also you would have to wait for a regrowth and how is that helpful?) It just doesn&#x27;t work using the tweezers alone,  you have to apply a patch as close to the area as possible that you are tweezing and apply gel. There are 4 patches provided and they quickly lose their stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;It is a coordination game as well, you have a patch on your face , tweezers in one hand and foot on a pedal, all of these items are connected to the machine with small leads, and all while trying to grab one hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use in Australia and had to have plug adaptors to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I debated whether to get this after reading the reviews and am really very, very sorry I bought it.  Also for those that might have a pacemaker you should not use this machine. (it&#x27;s in the manual all 2 small pages of it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson here is don&#x27;t waste your money go and have electrolysis by a reputable beautician.</li>
            <li> I never used this device because I read on Hair Facts that it is a fake. There hasn&#x27;t been any scientific study that proved you cold use hair gel to conduct electricity. The vector web site has a ton of grammatical issues as well.</li>
            <li> When it worked, I was pleased with the results.  After about 4 uses, the machine stopped working.  When calling the company, I just got an automated system, even though I selected to speak to a representative.  I was asked to leave a message and someone would get back to me in 48 hours.  48 hours came and went.</li>
            <li> the package came on time then as soon as i tried to use it it obviously doesnt work and it comes with a foregin cable so i used an adapter and it still doesnt work and i tell myself why why me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed! I&#x27;m actually saving anywhere from $50.00 to $100 dollars every session. This is the best thing ever. Yeah it takes some getting used to, and its a little dangerous. I&#x27;m stoked because this costed me $140 with a coupon code. The treatments I can do look professional. I like to use it with a clock, q-tips and medical tape.</li>
            <li> It does do the job but it&#x27;s very slow work.  It&#x27;s is very awkward to use because you have to hold the tweezers with one hand and push the petal with a foot or another hand.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking that it would be the answer to my pocket. It has turned out to be a nightmare. I had to reorder this product twice because each time it did not work. The pedal didn&#x27;t work and the sensor never moved. I returned the product over 20 days ago and still have not received an confirmation email nor a credit to my account. I called the 24/7 support line of Vector and it hangs up on you. I have sent an email to the support team that states that someone will get back with you within 48 hours and still have not heard from anyone in over 10 days. Judge for yourself but I think the company (Vector) is more focused on taking money than quality products and customer care.</li>
            <li> After 6 months of weekly professional electrolysis treatments, I had a bald spot on my chin the size of a dime.  Realizing that the process would take much longer than originally thought, I purchased the Vector machine.  One use with the tweezers and I knew that I would have to use a needle instead.  After purchasing a needle holder and a package of needles from Electricspa.com and a good lighted magnifying mirror from Amazon, I found the machine pretty easy to use.  For the price of 2 electrolysis treatments I can use the machine at my leisure.  It is not painless, but not much more painful than tweezing.  In spite of the negative reviews, it works for me and I would recommend it to friends and family.  If it came with a needle and needle holder I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Used on highest setting (not fun). This did not kill the hairs after multiple uses.</li>
            <li> Very time consuming and it didn&#x27;t seem to stunt the growth of the hair. Best to get laser done and save yourself the time and pain and get results for your money!</li>
            <li> Tedious, not sure if it even works.</li>
            <li> when i read previous reviews, i thought that the problem shall be with time, because it take a lot of time to finish job, but after i tried it once i was happy with the results until i saw all my treated hairs grew back again like i had waist my time. i am very upset with this result.</li>
            <li> This a great product, work as is described in the web site.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor R&lt;br /&gt;Dallas, Tx</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see how this product could work for anybody, or I have defective unit. Either way, I have a refund coming from Amazon with free return shipping.  Kudos to Amazon for the excellent support.&lt;br /&gt;I smeared the gel as instructed, I attached the patch as directed, I hooked up the machine as directed and followed all the instructions.  Touch the hair and nothing happens, touch the skin next to the hair with the machine turned up and it will zap the bare skin.  Hair just sits there. Too bad I wanted to zap the hair instead of just the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product. I&#x27;m following instructions, but I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s working. Sometimes it&#x27;s working and sometimes it&#x27;s not. First I thought it&#x27;s not working, then I could  remove some hairs, it takes so much time and result is almost zero.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I returned it. It was to difficult to grasp the hair follicles with the tweezers and hold effectively. Just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and they sent me a 240 volt not a 120 volt. so I never got to use it, so one star for wrong voltage.</li>
            <li> Had this product for several years, works fine.  I bought it for the stray nose, earlobe, and eyebrow stuff that guys get.  Today, after several years, I bring it out every two weeks for \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; trimming, as it seems new follicles become active every couple of weeks.  They are so few you can count them.  I find the Vector is only effective after a shower, when the hairs are damp and conductive.  In early use, you will find that what does grow back is lighter and finer.  No doubt, the process is tedious and time consuming.  It would take a patient woman to use it on leg hair.  Also, I suggest you follow instructions to leave the hair in, even after you&#x27;ve completed the process, as the chemicals created in the electrolysis process at the root help prevent regrowth.  Pulling the hair before the process is completed will hurt, and won&#x27;t prevent regrowth.  Let the device do it&#x27;s job.  When electrolysis is complete, the hair will release from the skin painlessly.  There&#x27;s a fine line between pulling the hair enough to keep distance between tweezer and skin - zap - while not pulling painfully on the hair.  When I bought mine, the needle-type devices weren&#x27;t available for home use.  They look a little scary to me.  The Vector has adjustable power settings: the highest power works fast, but will give you a serious zap if you touch skin.  Removing thick beard hairs leaves a welt for 15 minutes.  I used it to shape my beard pattern in the upper cheeks, just in case I decide to grow a beard again.  BTW, when I bought this unit, I also bought (what was then) the optional footpedal.  Glad they now include it in the kit.  Without it, you would zap yourself all the time.</li>
            <li> This is the single worst product I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon. It is sold by a third-party seller (head2toefit) who will resist every effort you make to return it, which you&#x27;ll want to do within 24 hours of trying it. I know there are some strange reviews for this product that give quirky, bizarre instructions on how to make it work but they are not to be taken seriously. This is what will happen: you&#x27;ll carefully follow the setup instructions and then press the foot pedal to zap the hair and ... nothing. Unless of course you press the tweezers onto your skin, and then you&#x27;ll just get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason the product doesn&#x27;t work is because hair is not meant to conduct electricity. Hair is a natural insulator. The gel that comes with the product is meant to try to overcome that problem but it fails miserably. One reviewer stated that a customer service rep told them to try the device after a shower because then the moisture content of the hair will be maximized, thus allowing the hair to transmit the current needed to destroy the follicle. I tried this myself but saw no difference. It&#x27;s also worth noting that your hair only stays wet a few minutes after a shower so you wouldn&#x27;t have time to get a lot of hairs with this approach even if it did work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned before, when you see the product doesn&#x27;t work, your nightmare is only beginning. I immediately sent the device back to this seller (head2toefit) but she told me that it was her policy not to grant refunds on opened items, even if they were defective. (Note that there is no such return policy stated on her store profile.) So, I filed a claim with Amazon and waited for them to investigate the situation. In the meantime, the seller actually sent the item back to me with the message that she had tried it before sending it back and it worked fine for her! Mind-boggling. In a series of poorly written emails over the next few days she insisted that she wasn&#x27;t giving me a refund. Amazon tookthree full weeks to resolve the claim, and much to my horror, they initially denied my request for a refund on the grounds that they couldn&#x27;t force the seller to grant it. I had to appeal the decision and they then overturned their initial denial and refunded me my $200. I forgot to mention that I had also called the Vector company while I was trying to make the device work, and all you get is an answering machine promising to get back to you. I left my name and number and never got a call back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much more efficient to have a professional electrologist remove whatever hairs you want to get rid of. Probably cheaper too. A professional uses a tiny needle (or probe) to apply current directly into the hair follicle and kill it quickly.</li>
