            <li>Smells great and keeps my hands dry in this Afghanistan winter!</li>
            <li>Great for my dry hands!</li>

            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this product would highly recommend</li>
            <li>The fragrance is different from the Shea cashmere, but still nice.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying, and I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and lingers all day into the next.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>after I used it once or twice, I suddenly fell in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li>Leave very moist!</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth and silky in function and in form.</li>
            <li>It is great and long lasting.</li>
            <li>local B&amp;BW doesn&#x27;t carry the True Blue line, so I settled for the Sensual Jasmine &amp; Vanilla lotion, which is nice, but doesn&#x27;t compare to this</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have found that actually makes my fingers feel better.  </li>
            <li>At first, it seemed a little strong and too perfumey.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is a non-greasy lotion that absorbs quickly into your hand&#x27;s dry skin and makes them feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves your hands so silky and soft.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hands so soft</li>
            <li>Your hands are extra soft and supple in the morning when you wake up.  </li>
            <li>It is a rather thick cream but absorbs well and just a pea sized dab works just fine, so it will last me quite a while!</li>

            <li> Just what she wanted! Fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This cream smells terrific and makes my dry hands feel like a glove, not greasy but after use, it stays on your hands almost like a glove. I love this product would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have had this before...  it was a gift  from my sister. I have had so many compliments on the scent. Was glad to find it online.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product is just wonderful.  Not only does it keep my hands silky smooth, the fragrance is just amazing.  I used it one day and then walked through the plant at work.  One of my co-workers stopped me to ask what I was wearing.  I told her that it was my hand cream and sent her a link via email so she could purchase some for herself!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hands so silky and soft. The fragrance is different from the Shea cashmere, but still nice. Arrived quickly.</li>

People I work with actually follow the scent down the hall, to compliment me.  I&#x27;ve asked around and nobody has copped to feeling offended or overpowered by it, I get compliments all around.</li>
            <li> Hands feel wonderfully moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> Every lady my wife meets she tells them about this hand cream.  She just loves it as it makes her hands soft and smooth and it has a nice fragrance that she likes.  It is a non-greasy lotion that absorbs quickly into your hand&#x27;s dry skin and makes them feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She especially likes to use it in the winter as it helps repair the damage caused by the cold dry air.  This is one of her favorite products and because she raves about it as much as she does, I know you will like it also!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this handcream.  My hands and nails are atrocious after having undergone chemo for breast cancer.  The taxotere in my chemo mix has my nails looking like hades and my fingers around the nails are constantly peeling and cracking.  This is the only product I have found that actually makes my fingers feel better.  I will keep using it even after the nails and hands are &amp;#34;well&amp;#34; again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell off this lotion, it&#x27;s smells sooo good, my husband even complimented me on how nice it smelled.  It also makes my hands so soft It makes my skin feel like silk. I have tried all sorts of lotions to and this is the best lotion by far. This will be the third time ordering this lotion.  I hope they don&#x27;t quite making this lotion. They delivered it on time as usual. The only thing I wish is that it came in a bigger size. Definitely worth buying, and I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with the smell of this lotion. It&#x27;s hard to describe but the smell is a combination of woodsy, peppery and a hint of patchouli. I used it on my feet and it went on nicely but lost its creaminess as I rubbed it in. It did feel nice like silk &amp; cashmere tho. The smell is very strong and lingers all day into the next. I could smell it through my socks &amp; mesh sneakers. If I liked the smell I would have been 100% happy. I have numerous bath &amp; body products and I can&#x27;t believe they produced a femme product that smells like a man. Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you like smelling like a dude.</li>
            <li> My hands are addicted to this stuff. I am in a very dry environment where I have to continuously wash my hands. This is a must in harsh considitions like these. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Came upon this product accidentally while browsing one of Bath &amp; Body Works stores in Pittsburgh. The hand cream goes on easily and absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving a slippy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though very little is needed when applying, (just a dab), I wish it came in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Bath and Body products.  Smells wonderful, not too over powering.  Great for dry, cracked winter hands.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Best cream have used on my hands!  Leave very moist!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I use it every night before I go to bed on my hands and elbows.  Is has a yummy scent that is not overpowering.  Your hands are extra soft and supple in the morning when you wake up.  If you can ever find the matching shower cream, give it a try too, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my hands dry in this Afghanistan winter!</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth and silky in function and in form. It is a rather thick cream but absorbs well and just a pea sized dab works just fine, so it will last me quite a while!</li>
            <li> Love the way this feel, silky and smooth without being greasy and smell peaceful.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my hands feel for hours.  It is great and long lasting.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this! It was discontinued an looks like brought it back! The smell I amazing and leaves your skin sooooo soft! I get compliments every time I put it on!</li>
            <li> love how soft and smooth my hands feel with this great smelling hand cream.</li>
            <li> Great for my dry hands!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I use it every day.</li>
