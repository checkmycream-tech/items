            <li>For the price that I paid, I honestly can NOT complain!</li>
            <li>$90 Marc Jacobs brush :P</li>
            <li>i was told it a great product they loved it.</li>
            <li>There are so many great things about these brushes!</li>
            <li>If you are wanting to get a lot of good quality brushes for good price this is great.</li>
            <li>The product itself was nicely packed &amp; was beautiful.</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived very quickly and though I haven&#x27;t used them yet they look and feel like very good quality!</li>
            <li>Great price for the product for sure!</li>
            <li>While i loved the set there are no brushes made for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>brushes are good..</li>
            <li>Quality wise</li>
            <li>I looked over every brush, and they were good</li>
            <li>but when I was washing them they held up really good</li>
            <li>the brushes are a good price if you&#x27;re like myself and want to have something to learn and practice with.</li>
            <li>but they are still good.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;leather\\&quot; case they come in is nice and works great.  </li>
            <li>and I needed a good but inexpensive brush set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this brush set for my wife during Christmas and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are really good for the money.  </li>
            <li>Verry good..</li>
            <li>but, it all looks good and no strands came of it yet.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have any good blending brushes, and there&#x27;s not even a foundation brush in sight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good set of brushes can save you a fortune, in and of themselves.</li>
            <li>Because of that I just can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend without a warning.</li>
            <li>i got it way before.which i loved.  </li>
            <li>i figured if i would buy a set a brushes i would buy a good set.but</li>
            <li>and i loved</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t  put mineral makeup  on good.</li>
            <li>and I needed a good deal.</li>
            <li>These brushes are a good value for what you pay.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that, the packaging was good, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>The girls loved them.</li>
            <li>These are great brushes for those who know what they are doing and have experiences using make up brushes but for those who aren&#x27;t professionals it would be nice if each brush was labelled with what type of brush it is.</li>
            <li>They appeared to be good quality, so I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>My girl loved them.</li>
            <li>I bought it for a gift, and she loved it.</li>
            <li>This is a really good set for the price.  </li>

            <li>Good brushes.</li>
            <li>she said the quality was good</li>
            <li>The brushes are gorgeous.</li>

            <li>The case does have a very strong odor which transfers to the brushes, but a good airing out does the trick.  </li>
            <li>We love Shany products!  </li>
            <li>but i decided to take the risk and order them, and I&#x27;m glad i did!</li>

            <li>and they smell lovely:)</li>
            <li>However, I did find some shedding on most of them.</li>
            <li>I still love them and they really are a great value.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a big brush set and still have some room in your wallet, this set is perfect.</li>
            <li>If I could give this MORE than 5 stars, I would.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if I should trust brushes sold so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>She opened them and is in love with them.</li>
            <li>But being a MUA I don&#x27;t mind buying more brushes because I will use them all the time&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutly love these brushes.</li>
            <li>And to top it all off...the brushes are not labeled to let you know what each one is used for.</li>
            <li>I think she will love them</li>
            <li>I am overly satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>, i love it ...</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li>What makes the set even better is that you get a case that rolls up to hold all 32 brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought these</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>

            <li>i am quite pleased</li>
            <li>excellent brushes for make-up artist and daily used!</li>
            <li>I am by no means a make up expert, there are so many brushes</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Love this for me and for work.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll surely get another one😁😁😁😁</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are better off used as artist brushes than make-up ones.</li>
            <li>For those that don&#x27;t want to spend a mint on brushes such as MAC, or for those that need a good &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; set, these are GREAT.</li>
            <li>I found this humorous because A)</li>
            <li>This is why I feel this set makes a better booster set then a starter one.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I love the brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner plus when I watch tutorials they gurus can explain better which one they are using.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with the brushes.</li>
            <li>and I just love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE them!❤</li>
            <li>she&#x27;ll love this</li>
            <li>Just wish there was more of a variety.</li>
            <li>But they should be truthful.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brushes f.  </li>

            <li>becuase it can be used for so many things.</li>
            <li>but it is way better in quality</li>
            <li>but actually most are synthetic (plastic)</li>
            <li>These brushes are FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>These work as well or better than a set I have that I paid more for.  </li>
            <li>I plan to order a couple more for gifts for my daughters.</li>

            <li>This made it an okay buy.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I wish the quality was better</li>
            <li>However many others are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an aspiring makeup artist (in my head of course) and I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes were okay.</li>
            <li>But overall a very good set!</li>
            <li>and I am so satisfied.</li>
            <li>so many brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with the product especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>No problems with the delivery either :)</li>
            <li>The brushes are ok...</li>
            <li>I am ok with it all in all for the price.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Love the leather roll also. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anyone giving these brushes more than 1 star which makes me question who has written all those 5 star ratings.</li>
            <li>Thats what ticked me off the most</li>
            <li>it was okay</li>
            <li>I HAVE SO MANY MAKEUP BRUSH SETS FROM THIS COMPANY</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the most important part!</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>but i still love these brush.</li>
            <li>some brushes broke within a couple of days, its not a leather pouch but pleather, i could have gotten better brushes at walmart for this price</li>
            <li>So far the brushes have held together very nicely, the bristles have stayed in place and it looks nice to boot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cleaning them now so they can be soft and clean :D</li>
            <li>It just arrived today and I am very excited about using it.</li>
            <li>These brushes are pretty good quality; great really, for the price.  </li>
            <li>Theyre really soft and they work good!</li>
            <li>Everything arrived in tact, clean and the case protects the brush shape nicely.</li>
            <li>Shany&#x27;s service was great and super fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>Great price for high quality material.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft and are perfect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a make-up artist, so as a normal person I think the quality of the brushes is great</li>
            <li>and I could say they were pretty good.</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing quality and would be great for some one who is just starting with makeup and don&#x27;t have a lot to spend on brushes.</li>
            <li>if you are used to drug store brands this would be good for you because you get a lot more for way less the price...packaging its really cute great for a gift if you want...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay, but I will be looking for another set as I get more advanced with my makeup skills.</li>
            <li>Over all, I am happy with Shany&#x27;s products so far!</li>
            <li>Another great set of Shany professional brush set!</li>
            <li>I ordered from Gemini and received great customer service and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The brushes are individually wrapped in a nice pouch and come in a very nice Shany Box...</li>
            <li>Need to be washed before use (obviously) but very good product.</li>
            <li>Thought overall quality was very good.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic deal for the money, however don&#x27;t expect top of the line brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and pick up the makeup GREAT.</li>
            <li>This is the biggest professional, great quality brush set you will get at this price.</li>
            <li>she absolutely loved it and there all perfect and soft an professional such a great buy</li>
            <li>have no idea how a professional make-up artist would ever be happy with these</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it so much!!!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how nice these brushes are!</li>
            <li>They are beautiful, honestly fluffy and a mix of natural and synthetic fiber brushes which makes the kit I bought perfect.</li>
            <li>Some people have said how the one sponge applicator easily comes out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably pay easily $50 for this kit.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with no shedding.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to hurry to clean one if I switch colors</li>
            <li>Rather strongly, but nothing that some airing out didn&#x27;t remedy.</li>
            <li>The pouch had a strong odor but went away after some time.  </li>
            <li>but all you need to do is rub your finger across each of them and all of the brush will be right back in place perfect!!</li>
            <li>Really nice soft brushes glad I got them :)</li>
            <li>and it comes with a real nice roll up brush caddy too unlike many other brush sets.</li>
            <li>they came in a nice package and there was a scent when you first opened them</li>
            <li>This is more of my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; brush set and the quality is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Perfect for any make up need,Love the black leather pouch it comes with.</li>
            <li>all brushes in good condition, very soft material.</li>
            <li>A previous reviewer does a great job on describing the kind of brushes you get in the kit.  </li>
            <li>it is great that it came from shany super professional</li>
            <li>If you already have a pretty decent set this is great to supplement with.</li>
            <li>They come in a huge variety of styles/shapes.  </li>
            <li>and I got free shipping and handling...</li>
            <li>Kinda cheap tho.</li>
            <li>though cause I only use like 6 brushes out of the 32 lol.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have gone the cheap route with brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brushes were cheap quality.  </li>
            <li>Overall it was a great purchase without any problems.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product, its a great starter kit for a makeup enthusiast.</li>
            <li>and it qualifies for free shipping.</li>
            <li>they look somewhat cheap and do not hold a lot of product within the brush.</li>
            <li>no hairs fall out, easy to clean...</li>
            <li>Cheap product but the price should speak for itself</li>
            <li>they work very well and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great product, except for the initial smell.  </li>
            <li>I couldnt believe how  many brushes came with this, and the pamphlet that explains how to use each one is useful too.</li>
            <li>I use them daily and they&#x27;re holding up very well, the fit in my hand perfectly.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and they all look to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>These brushes to say the least made me very happy and work phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>So far so good on the sticks as well.</li>
            <li>These brushes are good for the price, they are soft and apply make up well.  </li>
            <li>The whole set is worth it!!!</li>
            <li>The handle is very sterdy (oak wood) and they are eached numbered and are so beautiful and soft!</li>
            <li>These are very soft, and sorted in a nice case making them easy to organize and take care of.</li>
            <li>The case is indeed cheap vinyl instead of leather, but it does it&#x27;s job of keeping the brushes together and clean.</li>
            <li>Plus, the brushes are super soft &amp; smooth like how makeup brushes are to be &amp; they pick up makeup pigments really good.</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing and very soft!</li>
            <li>I love them very much.</li>
            <li>The brush hair is very soft and lovely!</li>
            <li>products arrived safely and was consistent with the description.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got them.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these brushes</li>
            <li>Price is not bad, but the quality is cheap</li>
            <li>I was so EXCITED to order these brushes.</li>
            <li>&amp; IT&#x27;S SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>But overall, nice quality and if you cannot afford MAC brushes this is the way to go!</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s do the math here, even the el-cheapo brushes at the drugstore cost three to four dollars each, so that&#x27;s a significant savings here, even if you don&#x27;t count the sponge applicators and the brow/mascara brushes.</li>
            <li>and she said they are great and have lasted a long time, and for the price its a no brainier.</li>
            <li>Over all I&#x27;m so excited to use them.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>when I read the reviews I was excited to buy this.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it&#x27;s the case they come in and not the brushes themselves.  </li>
            <li>it comes with so many varieties and i can do so much with these!</li>
            <li>All in all not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>THEY ARE BETTER THAN SOME HIGH END BRUSHES!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the brushes are fine if you&#x27;re looking for a more expansive set of reasonably priced brushes.  </li>
            <li>They really are beautiful brushes and super soft.    </li>
            <li>it was kind of just a new smell.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very impressed and would definitely recommend them to a friend.</li>
            <li>3 powder brushes  1 face angled face brush (perfect for blush/bronzer)  1 concealer brush (SOOOO SOFT)  10 lid brushes all in different sizes  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a chance to clean the rest of the brushes but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to find a way to clean the case.</li>
            <li>I just clean them on the weekends.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a variety of eyeshadow brushes to do all types of glamour/beauty and Special FX looks.</li>
            <li>While the brush hair itself is great and soft, the metal pieces that attach them to the handle are kind of loose on some of them.</li>
            <li>So its more like a brush set of 28 lip,liner and concealer brushes and 4 decent face brushes BOOOOOO!</li>
            <li>They work amazingly for applying my makeup and they have everying single brush you will need except a kabuki but other than thay they are great!</li>
            <li>im an aspiring drag queen and have been looking for a great set of makeup brushes and these are amzing</li>
            <li>Omg omg omg these brushes are amazing they are sooooooo soft</li>
            <li>I love this brush set so much</li>
            <li>I returned this for a full refund.</li>
            <li>The bristles seem to be nice and soft but seem to pick up the makeup well.  </li>
            <li>So far I am loving this purchase.</li>
            <li>and do you really need that many?</li>
            <li>really long.they havent shed at all.there way better than i thought</li>
            <li>You can never have too many angled brushes, really.</li>
            <li>nice set ,states all natural bristles</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe I could get 32 brushes for such a good price.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this set to anyone looking for a full line of brushes.</li>
            <li>It would be a good gift for such use, but</li>
            <li>But I will admit the face brushes are good, I only use the angled brush though for contouring.</li>
            <li>It has my very picky makeup obesessed teenager&#x27;s seal of approval :)</li>
            <li>some of the brushes are similar, but it&#x27;s good for freelancing</li>
            <li>I purchased this online because I really needed more brushes but wasnt trying to pay an outragoeus amount for them like MAC.</li>
            <li>Only good thing is Amazon did pay for the return shipping so in the end</li>
            <li>This is a good brush set for general makeup application, but those of us who want to do more specialized looks with our makeup buy individual brushes might be a better option.</li>
            <li>I am a beginner makeup lover and have been wanting a full set of brushes for sometime now.</li>
            <li>Really nice, soft brushes.</li>
            <li>But good quality overall.</li>
            <li>Such a good deal.</li>
            <li>Loved this product, would definitely buy Shany products again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good price, especially for the quality, your really don&#x27;t have to much to lose!</li>
            <li>but other than the smell they are great</li>
            <li>Shipping took a while but all of the brushes were undamaged and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with shedding as a lot of other people have experienced.</li>
            <li>I love my new brush set!</li>
            <li>The reason why i gave this product 4 stars is because 1 of the sponge brush&#x27;s tips fell off but its nothing that some super glue cant fix.</li>
            <li>the package came so quickly.</li>
            <li>was really quick.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really expect to get 40 natural hair brushes for $40, and it still is a good value – even for plastic.</li>
            <li>I have not used the brushes extensively, but they appear to be of excellent quality, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and read MANY, MANY reviews on all types and brands of brushes before finally deciding on the SHANY set.</li>
            <li>I know what my top favorite &amp;#34;numbered&amp;#34; brushes I use regularly.</li>
            <li>but they are very strong but soft if that makes any since.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li>Truthfully, they didn&#x27;t sound so worth it because some reviews say they weren&#x27;t so soft &amp; they smelled, etc.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my new Shany brushes.</li>
            <li>I love my new makeup brush</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft, I love the feel.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of these brushes as they are very soft and have not shed at all.  </li>
            <li>I plan to wash them before use because that&#x27;s what you should do with all new brushes, but I&#x27;m super excited to use them!</li>
            <li>I tried my best, with all my might to pull the hair out of my brushes and not a one came out, at least I didnt see any!</li>
            <li>Who could possibly need that many liner brushes!</li>
            <li>First of all, I have to say it is inexpensive!</li>
            <li>These are my first set of brushes!</li>
            <li>The blush brushes have not left one speck of bristle on my face and I love them!</li>
            <li>I love the soft leather pouch they come in, which keeps me super organized.</li>
            <li>item arrived MUCH earlier than estimated, in safe packaging and it was easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are not high end brushes, but they do a good job.  </li>
            <li>but these are very good quality brushes for such a low price</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves them, she told me the other day that she washed the brushes and they look like new, so the quality is great!</li>
            <li>they are so soft yet very sturdy and come with an awesome little case that you can fit anywhere</li>
            <li>I was missing one of the brushes but it was a great deal</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t believe the quality of them  its amazing and only $17!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen light shedding, not as much as I&#x27;ve seen with my MAC brushes.</li>
            <li>The case does have a distinct smell but its not as unbearing as others put it out to be.</li>
            <li>but so WORTH it)</li>
            <li>She says they are a good quality, and since she does only her make-up that it is really all she needs.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and you are really able to pack on the colors.&lt;br /&gt;Down</li>
            <li>I check each and ever shany brush I receive, and I double check it for any fall outs of any kind</li>
            <li>But even if I have to get rid of the case this set of brushes was well worth my $25.</li>
            <li>Especially if you don&#x27;t know much up about makeup brushes and you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot on something that might not be good.</li>
            <li>They are nice soft and very attached bristle.</li>
            <li>, they come in a nice case (as said, there is a chemical smell in the case, just leave it outside or in the rain for a couple days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used most of the brushes and they feel soft.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>the only thing i wish was that they labeled the brushes or stuck a paper in them saying what kind each one was.</li>
            <li>these are so soft and I love using them.</li>
            <li>Worth the money?</li>
            <li>u get all different kind of brushes</li>
            <li>These brushes were soft and very fun to use!</li>
            <li>They were in the original SHANY box, all the brushes were wrapped in plastic, and the bigger brushes had more substantial plastic on the tops, so they wouldn&#x27;t get misshapen.</li>
            <li>so let me began by saying that when I open the bursh pouch I was so excited and pleased with my brushes, all my brushes was in there section.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have such a huge collection of make up brushes!</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected the most of the brushes are too small but still nice price though.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use those very often, but I do use pretty much all of the eye shadow brushes and love them.</li>
            <li>You should buy it right away.</li>
            <li>delivered right at the estimated date.</li>
            <li>im in beauty school right now,and</li>
            <li>an used all the brushes right away</li>
            <li>Took off the packaging, tried to use lip brush and the brush part came right off.</li>
            <li>i was gonna spend and than i thought that i could just send them back if i want,but i dont want to,ther cool:)</li>
            <li>I opened the leather pouch to a full set of brushes, many of which looked like they do the same thing.</li>
            <li>Very soft and definitally worth your money, and the cute leather pouch makes it so much easier to organize your brushes from biggest to smallest</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush are very soft and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve needed to add a concealer brush (MAC - #286 Duo Fibre Blending Brush--THE BEST if you have acne and want a flawless or near-flawless face) and a fluffy round brush for my eyes (any round fully brush will do).</li>
            <li>i was looking for some very specific brushes, which this set has, and decided to buy the whole thing for all the other wonderful and useful brushes.....</li>
            <li>The brushes didn&#x27;t have much fallout, nothing more than normal from the first washing.</li>
            <li>I love that the brushes are soft and there are so many different sizes!</li>
            <li>They have nice, long handles.</li>
            <li>Some of the bristles are to flimsy to do much, but for the price it&#x27;s not a bad set.</li>
            <li>And lastly I must say, the delivery was super super fast &amp; free too!</li>
            <li>Soft, fast shipping, packaged well, cute case</li>
            <li>There is a slight smell, but the quality is sooo good.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed replacing my old crappy brushes with a set that is so much nicer.</li>
            <li>Received super fast.</li>
            <li>it feels really nice and smooth and makes u want to use them everyday very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>VERY fast shipping.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>very very soft.and there</li>
            <li>Anyway I like these Shany brushes very much</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and it came so quickly!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cool and very soft!</li>
            <li>The brushes are long, sturdy and the hairs are fine and precisely cut for perfection.</li>
            <li>All were clean and brand new.</li>
            <li>when I can find a set of brushes with quality such as these for such an amazing price, I snatch them up!  </li>
            <li>Funny smell to case</li>
            <li>The bristles do fall out at first, however after a good cleaning i have not had any trouble.  </li>
            <li>i love these products they actually grab colors, before i got this</li>
            <li>the picture looks better than what you actually get.</li>
            <li>TOO MANY DUPS, not enough variety.</li>
            <li>Some say theirs had a funny smell..</li>
            <li>mine did not have any funny smells.</li>
            <li>Many of the eye and lip brushes are similar in size.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was Fast!</li>
            <li>The sponge applicator tip came off, so what I did was hot gluded it</li>
            <li>going to buy a higher quality set...</li>
            <li>Each brush had its own sleeve plus some had the harder plastic sleeves.</li>
            <li>This kit has every brush you could need, whether you&#x27;re a beginner or a seasoned make up pro.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>and there if I find I have a more specific need.</li>
            <li>, I wasnt expecting these until after the first of the year.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>There are many smaller liner type brushes.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will look at the pictures more closely.</li>
            <li>Thanks SHANY!</li>
            <li>I am willing to try these brushes out</li>
            <li>the first one I used it broke from the tip.</li>
            <li>The Brushes smelled at first but the smell went away.  </li>
            <li>this product &amp; would definitely purchase more</li>
            <li>Some of the hairs are coming out but that always happens the first time you use them.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever purchasing any type of SHANY product too.</li>
            <li>I was very grateful for the colorful guide that came with, which recommends what each brush can be used for.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I&#x27;m sure somewhere out there, there is &amp;</li>
            <li>I do not feel that the brushes pick up pigment especially well, and have found that I use the eyeshadow sponge the most because of it.  </li>
            <li>they apply makeup very well!</li>
            <li>Although, I wish there were more different brushes.</li>
            <li>I bought these because recently I have made an effort to learn more about makeup</li>
            <li>As for me like iv said I only these for the eyeliner brushes and lip brushes anything for eyeshadow I stick to my walmart brushes since they are better.</li>
            <li>Purchased these for myself, hoping to learn more about different brushes and improve my brush techniques.  </li>
            <li>Delivery fast and the quality of the brushes was worth the money.</li>
            <li>The same money and much better product.</li>
            <li>Not only so makeup babies can feel like they know what they are doing, but also to make sure you got what you paid for.</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes look the exact same.</li>
            <li>there are just so many different ones that I can use and it gets the job done</li>
            <li>3 of the brushes are shedding, the eye brushes are stiff, I recommend going elsewhere if you&#x27;re looking for a good set.</li>
            <li>bhcosmetics.com has brushes for less money which I did buy and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes because I figured I&#x27;d get a little bit more thoughtful about how I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li>I got rid of every other brush I own.</li>
            <li>Wow, I was so so so excited to recieve this.</li>
            <li>Comes with a box and its wrapped with plastic wrap looks super new can&#x27;t wait till my girlfriend sees this with the rest of her gifts</li>
            <li>Just purchased a 2nd set of these brushes for my Sister because I love mine so much.</li>
            <li>The brushes are good quality, but I wish i would have realized that they are basically 3 different types of brushes, just in different sizes.</li>
            <li>At first use they did shed some hairs, but after the first initial shedding they were fine.</li>
            <li>Super soft and exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>Super soft, Work like perfection!</li>
            <li>Again, I bought it based off all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>The face brushes are full and soft and has never made me break out.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s really good and the brushes are extremely soft ..</li>
            <li>I have purchased Shany products in the past and loved them</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>She was thrilled however after using them for less than 3 weeks we are seeing that the bristles are falling out.</li>
            <li>They are super soft, and do not shed a ton.</li>
            <li>They are super soft</li>
            <li>They are all super soft and i didnt have any of the bristles fall out after i did a test pull.</li>
            <li>and even though they don&#x27;t tell you what each brushes use is, its easy enough to look it up on line.  </li>
            <li>SUPER SOFT brushes.</li>
            <li>, they are super soft as described.  </li>
            <li>The brushes aren&#x27;t strong enough, they fall apart, the fur would stay in your chick/</li>
            <li>large fan brush  </li>
            <li>There certainly isn&#x27;t a lack of choices for any of your makeup needs.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a large brush set - to divide between makeup stashes (travel bag, car backup...)</li>
            <li>The large fan brush sheds by the handful.  </li>
            <li>I am in the process of enlarging my makeup collection, so i wanted to get a rather large brush set.</li>
            <li>I ordered these brushes a few months ago and have had pretty good luck with them so far.  </li>
            <li>Although I paid $33 for it, it was worth the price compared to others that cost way more and have less brushes...</li>
            <li>Love all the different sized brushes they are so soft !</li>
            <li>Nice little case.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I got the brushes and for very little money</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect them all to last years, but for the price, quantity and the quality, they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>This brush set it proof that you don&#x27;t have to spend an arm and a leg on quality brushes, especially natural brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Noone wants to put something on their face and smell something that smells like bug spray on it.</li>
            <li>so i haven&#x27;t really gotten a chance to play with them.</li>
            <li>i was very disapointed.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t need all of those brushes.  </li>
            <li>That made me really upset</li>
            <li>It came really fast.</li>
            <li>They apply very well.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>and I had to use way much product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Shany from aka MsLadyLocks</li>
            <li>They were very well packed.</li>
            <li>After 10 years of being make up free I decided to jump back in.</li>
            <li>Completely beyond worth it.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive set.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>My angled eyeliner was replaced with a straight liner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that the hairs are shedding, the whole knot is shaped into a cylinder.</li>
            <li>These brushes came amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>They pick up product very well, and i wasnt wearing bristles and makeup all over my face.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes and the shipping</li>
            <li>It is cheap Chinese quality  3.</li>
            <li>It came out better than I expected...^^</li>
            <li>brushes arrived intact and  as always Amazon shipping wast ultra fast and reliable.</li>
            <li>Quality brushes at  reasonable price.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>The brush set arrived at my house unbelievably fast.</li>
            <li>I would have hand picked my brushes from different manufactureres such as Sigma, Coastal Scents, and Sephora - they cost more money, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li>High quality product and carrying case!</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really stick to the brushes.</li>
            <li>The larger brushes look cheap.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Way better than I expected.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft and they apply the makeup so smooth leaving you with a natural look</li>
            <li>The hairs on the brushes are soft and the material of the handles are good and not cheap.</li>
            <li>I even gave mines away and just purchased a new one I love it especially if you are a new make up artist</li>
            <li>There are so many brushes that I can use a new clean one everyday!</li>
            <li>only reason I gave this only 4 stars is because the case does have a VERY strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Other than the rest of them were ok ^_^.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SOOOOO much better than I expected it would be!</li>
            <li>So many brushes that you will not need any other brushes.</li>
            <li>My mother has not complained!</li>
            <li>They are very durable and works like new again!</li>
            <li>A good range of brushes, while also having slight variations on the same brush in the set.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft but there is smell of plastic at first.</li>
            <li>Additionally, good brushes, that are regularly and properly cleaned, can help keep gross bacteria out of your makeup.</li>
            <li>bought this particular set bc</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, bristle quality seems to be decent.  </li>
            <li>Decent brushes.  </li>
            <li>While you get eye, lip, and  face brushes, many of the eye brushes are different sizes of the same brush.</li>
            <li>32  brush set - but could not find that particular link.  </li>
            <li>brushes are very soft &amp; work very well.</li>
            <li>I find the brush set to be overall very pretty.    </li>
            <li>I gave each brush a tug to see if the handles were loose and they were secure.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these to anyone and everyone looking for some high quality brushes with out the high price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>The face brushes shed a little at first, but mine are totally fine now.</li>
            <li>but that is to be expected just wash them and they will be fine</li>
            <li>Extremely soft!!</li>
            <li>today they&#x27;re so soft!!</li>
            <li>There was a strong scent as described by some of the other reviews that I had read.</li>
            <li>But, other than that, it&#x27;s a nice set- especially for those that are new to using makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>The case I believe is real leather because of the way it smelled and the brushes are soft...</li>
            <li>I looked at the tutorials that I would use my old MAC brushes that were very worn out (which came out NOT looking like what I had tried to do)  </li>
            <li>but so far I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>These brushes are really soft and so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Shany Pro Studio Quality ZGF Premium Goat Hair Brush Set with Wooden Handle and Golden Pouch]]</li>
            <li>I actually have the Shany super professional</li>
            <li>so im not sure which brush is for what but other than that they are great</li>
            <li>the brissles are soft but not too sof, the handles are long and made of good quality heavy plastic.</li>
            <li>I brought this because i needed new brushes.</li>
            <li>Just smelt new.</li>
            <li>It was time for me to get a new brush set.</li>
            <li>To me, it just smelled like a new product that was wrapped in the plastic.</li>
            <li>I wanted a new foundation brush and a new blending brush.</li>
            <li>I just received them today and have not used them yet, but the gold pouch didn&#x27;t have the strong odor that the black pouch has.  </li>
            <li>Bristles do not fall out and they&#x27;re still very soft.</li>
            <li>they are very soft and the case is made</li>
            <li>The brush set does not contain any synthetic brushes and the bristles are very soft, you can tell these are quality brushes.</li>
            <li>But very soft brushes.</li>
            <li>I bought this to add to a very old set of sable hair brushes.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>They were very soft and luxurious feeling.  </li>
            <li>, you get a lot of brushes and the texture is very soft.</li>
            <li>I have a VERY, VERY SENSITIVE skin.  </li>
            <li>Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all very soft and works so well.</li>
            <li>I often have the trouble of trying to find a clean brush, but not anymore!</li>
            <li>When the brushes arrived, I deep cleaned them and the next day had so much fun !  </li>
            <li>Fash shipping and professional quality!</li>
            <li>i didnt know how much to spend espically because im barely staring off with makeup</li>
            <li>These brushes are extremely soft!</li>
            <li>This comes with a number of brushes, but for those who are interested, I&#x27;ll tell you what DOESN&#x27;T actually come in this set:</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft, and the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out of them like my other cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft, the only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t include much eye brushes.</li>
            <li>So PROFESSIONAL!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My 7 year old got a toy make up set with brushes just like these!</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to clean off the same brush multiple times.</li>
            <li>Actually way more brushes than the average person needs and there were a couple I could have used that weren&#x27;t here (contouring brush).</li>
            <li>those held up just fine with just a little bit of shedding.  </li>
            <li>So you have an angled brush, a flat shader brush and a flat top brush in like 4 different sizes.</li>
            <li>Since the set is not that expensive, I think it is a good set to pick up for a teenage girl, as a first set of brushes.  </li>
            <li>I previously bought this item (32 count) a few months ago for myself and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>These brushes are worth every single penny!</li>
            <li>and I do not know what they are all used for, would&#x27;ve been great if they were separately labeled or at least a little insert into the bag,</li>
            <li>My sable hair brushes are good, but it&#x27;s a very small and limited set.</li>
            <li>The picture doesn&#x27;t clearly show what you will recieve so here</li>
            <li>what was clearly a shadow sponge tool was identified as an angled shadow brush.  </li>
            <li>So far no shedding or anything...</li>
            <li>The brissles are so soft.</li>
            <li>funny,dont pick of make up well, and trust me my eyeshadow is very pigmented and also all the eye brushes are very similar NO JOKE</li>
            <li>Professional style brushes.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality because I had never used their brushes or products before.</li>
            <li>No shedding yet as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>But so far i haven&#x27;t had any fallout.</li>
            <li>Being that I do not know much about brushes I asked her about them two weeks later.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this set if you are starting out/doing a lot of stuff with makeup or performing.  </li>
            <li>especially for beginners, those who don&#x27;t really use makeup every day, but</li>
            <li>In the description it clearly stated that it used natural hair.</li>
            <li>(i think it was a concelar brush) out of the whole set of brushes, i only saw two hairs fall</li>
            <li>But as far as I can tell the brushes did not pick it up.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>It completely shed in my hand.</li>
            <li>This is a set I could let my 9 year old niece play with and not freakout if she damaged a brush.</li>
            <li>They are soft and well made.</li>
            <li>They only thing I really wish it had was the name of the brushes on them.</li>
            <li>They are way too soft</li>
            <li>I bought these make up brushes because mine were getting old</li>
            <li>Natural bristles will burn like your eyebrows or your hair.</li>
            <li>and this is a professional set, therefore there is no &amp;#34;map&amp;#34; telling me which brush is for what.</li>
            <li>and they are way too soft to hold any make up.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and managable.</li>
            <li>and i gave her one gift early which happen to be this one</li>
            <li>Brushes relatively soft, except for brow brush.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and have no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I would of preffered to have at least one more.</li>
            <li>It might be bothersome if you have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>they are amazingly soft and i have had no problem with bristles falling out since washing them.</li>
            <li>They are soft on the skin and apply product well.  </li>
            <li>I got these brushes for my 18 year old step daughter and she was overjoyed.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see them in action.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 16 year old granddaughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li>The box itself was very simple, seemed like not too much effort was needed to just tear through it.</li>
            <li>The leather carry case is soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>B001JKTTVQ SHANY Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to get good foundation coverage.    </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who need good quality brushes and a not so expensive price.</li>
            <li>I love this product I needed a good brush set very bad</li>
            <li>And i love that they are soft yet stiff enough to use.</li>
            <li>Professional look, no shed, high quality brushes for a fraction of what you&#x27;d pay for the bigger brand sets.  </li>
            <li>About the smell, it&#x27;s only the new leather smell!</li>
            <li>If you want several brushes that get the job done decently without paying an arm and a leg, then this kit is for you.</li>
            <li>NOT BLACK like the picture shows.</li>
            <li>Not sure how it can be natural bristles AND cruelty free. ....</li>
            <li>The next issue was that the brushes on the picture was showing black hair for the bristles but what came in the box was light brown/light orange hair for the bristles.</li>
            <li>This set of brushes are not worth 5 stars because to me they are worth 10</li>
            <li>The large brushes do do well with loose powders though.  </li>
            <li>it smells similar to new sneakers.</li>
            <li>All came intact, several with plastic slips to help maintain the shape, and are as soft as soft could be.</li>
            <li>The supplied pamphlet was less than useful in identifying the correct brushes by number, for example:</li>
            <li>I read some negative feedback about their being a strong odor???</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that I really need all 32 brushes, but it just encourages me to play around with my makeup a little more.</li>
            <li>I have not had any major problems with these brushes, and find all brushes to do their intended job.</li>
            <li>Has every type of brush I could ever want as a theater major.</li>
            <li>The spaces for the brushes are wide, and I can even fit other brushes in the pouch.</li>
            <li>I only had one brush lose quite a few fibers when I ran my finger over it, and a quick crimp with a needle nosed plier fixed it.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are indeed very soft, and so far have been holding up very well after washing them a few times.  </li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend these brushes if you want decent quality brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li>So far they have held up well, a little fall out with the first uses of them.  </li>
            <li>these were amazing brushes i couldn&#x27;t have gone wrong</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a Christmas gift, or a gift in general, this is perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the set comes with a guide describing the uses of the individual brushes, which are all numbered clearly.</li>
            <li>Only about 3 brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>overall I like my brush set so far</li>
            <li>I paid extra money just to get my package here early</li>
            <li>So far I have only used a couple of eyeshadow brushes and a blush brush.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe what a difference they make in my makeup applications professional and personal.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is I am not a makeup professional</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend these for personal and hobby use, but they wouldn&#x27;t cut it professionally.  </li>
            <li>the eye brushes are the worse part of the set they are more like concealer brushes and lip brushes</li>
            <li>so pretty all black and</li>
            <li>i can tell you these are good for details on your eyes lips and nose but is a little poor for face..</li>
            <li>There is a round brush that is kind of pencil shaped, but its hard and pokey.</li>
            <li>These brushes are far better than expensive brushes I have purchased one at a time.  </li>
            <li>which is why its only getting 4 stars from me  two brushes had major flyaways and had to be trimmed or it would irritate my eyes</li>
            <li>it smelled a little funny when i opened up the box</li>
            <li>The package smelled a little funny...</li>
            <li>Please, ALWAYS properly wash and dry your new brushes before using them.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I understand that it is expected that they are new, but I did read some reviews were</li>
            <li>When my friends see this set they always ask me how much it was and are surprised when I tell them that it was only a little over $20!</li>
            <li>The only down side is them not being labeled but they are very versatile</li>
            <li>VERY disappointed as I recommended this product to many people, but I will make sure no one will be ordering them.</li>
            <li>And while the little handbook stating what every brush is for which is very helpful</li>
            <li>They do not come use, some other reviews said they felt like the brushes werent brand new.</li>

            <li> Nice set!</li>
            <li> For the price that I paid, I honestly can NOT complain!</li>
            <li> $90 Marc Jacobs brush :P</li>
            <li> i was told it a great product they loved it.</li>
            <li> There are so many great things about these brushes!</li>
            <li> If you are wanting to get a lot of good quality brushes for good price this is great.</li>
            <li> The product itself was nicely packed &amp; was beautiful.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived very quickly and though I haven&#x27;t used them yet they look and feel like very good quality!</li>
            <li> Great price for the product for sure!</li>
            <li> While i loved the set there are no brushes made for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> brushes are good..</li>
            <li> Quality wise</li>
            <li> I looked over every brush, and they were good</li>
            <li> but when I was washing them they held up really good</li>
            <li> the brushes are a good price if you&#x27;re like myself and want to have something to learn and practice with.</li>
            <li> but they are still good.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;leather\\&quot; case they come in is nice and works great.  </li>
            <li> and I needed a good but inexpensive brush set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set for my wife during Christmas and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are really good for the money.  </li>
            <li> Verry good..</li>
            <li> but, it all looks good and no strands came of it yet.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have any good blending brushes, and there&#x27;s not even a foundation brush in sight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A good set of brushes can save you a fortune, in and of themselves.</li>
            <li> Because of that I just can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend without a warning.</li>
            <li> i got it way before.which i loved.  </li>
            <li> i figured if i would buy a set a brushes i would buy a good set.but</li>
            <li> and i loved</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t  put mineral makeup  on good.</li>
            <li> and I needed a good deal.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a good value for what you pay.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, the packaging was good, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> The girls loved them.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for those who know what they are doing and have experiences using make up brushes but for those who aren&#x27;t professionals it would be nice if each brush was labelled with what type of brush it is.</li>
            <li> They appeared to be good quality, so I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> My girl loved them.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a gift, and she loved it.</li>
            <li> This is a really good set for the price.  </li>
            <li> I recommend getting these brushes they are really good</li>
            <li> I also bought one for my sister and she loved it.</li>
            <li> You do not get a blending brush are a good brush for all over application.</li>
            <li> Good brushes.</li>
            <li> she said the quality was good</li>
            <li> The brushes are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still smelly( like a strong plastic) but its lighter since i washed it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful and adequate holder for the brushes.</li>
            <li> very potent smell..</li>

            <li> They are very soft and picks up a good amount of product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just an okay product;</li>
            <li> I think like a guy, I didn&#x27;t know there were so many brushes.  </li>
            <li> It is not studio quality for sure.</li>
            <li> I order these brushes on 9/14 and received them on 9/18 with free shipping!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything more.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the types of brushes included in this set</li>
            <li> and I love the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The brushes are, in my opinion, BETTER THAN M.A.C. and A FRACTION OF THE COST.  </li>
            <li> The product is amazing and really are as good as mac brushes.</li>
            <li> okay I had to do an edit</li>
            <li> I wanted more face brushes and some of the eye brushes aren&#x27;t as dense as I would like</li>
            <li> and they smell lovely:)</li>
            <li> However, I did find some shedding on most of them.</li>
            <li> I still love them and they really are a great value.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a big brush set and still have some room in your wallet, this set is perfect.</li>
            <li> If I could give this MORE than 5 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if I should trust brushes sold so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> She opened them and is in love with them.</li>
            <li> But being a MUA I don&#x27;t mind buying more brushes because I will use them all the time&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutly love these brushes.</li>
            <li> And to top it all off...the brushes are not labeled to let you know what each one is used for.</li>
            <li> I think she will love them</li>
            <li> I am overly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll surely get another one😁😁😁😁</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are better off used as artist brushes than make-up ones.</li>
            <li> For those that don&#x27;t want to spend a mint on brushes such as MAC, or for those that need a good &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; set, these are GREAT.</li>
            <li> I found this humorous because A)</li>
            <li> This is why I feel this set makes a better booster set then a starter one.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I love the brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner plus when I watch tutorials they gurus can explain better which one they are using.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied with the brushes.</li>
            <li> and I just love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE them!❤</li>

            <li> I am ok with it all in all for the price.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the leather roll also. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone giving these brushes more than 1 star which makes me question who has written all those 5 star ratings.</li>
            <li> Thats what ticked me off the most</li>
            <li> it was okay</li>
            <li> I HAVE SO MANY MAKEUP BRUSH SETS FROM THIS COMPANY</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the most important part!</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> but i still love these brush.</li>
            <li> some brushes broke within a couple of days, its not a leather pouch but pleather, i could have gotten better brushes at walmart for this price</li>
            <li> So far the brushes have held together very nicely, the bristles have stayed in place and it looks nice to boot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cleaning them now so they can be soft and clean :D</li>
            <li> It just arrived today and I am very excited about using it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty good quality; great really, for the price.  </li>
            <li> Theyre really soft and they work good!</li>
            <li> Everything arrived in tact, clean and the case protects the brush shape nicely.</li>
            <li> Shany&#x27;s service was great and super fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> Great price for high quality material.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and are perfect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a make-up artist, so as a normal person I think the quality of the brushes is great</li>
            <li> and I could say they were pretty good.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing quality and would be great for some one who is just starting with makeup and don&#x27;t have a lot to spend on brushes.</li>
            <li> if you are used to drug store brands this would be good for you because you get a lot more for way less the price...packaging its really cute great for a gift if you want...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay, but I will be looking for another set as I get more advanced with my makeup skills.</li>
            <li> Over all, I am happy with Shany&#x27;s products so far!</li>
            <li> Another great set of Shany professional brush set!</li>
            <li> I ordered from Gemini and received great customer service and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The brushes are individually wrapped in a nice pouch and come in a very nice Shany Box...</li>
            <li> Need to be washed before use (obviously) but very good product.</li>
            <li> Thought overall quality was very good.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic deal for the money, however don&#x27;t expect top of the line brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and pick up the makeup GREAT.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest professional, great quality brush set you will get at this price.</li>
            <li> she absolutely loved it and there all perfect and soft an professional such a great buy</li>
            <li> have no idea how a professional make-up artist would ever be happy with these</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it so much!!!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how nice these brushes are!</li>
            <li> They are beautiful, honestly fluffy and a mix of natural and synthetic fiber brushes which makes the kit I bought perfect.</li>
            <li> Some people have said how the one sponge applicator easily comes out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably pay easily $50 for this kit.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with no shedding.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to hurry to clean one if I switch colors</li>
            <li> Rather strongly, but nothing that some airing out didn&#x27;t remedy.</li>
            <li> The pouch had a strong odor but went away after some time.  </li>
            <li> but all you need to do is rub your finger across each of them and all of the brush will be right back in place perfect!!</li>
            <li> Really nice soft brushes glad I got them :)</li>
            <li> and it comes with a real nice roll up brush caddy too unlike many other brush sets.</li>
            <li> they came in a nice package and there was a scent when you first opened them</li>
            <li> This is more of my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; brush set and the quality is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect for any make up need,Love the black leather pouch it comes with.</li>
            <li> all brushes in good condition, very soft material.</li>
            <li> A previous reviewer does a great job on describing the kind of brushes you get in the kit.  </li>
            <li> it is great that it came from shany super professional</li>
            <li> If you already have a pretty decent set this is great to supplement with.</li>
            <li> They come in a huge variety of styles/shapes.  </li>
            <li> and I got free shipping and handling...</li>
            <li> Kinda cheap tho.</li>
            <li> though cause I only use like 6 brushes out of the 32 lol.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have gone the cheap route with brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brushes were cheap quality.  </li>
            <li> Overall it was a great purchase without any problems.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product, its a great starter kit for a makeup enthusiast.</li>
            <li> and it qualifies for free shipping.</li>
            <li> they look somewhat cheap and do not hold a lot of product within the brush.</li>
            <li> no hairs fall out, easy to clean...</li>
            <li> Cheap product but the price should speak for itself</li>
            <li> they work very well and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product, except for the initial smell.  </li>
            <li> I couldnt believe how  many brushes came with this, and the pamphlet that explains how to use each one is useful too.</li>
            <li> I use them daily and they&#x27;re holding up very well, the fit in my hand perfectly.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and they all look to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes to say the least made me very happy and work phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> So far so good on the sticks as well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are good for the price, they are soft and apply make up well.  </li>
            <li> The whole set is worth it!!!</li>
            <li> The handle is very sterdy (oak wood) and they are eached numbered and are so beautiful and soft!</li>
            <li> These are very soft, and sorted in a nice case making them easy to organize and take care of.</li>
            <li> The case is indeed cheap vinyl instead of leather, but it does it&#x27;s job of keeping the brushes together and clean.</li>
            <li> Plus, the brushes are super soft &amp; smooth like how makeup brushes are to be &amp; they pick up makeup pigments really good.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and very soft!</li>
            <li> I love them very much.</li>
            <li> The brush hair is very soft and lovely!</li>
            <li> products arrived safely and was consistent with the description.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got them.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these brushes</li>
            <li> Price is not bad, but the quality is cheap</li>
            <li> I was so EXCITED to order these brushes.</li>
            <li> &amp; IT&#x27;S SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> But overall, nice quality and if you cannot afford MAC brushes this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s do the math here, even the el-cheapo brushes at the drugstore cost three to four dollars each, so that&#x27;s a significant savings here, even if you don&#x27;t count the sponge applicators and the brow/mascara brushes.</li>
            <li> and she said they are great and have lasted a long time, and for the price its a no brainier.</li>
            <li> Over all I&#x27;m so excited to use them.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> when I read the reviews I was excited to buy this.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure it&#x27;s the case they come in and not the brushes themselves.  </li>
            <li> it comes with so many varieties and i can do so much with these!</li>
            <li> All in all not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> THEY ARE BETTER THAN SOME HIGH END BRUSHES!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the brushes are fine if you&#x27;re looking for a more expansive set of reasonably priced brushes.  </li>
            <li> They really are beautiful brushes and super soft.    </li>
            <li> it was kind of just a new smell.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very impressed and would definitely recommend them to a friend.</li>
            <li> 3 powder brushes  1 face angled face brush (perfect for blush/bronzer)  1 concealer brush (SOOOO SOFT)  10 lid brushes all in different sizes  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to clean the rest of the brushes but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to find a way to clean the case.</li>
            <li> I just clean them on the weekends.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a variety of eyeshadow brushes to do all types of glamour/beauty and Special FX looks.</li>
            <li> While the brush hair itself is great and soft, the metal pieces that attach them to the handle are kind of loose on some of them.</li>
            <li> So its more like a brush set of 28 lip,liner and concealer brushes and 4 decent face brushes BOOOOOO!</li>
            <li> They work amazingly for applying my makeup and they have everying single brush you will need except a kabuki but other than thay they are great!</li>
            <li> im an aspiring drag queen and have been looking for a great set of makeup brushes and these are amzing</li>
            <li> Omg omg omg these brushes are amazing they are sooooooo soft</li>
            <li> I love this brush set so much</li>
            <li> I returned this for a full refund.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem to be nice and soft but seem to pick up the makeup well.  </li>
            <li> So far I am loving this purchase.</li>
            <li> and do you really need that many?</li>
            <li> really long.they havent shed at all.there way better than i thought</li>
            <li> You can never have too many angled brushes, really.</li>
            <li> nice set ,states all natural bristles</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I could get 32 brushes for such a good price.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this set to anyone looking for a full line of brushes.</li>
            <li> It would be a good gift for such use, but</li>
            <li> But I will admit the face brushes are good, I only use the angled brush though for contouring.</li>
            <li> It has my very picky makeup obesessed teenager&#x27;s seal of approval :)</li>
            <li> some of the brushes are similar, but it&#x27;s good for freelancing</li>
            <li> I purchased this online because I really needed more brushes but wasnt trying to pay an outragoeus amount for them like MAC.</li>
            <li> Only good thing is Amazon did pay for the return shipping so in the end</li>
            <li> This is a good brush set for general makeup application, but those of us who want to do more specialized looks with our makeup buy individual brushes might be a better option.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner makeup lover and have been wanting a full set of brushes for sometime now.</li>
            <li> Really nice, soft brushes.</li>
            <li> But good quality overall.</li>
            <li> Such a good deal.</li>
            <li> Loved this product, would definitely buy Shany products again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good price, especially for the quality, your really don&#x27;t have to much to lose!</li>
            <li> but other than the smell they are great</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while but all of the brushes were undamaged and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with shedding as a lot of other people have experienced.</li>
            <li> I love my new brush set!</li>
            <li> The reason why i gave this product 4 stars is because 1 of the sponge brush&#x27;s tips fell off but its nothing that some super glue cant fix.</li>
            <li> the package came so quickly.</li>
            <li> was really quick.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really expect to get 40 natural hair brushes for $40, and it still is a good value – even for plastic.</li>
            <li> I have not used the brushes extensively, but they appear to be of excellent quality, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and read MANY, MANY reviews on all types and brands of brushes before finally deciding on the SHANY set.</li>
            <li> I know what my top favorite &amp;#34;numbered&amp;#34; brushes I use regularly.</li>
            <li> but they are very strong but soft if that makes any since.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li> Truthfully, they didn&#x27;t sound so worth it because some reviews say they weren&#x27;t so soft &amp; they smelled, etc.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my new Shany brushes.</li>
            <li> I love my new makeup brush</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft, I love the feel.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of these brushes as they are very soft and have not shed at all.  </li>
            <li> I plan to wash them before use because that&#x27;s what you should do with all new brushes, but I&#x27;m super excited to use them!</li>
            <li> I tried my best, with all my might to pull the hair out of my brushes and not a one came out, at least I didnt see any!</li>
            <li> Who could possibly need that many liner brushes!</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say it is inexpensive!</li>
            <li> These are my first set of brushes!</li>
            <li> The blush brushes have not left one speck of bristle on my face and I love them!</li>
            <li> I love the soft leather pouch they come in, which keeps me super organized.</li>
            <li> item arrived MUCH earlier than estimated, in safe packaging and it was easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are not high end brushes, but they do a good job.  </li>
            <li> but these are very good quality brushes for such a low price</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves them, she told me the other day that she washed the brushes and they look like new, so the quality is great!</li>
            <li> they are so soft yet very sturdy and come with an awesome little case that you can fit anywhere</li>
            <li> I was missing one of the brushes but it was a great deal</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe the quality of them  its amazing and only $17!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen light shedding, not as much as I&#x27;ve seen with my MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> The case does have a distinct smell but its not as unbearing as others put it out to be.</li>
            <li> but so WORTH it)</li>
            <li> She says they are a good quality, and since she does only her make-up that it is really all she needs.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and you are really able to pack on the colors.&lt;br /&gt;Down</li>
            <li> I check each and ever shany brush I receive, and I double check it for any fall outs of any kind</li>
            <li> But even if I have to get rid of the case this set of brushes was well worth my $25.</li>
            <li> Especially if you don&#x27;t know much up about makeup brushes and you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot on something that might not be good.</li>
            <li> They are nice soft and very attached bristle.</li>
            <li> , they come in a nice case (as said, there is a chemical smell in the case, just leave it outside or in the rain for a couple days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used most of the brushes and they feel soft.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> the only thing i wish was that they labeled the brushes or stuck a paper in them saying what kind each one was.</li>
            <li> these are so soft and I love using them.</li>
            <li> Worth the money?</li>
            <li> u get all different kind of brushes</li>
            <li> These brushes were soft and very fun to use!</li>
            <li> They were in the original SHANY box, all the brushes were wrapped in plastic, and the bigger brushes had more substantial plastic on the tops, so they wouldn&#x27;t get misshapen.</li>
            <li> so let me began by saying that when I open the bursh pouch I was so excited and pleased with my brushes, all my brushes was in there section.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have such a huge collection of make up brushes!</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected the most of the brushes are too small but still nice price though.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use those very often, but I do use pretty much all of the eye shadow brushes and love them.</li>
            <li> You should buy it right away.</li>
            <li> delivered right at the estimated date.</li>
            <li> im in beauty school right now,and</li>
            <li> an used all the brushes right away</li>
            <li> Took off the packaging, tried to use lip brush and the brush part came right off.</li>
            <li> i was gonna spend and than i thought that i could just send them back if i want,but i dont want to,ther cool:)</li>
            <li> I opened the leather pouch to a full set of brushes, many of which looked like they do the same thing.</li>
            <li> Very soft and definitally worth your money, and the cute leather pouch makes it so much easier to organize your brushes from biggest to smallest</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are very soft and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed to add a concealer brush (MAC - #286 Duo Fibre Blending Brush--THE BEST if you have acne and want a flawless or near-flawless face) and a fluffy round brush for my eyes (any round fully brush will do).</li>
            <li> i was looking for some very specific brushes, which this set has, and decided to buy the whole thing for all the other wonderful and useful brushes.....</li>
            <li> The brushes didn&#x27;t have much fallout, nothing more than normal from the first washing.</li>
            <li> I love that the brushes are soft and there are so many different sizes!</li>
            <li> They have nice, long handles.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles are to flimsy to do much, but for the price it&#x27;s not a bad set.</li>
            <li> And lastly I must say, the delivery was super super fast &amp; free too!</li>
            <li> Soft, fast shipping, packaged well, cute case</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell, but the quality is sooo good.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed replacing my old crappy brushes with a set that is so much nicer.</li>
            <li> Received super fast.</li>
            <li> it feels really nice and smooth and makes u want to use them everyday very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> VERY fast shipping.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> very very soft.and there</li>
            <li> Anyway I like these Shany brushes very much</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and it came so quickly!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cool and very soft!</li>
            <li> The brushes are long, sturdy and the hairs are fine and precisely cut for perfection.</li>
            <li> All were clean and brand new.</li>
            <li> when I can find a set of brushes with quality such as these for such an amazing price, I snatch them up!  </li>
            <li> Funny smell to case</li>
            <li> The bristles do fall out at first, however after a good cleaning i have not had any trouble.  </li>
            <li> i love these products they actually grab colors, before i got this</li>
            <li> the picture looks better than what you actually get.</li>
            <li> TOO MANY DUPS, not enough variety.</li>
            <li> Some say theirs had a funny smell..</li>
            <li> mine did not have any funny smells.</li>
            <li> Many of the eye and lip brushes are similar in size.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was Fast!</li>
            <li> The sponge applicator tip came off, so what I did was hot gluded it</li>
            <li> going to buy a higher quality set...</li>
            <li> Each brush had its own sleeve plus some had the harder plastic sleeves.</li>
            <li> This kit has every brush you could need, whether you&#x27;re a beginner or a seasoned make up pro.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> and there if I find I have a more specific need.</li>
            <li> , I wasnt expecting these until after the first of the year.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> There are many smaller liner type brushes.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will look at the pictures more closely.</li>
            <li> Thanks SHANY!</li>
            <li> I am willing to try these brushes out</li>
            <li> the first one I used it broke from the tip.</li>
            <li> The Brushes smelled at first but the smell went away.  </li>
            <li> this product &amp; would definitely purchase more</li>
            <li> Some of the hairs are coming out but that always happens the first time you use them.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever purchasing any type of SHANY product too.</li>
            <li> I was very grateful for the colorful guide that came with, which recommends what each brush can be used for.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I&#x27;m sure somewhere out there, there is &amp;</li>
            <li> I do not feel that the brushes pick up pigment especially well, and have found that I use the eyeshadow sponge the most because of it.  </li>
            <li> they apply makeup very well!</li>
            <li> Although, I wish there were more different brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these because recently I have made an effort to learn more about makeup</li>
            <li> As for me like iv said I only these for the eyeliner brushes and lip brushes anything for eyeshadow I stick to my walmart brushes since they are better.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for myself, hoping to learn more about different brushes and improve my brush techniques.  </li>
            <li> Delivery fast and the quality of the brushes was worth the money.</li>
            <li> The same money and much better product.</li>
            <li> Not only so makeup babies can feel like they know what they are doing, but also to make sure you got what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes look the exact same.</li>
            <li> there are just so many different ones that I can use and it gets the job done</li>
            <li> 3 of the brushes are shedding, the eye brushes are stiff, I recommend going elsewhere if you&#x27;re looking for a good set.</li>
            <li> bhcosmetics.com has brushes for less money which I did buy and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I figured I&#x27;d get a little bit more thoughtful about how I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> I got rid of every other brush I own.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was so so so excited to recieve this.</li>
            <li> Comes with a box and its wrapped with plastic wrap looks super new can&#x27;t wait till my girlfriend sees this with the rest of her gifts</li>
            <li> Just purchased a 2nd set of these brushes for my Sister because I love mine so much.</li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality, but I wish i would have realized that they are basically 3 different types of brushes, just in different sizes.</li>
            <li> At first use they did shed some hairs, but after the first initial shedding they were fine.</li>
            <li> Super soft and exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Super soft, Work like perfection!</li>
            <li> Again, I bought it based off all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> The face brushes are full and soft and has never made me break out.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s really good and the brushes are extremely soft ..</li>
            <li> I have purchased Shany products in the past and loved them</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> She was thrilled however after using them for less than 3 weeks we are seeing that the bristles are falling out.</li>
            <li> They are super soft, and do not shed a ton.</li>
            <li> They are super soft</li>
            <li> They are all super soft and i didnt have any of the bristles fall out after i did a test pull.</li>
            <li> and even though they don&#x27;t tell you what each brushes use is, its easy enough to look it up on line.  </li>
            <li> SUPER SOFT brushes.</li>
            <li> , they are super soft as described.  </li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t strong enough, they fall apart, the fur would stay in your chick/</li>
            <li> large fan brush  </li>
            <li> There certainly isn&#x27;t a lack of choices for any of your makeup needs.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a large brush set - to divide between makeup stashes (travel bag, car backup...)</li>
            <li> The large fan brush sheds by the handful.  </li>
            <li> I am in the process of enlarging my makeup collection, so i wanted to get a rather large brush set.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes a few months ago and have had pretty good luck with them so far.  </li>
            <li> Although I paid $33 for it, it was worth the price compared to others that cost way more and have less brushes...</li>
            <li> Love all the different sized brushes they are so soft !</li>
            <li> Nice little case.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I got the brushes and for very little money</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect them all to last years, but for the price, quantity and the quality, they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> This brush set it proof that you don&#x27;t have to spend an arm and a leg on quality brushes, especially natural brushes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Noone wants to put something on their face and smell something that smells like bug spray on it.</li>
            <li> so i haven&#x27;t really gotten a chance to play with them.</li>
            <li> i was very disapointed.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t need all of those brushes.  </li>
            <li> That made me really upset</li>
            <li> It came really fast.</li>
            <li> They apply very well.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> and I had to use way much product.</li>
            <li> Thanks Shany from aka MsLadyLocks</li>
            <li> They were very well packed.</li>
            <li> After 10 years of being make up free I decided to jump back in.</li>
            <li> Completely beyond worth it.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive set.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> My angled eyeliner was replaced with a straight liner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that the hairs are shedding, the whole knot is shaped into a cylinder.</li>
            <li> These brushes came amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> They pick up product very well, and i wasnt wearing bristles and makeup all over my face.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes and the shipping</li>
            <li> It is cheap Chinese quality  3.</li>
            <li> It came out better than I expected...^^</li>
            <li> brushes arrived intact and  as always Amazon shipping wast ultra fast and reliable.</li>
            <li> Quality brushes at  reasonable price.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> The brush set arrived at my house unbelievably fast.</li>
            <li> I would have hand picked my brushes from different manufactureres such as Sigma, Coastal Scents, and Sephora - they cost more money, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li> High quality product and carrying case!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really stick to the brushes.</li>
            <li> The larger brushes look cheap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft and they apply the makeup so smooth leaving you with a natural look</li>
            <li> The hairs on the brushes are soft and the material of the handles are good and not cheap.</li>
            <li> I even gave mines away and just purchased a new one I love it especially if you are a new make up artist</li>
            <li> There are so many brushes that I can use a new clean one everyday!</li>
            <li> only reason I gave this only 4 stars is because the case does have a VERY strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Other than the rest of them were ok ^_^.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SOOOOO much better than I expected it would be!</li>
            <li> So many brushes that you will not need any other brushes.</li>
            <li> My mother has not complained!</li>
            <li> They are very durable and works like new again!</li>
            <li> A good range of brushes, while also having slight variations on the same brush in the set.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft but there is smell of plastic at first.</li>
            <li> Additionally, good brushes, that are regularly and properly cleaned, can help keep gross bacteria out of your makeup.</li>
            <li> bought this particular set bc</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, bristle quality seems to be decent.  </li>
            <li> Decent brushes.  </li>
            <li> While you get eye, lip, and  face brushes, many of the eye brushes are different sizes of the same brush.</li>
            <li> 32  brush set - but could not find that particular link.  </li>
            <li> brushes are very soft &amp; work very well.</li>
            <li> I find the brush set to be overall very pretty.    </li>
            <li> I gave each brush a tug to see if the handles were loose and they were secure.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend these to anyone and everyone looking for some high quality brushes with out the high price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> The face brushes shed a little at first, but mine are totally fine now.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected just wash them and they will be fine</li>
            <li> Extremely soft!!</li>
            <li> today they&#x27;re so soft!!</li>
            <li> There was a strong scent as described by some of the other reviews that I had read.</li>
            <li> But, other than that, it&#x27;s a nice set- especially for those that are new to using makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> The case I believe is real leather because of the way it smelled and the brushes are soft...</li>
            <li> I looked at the tutorials that I would use my old MAC brushes that were very worn out (which came out NOT looking like what I had tried to do)  </li>
            <li> but so far I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really soft and so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Shany Pro Studio Quality ZGF Premium Goat Hair Brush Set with Wooden Handle and Golden Pouch]]</li>
            <li> I actually have the Shany super professional</li>
            <li> so im not sure which brush is for what but other than that they are great</li>
            <li> the brissles are soft but not too sof, the handles are long and made of good quality heavy plastic.</li>
            <li> I brought this because i needed new brushes.</li>
            <li> Just smelt new.</li>
            <li> It was time for me to get a new brush set.</li>
            <li> To me, it just smelled like a new product that was wrapped in the plastic.</li>
            <li> I wanted a new foundation brush and a new blending brush.</li>
            <li> I just received them today and have not used them yet, but the gold pouch didn&#x27;t have the strong odor that the black pouch has.  </li>
            <li> Bristles do not fall out and they&#x27;re still very soft.</li>
            <li> they are very soft and the case is made</li>
            <li> The brush set does not contain any synthetic brushes and the bristles are very soft, you can tell these are quality brushes.</li>
            <li> But very soft brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to a very old set of sable hair brushes.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> They were very soft and luxurious feeling.  </li>
            <li> , you get a lot of brushes and the texture is very soft.</li>
            <li> I have a VERY, VERY SENSITIVE skin.  </li>
            <li> Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all very soft and works so well.</li>
            <li> I often have the trouble of trying to find a clean brush, but not anymore!</li>
            <li> When the brushes arrived, I deep cleaned them and the next day had so much fun !  </li>
            <li> Fash shipping and professional quality!</li>
            <li> i didnt know how much to spend espically because im barely staring off with makeup</li>
            <li> These brushes are extremely soft!</li>
            <li> This comes with a number of brushes, but for those who are interested, I&#x27;ll tell you what DOESN&#x27;T actually come in this set:</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft, and the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out of them like my other cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft, the only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t include much eye brushes.</li>
            <li> So PROFESSIONAL!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My 7 year old got a toy make up set with brushes just like these!</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to clean off the same brush multiple times.</li>
            <li> Actually way more brushes than the average person needs and there were a couple I could have used that weren&#x27;t here (contouring brush).</li>
            <li> those held up just fine with just a little bit of shedding.  </li>
            <li> So you have an angled brush, a flat shader brush and a flat top brush in like 4 different sizes.</li>
            <li> Since the set is not that expensive, I think it is a good set to pick up for a teenage girl, as a first set of brushes.  </li>
            <li> I previously bought this item (32 count) a few months ago for myself and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> and I do not know what they are all used for, would&#x27;ve been great if they were separately labeled or at least a little insert into the bag,</li>
            <li> My sable hair brushes are good, but it&#x27;s a very small and limited set.</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t clearly show what you will recieve so here</li>
            <li> what was clearly a shadow sponge tool was identified as an angled shadow brush.  </li>
            <li> So far no shedding or anything...</li>
            <li> The brissles are so soft.</li>
            <li> funny,dont pick of make up well, and trust me my eyeshadow is very pigmented and also all the eye brushes are very similar NO JOKE</li>
            <li> Professional style brushes.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality because I had never used their brushes or products before.</li>
            <li> No shedding yet as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> But so far i haven&#x27;t had any fallout.</li>
            <li> Being that I do not know much about brushes I asked her about them two weeks later.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this set if you are starting out/doing a lot of stuff with makeup or performing.  </li>
            <li> especially for beginners, those who don&#x27;t really use makeup every day, but</li>
            <li> In the description it clearly stated that it used natural hair.</li>
            <li> (i think it was a concelar brush) out of the whole set of brushes, i only saw two hairs fall</li>
            <li> But as far as I can tell the brushes did not pick it up.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> It completely shed in my hand.</li>
            <li> This is a set I could let my 9 year old niece play with and not freakout if she damaged a brush.</li>
            <li> They are soft and well made.</li>
            <li> They only thing I really wish it had was the name of the brushes on them.</li>
            <li> They are way too soft</li>
            <li> I bought these make up brushes because mine were getting old</li>
            <li> Natural bristles will burn like your eyebrows or your hair.</li>
            <li> and this is a professional set, therefore there is no &amp;#34;map&amp;#34; telling me which brush is for what.</li>
            <li> and they are way too soft to hold any make up.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and managable.</li>
            <li> and i gave her one gift early which happen to be this one</li>
            <li> Brushes relatively soft, except for brow brush.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and have no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I would of preffered to have at least one more.</li>
            <li> It might be bothersome if you have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> they are amazingly soft and i have had no problem with bristles falling out since washing them.</li>
            <li> They are soft on the skin and apply product well.  </li>
            <li> I got these brushes for my 18 year old step daughter and she was overjoyed.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see them in action.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 16 year old granddaughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> The box itself was very simple, seemed like not too much effort was needed to just tear through it.</li>
            <li> The leather carry case is soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> B001JKTTVQ SHANY Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get good foundation coverage.    </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who need good quality brushes and a not so expensive price.</li>
            <li> I love this product I needed a good brush set very bad</li>
            <li> And i love that they are soft yet stiff enough to use.</li>
            <li> Professional look, no shed, high quality brushes for a fraction of what you&#x27;d pay for the bigger brand sets.  </li>
            <li> About the smell, it&#x27;s only the new leather smell!</li>
            <li> If you want several brushes that get the job done decently without paying an arm and a leg, then this kit is for you.</li>
            <li> NOT BLACK like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it can be natural bristles AND cruelty free. ....</li>
            <li> The next issue was that the brushes on the picture was showing black hair for the bristles but what came in the box was light brown/light orange hair for the bristles.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes are not worth 5 stars because to me they are worth 10</li>
            <li> The large brushes do do well with loose powders though.  </li>
            <li> it smells similar to new sneakers.</li>
            <li> All came intact, several with plastic slips to help maintain the shape, and are as soft as soft could be.</li>
            <li> The supplied pamphlet was less than useful in identifying the correct brushes by number, for example:</li>
            <li> I read some negative feedback about their being a strong odor???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I really need all 32 brushes, but it just encourages me to play around with my makeup a little more.</li>
            <li> I have not had any major problems with these brushes, and find all brushes to do their intended job.</li>
            <li> Has every type of brush I could ever want as a theater major.</li>
            <li> The spaces for the brushes are wide, and I can even fit other brushes in the pouch.</li>
            <li> I only had one brush lose quite a few fibers when I ran my finger over it, and a quick crimp with a needle nosed plier fixed it.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are indeed very soft, and so far have been holding up very well after washing them a few times.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend these brushes if you want decent quality brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li> So far they have held up well, a little fall out with the first uses of them.  </li>
            <li> these were amazing brushes i couldn&#x27;t have gone wrong</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a Christmas gift, or a gift in general, this is perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the set comes with a guide describing the uses of the individual brushes, which are all numbered clearly.</li>
            <li> Only about 3 brushes are soft.</li>
            <li> overall I like my brush set so far</li>
            <li> I paid extra money just to get my package here early</li>
            <li> So far I have only used a couple of eyeshadow brushes and a blush brush.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a difference they make in my makeup applications professional and personal.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is I am not a makeup professional</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend these for personal and hobby use, but they wouldn&#x27;t cut it professionally.  </li>
            <li> the eye brushes are the worse part of the set they are more like concealer brushes and lip brushes</li>
            <li> so pretty all black and</li>
            <li> i can tell you these are good for details on your eyes lips and nose but is a little poor for face..</li>
            <li> There is a round brush that is kind of pencil shaped, but its hard and pokey.</li>
            <li> These brushes are far better than expensive brushes I have purchased one at a time.  </li>
            <li> which is why its only getting 4 stars from me  two brushes had major flyaways and had to be trimmed or it would irritate my eyes</li>
            <li> it smelled a little funny when i opened up the box</li>
            <li> The package smelled a little funny...</li>
            <li> Please, ALWAYS properly wash and dry your new brushes before using them.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I understand that it is expected that they are new, but I did read some reviews were</li>
            <li> When my friends see this set they always ask me how much it was and are surprised when I tell them that it was only a little over $20!</li>
            <li> The only down side is them not being labeled but they are very versatile</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed as I recommended this product to many people, but I will make sure no one will be ordering them.</li>
            <li> And while the little handbook stating what every brush is for which is very helpful</li>
            <li> They do not come use, some other reviews said they felt like the brushes werent brand new.</li>
            <li> They got here in just a few days and they are SSSOOOOO SOFT!!!</li>
            <li> Bought a set of Sephora brushes but still not soft enough and lot more expensive than these brushes.  </li>
            <li> Compared to all the other make up brush sets i bought in the past 13 years, not only are these way more durable and the brissels don&#x27;t fall out, fray, or become course after a few months like all the others.</li>
            <li> it was only a little bit of shedding and i am new to makeup</li>
            <li> The gift was a score, the investment will last long.</li>
            <li> The handles are too long for personal use.</li>
            <li> What I think is supposed to be a flat liner brush</li>
            <li> Other than the couple small things, this product is worth the price...and the smell.</li>
            <li> so it is not that big of an issue in the long run!</li>
            <li> I had one problem so far - the black sponge tip kept falling off brush #7 -</li>
            <li> The brushes are not black they are tan and dark brown.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that there is no fluffy round brush.</li>
            <li> Maybe if i was a makeup artist connoisseur i would have understood but its 34 brushes and i only have a limited time to get dress for work, but even though its no use for me don&#x27;t change the numbered/bio of each brush.</li>
            <li> ANY kind of small- or medium-sized thick fluffy brushes.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional make up person, but I think the brushes are very soft, shaped well and firm when needed.  </li>
            <li> It is a minor and not a major con for myself considering</li>
            <li> Of course, there is minor shedding, but nothing to be too concerned with so far.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> There is a strange chemical smell, even after i have washed and conditioned the brushes, that lingers.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and were well packaged, the case is not real leather and as such has a bit of a chemical smell, but you can either air it out or just ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a fold out pamphlet that describes which brush does what.</li>
            <li> They are made of synthetic hair not natural.</li>
            <li> These bristles are plastic, not natural.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with them sheading or a strange smell as others have posted.</li>
            <li> LOTS of brushes for the money and long handles like I prefer.</li>
            <li> The brushes are are soft and feel firm.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it as long as the brushes does its job</li>
            <li> my only problem was that i wish it&#x27;ll come with something with the brushes name and uses written for us inexperienced make up \\&quot;artist\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s such a vast variety of brushes, and it comes neatly organized and rolled up, allowing you to store it in tight places.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased more expensive brushes in the past and feel like these are equally efficient.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this set 1 day earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> She says that she will not use any other brushed from now on.</li>
            <li> The only prob is the duplication in brushes with minimal difference!</li>
            <li> The other brushes aren&#x27;t big/fluffy enough for my liking but they do get the job done.</li>
            <li> My only other very small qualm is that the bigger brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> yes they do have a smell but its not that bad the only way for u to be able to smell it</li>
            <li> but it was pretty bad at first.</li>
            <li> an let them dry.</li>
            <li> but I left the pouch open for a few hours and it went away.</li>
            <li> I wanted several shadow brushes, there are only a few</li>
            <li> I tracked the shipping every single day until it came.</li>
            <li> I needed to mention it twice as the cost of this set is about 1/2 - 1/3 the cost of a single brush purchase for myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get every single brush you would need to start out in this kit.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I really have is that some of the brushes that are meant for the crease should be a little fluffier.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find any loose brush hairs...</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m ever traveling with brushes I would wrap them up in a soft shell organizer, then put them in a hard shell case.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I would see a lot of shedding of the brushes and loose handles, but I do not have those concerns!</li>
            <li> There are many duplicates, which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing if you&#x27;re wanting to do intricate makeup designs.</li>
            <li> Minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> I know that some loss of bristles is to be expected</li>
            <li> But another thing is that the pouch in not really leather.</li>
            <li> really not something I would recommend for a hardcore makeup person.</li>
            <li> Returning not the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> a \\&quot;blending\\&quot; brush does come in the kit but in my opinion its way too stiff/not fluffy enough to do what its suppose to.</li>
            <li> Now I want a pink set.</li>
            <li> and im like all right ill cilick on it.and</li>
            <li> it was the way I laid it down to dry</li>
            <li> The vinyl carrying case works fine, albeit unpleasant smelling for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are a few missing from the set (not from what is said is in the package, just meant in general)</li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell when you open the box, but it goes away once you air it out for a little.</li>
            <li> small fan brush  7 liner brushes (all different shapes)  </li>
            <li> I was so excited only to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> ou, one out of rhe blush brush and rhe other out</li>
            <li> if the fan brush other than the one mistake of two # 26s</li>
            <li> It just have a smell maybe due to the leatehr like packaging on it</li>
            <li> I have other brushes.</li>
            <li> You can also try this on any other fabric or rug fringe. )</li>
            <li> I have read some other reviews stating that the brushes don&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; the make up</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> No such luck - my small fan brush has been renamed Ms. Pac-man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very minimal.</li>
            <li> They didnt have an odd smell like a lot of other products are being claimed to have.</li>
            <li> just for your average user, I would recommend getting a mire diverse set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely biased in my opinion about that broken brush.</li>
            <li> the fan brush is thick enough than I thought</li>
            <li> I would recommend washing these brushes before use (just like every other brushes you may buy) and take care of them!</li>
            <li> I do really like the very thin eyeliner brushes and the fan brushes.</li>
            <li> Just useless to people like myself who don&#x27;t need the same brush in 4 different sizes.    </li>
            <li> I do wish I got less brushes</li>
            <li> Half way thru applying my make up</li>
            <li> I had no problems except for one of the brushes was rolled into the case so the bristles are slightly bent</li>
            <li> ,i thought less of them</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after about a week the handles came apart, but I glued them back together no big deal.  </li>
            <li> I expected a mediocre quality set for the price I paid but am pleasantly surprised at how well the brush set is made.</li>
            <li> Ive had these brushes for a few weeks now using them about everyday if not every other day.</li>
            <li> Shany actually has the nerve to describe some of the brushes as &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; when they&#x27;re all stick hard!</li>
            <li> I will say for those who are looking for a stippling type brush, contour brush or the typical fluffy eye shadow brush to blend, blend, blend....</li>
            <li> I am not a professional, but shouldn&#x27;t brushes be at least a little bit firm?  </li>
            <li> Ive been looking for brushes but haven&#x27;t found any but those little cases with 4 or 5 in them...</li>
            <li> I did smell a little paint,so I took all my brushes out for the pouch to air out, then I gave all my brushes a shampoo</li>
            <li> and I find it shed little to nothing.</li>
            <li> The leather bag made the brushes smell a little</li>
            <li> For less brushes and a WORSE quality, I paid the same price.</li>
            <li> Not very rewarding</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t put them down!</li>
            <li> I also agree with other reviewers who have said the eyeshadow brushes are not very good at picking up product.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me and use makeup everyday then this is a must have...</li>
            <li> .......dont waste your money,if your worried about it and went thru everything like i did(read the reviews a ton of times and watched reviews on youtube)DO</li>
            <li> One of the brushes (a concealer brush I think) had an uneven tip that I had to trim myself..    </li>
            <li> They did smell heavily of paint</li>
            <li> I tracked it everyday.</li>
            <li> two number 26 brushes(eyeshadow brush) ab missing a 27</li>
            <li> Just opened my package and noticed a few things</li>
            <li> is a cylinder brush with an uneven edge.</li>
            <li> I do need to add that they are used about everyday but not in a fashion that should cause them to fall apart.</li>
            <li> ,i had a few hundred bucks saved to do this.but</li>
            <li> Waste of  money give set to friends.</li>
            <li> I let it air out for a few days and it ended up going away</li>
            <li> Where is the fluffy blending brush for eyeshadow?  </li>
            <li> I just wish there was one or two really firm brushes for blending foundation.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find any missing pieces.</li>
            <li> the case is black also!</li>
            <li> black goes with everything!</li>
            <li> But i will say the &amp;#34;eye shadow&amp;#34;brushes are a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> out came an awful strong odor that other customers were talking about.</li>
            <li> but I must say that it was the only thing that I found wrong.</li>
            <li> Arrived within a few days of ordering!  </li>
            <li> The powder and blush brushes I find to be too small.</li>
            <li> But I ordered these just this past friday and got them in tuesday afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the 32 count again and not only did I receive the wrong item (22 count, which ISN&#x27;T EVEN A BUYING OPTION)</li>
            <li> The powder brushes are really small compared to my bareminerals brushes</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not really sure why anyone would complain about this.</li>
            <li> So I shopped around and looked at the makeup counters, Ulta, Sephora, all the usual places.</li>
            <li> The bag looks leather but its not authentic .. but the brushes work.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about them, but they arrived in the usual Amazon (prime) way - 2 days after I ordered them.  </li>
            <li> Not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> they feel a little weird or sticky but that goes away when they dry!</li>
            <li> and I would have to agree with that when working with pressed powder blushes or foundations they do seem to have a hard time.  </li>
            <li> ; I would desire a hard case, maybe?</li>
            <li> bristles are too hard.</li>
            <li> they were a little dusty for some reason</li>
            <li> Has no labels on brushes so it sucks to use cause</li>
            <li> There seems to be at least 2 of everything</li>
            <li> Some people complained about a chemical smell when opening the brushes.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t doubt some of these brushes could have been used to some capacity instead of the ones I purchased in addition to this set, I was expecting to have at least the basics of what I needed for a face of makeup.  </li>
            <li> honestly im not</li>
            <li> Wish there was a negative or 1/2 star rating ...</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a fluffy blending brush, but alas, it was not included.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on these Shany poor quality brushes.</li>
            <li> NOT CUTE!</li>
            <li> By this I mean using lip brushes as eyeshadow brushes, eyebrow brushes as eyeliner brushes, eyeliner brushes as lip brushes and so on.</li>
            <li> Catastrophic failure.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t provide the two brushes I was in serious need of.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect to seriously buy these and compare them with something like that</li>
            <li> I refuse to use those silly stumpy little sponge tipped applicators that come with eyeshadows, and I dislike eyeliner pencils.</li>
            <li> Eye brushes are not up to $$$ expensive brushes but felt none - to little irritation when using them on the eye area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you want face brushes this is not a good buy.</li>
            <li> For a novice like myself, that is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> but not a good product</li>
            <li> I use them on daily basis and till today they haven&#x27;t disappointed me</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed with this brush set, as it contains little in the variety  of brushes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain the brushes don&#x27;t shed , however how they were packaged was poor  </li>
            <li> numbering was also done poorly</li>
            <li> Despite the broken brush and the smell I still attempted to use the brushes.</li>
            <li> They do not have a concealer brush,angled blush brush or a thin eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re either too stiff or too flimsy and very difficult to control when applying the makeup.</li>
            <li> and it started shedding so badly that half the bristles disappeared...</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it came with a very bad smell</li>
            <li> felt like i wasted my money :(</li>
            <li> they look weird</li>
            <li> I was skeptical buying these because of the price, I bought the biggest set..</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the smell of the fake leather pouch or the plastic that the brushes are held in.</li>
            <li> But what I did notice was the foldable paper telling you what each brush is and what it is used for has the brushes labeled all wrong, the XL-fan brush is not used for eyeliner, but the paper told me it did.</li>
            <li> the quality of the brushes are CRAP compared to the ones I ordered a few months ago.</li>
            <li> but if they keep falling out like they are, the brush will be useless in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> Kinda lame,</li>
            <li> you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> And the booklets description of each brush is vague.</li>
            <li> Every brush was very dusty  4.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes they have are crap and not very good at shading.</li>
            <li> and the brush roll stinks</li>
            <li> And two, with it being Christmas time, and shipping is crazy this time of year</li>
            <li> For the price, you cannot be unhappy with this.</li>
            <li> people said theirs appeared dirty and used.</li>
            <li> even for one use - these brushes are useless!</li>
            <li> It might have been a bad brush....    </li>
            <li> I guess 2 bad brushes out of 32 isn&#x27;t all that bad.</li>
            <li> that there is a bad smell, mine didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> i wasnt like bad or</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad</li>
            <li> I am greatly disappointed in the brushes I purchased.  </li>
            <li> Alot of people say they shed like crazy, but I don&#x27;t have that problem!</li>
            <li> when i opened the box i was hit with that rank smell everyone keeps talking about...</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my girl on Xmas... very disappointed</li>
            <li> The brushes shed horribly.</li>
            <li> I opened them up and the smell was awful!!</li>
            <li> I like the number of brushes in the set however there is an awful smell with bag that holds them.</li>
            <li> It smells like bug spray and having a horrible time getting rid of them.</li>
            <li> The brushes also had a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> If i can give these brushes 1/10 of a star i would these brushes are horrible, I wouldn&#x27;t even call the problem shedding but literally falling apart.</li>
            <li> The smell was horrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> They are terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great buy &amp; awesome price!</li>
            <li> Only about 3 brushes are soft. The rest suck do not buy! If looking for cheap brushes try real techniques brushes, they are they best for cheap!</li>
            <li> I brought this because i needed new brushes. While i loved the set there are no brushes made for liquid foundation. And while the little handbook stating what every brush is for which is very helpful i just ended up doing my own thing with them because at times i felt i was reading a brush did the same thing as another. Maybe if i was a makeup artist connoisseur i would have understood but its 34 brushes and i only have a limited time to get dress for work, but even though its no use for me don&#x27;t change the numbered/bio of each brush.</li>
            <li> The leather pouch smells like tire rubber..very potent smell..brushes are good..it&#x27;s just an okay product; Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Quality wise I can&#x27;t complain the brushes don&#x27;t shed , however how they were packaged was poor  which is why its only getting 4 stars from me  two brushes had major flyaways and had to be trimmed or it would irritate my eyes one being the liner brush  numbering was also done poorly I am just learning what brush is what ( and yes I do watch reviews on youtube and so forth the quality is great of the brushes but the numbering was off by about 3 brushes.  No biggie though just switched the brushes around but like I said I&#x27;m a newbie. I still like the set though.</li>
            <li> I bought these same brushes for a friend and she loves them so I decided to try them! The brushes arrived very quickly and though I haven&#x27;t used them yet they look and feel like very good quality! I plan to wash them before use because that&#x27;s what you should do with all new brushes, but I&#x27;m super excited to use them! So far I&#x27;m very impressed and would definitely recommend them to a friend.</li>
            <li> ...I got this brush set four days before I was suppose to it and I got free shipping and handling...Although I paid $33 for it, it was worth the price compared to others that cost way more and have less brushes...Ive been looking for brushes but haven&#x27;t found any but those little cases with 4 or 5 in them...I wanted variety and I got it!!!...The case I believe is real leather because of the way it smelled and the brushes are soft...So far no shedding or anything...If you are like me and use makeup everyday then this is a must have...Try it!!!...</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the quality and value for the money on these brushes. I don&#x27;t expect them all to last years, but for the price, quantity and the quality, they are fantastic. They are extremely soft and they all look to be of good quality. At first use they did shed some hairs, but after the first initial shedding they were fine. Buy this!!!</li>
            <li> This brush set it proof that you don&#x27;t have to spend an arm and a leg on quality brushes, especially natural brushes. It has 10 eyeshadow brushes! My favorite is the large, angled shadow brush, which is the best for blending when I&#x27;m done applying my shadow. The face brushes are full and soft and has never made me break out. The face brushes shed a little at first, but mine are totally fine now. I love the soft leather pouch they come in, which keeps me super organized. The spaces for the brushes are wide, and I can even fit other brushes in the pouch.</li>
            <li> I Just Got My Brush set in the mail today and im definitly happy with th quality of the brushes. the brissles are soft but not too sof, the handles are long and made of good quality heavy plastic. The brushes are not black they are tan and dark brown. The case does have a distinct smell but its not as unbearing as others put it out to be. it smells similar to new sneakers. The reason why i gave this product 4 stars is because 1 of the sponge brush&#x27;s tips fell off but its nothing that some super glue cant fix.</li>
            <li> Funny smell to case but brushes are wonderful.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a brush kit.  I think like a guy, I didn&#x27;t know there were so many brushes.  The gift was a score, the investment will last long. Great gift.</li>
            <li> I got this wanting 32 brushes but I only got 22 so I paid the 32 brushes price but only got 22 so I didn&#x27;t get what I was told</li>
            <li> I love this brush set so much I got rid of every other brush I own. I ordered 2 more sets for friends -- definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> This product is very cheap quality. It is not studio quality for sure. The brushes shed horribly. I returned this for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my order! I order these brushes on 9/14 and received them on 9/18 with free shipping! The quality of the products are pretty good! Over all, I am happy with Shany&#x27;s products so far!</li>
            <li> We love Shany products!  This brush set was no exception.  Excellent quality and value.  Couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything more.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am a Make-up Artist rebuilding my makeup kit/supplies. I am VERY happy with this product so far. I was looking for a variety of eyeshadow brushes to do all types of glamour/beauty and Special FX looks. I LOVE the types of brushes included in this set and I love the price!&lt;br /&gt;I am going to wash/condition the brushes before use. I was worried that I would see a lot of shedding of the brushes and loose handles, but I do not have those concerns! Of course, there is minor shedding, but nothing to be too concerned with so far.&lt;br /&gt;This item arrived MUCH earlier than estimated, in safe packaging and it was easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep you updated!!</li>
            <li> products arrived safely and was consistent with the description.</li>
            <li> Has no labels on brushes so it sucks to use cause you don&#x27;t know what brush to use</li>
            <li> Wow, I was so so so excited to recieve this. I tracked the shipping every single day until it came. The brushes are excellent. They have nice, long handles. The brissles are so soft. The leather brush roll is great. The picture doesn&#x27;t clearly show what you will recieve so here you go:  1 large fan brush  3 powder brushes  1 face angled face brush (perfect for blush/bronzer)  1 concealer brush (SOOOO SOFT)  10 lid brushes all in different sizes  1 eye blending brush  1 angled eye brush  1 small fan brush  7 liner brushes (all different shapes)  2 smudge brushes  1 spoolie  1 brow/lash comb  1 leather bush roll  Obviously this kit isnot vegan, but I cannot even being to explain to you how amazing the quality is.  The brushes are, in my opinion, BETTER THAN M.A.C. and A FRACTION OF THE COST.  The packaging was even great. The boxwas stuffed with bags of air to protect everything, the brush roll was wrapped, and inside, every brush was in its place AND wrapped individually for extra protection. 12 of the brushes came with brush covers to help keep their shape as well. None of the brushes were damaged in any way.   THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING.  You should buy it right away.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing and really are as good as mac brushes. My Wife are pretty happy with this gift.</li>
            <li> i recently bought and tested out all of the brushes and i like the face brushes like the larger ones for powder blush but i absoulutly do not recommend you to get these maybe if they sell the face brushes apart from the eye brushes....(EYE BRUSHES)feel funny,dont pick of make up well, and trust me my eyeshadow is very pigmented and also all the eye brushes are very similar NO JOKE and theres no blending brush.......dont waste your money,if your worried about it and went thru everything like i did(read the reviews a ton of times and watched reviews on youtube)DO NOT GET THESE BRUSHES!!!...and the brush roll stinks when you get it,brands i recommend are like sigma i thought i would give shanys a try and i did but im going back to sigma brushes(which are kinda pricey but so WORTH it)</li>
            <li> Great quality!! Professional style brushes. Need to be washed before use (obviously) but very good product. I was surprised at the quality because I had never used their brushes or products before. Will definitely give their makeup a try!</li>
            <li> okay I just got my brushes in the mail today!! I opened them up and the smell was awful!! it was really strong! but I must say that it was the only thing that I found wrong. the brushes are wonderful, I thought that they would be flimsy and just not work anything but they are very strong but soft if that makes any since. I looked over every brush, and they were good they were a little dusty for some reason but I flicked the dust off with my nail and then washed them with antibacterial soap, so they are drying now but when I was washing them they held up really good I tried my best, with all my might to pull the hair out of my brushes and not a one came out, at least I didnt see any! so I think the brushes are Great!! and the price is great. I also scrubbed my pouch to try a get some of the smell out it&#x27;s still smelly( like a strong plastic) but its lighter since i washed it!! I hope this helps. okay I had to do an edit, this is the next day after I washed my brushes they look weird but all you need to do is rub your finger across each of them and all of the brush will be right back in place perfect!! one did have some hairs out of place put it was the way I laid it down to dry so be mindful of the when you wash them, I re-wet it and it was back in place if you was the handles(I did) they feel a little weird or sticky but that goes away when they dry! again these are Great brushs! and my name is Cheryl not marvin my husband has this account set up so it will prob. show his name!</li>
            <li> I like the number of brushes in the set however there is an awful smell with bag that holds them. It smells like bug spray and having a horrible time getting rid of them. Noone wants to put something on their face and smell something that smells like bug spray on it. Not very rewarding I assure you.</li>
            <li> Arrived within a few days of ordering!  Very nice set of brushes- excellent condition, quality, and variety.  Thinking of ordering a second set.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> the brushes are a good price if you&#x27;re like myself and want to have something to learn and practice with.I wanted more face brushes and some of the eye brushes aren&#x27;t as dense as I would like but they are still good. No shedding yet as far as I can tell. Some people have said how the one sponge applicator easily comes out but I think they are meant to and the sponge applicators are disposable and replaceable somehow. overall I like my brush set so far and I&#x27;m happy I bought it! It says 32 but my sister just counted 34 brushes..hmmm</li>
            <li> my brushes arrived today before work so i haven&#x27;t really gotten a chance to play with them. But so far i haven&#x27;t had any fallout. when i opened the box i was hit with that rank smell everyone keeps talking about...doubt i&#x27;ll be using that to store my brushes...hopefully once i wash the brushes that smell will go away. kid you not i left the bag in my room while i worked a 6 hour shift, came back an my room smelled like the bag&#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;the brush bristles are a brownish color, but i don&#x27;t think it makes them unattractive they still look nice to me:) very pleased with my purchase (aside from the smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: washed and conditioned the brushes. no fallout whatsoever and they smell lovely:)</li>
            <li> i was looking for some very specific brushes, which this set has, and decided to buy the whole thing for all the other wonderful and useful brushes.....very happy</li>
            <li> Some people say the case smells, some people say it doesn&#x27;t. Mine did. Rather strongly, but nothing that some airing out didn&#x27;t remedy. I suggest you put it in a room with an open window or door, or the next time you enter the room you put it in - you&#x27;ll get hit in the face with the smell.  The brushes didn&#x27;t have much fallout, nothing more than normal from the first washing. No color bleeding.    There are many duplicates, which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing if you&#x27;re wanting to do intricate makeup designs. Just useless to people like myself who don&#x27;t need the same brush in 4 different sizes.    My only other very small qualm is that the bigger brushes are very soft. It&#x27;s difficult to get good foundation coverage.    Other than the couple small things, this product is worth the price...and the smell.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it!! The product itself was nicely packed &amp; was beautiful. It&#x27;s a must buy!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got them. They really are beautiful brushes and super soft.    However, I did find some shedding on most of them. I dipped one of the eyeshadow brushes into my cinema secrets brush cleaner and it started shedding so badly that half the bristles disappeared...It might have been a bad brush....    I tried cleaning the blush brushes and  (thank goodness) those held up just fine with just a little bit of shedding.  One of the brushes (a concealer brush I think) had an uneven tip that I had to trim myself..    Other than the rest of them were ok ^_^. I didn&#x27;t get a chance to clean the rest of the brushes but when I do I&#x27;ll let you know how it goes.    I guess 2 bad brushes out of 32 isn&#x27;t all that bad. I still love them and they really are a great value.</li>
            <li> 1. There is a strange chemical smell, even after i have washed and conditioned the brushes, that lingers. It doesnt bother me, however it may bother you.  2. The bristles do fall out at first, however after a good cleaning i have not had any trouble.  3. Great selection of brushes, all work great and get the job done.  4. The \\&quot;leather\\&quot; case they come in is nice and works great.  5. This is a fantastic deal for the money, however don&#x27;t expect top of the line brushes. You do get what you pay for, however these brushes are 100% useable and work.  6. I find the brush set to be overall very pretty.    If you are looking for a big brush set and still have some room in your wallet, this set is perfect. I have not had any major problems with these brushes, and find all brushes to do their intended job.</li>
            <li> If I could give this MORE than 5 stars, I would. I was unbelievably excited to get these, as I&#x27;ve ordered SHANY products before and gotten great results. I received them only three days after I got my confirmation email(YAY!!). They were in the original SHANY box, all the brushes were wrapped in plastic, and the bigger brushes had more substantial plastic on the tops, so they wouldn&#x27;t get misshapen. They came with a paper describing all the brushes, and their uses. A lot of people said they shed and smell like plastic or whatever, but neither of those things are happening with mine. It&#x27;s SOOOOO much better than I expected it would be! I&#x27;M SOOOO UNBELIEVABLY HAPPY WITH THEM!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical buying these because of the price, I bought the biggest set.. but they are so soft and I love them for the price!!!</li>
            <li> i love these products they actually grab colors, before i got this i saw the reviews and was a bit if-y about it but i decided to take the risk and order them, and I&#x27;m glad i did! 32 brushes for $25.00 that&#x27;s a bargain! I&#x27;m cleaning them now so they can be soft and clean :D</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if I should trust brushes sold so inexpensive.  When the brushes arrived, I deep cleaned them and the next day had so much fun !  I looked at the tutorials that I would use my old MAC brushes that were very worn out (which came out NOT looking like what I had tried to do)  I tried the tutorials with these brushes and lets just say my eye makeup came out looking like I just left a make-up artist!!!! These brushes to say the least made me very happy and work phenomenal.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister. She opened them and is in love with them. Being that I do not know much about brushes I asked her about them two weeks later. She says they are a good quality, and since she does only her make-up that it is really all she needs.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft, I love the feel. But its like 3 brushes and the rest are dups....i was very disapointed. Doesn&#x27;t include a cream/liquid foundation brush. and out of 32 brushes you would think it would! the picture looks better than what you actually get. TOO MANY DUPS, not enough variety.</li>
            <li> Just purchased a 2nd set of these brushes for my Sister because I love mine so much. Been using mine for a year now and I still have no complaints. Bristles do not fall out and they&#x27;re still very soft. Definitely worth every penny. I know my Sister is gonna love them!</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist just starting out and I needed a good but inexpensive brush set.&lt;br /&gt;These are great to start with! They are so soft and you are really able to pack on the colors.&lt;br /&gt;Down side is the pouch does smell like vinyl, even after deep cleaning my brushes, they&lt;br /&gt;Still smelled like vinyl! It is going away gradually. Another con for me was they don&#x27;t gave any&lt;br /&gt;Fluffy blending eye brushes. But being a MUA I don&#x27;t mind buying more brushes because I will use them all the time&lt;br /&gt;But just for your average user, I would recommend getting a mire diverse set.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love these brushes. They arrived on time and were well packaged, the case is not real leather and as such has a bit of a chemical smell, but you can either air it out or just ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a fold out pamphlet that describes which brush does what. It would be nice if  there were some way to tell without having to guess which number you are about to remove and counting from there. I just numbered the carrying slots which made it better.&lt;br /&gt;My makeup has never looked so flawless, I am get compliments on it all the time. It&#x27;s a very good price, especially for the quality, your really don&#x27;t have to much to lose! Go for it!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set for my wife during Christmas and she loved it.  There&#x27;s such a vast variety of brushes, and it comes neatly organized and rolled up, allowing you to store it in tight places.  It&#x27;s also perfect as a travel companion.</li>
            <li> I paid extra money just to get my package here early and it hasn&#x27;t came . Someone please explain this to me !</li>
            <li> I received my package ahead of time. It was neatly packaged. Some say theirs had a funny smell.. mine did not have any funny smells. Just smelt new. There is a guide to tell you every use for every brush. Every brush is numbered. I&#x27;m a beginner cosmetologist and this works great for me. I recommend this to anyone who need good quality brushes and a not so expensive price. I loveeee it !</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these brushes I was gona get Coastal Scents brushes but instead i got this i almost cried felt like i wasted my money :( the eye brushes are the worse part of the set they are more like concealer brushes and lip brushes So its more like a brush set of 28 lip,liner and concealer brushes and 4 decent face brushes BOOOOOO!</li>
            <li> Price is not bad, but the quality is cheap</li>
            <li> Buy two 32-piece kit and received two of 22 !!! a scam</li>
            <li> These brushes are really good for the money.  I ordered the larger set but I really don&#x27;t need all of those brushes.  Many of the eye and lip brushes are similar in size.  I would suggest purchasing the smaller pack.  They apply makeup really nice and are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Super soft and exceeded my expectations! They did smell heavily of paint but I left the pouch open for a few hours and it went away. Love, love , LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I was so EXCITED to order these brushes. I tracked it everyday. They came in one day before scheduled which was nice! When I opened the package up...out came an awful strong odor that other customers were talking about. I think it&#x27;s the smell of the fake leather pouch or the plastic that the brushes are held in. The next issue was that the brushes on the picture was showing black hair for the bristles but what came in the box was light brown/light orange hair for the bristles. NOT CUTE! That made me really upset so I returned them the same day. And to top it all off...the brushes are not labeled to let you know what each one is used for. I don&#x27;t blame amazon.com but I do blame the merchant that is working with Amazon.com SHAME ON YOU FOR WASTING MY TIME AND MY MONEY!</li>
            <li> All the eye brushes are the same. No blending brush. They are trying to make quantity over quality. The brushes are soft but there is smell of plastic at first. The brush dye was also shotty and was leaked onto the brush wrappers. I would reccomend NOT wasing your money.  I only use 3 brushes.</li>
            <li> These are going to be a present for my daughter.  They arrived in a timely manner and look beautiful.  I think she will love them</li>
            <li> It came really fast. And i love that they are soft yet stiff enough to use. They apply very well. I am overly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Kinda cheap tho. And the leather bag is too smelly</li>
            <li> im an aspiring drag queen and have been looking for a great set of makeup brushes and these are amzing yes they do have a smell but its not that bad the only way for u to be able to smell it u have to put your nose up to it but other than the smell they are great they are very soft and the case is made well i dont know if it is leather or not i cant tell but its just the best</li>
            <li> it was only a little bit of shedding and i am new to makeup so im not sure which brush is for what but other than that they are great</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I&#x27;m almost overwhelmed with the choice but I definitely do use everthing.&#x27;  I would really recommend this set if you are starting out/doing a lot of stuff with makeup or performing.  Nice! And thank you!</li>
            <li> same the picture , i love it ... thank you</li>
            <li> This is a very nice set of brushes.  Glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set! My mom was jealous when I bought myself this and then for Mother&#x27;s Day she asked me to buy her one! When my friends see this set they always ask me how much it was and are surprised when I tell them that it was only a little over $20! The brush set does not contain any synthetic brushes and the bristles are very soft, you can tell these are quality brushes. What makes the set even better is that you get a case that rolls up to hold all 32 brushes.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected the most of the brushes are too small but still nice price though.</li>
            <li> Honestly, before I bought these brushes, I read all the reviews to it. Truthfully, they didn&#x27;t sound so worth it because some reviews say they weren&#x27;t so soft &amp; they smelled, etc. Well, I decided to get them anyways and you know what?!? These brushes are WONDERFUL! I&#x27;m glad I bought these and I LOVE it so much!!! About the smell, it&#x27;s only the new leather smell! Don&#x27;t worry about it! These brushes are for the face, not the nose. Plus, the brushes are super soft &amp; smooth like how makeup brushes are to be &amp; they pick up makeup pigments really good. I&#x27;ve also cleaned them too &amp; the hair didn&#x27;t fall out. And lastly I must say, the delivery was super super fast &amp; free too! I got mines in 2 DAYS! This set of brushes are not worth 5 stars because to me they are worth 10+ stars!!! LOVE THEM SO MUCH &amp; IT&#x27;S SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I looooooove these brushes! ! Soft, manageable,  inexpensive, just great!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of the brushes yet so I may edit my review later.  I purchased these for my daughter who is a dancer.  The bristles seem to be nice and soft but seem to pick up the makeup well.  So far I have only used a couple of eyeshadow brushes and a blush brush.  There certainly isn&#x27;t a lack of choices for any of your makeup needs.  I have purchased more expensive brushes in the past and feel like these are equally efficient.  The value cannot be beaten.</li>
            <li> Love these. Great deal.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and it came so quickly! It does have a slight smell when you open the box, but it goes away once you air it out for a little. Make sure to wash your brushes before use! Very happy with this product :)</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;ve had one or two bristles fall out already. Yes, the package had a smell, but it goes away almost instantly. The brushes are super soft on my skin. I do wish I got less brushes though cause I only use like 6 brushes out of the 32 lol.</li>
            <li> I received my brush set on Saturday. I was so excited only to be disappointed.  As soon as I unrolled the brushes, one of the brush heads fell out of the roll. I tried to put it back together but to no avail. The brushes also had a horrible smell. The smell did however disappear but only after I washed the brushes twice. Despite the broken brush and the smell I still attempted to use the brushes. Mistake!!!!! Half way thru applying my make up I switched from the Shany set and used another company&#x27;s brush set. I didn&#x27;t like the application at all and I had to use way much product. Overall I wish I could return this set and get my money back!</li>
            <li> The handles of these keep coming off in your hands.</li>
            <li> Delivery was Fast! The brushes are very well made and a great quality. Great price for the product for sure! when the brushes need cleaned i just use my favorite shampoo and swirl them around in it in the palm of my hand and then rinse them, it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> First of all the shipping an packaging was so great! so let me began by saying that when I open the bursh pouch I was so excited and pleased with my brushes, all my brushes was in there section. The sponge applicator tip came off, so what I did was hot gluded it back on, that was no problem at all. I check each and ever shany brush I receive, and I double check it for any fall outs of any kind, there was no problem at all. I did smell a little paint,so I took all my brushes out for the pouch to air out, then I gave all my brushes a shampoo an let them dry. After that I use each an every brush that I received every thing came out great! I recommended this brush set to anyone. especially for beginners, those who don&#x27;t really use makeup every day, but need the brushes when they do, For people who are in beauty school,and for those who are on a budget like myself. I gave this 4 stars cause one of the sponge handle tip came off other-wise I would have given it 5 stars. I truly love my Shany brush set. Thanks Shany from aka MsLadyLocks</li>
            <li> Save your money. These brushes do not blend well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are worth every single penny! They&#x27;re so soft and they apply the makeup so smooth leaving you with a natural look</li>
            <li> If i can give these brushes 1/10 of a star i would these brushes are horrible, I wouldn&#x27;t even call the problem shedding but literally falling apart. I would not recommend them at all im deff. going to buy a higher quality set... I shouldn&#x27;t have gone the cheap route with brushes.&lt;br /&gt;long link but here is how the hair was coming out by bunches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Verry good.. Son muy buenas y trae una variedad de brochas increibles..La aplicacion para ponerte la sombra queda bella y las brochas,son vien suaves..</li>
            <li> Fast delivery they look great, I can&#x27;t tell if they worked out , because it was a gift. But very soft brushes.</li>
            <li> They are made of synthetic hair not natural. In the description it clearly stated that it used natural hair. Got this as a gift for my girl on Xmas... very disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my sis i know nothing about stuff like this But she knows about it bery well so the four stars came from her</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and it says&lt;br /&gt; that there is a bad smell, mine didn&#x27;t. But what I did notice was the foldable paper telling you what each brush is and what it is used for has the brushes labeled all wrong, the XL-fan brush is not used for eyeliner, but the paper told me it did. The only thing that i was disapointed to see is i have two number 26 brushes(eyeshadow brush) ab missing a 27 (i think it was a concelar brush) out of the whole set of brushes, i only saw two hairs fall ou, one out of rhe blush brush and rhe other out if the fan brush other than the one mistake of two # 26s i am quite pleased</li>
            <li> excellent brushes for make-up artist and daily used! all brushes in good condition, very soft material. 32 in count and the bag it&#x27;s cool and very soft! all the brushes you need to do your make-up! delivered right at the estimated date.</li>
            <li> I am by no means a make up expert, there are so many brushes and I do not know what they are all used for, would&#x27;ve been great if they were separately labeled or at least a little insert into the bag, letting you know what&#x27;s what. But overall, nice quality and if you cannot afford MAC brushes this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes Friday and got them in the mail the following Monday. VERY fast shipping. They were very well packed. Each brush had its own sleeve plus some had the harder plastic sleeves. The case was wrapped in plastic and then there were pockets of air packed around that inside the box. I had no problems except for one of the brushes was rolled into the case so the bristles are slightly bent but I am trying to correct that now.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes pick up LOTS of color.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this only 4 stars is because the case does have a VERY strong chemical smell. It actually gave me a headache smelling it. But as far as I can tell the brushes did not pick it up. I&#x27;m going to try to find a way to clean the case. But even if I have to get rid of the case this set of brushes was well worth my $25.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! I got them for Mothers Day and I can&#x27;t put them down! There are a few missing from the set (not from what is said is in the package, just meant in general) but I can buy them separately. The hairs have all stayed in tacked and none have fallen out or become &amp;#34;tweaked&amp;#34;. Love love love them! Highly recommend these to anyone and everyone looking for some high quality brushes with out the high price. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. I went off the reviews. She loved them and wouldn&#x27;t stop talking about how impressed she was with the quality and my ability to buy her something I had no clue about. Again, I bought it based off all the positive reviews and I do recommend this to every boyfriend out there thinking about this.</li>
            <li> Shany Professional 32 count brush set is  Really a great Product for best price I got it for $11 . I love it and its really nicely made.</li>
            <li> After 10 years of being make up free I decided to jump back in. So far I am loving this purchase. The brushes are soft, easy to wash, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with shedding!!!!!</li>
            <li> For the price these brushes are awesome. I love them. Especially if you don&#x27;t know much up about makeup brushes and you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot on something that might not be good. this is a great starter.</li>
            <li> Excellent beginners brush set. I bought this to supplement my more expensive brushes. This is more of my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; brush set and the quality is not bad at all. Some of the bristles are to flimsy to do much, but for the price it&#x27;s not a bad set. I would recommend for a a beginner.</li>
            <li> I wanted a large brush set - to divide between makeup stashes (travel bag, car backup...) even for one use - these brushes are useless! Who could possibly need that many liner brushes! I wanted several shadow brushes, there are only a few and they don&#x27;t work that well.  The powder and blush brushes I find to be too small. The large fan brush sheds by the handful.  The handles are too long for personal use. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Professional look, no shed, high quality brushes for a fraction of what you&#x27;d pay for the bigger brand sets.  Love this for me and for work.</li>
            <li> I gave this set a shot because they were so inexpensive. Completely beyond worth it. all thirty two are just over the price of one of my foundations brushes from sephora. All came intact, several with plastic slips to help maintain the shape, and are as soft as soft could be. plus the case is really nice as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this last week and I am so in love with them I even gave mines away and just purchased a new one I love it especially if you are a new make up artist</li>
            <li> I love the quality of these brushes. This kit has every brush you could need, whether you&#x27;re a beginner or a seasoned make up pro.</li>
            <li> Not going to lie, this set totally makes me feel like a makeup pro! These are great quality brushes, and the set includes everything you&#x27;d ever need. The leather pouch makes transporting the brushes very easy as well.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say it is inexpensive! These are my first set of brushes! I really like it! They are very soft and picks up a good amount of product! I washed these brushes once. They are very durable and works like new again! What a good investment in!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have such a huge collection of make up brushes! Fash shipping and professional quality! I ordered this along with the Shany Cosmetics makeup kit, I could spend days trying different looks!</li>
            <li> I may not be a make up artist but I think that this set of brushes is great.  The variety covers about everything one would need.  I am impressed with the quality and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the smell.  Great set for the price and very fast shipping.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this product I needed a good brush set very bad and I found it in this one they have a brush for everything and they are very good quality I would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys doing makeup</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! The handle is very sterdy (oak wood) and they are eached numbered and are so beautiful and soft! They work amazingly for applying my makeup and they have everying single brush you will need except a kabuki but other than thay they are great!</li>
            <li> It just have a smell maybe due to the leatehr like packaging on it but, it all looks good and no strands came of it yet.</li>
            <li> Very good brushes I loved it especially for the price .. Only thing is that it came with a very bad smell so it&#x27;s mandatory you wash them before use ! Other than that it&#x27;s really good and the brushes are extremely soft .. I am satisfied</li>
            <li> I chose this product as a gift for my wife&lt;br /&gt;He was granted to impress my wife&lt;br /&gt;High quality product</li>
            <li> I am IN LOOOOOVVVEEEEE the package came so quickly. It&#x27;s was package nice and neat. The pictures do not lie. I LOVE MY brush set and make up box. I uploaded picture for your viewing</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. I absolutely love them. I can&#x27;t believe what a difference they make in my makeup applications professional and personal.</li>
            <li> Omg omg omg these brushes are amazing they are sooooooo soft which is excellent for the skin it feels really nice and smooth and makes u want to use them everyday very gentle on the skin simply amazing oh yeah I&#x27;ll surely get another one😁😁😁😁😀😀😀😀😀😀</li>
            <li> You might think that you&#x27;re getting the bang for your buck with this 32-piece brush set, but honestly, some of them are just duplicates. There seems to be at least 2 of everything and do you really need that many? The eyeshadow brushes they have are crap and not very good at shading. They don&#x27;t have any good blending brushes, and there&#x27;s not even a foundation brush in sight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are better off used as artist brushes than make-up ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to a very old set of sable hair brushes. My sable hair brushes are good, but it&#x27;s a very small and limited set. Let&#x27;s do the math here, even the el-cheapo brushes at the drugstore cost three to four dollars each, so that&#x27;s a significant savings here, even if you don&#x27;t count the sponge applicators and the brow/mascara brushes. Not counting those four, you&#x27;re still getting 28 brushes at a low price. These are very soft, and sorted in a nice case making them easy to organize and take care of. A good set of brushes can save you a fortune, in and of themselves. I refuse to use those silly stumpy little sponge tipped applicators that come with eyeshadows, and I dislike eyeliner pencils. With good brushes, you can have eyeliner in whatever shade you choose, use your eye shadows! Additionally, good brushes, that are regularly and properly cleaned, can help keep gross bacteria out of your makeup. For those that don&#x27;t want to spend a mint on brushes such as MAC, or for those that need a good &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; set, these are GREAT. I like to buy a set like this, then add to it with a brush here and there if I find I have a more specific need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving these brushes/company the benefit of the doubt. I&#x27;d prefer 1 to 1.5 stars. Just opened my package and noticed a few things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Very soft bristles. Eye brushes are not up to $$$ expensive brushes but felt none - to little irritation when using them on the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;2. Very inexpensive set.&lt;br /&gt;3. A good range of brushes, while also having slight variations on the same brush in the set. This makes it a nice booster or exploration set. You can also figure out what variation of hardness and angle you&#x27;d like to look out for in future brushes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Inexpensive set. I needed to mention it twice as the cost of this set is about 1/2 - 1/3 the cost of a single brush purchase for myself.&lt;br /&gt;5. Nice little case. It&#x27;s a wonderful and adequate holder for the brushes. If I&#x27;m ever traveling with brushes I would wrap them up in a soft shell organizer, then put them in a hard shell case. A shoe box or traveling case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The itemized list of brushes and their description is incorrect. I found 5 errors in my booklet. Not a deal for me but some may be a stickler about this.&lt;br /&gt;2. My angled eyeliner was replaced with a straight liner. I found this humorous because A) I already have an angled liner that I prefer (E.L.F. &amp; Sephora Pro). B) The plastic cap covering the brush was bent like it should be for an angled liner. It looked like when packing, someone was sleeping on the job. This is why I feel this set makes a better booster set then a starter one.&lt;br /&gt;3. What I think is supposed to be a flat liner brush is a cylinder brush with an uneven edge. I&#x27;ve never seen this shape before. I have no idea what to do with it. It&#x27;s not that the hairs are shedding, the whole knot is shaped into a cylinder. It is a minor and not a major con for myself considering I have other brushes. If you did not....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAJOR Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Out-of-the-box destroyed brush. This is the reason I&#x27;m writing this review. Picked up brush #5. It completely shed in my hand. Catastrophic failure. I have never seen this with any brush I&#x27;ve brought before. Paint brushes, makeup brushes, even shaving brushes. I have a feeling there was an issue with epoxy glue and curing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT regret making my purchase. I am reminded of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. This is a set I could let my 9 year old niece play with and not freakout if she damaged a brush. If you already have a pretty decent set this is great to supplement with. If you&#x27;re just starting out and want to see what all the different brushes can do then it&#x27;s okay/good. I&#x27;m completely biased in my opinion about that broken brush. Because of that I just can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend without a warning.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with these brushes! Theres one for everything you need. They are soft and well made. I was very satisfied to the price just wish they had the brush type stamped on each brush they are numbered and come with a paper that lists what each one is for.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she said they are great and have lasted a long time, and for the price its a no brainier.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes. They&#x27;re really precise and the hairs are good on the skin. Cannot complain at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a Christmas gift, or a gift in general, this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also explains what each brush is used for. Just perfect and affordable!</li>
            <li> Nice set! I was in need of brushes, kept using the same two. Anyways the set is soo big I wish I had a bigger bathroom counter! Awesome</li>
            <li> These brushes came amazingly fast. For one,I am stationed overseas, so I was expecting them to take a couple weeks. And two, with it being Christmas time, and shipping is crazy this time of year, I wasnt expecting these until after the first of the year. But I ordered these just this past friday and got them in tuesday afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for shedding, there was none. They pick up product very well, and i wasnt wearing bristles and makeup all over my face. They didnt have an odd smell like a lot of other products are being claimed to have. I didnt like the leather wrap up case it comes in but it will do until i find something nicer to put them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all...EXACTLY what i was looking for. Great quality brushes with out having to pay with arms and legs to get them! :-)&lt;br /&gt;And Shany&#x27;s service was great and super fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes and the shipping was really quick. They are nice soft and very attached bristle. So far so good on the sticks as well. They only thing I really wish it had was the name of the brushes on them. I&#x27;m a beginner plus when I watch tutorials they gurus can explain better which one they are using. Over all I&#x27;m so excited to use them. So I would recommend them. FYI there will be shedding it is manufacted but it&#x27;s very minimal. On one blush brush there was 2 strands sticking out that was all the shedding I seen.</li>
            <li> Makes a great present!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my girlfriend a year ago. She still uses these brushes today. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> This is awesome brushes...i used this all the time and okey to wash! Never have a problem on this item!</li>
            <li> I previously bought this item (32 count) a few months ago for myself and LOVED it. I ordered it again as a gift for someone for their birthday. I ordered the 32 count again and not only did I receive the wrong item (22 count, which ISN&#x27;T EVEN A BUYING OPTION) the quality of the brushes are CRAP compared to the ones I ordered a few months ago. They are COMPLETELY different. For less brushes and a WORSE quality, I paid the same price. VERY disappointed as I recommended this product to many people, but I will make sure no one will be ordering them.</li>
            <li> Soft, fast shipping, packaged well, cute case</li>
            <li> Great value. Minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> We were delighted to receive this item as quickly as we did, as this was a Christmas gift for our daughter. She was thrilled however after using them for less than 3 weeks we are seeing that the bristles are falling out. I know that some loss of bristles is to be expected but if they keep falling out like they are, the brush will be useless in a matter of weeks. I do need to add that they are used about everyday but not in a fashion that should cause them to fall apart.</li>
            <li> 1. It is definitely NOT a leather case  2. It is cheap Chinese quality  3. Every brush was very dusty  4. There is not eye concealer   5. I am not a professional, but shouldn&#x27;t brushes be at least a little bit firm?  They are way too soft</li>
            <li> These brushes were cheap quality.  They had a sort of smell that I did not like (like spray paint).  I did notice shedding.  I returned them for a refund.</li>
            <li> so i bought these brushes on friday last week,and i got them today(sunday).i thought they would come on tuesday because thats what it said when i prucshased it.but i got it way before.which i loved.  im in beauty school right now,and i wear no makeup at all.so i figured if i would buy a set a brushes i would buy a good set.but i didnt know how much to spend espically because im barely staring off with makeup and stuff.i wanted to buy them at the mall,or at the mac store,i had a few hundred bucks saved to do this.but then i saw the site on google and im like all right ill cilick on it.and i did.and i saw these brushes.and i thought it was a freakin steal.i was defintly buying them after reading the reviews.and when i opend the box today,i thought it was small,i dont kno why i thougt that.and then i opened it up.there was a smell when i opend the box.but i wasnt like bad or anything.and then i opened it up and it was longer than i thouht and i loved it!i havent used them or anything.but i did play around with them.there very very soft.and there really long.they havent shed at all.there way better than i thought,i thought less of them and im like oh well its only 40 bucks,way cheaper than what i was gonna spend and than i thought that i could just send them back if i want,but i dont want to,ther cool:)</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t  put mineral makeup  on good. Waste of  money give set to friends. I washed them &amp; they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> I just got my brushes in the mail yesterday and I like them. Shipping took a while but all of the brushes were undamaged and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with shedding as a lot of other people have experienced. There is a lot of brushes but I took a look at the information inside the box and it tells you which brush is for what. Overall it was a great purchase without any problems.</li>
            <li> These just came in a day before the estimated delivery time which is a plus point and I&#x27;m satisfied with the brushes. the fan brush is thick enough than I thought and I just love the way it feels on my skin. The whole set is worth it!!! It came out better than I expected...^^</li>
            <li> I was missing one of the brushes but it was a great deal</li>
            <li> I bought these make up brushes because mine were getting old and I needed a good deal. I have purchased Shany products in the past and loved them so I figured I would give these a try. The powder brushes are really small compared to my bareminerals brushes so I don&#x27;t use those very often, but I do use pretty much all of the eye shadow brushes and love them. If your looking for a good deal buy these!     I gave them four stars instead of five for the fact that the powder brushes are on the small side and the case smelled like spray paint when I first got it for about a week. I let it air out for a few days and it ended up going away but it was pretty bad at first. Overall I would recommend these brushes if you want decent quality brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a good value for what you pay.  They are not high end brushes, but they do a good job.  The case does have a very strong odor which transfers to the brushes, but a good airing out does the trick.  A previous reviewer does a great job on describing the kind of brushes you get in the kit.  The eye brushes are a bit on the smaller side.  I was hoping for a fluffy blending brush, but alas, it was not included.  There are many smaller liner type brushes.  So far they have held up well, a little fall out with the first uses of them.  If you want several brushes that get the job done decently without paying an arm and a leg, then this kit is for you.</li>
            <li> My daughter asked for make up brushes for Christmas and all I heard after she opened them was how fancy she felt.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and very soft!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE them!❤️</li>
            <li> Comes with a box and its wrapped with plastic wrap looks super new can&#x27;t wait till my girlfriend sees this with the rest of her gifts she&#x27;ll love this</li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality, but I wish i would have realized that they are basically 3 different types of brushes, just in different sizes. So you have an angled brush, a flat shader brush and a flat top brush in like 4 different sizes. Kinda lame, but oh well. You can never have too many angled brushes, really. Just wish there was more of a variety. Next time I will look at the pictures more closely.</li>
            <li> I would definitely reccommend this product to anyone who is a regular makeup user. I shop at Sephora for most all of my make up, and these brushes go well with anything! They are super soft, and do not shed a ton. The only down side is them not being labeled but they are very versatile so it is not that big of an issue in the long run! Thanks SHANY!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product, its a great starter kit for a makeup enthusiast. All the brushes you need in a variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> These bristles are plastic, not natural. (The way to test this, is by lighting one with a match. Natural bristles will burn like your eyebrows or your hair. Plastic melts into a glob. You can also try this on any other fabric or rug fringe. )&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really expect to get 40 natural hair brushes for $40, and it still is a good value – even for plastic. But they should be truthful.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brushes f.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the bad reviews. They are a very good deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All brushes arrived intact and  as always Amazon shipping wast ultra fast and reliable.</li>
            <li> Great price for high quality material. Everything arrived in tact, clean and the case protects the brush shape nicely. The only downfall is I am not a makeup professional and this is a professional set, therefore there is no &amp;#34;map&amp;#34; telling me which brush is for what. So if anything, they&#x27;re too good for me! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very happy with these brushes. I heard a lot of complaints about smell and powder falling out, but I didn&#x27;t have any of that. My concern was with the brushes themself. They&#x27;re either too stiff or too flimsy and very difficult to control when applying the makeup.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Amazing price and quality! Undoubtedly one of the best brushes I&#x27;ve tried ever!!!</li>
            <li> the wife and daughter love these brushes got it for them for xmas and they both went nuts for it</li>
            <li> OMG this is the best brush set EVER! :D The brushes are so soft and pick up the makeup GREAT. But another thing is that the pouch in not really leather. But aside from that the brushes are great and worth the money :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful! They pick up shadows well, they come in a nice case (as said, there is a chemical smell in the case, just leave it outside or in the rain for a couple days and it should be fine-take brushes out before) There are so many! I often have the trouble of trying to find a clean brush, but not anymore! There are so many brushes that I can use a new clean one everyday! I just clean them on the weekends. There are many similiar brushes which I don&#x27;t mind because I like the shape becuase it can be used for so many things. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that there is no fluffy round brush. There is a round brush that is kind of pencil shaped, but its hard and pokey. I also wish that the chemical smell wasn&#x27;t there and the brushes didn&#x27;t have to sit in the case and absorb the smell. These brushes are extremely soft! I love them very much. They are not pro brushes or anything, but they are wonderful and a great set for beginners!</li>
            <li> These brushes are an orangish-gold color...NOT BLACK like the picture shows. They do not have a concealer brush,angled blush brush or a thin eyeliner brush. The smell was horrible. I am willing to try these brushes out but so far I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I am greatly disappointed in the brushes I purchased.  They are NOT the same as the picture and they are way too soft to hold any make up. The eyeshadow brushes are duplicated in different sizes. Aside from that, the packaging was good, that&#x27;s all. If you want a 32pc. brush set get this one&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its $31.99, but it is way better in quality and it qualifies for free shipping. I will not buy brushes from Shany ever again.</li>
            <li> I bought two sets for gifts. The girls loved them.</li>
            <li> I recieved this set 1 day earlier than expected! For the price, you cannot be unhappy with this. I&#x27;d probably pay easily $50 for this kit. It did smell a wee bit, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the fake leather case that the brushes came in. It&#x27;s not over powering and I&#x27;m not really sure why anyone would complain about this. I&#x27;m not a make-up artist, so as a normal person I think the quality of the brushes is great and I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, and she loves it. The brushes are soft and managable. She says that she will not use any other brushed from now on.</li>
            <li> Great deal. The brushes are made well. I have not had any problems with them sheading or a strange smell as others have posted. But i will say the &amp;#34;eye shadow&amp;#34;brushes are a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of these brushes as they are very soft and have not shed at all.  The leather case is very nice as well.  Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> nice set ,states all natural bristles but actually most are synthetic (plastic) does not say that in description but does on SHANY website</li>
            <li> I purchased these for myself almost two years ago.  They were very soft and luxurious feeling.  Unfortunately after about a week the handles came apart, but I glued them back together no big deal.  The pouch had a strong odor but went away after some time.  I didn&#x27;t use all of the brushes some were very similar to others.  I would have been happy to continue using these but when my car was stolen (they were inside) I had to replace them.  I opted to get [[ASIN:B005IHSBJM Shany Pro Studio Quality ZGF Premium Goat Hair Brush Set with Wooden Handle and Golden Pouch]] because the issue I had with the handles coming apart.  I just received them today and have not used them yet, but the gold pouch didn&#x27;t have the strong odor that the black pouch has.  I gave each brush a tug to see if the handles were loose and they were secure.  They are much better quality!  Spend the extra $15 bucks.  I can&#x27;t wait until I use them.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I got the brushes and for very little money I use them on daily basis and till today they haven&#x27;t disappointed me</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes a few months ago and have had pretty good luck with them so far.  I have read some other reviews stating that the brushes don&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; the make up and I would have to agree with that when working with pressed powder blushes or foundations they do seem to have a hard time.  Only the larger brushes though, the smaller ones do not seem to have this problem.  The large brushes do do well with loose powders though.  The brushes are indeed very soft, and so far have been holding up very well after washing them a few times.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bristles falling out yet, but only time will tell.  The case is indeed cheap vinyl instead of leather, but it does it&#x27;s job of keeping the brushes together and clean.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived on time and were as described.  These brushes are FANTASTIC!  I got these and couldn&#x27;t believe how great they are.  They are natural hair, and hold the make excellently. These work as well or better than a set I have that I paid more for.  I am very impressed with they quality of these brushes,  I recommend them to anyone.  I use brushes for applying my makeup, and find this brush set the be excellent. If you want to try brushes fro makeup application this is an excellent set too try.  I plan to order a couple more for gifts for my daughters. Linda W</li>
            <li> These brushes are another great product from Shany.  I love to have an abundance of brushes, so when I can find a set of brushes with quality such as these for such an amazing price, I snatch them up!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is the biggest professional, great quality brush set you will get at this price. You get a huge variety of many, many brushes to get any job done whether you are a makeup artist or a beginner! I highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li> Quality brushes at  reasonable price. Perfect for any make up need,Love the black leather pouch it comes with. Love all the different sized brushes they are so soft !</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! so pretty all black and the case is black also! black goes with everything! So many brushes to use! and the price is so unbeatable! You just have to buy them!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Packaged nice. No fall out when I washed them. Extremely soft!! (:</li>
            <li> Really nice soft brushes glad I got them :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on November 29, 2014. Size: 32 Count and paid the price for 32 count. Today I received order received only 22 count.. Even the product description states 32 count.&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed!! I am returning my the product...</li>
            <li> Super soft, Work like perfection! Love them. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I love this set.  It just arrived today and I am very excited about using it. I will post an update later.</li>
            <li> Best brushes everrrrrrre</li>
            <li> Bought it for my fiance&#x27; (shes a make up artist ) for valentines day as apart of her gifts and i gave her one gift early which happen to be this one she opened it an used all the brushes right away she absolutely loved it and there all perfect and soft an professional such a great buy</li>
            <li> LOTS of brushes for the money and long handles like I prefer. Brushes relatively soft, except for brow brush. Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for those who know what they are doing and have experiences using make up brushes but for those who aren&#x27;t professionals it would be nice if each brush was labelled with what type of brush it is.</li>
            <li> What a great set of brushes for the money! This comes with a number of brushes, but for those who are interested, I&#x27;ll tell you what DOESN&#x27;T actually come in this set: ANY kind of small- or medium-sized thick fluffy brushes. I&#x27;ve needed to add a concealer brush (MAC - #286 Duo Fibre Blending Brush--THE BEST if you have acne and want a flawless or near-flawless face) and a fluffy round brush for my eyes (any round fully brush will do). Otherwise, this set is a great one for all levels!</li>
            <li> It was time for me to get a new brush set. So I shopped around and looked at the makeup counters, Ulta, Sephora, all the usual places. Then I decided to try Amazon and see what they had to offer. That&#x27;s where I found these brushes. I couldn&#x27;t believe I could get 32 brushes for such a good price. They appeared to be good quality, so I decided to go for it. I&#x27;m so glad I did! I LOVE my new Shany brushes. They feel great, apply great Nd wash great. I&#x27;m not sure that I really need all 32 brushes, but it just encourages me to play around with my makeup a little more.</li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly and I was immediately delighted with the brushes.  I am not a professional make up person, but I think the brushes are very soft, shaped well and firm when needed.  They come in a huge variety of styles/shapes.  These brushes are far better than expensive brushes I have purchased one at a time.  The blush brushes have not left one speck of bristle on my face and I love them!</li>
            <li> Love love love my brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought this set a month ago and I could say they were pretty good. The hairs on the brushes are soft and the material of the handles are good and not cheap. I paid around $20 for 32pc which is super good !</li>
            <li> the type of brushes my sister and I use is MAC. when I read the reviews I was excited to buy this. but when I got it this was nothing like that brand. the first one I used it broke from the tip. they look somewhat cheap and do not hold a lot of product within the brush. I noticed almost all the brushes are for eyeshadow. if you want face brushes this is not a good buy. comparing to MAC I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again. if you are used to drug store brands this would be good for you because you get a lot more for way less the price...packaging its really cute great for a gift if you want...</li>
            <li> The brushes are are soft and feel firm.  The Brushes smelled at first but the smell went away.  There are a variety of brushes for different makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for people who uses make up regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived earlier than delivery date.</li>
            <li> This set is really nice, you get a lot of brushes and the texture is very soft. I use it every day and have no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> This brush set is great and I find it shed little to nothing. These brushes are amazing quality and would be great for some one who is just starting with makeup and don&#x27;t have a lot to spend on brushes. This also an amazing brush set to get someone for the holiday or birthday. Or if your trying to grow your makeup brush collection. I totally recommend this to anyone, and I hope this review will help someone.</li>
            <li> Wow. There is a slight smell, but the quality is sooo good. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> Bought this on a deal of the day so got a really good price but $20 is still totally worth it.  Love the case it comes in too.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> brushes are very soft &amp; work very well. no hairs fall out, easy to clean...&lt;br /&gt;love this product &amp; would definitely purchase more</li>
            <li> I love my new brush set! Each brush came individually wrapped. All were clean and brand new. Yes, I understand that it is expected that they are new, but I did read some reviews were people said theirs appeared dirty and used. I did not experience this and I would recommend this set to anyone looking for a full line of brushes. Oh, and the carrying case is awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used most of the brushes and they feel soft. Some of the hairs are coming out but that always happens the first time you use them. I hope they dont continue to fall. The only thing I miss is a blender brush. I have one but I would of preffered to have at least one more.</li>
            <li> I have a VERY, VERY SENSITIVE skin.  Bought a set of Sephora brushes but still not soft enough and lot more expensive than these brushes.  These brushes are really soft and so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The brush set arrived at my house unbelievably fast. The product is in excellent condition. Very soft bristles. I have not used the brushes extensively, but they appear to be of excellent quality, especially considering the price. Thankfully, the set comes with a guide describing the uses of the individual brushes, which are all numbered clearly. There was a strong scent as described by some of the other reviews that I had read. It might be bothersome if you have a sensitive nose. I believe that it will fade with time and overall, the product is pleasing despite it. The leather case is lovely as well. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really LOVE these brushes!!! For the price that I paid, I honestly can NOT complain! I did a lot of research and read MANY, MANY reviews on all types and brands of brushes before finally deciding on the SHANY set. I am SO satisfied with my purchase. This is my first time ever purchasing any type of SHANY product too. I read some negative feedback about their being a strong odor??? To me, it just smelled like a new product that was wrapped in the plastic. The product itself did not smell and once I took all of the carefully individually wrapped plastic and paper off, there was no odor at all. And NO...I did not have to even wash my brushes. I have yet to find any loose brush hairs...they simply do NOT fall out. The brush hair is very soft and lovely! I was very grateful for the colorful guide that came with, which recommends what each brush can be used for. Also the brushes are numbered, so this is handy...I know what my top favorite &amp;#34;numbered&amp;#34; brushes I use regularly. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I&#x27;m sure somewhere out there, there is &amp;#34;a perfect brush set.&amp;#34; I would desire a hard case, maybe? However, the roll-up pouch is so convenient....especially for travel. Anyway...I would definitely order this set immediately....you will not be sorry. You will thank me! THANK YOU SHANY!!!!</li>
            <li> Cheap product but the price should speak for itself</li>
            <li> Leather pouch is really nice.  One of the brushes fell apart two days after I received product.  I do not feel that the brushes pick up pigment especially well, and have found that I use the eyeshadow sponge the most because of it.  The eyelash comb came damaged.  Since the set is not that expensive, I think it is a good set to pick up for a teenage girl, as a first set of brushes.  It would be a good gift for such use, but really not something I would recommend for a hardcore makeup person.</li>
            <li> Returning not the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> these were amazing brushes i couldn&#x27;t have gone wrong they apply makeup very well! and they don&#x27;t shed hair! the heads have never gotten looses or called off i can&#x27;t believe the quality of them  its amazing and only $17!</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft, and the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out of them like my other cheap brushes. Love the variety, just need to figure out what they are all for!!</li>
            <li> You get every single brush you would need to start out in this kit. It is great for beginners and experts a like. I love the colors, as well.</li>
            <li> the brushes work great with any makeup. they are so soft yet very sturdy and come with an awesome little case that you can fit anywhere it&#x27;s a win win</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. I had a friend recommend them to me and I&#x27;m glad i listened. they are amazingly soft and i have had no problem with bristles falling out since washing them. they work very well and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great.  I am learning how to how the brushes and what each brush does for a flawless makeup application. They are quality brushes for the money.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty good quality; great really, for the price.  They are soft on the skin and apply product well.  I only had one brush lose quite a few fibers when I ran my finger over it, and a quick crimp with a needle nosed plier fixed it.  I didn&#x27;t contact the seller about it because it&#x27;s not one of the brushes I will use regularly. I also don&#x27;t care if my brushes have crimp marks.  Some people complained about a chemical smell when opening the brushes.  I am pretty sure it&#x27;s the case they come in and not the brushes themselves.  Please, ALWAYS properly wash and dry your new brushes before using them.  I&#x27;d recommend these for personal and hobby use, but they wouldn&#x27;t cut it professionally.  However, take that with a grain of salt; it is simply my opinion!</li>
            <li> These brushes are good for the price, they are soft and apply make up well.  Although, I wish there were more different brushes.</li>
            <li> They are okay if u wana explore brushes and play around these are the ones u shud get. The only prob is the duplication in brushes with minimal difference!</li>
            <li> I bought these because recently I have made an effort to learn more about makeup and it&#x27;s correct application.  I was hoping with 32 brushes that have virtually everything I need to recreate the looks I saw in videos, etc.  Since buying these I have had to buy 3 brushes for my eyes, one for under eye concealer, and one for liquid foundation.  While I don&#x27;t doubt some of these brushes could have been used to some capacity instead of the ones I purchased in addition to this set, I was expecting to have at least the basics of what I needed for a face of makeup.  Where is the fluffy blending brush for eyeshadow?  I only use about 5 of the brushes that came in the set.  I also agree with other reviewers who have said the eyeshadow brushes are not very good at picking up product.  If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this set.  I would have hand picked my brushes from different manufactureres such as Sigma, Coastal Scents, and Sephora - they cost more money, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li> Loved them!! They are awesome! Loved the holding case too! Worth every cent. The bristles on the brush are very soft and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> My girl loved them. Always uses them.. great buy for the price no lie. 32 pieces in the kit. The bag looks leather but its not authentic .. but the brushes work. They do not come use, some other reviews said they felt like the brushes werent brand new. But they are..</li>
            <li> Compared to all the other make up brush sets i bought in the past 13 years, not only are these way more durable and the brissels don&#x27;t fall out, fray, or become course after a few months like all the others. They are super soft you get 32 brushes for the cost of buying a set of 10. You cant beat this price and they give you every brush that you could possibly need (except a foundation brush) and it comes with a real nice roll up brush caddy too unlike many other brush sets.</li>
            <li> Theyre really soft and they work good!</li>
            <li> my granddaughter will love this xmas gift.</li>
            <li> this brush set is amazing..the only thing is i ordered the 32 piece and got the 24 piece..but it is a great brush set</li>
            <li> I bought it for a gift, and she loved it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just so-so. I knew by the price that they wouldn&#x27;t be my favorites but there are about 3 brushes that I use regularly and like. This made it an okay buy.</li>
            <li> It was ok. I wish the quality was better</li>
            <li> Great brushes! If you are wanting to get a lot of good quality brushes for good price this is great. I will say for those who are looking for a stippling type brush, contour brush or the typical fluffy eye shadow brush to blend, blend, blend.... it&#x27;s not in this kit. However many others are.</li>
            <li> What a great, inexpensive set!  I washed all the brushes before I used them and didn&#x27;t lose any hair.  High quality product and carrying case!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an aspiring makeup artist (in my head of course) and I love these brushes. I threw out the carrying case because I had no need for it (I stand my brushes up in a container). I love that the brushes are soft and there are so many different sizes! I just wish there was one or two really firm brushes for blending foundation. Other than that, I have no complaints. I really enjoyed replacing my old crappy brushes with a set that is so much nicer.</li>
            <li> The face brushes are great, but the eyeshadow bristles have the consistency of a foundation brush bristles, so they won&#x27;t work for blending.</li>
            <li> Ive had these brushes for a few weeks now using them about everyday if not every other day. And let me begin by saying that I bought these brushes to replace the inexpensive walmart brushes I have been using for close to a year now and honestly im not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this particular set bc I thought it had a big variety but it didn&#x27;t provide the two brushes I was in serious need of. I wanted a new foundation brush and a new blending brush. In this brush kit a \\&quot;blending\\&quot; brush does come in the kit but in my opinion its way too stiff/not fluffy enough to do what its suppose to. A lot of reviewers said that they wish this kit came w/a list of what each brush is and it does! At this point im not even bothering using the brushes for their \\&quot;intended\\&quot; use im using them however I fancy. By this I mean using lip brushes as eyeshadow brushes, eyebrow brushes as eyeliner brushes, eyeliner brushes as lip brushes and so on. If ur an individual looking for a variety of eyeliner,lip, and powder brushes this is for u. But if ur looking for eyeshadow brushes specifically, this is not it. As for me like iv said I only these for the eyeliner brushes and lip brushes anything for eyeshadow I stick to my walmart brushes since they are better. But I will admit the face brushes are good, I only use the angled brush though for contouring. The other brushes aren&#x27;t big/fluffy enough for my liking but they do get the job done. Hope I helped</li>
            <li> for the price these are, its and AMAZING set! it comes with so many varieties and i can do so much with these!</li>
            <li> I am in the process of enlarging my makeup collection, so i wanted to get a rather large brush set. When I saw the price I thought these were gonna be some off the wagon brushes but these are very good quality brushes for such a low price</li>
            <li> This is a really good set for the price.  The brushes are really soft, the only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t include much eye brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy for all of you closet makeup artist! Brushes are study and wash well. Received super fast.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes!</li>
            <li> They feel so soft and nice, great value, all the brushes you need! I recommend getting these brushes they are really good and i love this set!</li>
            <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;these are a great brush set&lt;br /&gt;32 brushes to be exact.&lt;br /&gt;and it is great that it came from shany super professional</li>
            <li> i got my product yesterday and was extremely happy with it. they were all wrapped individually and all the brushes where neatly packed in the case.They are all super soft and i didnt have any of the bristles fall out after i did a test pull. it smelled a little funny when i opened up the box but it didn&#x27;t really stick to the brushes. it was kind of just a new smell. the only thing i wish was that they labeled the brushes or stuck a paper in them saying what kind each one was. over all tho i am super excited to use them and was happy with what i got.</li>
            <li> These are a steal at the price.  I was a bit worried about them, but they arrived in the usual Amazon (prime) way - 2 days after I ordered them.  There is a scent to them, but I took them out of the plastic bag and opened up the pouch to let them air out. I would also suggest washing them before using them to get rid of some of that factory smell.  Overall these are wonderful brushes at a great price with a lot of variety.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I found no stray bristles as well as no wobbly handles. The only complaint I really have is that some of the brushes that are meant for the crease should be a little fluffier. But, other than that, it&#x27;s a nice set- especially for those that are new to using makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> these are so soft and I love using them. they came in a nice package and there was a scent when you first opened them but that is to be expected just wash them and they will be fine</li>
            <li> The brushes were okay. they werent great.&lt;br /&gt;its bristles are too hard. not like the MAC ones.&lt;br /&gt;so you would have to keep pressuring them for eye shadow</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves them, she told me the other day that she washed the brushes and they look like new, so the quality is great!</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product! The brushes came packaged in its own plastic cover and I didn&#x27;t have a smell like some over did! But overall a very good set!</li>
            <li> I got these brushes for my 18 year old step daughter and she was overjoyed.  Nice variety and even though they don&#x27;t tell you what each brushes use is, its easy enough to look it up on line.  So far the brushes have held together very nicely, the bristles have stayed in place and it looks nice to boot.  It has my very picky makeup obesessed teenager&#x27;s seal of approval :)</li>
            <li> I purchased the 32 brush set for my daughter for Christmas and was amazed by the quality! The brushes are long, sturdy and the hairs are fine and precisely cut for perfection. The brushes are individually wrapped in a nice pouch and come in a very nice Shany Box...the pouch is perfect for travel. So PROFESSIONAL! After she opened her present of brushes and I saw them for the first time and was so impressed I ordered the smaller 18 Brush Set for myself and I am so satisfied. I LOVE IT! You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> so many brushes for the price. they look and feel so nice. the pouch is great for travelling and taking on jobs. some of the brushes are similar, but it&#x27;s good for freelancing so you don&#x27;t have to clean off the same brush multiple times.</li>
            <li> Wow! What great brushes! I was really impressed with the product especially considering the price. I ordered from Gemini and received great customer service and super fast shipping! I would recommend washing these brushes before use (just like every other brushes you may buy) and take care of them! These brushes were soft and very fun to use! Keep in mind the price when you buy them! You can&#x27;t expect to seriously buy these and compare them with something like that $90 Marc Jacobs brush :P But I guarantee you will be impressed with the price!</li>
            <li> Purchased these for myself, hoping to learn more about different brushes and improve my brush techniques.  The supplied pamphlet was less than useful in identifying the correct brushes by number, for example: what was clearly a shadow sponge tool was identified as an angled shadow brush.  The fan brushes I received arrived with their bristles displaced which I had hoped a dampening with water might fix.  No such luck - my small fan brush has been renamed Ms. Pac-man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, bristle quality seems to be decent.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding bristles with daily use or after washing.  I assume the bristles are dyed, and I have not noticed leeching dye after washing.  The vinyl carrying case works fine, albeit unpleasant smelling for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the brushes are fine if you&#x27;re looking for a more expansive set of reasonably priced brushes.  You get what you pay for, in this case.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great quality. Very soft and definitally worth your money, and the cute leather pouch makes it so much easier to organize your brushes from biggest to smallest</li>
            <li> Great product, except for the initial smell.  No problems with the delivery either :)</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I figured I&#x27;d get a little bit more thoughtful about how I apply my makeup. While the brush hair itself is great and soft, the metal pieces that attach them to the handle are kind of loose on some of them. I had one of the heads come off. Otherwise a great variety</li>
            <li> She loves the brush set and goes well with the Shany muli product kit that she received as a gift.</li>
            <li> Ok...what can you expect for 20 bucks. Decent brushes.  But the case is not leather...it&#x27;s plastic. The brushes are ok... like I said. ...20 bucks. The larger brushes look cheap. All in all not disappointed.  I am ok with it all in all for the price. Not sure how it can be natural bristles AND cruelty free. ....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say. The brushes aren&#x27;t strong enough, they fall apart, the fur would stay in your chick/eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how a professional make-up artist would ever be happy with these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;No, I would never recommend this product at all!</li>
            <li> Delivery fast and the quality of the brushes was worth the money. His is a nice set and I have tried many makeup brushes. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Has every type of brush I could ever want as a theater major. Can&#x27;t wait to see them in action.</li>
            <li> I purchased this online because I really needed more brushes but wasnt trying to pay an outragoeus amount for them like MAC. They got here in just a few days and they are SSSOOOOO SOFT!!! Easy to use with no shedding. I love these!!</li>
            <li> They are terrible. 3 of the brushes are shedding, the eye brushes are stiff, I recommend going elsewhere if you&#x27;re looking for a good set.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft. They feel great on skin. So many brushes that you will not need any other brushes. Love the leather roll also. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes. They&#x27;re all very soft and works so well. The softness of the brush helps blend make up well. It came in a nicely packed box. The leather bag made the brushes smell a little but it&#x27;s not that bad I don&#x27;t mind it as long as the brushes does its job I&#x27;m happy. I also bought one for my sister and she loved it. Recommend.</li>
            <li> My mother has not complained! Great.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 16 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She went nuts over it!</li>
            <li> I love how the brushes are number and it comes with a sheet that describes the brush and what it may be used for!</li>
            <li> Amazon and Shany should be embarrassed at the crappy quality of these brushes! My 7 year old got a toy make up set with brushes just like these! I can&#x27;t imagine anyone giving these brushes more than 1 star which makes me question who has written all those 5 star ratings. Shany actually has the nerve to describe some of the brushes as &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; when they&#x27;re all stick hard! bhcosmetics.com has brushes for less money which I did buy and have been very pleased. They are beautiful, honestly fluffy and a mix of natural and synthetic fiber brushes which makes the kit I bought perfect. The same money and much better product. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on these Shany poor quality brushes. Only good thing is Amazon did pay for the return shipping so in the end I was only out the time it took to get the brushes and to send them back. Wish there was a negative or 1/2 star rating ... I don&#x27;t think these even deserve 1 star.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed with this brush set, as it contains little in the variety  of brushes. While you get eye, lip, and  face brushes, many of the eye brushes are different sizes of the same brush. You do not get a blending brush are a good brush for all over application. Also, there is not a tapered crease brush included. I do really like the very thin eyeliner brushes and the fan brushes. This is a good brush set for general makeup application, but those of us who want to do more specialized looks with our makeup buy individual brushes might be a better option.</li>
            <li> Good brushes. Not the best I&#x27;ve had. Took off the packaging, tried to use lip brush and the brush part came right off. Worth the money? Personally, I think not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the item</li>
            <li> very good quality, im makeup artist i can tell you these are good for details on your eyes lips and nose but is a little poor for face..</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes I can&#x27;t put concealer on it. But it i still use them on me and friends</li>
            <li> When this product arrived I was furious, I opened my door to find a RIPPED OPEN BOX. The box itself was very simple, seemed like not too much effort was needed to just tear through it. Thats what ticked me off the most, the only reason I kept this opened up garbage is because it was a gift for my sister who&#x27;s birthday was the next day and I didn&#x27;t find any missing pieces.</li>
            <li> I received this set as a birthday present. I am a beginner makeup lover and have been wanting a full set of brushes for sometime now. I like the set, but there is no list of what each brush is supposed to do. For a novice like myself, that is not a good thing. I opened the leather pouch to a full set of brushes, many of which looked like they do the same thing. It would be nice if there was a guide on each brush was and its purpose. Not only so makeup babies can feel like they know what they are doing, but also to make sure you got what you paid for. It&#x27;s just okay, but I will be looking for another set as I get more advanced with my makeup skills. Not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> i was told it a great product they loved it. it arrived on time packaging was very good will shop again</li>
            <li> Really nice, soft brushes. Actually way more brushes than the average person needs and there were a couple I could have used that weren&#x27;t here (contouring brush). Thought overall quality was very good. Product arrived on time. Did not smell to me.</li>
            <li> My wife loves them u get all different kind of brushes</li>
            <li> Best brushes in the world. Thank you so much. Now I want a pink set.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes look the exact same. And the booklets description of each brush is vague. But good quality overall.</li>
            <li> I love my new makeup brush they&#x27;re just perfect for eveyone</li>
            <li> Such a good deal. Alot of people say they shed like crazy, but I don&#x27;t have that problem! I&#x27;ve seen light shedding, not as much as I&#x27;ve seen with my MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> bought this for my friend for christmas and she absolutely loved it! she said the quality was good so i might get this for myself!</li>
            <li> all the brushes do is fall apart for the price it was okay but not a good product</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected. The brushes are gorgeous. The quality is amazing and the price was spectacular. I expected a mediocre quality set for the price I paid but am pleasantly surprised at how well the brush set is made. The leather carry case is soft and flexible. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how nice these brushes are! The box it came in was nice, and the rollup case is sweet! I couldnt believe how  many brushes came with this, and the pamphlet that explains how to use each one is useful too.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and are perfect.  I use them daily and they&#x27;re holding up very well, the fit in my hand perfectly.</li>
            <li> ALL SHANY COSMETICS BRUSHES ARE GREAT IN QUALITY!! THEY ARE BETTER THAN SOME HIGH END BRUSHES!! I HAVE SO MANY MAKEUP BRUSH SETS FROM THIS COMPANY AND THEY ARE ALL GREAT!!</li>
            <li> Another great set of Shany professional brush set! 32 brush I don&#x27;t even know what to do with 32 brushes lol!</li>
            <li> There are so many great things about these brushes! I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to hurry to clean one if I switch colors there are just so many different ones that I can use and it gets the job done that&#x27;s the most important part!</li>
            <li> Loved this product, would definitely buy Shany products again. came in just as described. my only problem was that i wish it&#x27;ll come with something with the brushes name and uses written for us inexperienced make up \\&quot;artist\\&quot;. However, this set is awesome, you get what you pay for. SUPER SOFT brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these i got em today they&#x27;re so soft!! The package smelled a little funny...but i still love these brush. I wish there was a paper that had their names on them.</li>
            <li> some brushes broke within a couple of days, its not a leather pouch but pleather, i could have gotten better brushes at walmart for this price</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001JKTTVQ SHANY Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch, Set of 12 Brushes and 1 Pouch, Red]]  I actually have the Shany super professional 32  brush set - but could not find that particular link.  Anyway I like these Shany brushes very much, they are super soft as described.  I had one problem so far - the black sponge tip kept falling off brush #7 - so I took a pair of pliers and crimped the tube. That seems to have worked.  I gave the product a 5 star anyway.</li>
