    <ol>
            <li>This is the best system out there.</li>
            <li>For the price and effectiveness, it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Iuse this 3-4 times a week on my oil, acne prone skin, and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I adore this mask - it does a wonderful job cleaning out my pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and am seriously impressed.</li>
            <li>Best of luck!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Great!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy to report I did not experience that at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that great...</li>
            <li>I love that it was the perfect balance:</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Very refreshing.</li>
            <li>this wonderful, reasonably priced mask is fully packed with good stuff for your skin.</li>
            <li>The whiteheads on my chin are the most stubborn hateful bumps I&#x27;ve ever had in my life!</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply a good, hydrating moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>When a product works this quickly &amp; effectively on areas that nothing else has touched, it&#x27;s something I can recommend to others.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t heard of activated charcoal for pore cleansing...</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy this again :)</li>
            <li>It is cruelty-free and has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY others over the years.</li>
            <li>id not make my skin any clearer, maybe it will work better for you.  </li>
            <li>I used this mask 2 days ago &amp; the places on my forehead are better today than yesterday.</li>
            <li>but Ive tried just about everything on these areas &amp; this hands down is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The product has a pleasant, natural scent to it.</li>
            <li>fantastic as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>This is another great product in the Giovanni facial care line.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel amazingly smooth and clean without drying.</li>
            <li>face does feel significantly cleaner after using this product.</li>
            <li>Upon application the mask provides with pleasantly tingling sensation, relaxing your facial muscles and stripping your skin of all the gunk.</li>
            <li>But I love the whole system.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in a travel set since I wanted to try before buying full size.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference right away with my skin.</li>
            <li>Leave on for 20 min and wipe off gently with cool water.</li>
            <li>I try to avoid the more dry parts of my face when I use it, as they tend to be more sensitive to masks.</li>
            <li>Consistently works perfectly with my difficult skin.</li>
            <li>I was a bid reluctant to buy it at first, however after reading the ingredients I was blown away.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can not say as for the long term results, but it does its job very well, and given that the price is so good - this little tube has become a must in my book!</li>
            <li>It hardened and I removed it, and my skin was soft, yet clean.</li>
            <li>Used it for 20 min as instructed and it caused an allergic reaction that is pretty much like a chemical burn on my face.</li>
            <li>My face is left feeling clean and fresh after use of this mask.</li>
            <li>Granted I have nothing to compare it to, but it has left my skin baby smooth every time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>Worse than I ever experienced...</li>
            <li>Skin was a little dry, but disappeance of my red blotches made me very happy.</li>
            <li>I have harsh red easily irritated skin on my face, and after one use my face looked even with my normal skin color.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend their step 3 facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li>My skin has behaving for the last year or so after a treatment of accutane but then several stressful things happened in my life and my skin completely broke out.</li>
            <li>I picked it up at Marshall&#x27;s a few months ago, and the first time I used it, I felt the tingling and the coolness others have spoken of.</li>

            <li> Very simple, no strange bad smells and its very easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with huge pores and I was sad to see this didn&#x27;t help fix it</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, this mask keeps working long after its removed.</li>
            <li> If you have troubled skin this product is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and all, and I have seen a slight difference even though I&#x27;ve only used it once.</li>
            <li> My face is extremely read and puffy.</li>
            <li> I have large pores, several whiteheads and a couple blackheads that I&#x27;ve found impossible to get rid of...</li>
            <li> It is not as messy as the much hailed (and twice as expensive)</li>
            <li> I noticed slight improvement to the blackheads on my nose as well.</li>
            <li> I can definitely say it doesn&#x27;t make my skin produce less oil or do anything for my acne or whiteheads, but it also doesn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably keep using it just because it&#x27;s vegetarian, but if I didn&#x27;t care about things like that, Proactiv&#x27;s Refining Mask does make your skin less oily, at least for about two days</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have terrible skin.</li>
            <li> Hardly any abrasive material in it.  </li>
            <li> I use the mask so I can at least be *</li>
            <li> Before I put anything on my face, I research and found nothing negative.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to mislead because my skin isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> I have awful skin, and nothing helps it--but the caveat is that it&#x27;s hormone- and medication-induced acne and nothing any product can cure.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love this mask. Granted I have nothing to compare it to, but it has left my skin baby smooth every time I&#x27;ve used it. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with huge pores and I was sad to see this didn&#x27;t help fix it but it never claimed to.&lt;br /&gt;My face does feel significantly cleaner after using this product. Some of the reviews mentioned some itching sensations but I&#x27;m happy to report I did not experience that at all. I will probably buy this again :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give an individual review for this product because I&#x27;ve used it in conjunction with the cleanser &amp; moisturizer for about 10 days. But I love the whole system. This mask doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and all, and I have seen a slight difference even though I&#x27;ve only used it once. This is the best system out there.</li>
            <li> gets the &#x27;bacteria&amp;#34; out!!!</li>
            <li> This product works.  It is not as messy as the much hailed (and twice as expensive) Mario B. Silver Powder. It is cruelty-free and has a lovely scent. I saw results after one use, but I use it as a spot treatment now on my forehead and problem areas that flare up.  I love that it was the perfect balance: not so drying I wanted to scratch my skin off my face, but still cleared my acne, even the several blemishes that had been lurking just under the surface for weeks. For the price and effectiveness, it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Consistently works perfectly with my difficult skin. I have tried MANY others over the years. I&#x27;m never without some of this in my home.&lt;br /&gt;Also fantastic as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> This is another great product in the Giovanni facial care line. You simply apply the mask, wait 20 minutes, then rinse off. The product has a pleasant, natural scent to it. My face is left feeling clean and fresh after use of this mask. I noticed slight improvement to the blackheads on my nose as well. Be sure to apply a good, hydrating moisturizer afterwards. I highly recommend their step 3 facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This mask has worked wonders on my face. I picked it up at Marshall&#x27;s a few months ago, and the first time I used it, I felt the tingling and the coolness others have spoken of. It hardened and I removed it, and my skin was soft, yet clean. Iuse this 3-4 times a week on my oil, acne prone skin, and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I adore this mask - it does a wonderful job cleaning out my pores. I get visible blackheads on my nose and they&#x27;re 100% gone when I use this. I try to avoid the more dry parts of my face when I use it, as they tend to be more sensitive to masks.</li>
            <li> Too drying for me. I prefer Origins Charcoal mask 100%.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have terrible skin. I have been on everything from prescription medications and creams to homeopathic. My skin has behaving for the last year or so after a treatment of accutane but then several stressful things happened in my life and my skin completely broke out. I tried this mask and was blown away! Leave it on for 20 minutes and rinse off. Very simple, no strange bad smells and its very easy to rinse off. I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and am seriously impressed. If you have troubled skin this product is definitely worth a try! Best of luck!</li>
            <li> this wonderful, reasonably priced mask is fully packed with good stuff for your skin. I was a bid reluctant to buy it at first, however after reading the ingredients I was blown away. Upon application the mask provides with pleasantly tingling sensation, relaxing your facial muscles and stripping your skin of all the gunk. Honestly, I can not say as for the long term results, but it does its job very well, and given that the price is so good - this little tube has become a must in my book! Try it, I promise, you will not regret!</li>
            <li> I bought this mask only because it was vegetarian, not because I thought it would actually do what it claims. I have awful skin, and nothing helps it--but the caveat is that it&#x27;s hormone- and medication-induced acne and nothing any product can cure. I use the mask so I can at least be *trying*. I can definitely say it doesn&#x27;t make my skin produce less oil or do anything for my acne or whiteheads, but it also doesn&#x27;t make it worse. I&#x27;ll probably keep using it just because it&#x27;s vegetarian, but if I didn&#x27;t care about things like that, Proactiv&#x27;s Refining Mask does make your skin less oily, at least for about two days (I had to use it every three days for it to keep working).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that great...it id not make my skin any clearer, maybe it will work better for you.  Good luck</li>
            <li> Did not like it.  Hardly any abrasive material in it.  Did not like smell.</li>
            <li> Cleans deep into the pores.  Makes skin feel amazingly smooth and clean without drying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in a travel set since I wanted to try before buying full size. I&#x27;ve been battling hormonal acne for quite awhile now... Worse than I ever experienced... Even during puberty! I have large pores, several whiteheads and a couple blackheads that I&#x27;ve found impossible to get rid of... I&#x27;ve only used this mask fully twice. I&#x27;ve used as spot treatments once... But that&#x27;s enough to say this mask truly works. The whiteheads on my chin are the most stubborn hateful bumps I&#x27;ve ever had in my life! It&#x27;s slower going with these but I can already see improvement so I&#x27;m hopeful they will disappear soon. I don&#x27;t want to mislead because my skin isn&#x27;t that bad but Ive tried just about everything on these areas &amp; this hands down is the best I&#x27;ve used. When a product works this quickly &amp; effectively on areas that nothing else has touched, it&#x27;s something I can recommend to others. Oh yeah, this mask keeps working long after its removed. I used this mask 2 days ago &amp; the places on my forehead are better today than yesterday. Honestly, I can&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t heard of activated charcoal for pore cleansing... It&#x27;s Great!</li>
            <li> Did not like. Returned</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a local store. Before I put anything on my face, I research and found nothing negative. Used it for 20 min as instructed and it caused an allergic reaction that is pretty much like a chemical burn on my face. My face is extremely read and puffy. Caused blisters on my cheeks. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference right away with my skin. I have harsh red easily irritated skin on my face, and after one use my face looked even with my normal skin color. Leave on for 20 min and wipe off gently with cool water. Very refreshing. Skin was a little dry, but disappeance of my red blotches made me very happy.</li>
