            <li>It is very rich and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>It has a mild pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t make me smell \\&quot;like</li>
            <li>Within a couple days they looked healthy again.  </li>
            <li>Not any more.  </li>
            <li>I love how it is not so greasy</li>
            <li>There is nothing better.</li>
            <li>I love the cuticle mousse.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have any more hangnails and my nails aren&#x27;t growing ridges anymore.</li>
            <li>I have used the Amera Cuticle Mousse for several years and it is the best I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>Love this cuticle cream.</li>
            <li>As soon as I am out, I order more.</li>
            <li>Does great things for the cuticle, keeping them soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>Far superior to any brand out there .</li>
            <li>Using it twice a day is best, but even if you only use it once, you will see a really big difference!    </li>
            <li>It is well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>my cuticle are soft and easy to deal with after using this product.</li>
            <li>It really helps your cuticles and makes your hands feel so much better overall.    </li>
            <li>It really softens your cuticles and keeps them moist.  </li>
            <li>You really need to buy this product.  </li>

            <li>It really helps to thicken my nails.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My cuticles started looking beautiful in just a few days of using this product and like the other reviewers said it is not greasy at all</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to wait for anything to dry before doing things and that is a huge benefit.</li>
            <li>Seems to have less lanolin and more water.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous for moisturizing chapped, dry cuticles and strengthening my nails.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>And my cuticles were super dry.</li>
            <li>My nails definitely grow faster and cuticles so much softer.  </li>
            <li>The price on amazon is exactly the same as horn I buy it at a distributing center where I live.</li>
            <li>It sinks right in and makes a huge difference - a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>If you use this mousse at least once daily (twice is better)</li>

            <li> disappointed that it is not as good as it could be.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a tiny bit on each finger, so it lasts a really long time!!!  </li>
            <li> My cuticles are always dry and cracked, especially during the winter.  </li>
            <li> a nurse wash my hands all day long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my cuticles had become so dry they would bleed.  </li>
            <li> and you will notice a difference in the dry cuticle.  </li>
            <li> My skin and cuticles have always been very dry</li>
            <li> and I have wasted lost of money on other products but always come back to this.</li>
            <li> one being my boss and the other, a doctor.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of cuticle mousse, but none can compare with this product!  </li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday since Christmas</li>
            <li> Keeps my dry and previous broken nails tips and cuticles moist.</li>
            <li> It fixes the problem after a few applications, for me, usually at bed time.  </li>
            <li> No more dryness.  </li>
            <li> After a week of use I could hardly believe the difference.  </li>
            <li> No more hand nails!</li>
            <li> If only I would use it all the time, not just when my hands get bad.  </li>
            <li> Her cuticles were really bad.  </li>
            <li> Every once in awhile I&#x27;ll try another brand and am always disappointed.</li>

            <li> my cuticle are soft and easy to deal with after using this product. I&#x27;ve told all who will listen about it.</li>
            <li> I am a residential contractor that uses my hands in my trade.  My cuticles are always dry and cracked, especially during the winter.  I have used Amera&#x27;s cuticle mousse for years, it is great!  It fixes the problem after a few applications, for me, usually at bed time.  If only I would use it all the time, not just when my hands get bad.  It has a mild pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t make me smell \\&quot;like I&#x27;ve been using my wife&#x27;s perfumy lotion.\\&quot;  Not greasy either.    Thanks Amera for a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage Daughter.  Her cuticles were really bad.  Within a couple days they looked healthy again.  I was very impressed and recommend this product to everyone.  I use it at night before I go to bed and it makes my cuticles feel sooo good.</li>
            <li> This is the GREATEST stuff!  I have tried other brands of cuticle mousse, but none can compare with this product!  It really softens your cuticles and keeps them moist.  Using it twice a day is best, but even if you only use it once, you will see a really big difference!    I am a nurse wash my hands all day long. We were at a conference and during a break, I started putting it on my cuticles. So, the \\&quot;girls\\&quot; wanted to try it--one being my boss and the other, a doctor.  Everyone at the table tried it and they loved it. I know the doctor and my boss bought some, just because of this one product try.    I have one for home and one for work.  It really helps your cuticles and makes your hands feel so much better overall.    You really need to buy this product.  You only have to use a tiny bit on each finger, so it lasts a really long time!!!  Great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my cuticles had become so dry they would bleed.  I seemed to continually pick at them.  Not any more.  After a week of use I could hardly believe the difference.  No more dryness.  It was like I had a week of spa treatments.  This product is a real keeper.</li>
            <li> Amera Cuticle Mousse is the best cream ever.  I love how it is not so greasy it leaves marks on all the papers you touch.  There is nothing better.</li>
            <li> Not as good a product as it was a year or so ago when I bought the last jar.  Seems to have less lanolin and more water.  Still a good product but disappointed that it is not as good as it could be.</li>
            <li> I love it! No more hand nails! Very good stuff. It is well worth the cost.  Amera keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> I love the cuticle mousse. I have been using it everyday since Christmas and I don&#x27;t have any more hangnails and my nails aren&#x27;t growing ridges anymore. I have recommended this product to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> When I use Amera Mousse every day I can not only see a visible difference in my cuticles, but also in my nails.  It really helps to thicken my nails.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 20 years. Far superior to any brand out there . I highly recommend it. Wish it was a Prime item.</li>
            <li> This is the best cuticle cream I have ever had and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them. It sinks right in and makes a huge difference - a little goes a long way! My cuticles started looking beautiful in just a few days of using this product and like the other reviewers said it is not greasy at all so I don&#x27;t have to wait for anything to dry before doing things and that is a huge benefit. You will LOVE it, guaranteed! Will be buying more of them so that I don&#x27;t run out of it!</li>
            <li> Big fan, always have been.  Nothing else works as well.</li>
            <li> Have used this cuticle mousse for over 30 years.  Even one application and you will notice a difference in the dry cuticle.  100% recommended.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for moisturizing chapped, dry cuticles and strengthening my nails.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Does great things for the cuticle, keeping them soft and pliable. Definitely recommend its use.</li>
            <li> This cuticle cream is really amazing! Best I&#x27;ve ever used! And my cuticles were super dry. But must be used regularly.</li>
            <li> I have used the Amera Cuticle Mousse for several years and it is the best I have ever found.  My skin and cuticles have always been very dry and I have wasted lost of money on other products but always come back to this.</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle cream. Keeps my dry and previous broken nails tips and cuticles moist.</li>
            <li> I have used Amera mousse for years. Every once in awhile I&#x27;ll try another brand and am always disappointed. If you use this mousse at least once daily (twice is better) you will definitely notice softer cuticles and stringer longer nails. Best to use before putting on hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Been using it for over 10 years and I wouldn&#x27;t live without it. Thank you Amera cuticle mousse.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. It is the only thing I have ever found to heal cuticles. As soon as I am out, I order more.</li>
            <li> This is the best cuticle mousse I have ever used. It is very rich and absorbs nicely. The price on amazon is exactly the same as horn I buy it at a distributing center where I live. My nails definitely grow faster and cuticles so much softer.  Have used this for years.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!!</li>
