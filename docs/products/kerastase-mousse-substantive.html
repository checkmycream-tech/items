    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best mousse I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best mousse out there!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product, it controls frezee hair and it provides volume.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly conditioning and makes your hair do whatever you want, with no stiffness or oiliness.</li>
            <li>Now, I still use hairspray on rainy or humid days, but not to the extent that I used to have to in order to have a good hair day!  </li>
            <li>It works great  for me.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It gives great hold</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and does add volume.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>amazing body, softness and shine.</li>
            <li>This is a very fine product that I used to buy at an upscale salon.</li>
            <li>first can did not work and it was happily replaced</li>
            <li>Just love this product.  </li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this product to me, and when she used it in my hair it seemed to work magic.</li>
            <li>as most hair style products even some others  of  Kerastase</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need to use sticky hairspray to hold my hair in shape (most days).  </li>
            <li>I truly love this product.  </li>
            <li>but it does more than anything I have tried.</li>
            <li>Also, I can use it for many days in a row.</li>
            <li>I get many compliment on my hair since i start using this product and will not use anything else.</li>
            <li>The product is the best hair product I have used in a long time.  </li>
            <li>This mouse is great for fine hair in the summer time when the humidity is high.  </li>
            <li>but unfortunately, my fine hair has no body after using this product.</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference in the end result of my hair after using.  </li>
            <li>This mousse is fabulous.</li>
            <li>At home, on my own - I didn&#x27;t quite get the results she did, but it still worked reasonably well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shampoo, conditioner and mousse work together to leave my hair incredibly smooth and well behaved.  </li>
            <li>While I like a great bargain like the next person, sometimes you get what you pay for when it comes to hair products.  </li>
            <li>It also has a light, pleasant scent that my husband likes (too), without being perfume-y, or strong enough to be an issue with my working in a hospital (where you cannot &amp;#34;wear scents‚Äù).</li>
            <li>Great product, no not use more than a golf ball size ..a little goes a long way,, great for my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Hair mousse is such a great styling tool concept but somehow the makers of mousse, I have found, never seem to hit the mark just right.  </li>
            <li>My Tresemme or John Frieda mousse worked better and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It holds well and allows for adequate styling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use on towel dried hair.  </li>
            <li>It is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>, however I do not think it is worth the money, as curls do not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li>Less Frizz and more healthy looking.</li>
            <li>But, for fine hair or short styles needing a light touch with some hold</li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>It is light but but gives a nice hold and texture without being too stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li>I am 43 and have baby fine, natural (not colored) shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li>most likely will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>It was, as is the tendency with gray hair, more coarse, tended to frizz, and just wanted to lay on my head and look tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>apply this mousse to my roots first and then any leftover product through the ends.  </li>
            <li>I am able manually to place it back on every time I use it</li>
            <li>My new hairstylist recommended this product and I found that everything she said is true.  </li>
            <li>Clean light scent will not combat your other products.</li>
            <li>My hair looks gorgeous and shiny and is silky soft, and this stuff keeps working past that brief novelty/honeymoon period you see with so many products.</li>
            <li>I have tried mousse products that are all over the pricing spectrum, and as a result ended up with a cabinet full of such products- many of which are half full.  </li>
            <li>It is said that Mousse is the secret weapon to great hair.</li>
            <li>Gentle for my color treated hair, gives volume to my finer textured hair, and provides hold</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>but that is a real pain.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t for that much for my hair</li>
            <li>It does give good lift to my roots and helps my ends old the bend I put in them with my round brush.</li>
            <li>A big price for nothing special.</li>
            <li>very light but provides enough for a short &amp;#34;bob&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>I want to write a longer review when I have a little more time.</li>
            <li>Works great on long thick hair.</li>
            <li>It adds a bit of volume and control without weighing my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>First off nothing was in english to explain how to use it</li>
            <li>No small feat.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so a can of this can last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s  soft consistency.</li>
            <li>cheaper\\&quot; offers listed on the Prime page.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, because the seller is so far away, I choose to do nothing about the situation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light yet gives you volume with a heavy feeling to my hair.</li>
            <li>It feels like clean not greasy  or heavy</li>
            <li>While many conditioners left me with something that seemed as soft as \\&quot;gerbil hair\\&quot;, and equally as fluffy, these products left it soft yet manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have -very curly hair-short on sides and long on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One last important note, it does last a long time despite the smaller can.</li>
            <li>I find that you are somewhat more expensive than the salon, but I really needed this product.</li>
            <li>I was on DepoProvera for several years, and as a result, my body went into menopause early at age 33.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that folks check out the \\&quot;see other offers....</li>
            <li>This product adds long lasting volume and body to my mature</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product adds long lasting volume and body to my mature</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good buy, even though it is very expensive!</li>
            <li> I have coarse, dry, long hair.</li>
            <li> The only issue was that my gray hair did not have the same \\&quot;substance\\&quot; as my previously colored hair.  </li>
            <li> I towel dry my hair, put a dab about the size of a quarter into my hand, then rub hands together and then distribute to the hair.  </li>
            <li> I add it to my hair while still damp, and then let it dry before styling.</li>
            <li> Now, I can embrace mousse again and take styling back down to one step.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this through Amazon from \\&quot;Stacey Leininger\\&quot;, and even having paid postage, my final cost was almost $15.00 LESS than the cost offered on Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I color my hair, therefore very very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I already had naturally fine hair (Scottish heritage) and adding to it a textural change made getting volume and bounce virtually impossible.</li>
            <li> I prefer not to put too much product on my hair, which is delicate and reacts badly (breaking) to dimethicone, so I only use it when it&#x27;s very humid to prevent it from going completely limp and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, but does the job.</li>
            <li> When you pressed down to release the foam, the release mechanism broke.  </li>
            <li> I find that during the winter months it is a little drying to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s now a little runny when it comes out of the can and not as firm or moussey.  </li>
            <li> I used it it dried my hair out</li>
            <li> but  it doesn&#x27;t leaves hair  sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> I just discovered this product, have used it everyday for a few weeks, and it&#x27;s solved a lifetime&#x27;s problems with my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> ALSO, while this was offered through \\&quot;PRIME\\&quot; it was MUCH LESS expensive through a different seller.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, heavy hair, you are not going to get away with this because it has the hold of a mousse, which is lighter.  </li>
            <li> so use it in small quantity</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> This is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this affects how it works, but it does drip on my bathroom counter which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I have never loved my hair as it always frizzes or falls.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when it arrived this time it was defective.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment that I can&#x27;t get it out of the can.</li>

            <li> Just love this product.  I towel dry my hair, put a dab about the size of a quarter into my hand, then rub hands together and then distribute to the hair.  I color my hair, therefore very very dry hair.  This product keeps my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference in the end result of my hair after using.  Less Frizz and more healthy looking.</li>
            <li> First off nothing was in english to explain how to use it&lt;br /&gt;When I used it it dried my hair out no I would not recommend it</li>
            <li> This mousse is fabulous. I have never loved my hair as it always frizzes or falls. This mousse provied structure and smoothness without adding any weight. It is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was on DepoProvera for several years, and as a result, my body went into menopause early at age 33. As a result, my hair texture drastically changed, making most hair products useless to me. I already had naturally fine hair (Scottish heritage) and adding to it a textural change made getting volume and bounce virtually impossible. Keratase-Mousse Substantive was my saving grace. I use it every time I wash my hair, whither I do a blow-out or curl it. I add it to my hair while still damp, and then let it dry before styling. It also has a light, pleasant scent that my husband likes (too), without being perfume-y, or strong enough to be an issue with my working in a hospital (where you cannot &amp;#34;wear scents‚Äù).</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product to me, and when she used it in my hair it seemed to work magic. At home, on my own - I didn&#x27;t quite get the results she did, but it still worked reasonably well.&lt;br /&gt;I did not find this product to be sticky, have a funky smell, or leave my hair stiff.&lt;br /&gt;I most likely will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> It works great  for me. I like it&#x27;s  soft consistency. It makes styling  easier  . It feels like clean not greasy  or heavy as most hair style products even some others  of  Kerastase&lt;br /&gt;It gives great hold but  it doesn&#x27;t leaves hair  sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> A big price for nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have -very curly hair-short on sides and long on top.&lt;br /&gt;My first can did not work and it was happily replaced, however I do not think it is worth the money, as curls do not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product adds long lasting volume and body to my mature hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this products to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, but does the job.</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and someone recommended this product to me.  It did not disappoint. It is everything a mousse should be and has never been up until this point.  It is light but but gives a nice hold and texture without being too stiff or sticky.  Plus, it adds shine galore!!  Hair mousse is such a great styling tool concept but somehow the makers of mousse, I have found, never seem to hit the mark just right.  I stopped using it years ago and started mixing a frizz product with a bit of gel to get the effect I wanted.  Now, I can embrace mousse again and take styling back down to one step.  It is still a mousse, though.  If you have thick, heavy hair, you are not going to get away with this because it has the hold of a mousse, which is lighter.  But, for fine hair or short styles needing a light touch with some hold but no stiffness, order now.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product several years ago by my hairdresser.  After years of covering up my gray hair, I decided to wear it as a badge of honor.  The only issue was that my gray hair did not have the same \\&quot;substance\\&quot; as my previously colored hair.  It was, as is the tendency with gray hair, more coarse, tended to frizz, and just wanted to lay on my head and look tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While quite pricey, the Kerastase Age Premium line was the answer to my problems. The shampoo, conditioner and mousse work together to leave my hair incredibly smooth and well behaved.  While many conditioners left me with something that seemed as soft as \\&quot;gerbil hair\\&quot;, and equally as fluffy, these products left it soft yet manageable.  ALSO, while this was offered through \\&quot;PRIME\\&quot; it was MUCH LESS expensive through a different seller. I highly recommend that folks check out the \\&quot;see other offers....may be cheaper\\&quot; offers listed on the Prime page.  I purchased this through Amazon from \\&quot;Stacey Leininger\\&quot;, and even having paid postage, my final cost was almost $15.00 LESS than the cost offered on Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this mousse to my roots first and then any leftover product through the ends.  It does give good lift to my roots and helps my ends old the bend I put in them with my round brush. A little goes a long way, so a can of this can last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard, but not verified, that this product is being discontinued by L&#x27;Oreal. If that is indeed the case, I will be building up my stockpile.</li>
            <li> This is a very fine product that I used to buy at an upscale salon. I find that you are somewhat more expensive than the salon, but I really needed this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this but unfortunately, my fine hair has no body after using this product. My Tresemme or John Frieda mousse worked better and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I want to write a longer review when I have a little more time. I just discovered this product, have used it everyday for a few weeks, and it&#x27;s solved a lifetime&#x27;s problems with my hair. Incredibly conditioning and makes your hair do whatever you want, with no stiffness or oiliness. My hair looks gorgeous and shiny and is silky soft, and this stuff keeps working past that brief novelty/honeymoon period you see with so many products. Please buy it, so they keep making it!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d get a lot of volume with this product but it made my hair &amp;#34; fall&amp;#34; instead...  Kinda blah... The shine however makes up for the lack of fullness.</li>
            <li> It is said that Mousse is the secret weapon to great hair. This is the best mousse I have ever used. It does not make my hair crunchy or sticky at all. It does make my hair feel silky while giving it shape. No small feat. I have coarse, dry, long hair.</li>
            <li> While I like a great bargain like the next person, sometimes you get what you pay for when it comes to hair products.  I have tried mousse products that are all over the pricing spectrum, and as a result ended up with a cabinet full of such products- many of which are half full.  So, along comes this mousse that fulfilled my wish list:  Gentle for my color treated hair, gives volume to my finer textured hair, and provides hold so I don&#x27;t need to use sticky hairspray to hold my hair in shape (most days).  Now, I still use hairspray on rainy or humid days, but not to the extent that I used to have to in order to have a good hair day!  One last important note, it does last a long time despite the smaller can.</li>
            <li> This mouse is great for fine hair in the summer time when the humidity is high.  I find that during the winter months it is a little drying to my hair.  Overall, it is a good buy, even though it is very expensive!</li>
            <li> This is my second can and both do not work.  The product is the best hair product I have used in a long time.  What a disappointment that I can&#x27;t get it out of the can.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It&#x27;s great to use on towel dried hair.  It holds well and allows for adequate styling.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and does add volume.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and don&#x27;t use it everyday so there is still some left.  I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s now a little runny when it comes out of the can and not as firm or moussey.  I can&#x27;t really tell if this affects how it works, but it does drip on my bathroom counter which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I truly love this product.  Unfortunately, when it arrived this time it was defective. When you pressed down to release the foam, the release mechanism broke.  I am able manually to place it back on every time I use it but that is a real pain. Frankly, because the seller is so far away, I choose to do nothing about the situation.  I think in the future, I will only order in the United States.</li>
            <li> My new hairstylist recommended this product and I found that everything she said is true.  It&#x27;s light yet gives you volume with a heavy feeling to my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t for that much for my hair but it does more than anything I have tried. It adds a bit of volume and control without weighing my fine hair down. Also, I can use it for many days in a row.</li>
            <li> very light but provides enough for a short &amp;#34;bob&amp;#34; hair do.  over priced in the market. so use it in small quantity</li>
            <li> Best mousse out there! Works great on long thick hair. Clean light scent will not combat your other products.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not drying.</li>
            <li> Great product, no not use more than a golf ball size ..a little goes a long way,, great for my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable. I am 43 and have baby fine, natural (not colored) shoulder-length hair. All the mousses I had tried prior to this stripped my hair of shine and made it crunchy. This is unbelievable. I prefer not to put too much product on my hair, which is delicate and reacts badly (breaking) to dimethicone, so I only use it when it&#x27;s very humid to prevent it from going completely limp and frizzy. amazing body, softness and shine.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, it controls frezee hair and it provides volume.  I get many compliment on my hair since i start using this product and will not use anything else.</li>
