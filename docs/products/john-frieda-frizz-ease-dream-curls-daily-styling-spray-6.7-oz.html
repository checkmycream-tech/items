    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I find just spraying evenly througout my hair and scrunching a bit before diffusing is the best method.</li>
            <li>John Frieda discontinued Spiral Style Gel which was the best product I&#x27;ve ever found for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>And my husband loves it and says my hair smells great all the time!</li>
            <li>This product is great as a refresher for your curls when they start to fall..</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>I have had the hardest time finding a good hair product for my curls and have been using this for some time now.</li>
            <li>have a good day.</li>
            <li>I can curl my hair with my friggin finger better than with this product!</li>
            <li>but otherwise, I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this spray!</li>
            <li>Frizz-Ease makes the curls so easy and looks great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product for naturally curly or wavy hair, but it&#x27;s not the best product to keep frizz away.</li>
            <li>My hair is kind of sticky and the curls don&#x27;t hold up in the lightest breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its the best one of it&#x27;s kind of I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, just spray spray spray and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to produce beautiful curls, and it also passes the frizz test.  </li>
            <li>It does a very good job of re-invigorating the curls after I&#x27;d slept on them, and my hair is as soft as can be.  </li>
            <li>I am sure this is made for straight-haired girls like most of his products.</li>
            <li>Ever since I stopped being able to buy Loreal Pumping Curls spray in the stores</li>
            <li>I love having this on hand to use in the morning when I wake up and</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had great results for a week straight.  </li>
            <li>I use herbal essences hair spray:)</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this spray gel.</li>
            <li>I really love this styling spray.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product that I can&#x27;t find locally.</li>
            <li>At first, my hair would look great for the first 2 hours after diffusing, then it would lose its curl and straighten out</li>
            <li>While this one is not as good as my old favorite</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t the best product to completely smooth down frizz, though it does somewhat help.</li>
            <li>I take a shower at night, apply some leave-in conditioner and then lightly spritz my hair with Dream Curls, lightly scrunching as directed, and then go to bed.  </li>
            <li>but for use to initially get them to curl, not so great...</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get the best results from Dream Curls, I wait to use this till I am ready to dry my hair(I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but that is huge!  </li>
            <li>With the right product my hair can have an awesome messy bedhead look or a defined sleek curl or somewhere in between.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing to make my hair look better.  </li>
            <li>first thing I have to say is that while Dream Curls promises a non crunchy finish I have to strongly disagree.</li>
            <li>This may be due to how my hair works, so dont hold me to it, but in order for me to have almost frizz free, defined and gorgeous curls</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that is fine rather than course, and it tends to frizz very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product works great to revive limp curls, without the accompanying frizz.</li>
            <li>What it is good at doing is helping to maintain the spiral curls and waves I get, when I step out of the shower, for the whole entire day.</li>
            <li>Works good for second day curls for those of us with hair that dries out too much if you wash it every day.  </li>
            <li>serum(the one with the heat protectant) and Garnier Fructis Style Pure Clean Smoothing Cream.</li>
            <li>A few more light spritzes in the morning with light scrunching</li>
            <li>But when I did this new method, my hair has SO much volume and curls!!!</li>
            <li>Ihave also tried using this spray on towel dried hair with no other products and combed through to distribute evenly (like the instructions state) but did not have very good results.</li>
            <li>I have to put up with a bit of a crunch for the first day.</li>
            <li>Works really well for that too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many over the counter products that all seemed to work the same.</li>
            <li>and it comes out even better weirdly enough!</li>
            <li>In fact, I notice much more volume if I concentrate first on the top/sides of my head and save the bottom for last.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way my hair actually gets softer as is dries (instead of stiffer like with gels) and still holds the curls!  </li>
            <li>I use it pretty much every day that I don&#x27;t straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much, because it can make your hair crunchy, like using a gel.  </li>
            <li>It really tightens up my curls into ringlets.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also much cheaper on Amazon than it is at Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li>thanks for the package</li>
            <li>thanks so much for the order.</li>
            <li>This product did not make my fine hair fall flat.  </li>
            <li>I say curly and wavy because it can be extremely curly but also can be more relaxed in places.</li>
            <li>My head is full of curls the next morning.  </li>
            <li>Before Dream Curls, I would have had a head full of frizz and my hair would have ended up put into a bun in a last ditch effort to control it.  </li>
            <li>I find that the less I pay attention to scrunching while defusing, the better off</li>
            <li>Before the Dream Curls I was using just the two with decent results just not as defined and springy.</li>
            <li>I use about 5 sprays for my fine hair and comb through with a wide tooth comb.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair looking very natural, like you didn&#x27;t do a thing to it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t the first use, second use...or 50th use.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard or sticky like so many hairsprays seem to do.</li>
            <li>I have went back to my old mousse and just keep this handy throughout the day when they are starting to sag a little.</li>
            <li>Bought this last night, because in the humid weather my hair does curl up a bit but also gets very frizzy and fly-away.  </li>
            <li>Then I scrunch my hair with an old soft tshirt.  </li>
            <li>, that I began thinking my hair was completely unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought a new blow dryer which came with a diffuser attachment</li>
            <li>After I am done diffusing, I spritz a little more of the Jon Frieda dream curls spray to my hair and scrunch and twist a little more, add a little hair spray and voila!!</li>
            <li>dont use this when drying naturally because to me my curls do not look any different with it unless I use the diffuser).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this product a few different ways and have not yet found one that leaves me with a full head of non crunchy curls.</li>
            <li>but because i straighten less ;) )</li>
            <li>It does not make my hair hard or crunchy, it provides me with full movement.</li>
            <li>My hair is slightly less frizzy, but not by much.</li>
            <li>I have confused hair that is naturally fine and curly/wavy.  </li>
            <li>even if it loses a little volume, it&#x27;s still cute cause</li>
            <li>Because I have good curly hair days and bad, it takes me awhile to determine whether I like a product.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s actually less curly and voluminous than normal, and the frizz is still there.  </li>
            <li> my waves/curls are FLAT.</li>

            <li> Also, I diffuse my hair until it is DRY.</li>
            <li> After my shower I spray my hair, comb thru, scrunch curls and let dry!</li>
            <li> Before, I only did it half way</li>
            <li> so being new to a diffuser, I found it frustrating what I was left with a few hours later.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair slightly crunchy, but I wait until my hair is completely dry (since I don&#x27;t blow dry all the way with the diffuser)</li>
            <li> When my hair is wet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product on my dresser for a while now but never really got around to using it.</li>
            <li> I want to start out by saying I naturally have a combination of thick bushy S-shaped waves and spiral curls.</li>
            <li> (sparingly, too much of anything is not a good thing with my hair!)</li>
            <li> On 2nd days I usually don&#x27;t have to do anything</li>
            <li> so I still use a leave in conditioner and a little serum after washing my hair (but my hair is naturally dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying that I have fine,dry, frizzy, slightly longer than shoulder length curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Because of my hair type I hate washing my hair if I dont have to, so a hair product that doesnt leave alot of residue and keeps working till I break down and decide to wash it again is really important.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I finish with a little hairspray....</li>
            <li> This product is a little sticky but nothing like a mouse or hair spray.</li>
            <li> I like to spray it on and then take a towel to scrunch my hair to make the curls a little tighter.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding inexpensive products that work without making my hair gunky.  </li>
            <li> and I still have curls(which not many products can do)</li>
            <li> John Frieda sucks...</li>
            <li> this stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been out in humid muggy weather several times and not a hair frizzes.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and</li>
            <li> i used it with the other John Frieda products as directed but was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s not surprising).  </li>
            <li> I mean how else do you want it to work?!</li>
            <li> It merely takes away the frizz and defines the curl.</li>
            <li> Otherwise all my waves and curls fall flat and frizzed out and it just looks horrible.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been using it like crazy.</li>
            <li> If your like me, you have alot of bad hair days and products like this are the answer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> This spray is sticky and leaves hair in horrible condition.   </li>
    </ol>

            <li> John Frieda sucks...but for some reason I decided to purchase this around 6 months ago in hopes it would work. It didn&#x27;t the first use, second use...or 50th use. This spray is sticky and leaves hair in horrible condition.   Do NOT recommend this. I am sure this is made for straight-haired girls like most of his products. I have thick, wavy hair and this stuff sucks. I can curl my hair with my friggin finger better than with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying that I have fine,dry, frizzy, slightly longer than shoulder length curly/wavy hair. I say curly and wavy because it can be extremely curly but also can be more relaxed in places. With the right product my hair can have an awesome messy bedhead look or a defined sleek curl or somewhere in between. If your like me, you have alot of bad hair days and products like this are the answer. Ever since I stopped being able to buy Loreal Pumping Curls spray in the stores I about gave up on sprays that promise to give life to and define your curls. While this one is not as good as my old favorite it comes quite close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I have to say is that while Dream Curls promises a non crunchy finish I have to strongly disagree. I&#x27;ve tried this product a few different ways and have not yet found one that leaves me with a full head of non crunchy curls. This may be due to how my hair works, so dont hold me to it, but in order for me to have almost frizz free, defined and gorgeous curls I have to put up with a bit of a crunch for the first day. The 2nd,3rd and sometimes 4th day results are what make this product a winner for me. Because of my hair type I hate washing my hair if I dont have to, so a hair product that doesnt leave alot of residue and keeps working till I break down and decide to wash it again is really important. On 2nd days I usually don&#x27;t have to do anything and I still have curls(which not many products can do) and by now, the crunchiness is gone which is another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the best results from Dream Curls, I wait to use this till I am ready to dry my hair(I dont use this when drying naturally because to me my curls do not look any different with it unless I use the diffuser). When my hair is wet I use the Frizz Ease serum(the one with the heat protectant) and Garnier Fructis Style Pure Clean Smoothing Cream. Before the Dream Curls I was using just the two with decent results just not as defined and springy. Ihave also tried using this spray on towel dried hair with no other products and combed through to distribute evenly (like the instructions state) but did not have very good results. I find just spraying evenly througout my hair and scrunching a bit before diffusing is the best method.</li>
            <li> Bought this last night, because in the humid weather my hair does curl up a bit but also gets very frizzy and fly-away.  This did absolutely nothing to make my hair look better.  It&#x27;s actually less curly and voluminous than normal, and the frizz is still there.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly less frizzy, but not by much. It improved my curls for about an hour or two. I am of mixed race (to help you understand my type of hair).</li>
            <li> I love having this on hand to use in the morning when I wake up and my waves/curls are FLAT. I spritz this in and scrunch it up and it&#x27;s good to go. Also I like to spray this in to roughen up my hair before I put a curling iron to it. Works really well for that too!</li>
            <li> I want to start out by saying I naturally have a combination of thick bushy S-shaped waves and spiral curls.This product isn&#x27;t the best product to completely smooth down frizz, though it does somewhat help. What it is good at doing is helping to maintain the spiral curls and waves I get, when I step out of the shower, for the whole entire day. Otherwise all my waves and curls fall flat and frizzed out and it just looks horrible. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard or sticky like so many hairsprays seem to do. It&#x27;s a good product for naturally curly or wavy hair, but it&#x27;s not the best product to keep frizz away.</li>
            <li> I have confused hair that is naturally fine and curly/wavy.  I&#x27;ve tried many over the counter products that all seemed to work the same. Because I have good curly hair days and bad, it takes me awhile to determine whether I like a product.  Until I found this. I&#x27;ve used this product in combination with Loreal Everstyle Curl Creme and I&#x27;ve had great results for a week straight.  Doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but that is huge!  I use about 5 sprays for my fine hair and comb through with a wide tooth comb.  Then I scrunch my hair with an old soft tshirt.  After that, I apply my curl creme (sparingly, too much of anything is not a good thing with my hair!) and defuse on low/warm. I find that the less I pay attention to scrunching while defusing, the better off I am. Actually, sometimes I check my phone while blowdrying and it comes out even better weirdly enough! This product did not make my fine hair fall flat.  In fact, I notice much more volume if I concentrate first on the top/sides of my head and save the bottom for last.  It does make my hair slightly crunchy, but I wait until my hair is completely dry (since I don&#x27;t blow dry all the way with the diffuser) and I just scrunch out the crunch. The curls/waves stay.  Sometimes I finish with a little hairspray....but otherwise, I love it!  As a side note, I&#x27;ve tried the CVS knockoff as well and that works the same way...</li>
            <li> Love this product!  After my shower I spray my hair, comb thru, scrunch curls and let dry!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is fine rather than course, and it tends to frizz very quickly.  I&#x27;ve had trouble finding inexpensive products that work without making my hair gunky.  This product is a blessing.  I take a shower at night, apply some leave-in conditioner and then lightly spritz my hair with Dream Curls, lightly scrunching as directed, and then go to bed.  My head is full of curls the next morning.  I&#x27;d forgotten my hair was that curly - I was so used to just frizz, that I began thinking my hair was completely unmanageable.  A few more light spritzes in the morning with light scrunching and I&#x27;m good to go.  It does a very good job of re-invigorating the curls after I&#x27;d slept on them, and my hair is as soft as can be.  Just don&#x27;t use too much, because it can make your hair crunchy, like using a gel.  Also I&#x27;ve found that I have to wash my hair every day or it tends to not work quite as well.  It doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to produce beautiful curls, and it also passes the frizz test.  I&#x27;ve been out in humid muggy weather several times and not a hair frizzes. Before Dream Curls, I would have had a head full of frizz and my hair would have ended up put into a bun in a last ditch effort to control it.  I even still keep a rubberband with me \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; although I haven&#x27;t needed it for weeks - it&#x27;s GREAT! :)</li>
            <li> This product works great to revive limp curls, without the accompanying frizz.</li>
            <li> Frizz-Ease makes the curls so easy and looks great.</li>
            <li> This product is great as a refresher for your curls when they start to fall..but for use to initially get them to curl, not so great...i used it with the other John Frieda products as directed but was not impressed at all. I have went back to my old mousse and just keep this handy throughout the day when they are starting to sag a little.</li>
            <li> DREAM CURLS DEFINITELY IS FRIZZ-EASE WITHOUT STICKY,STIFF RESIDUE ON THE HAIR!</li>
            <li> John Frieda discontinued Spiral Style Gel which was the best product I&#x27;ve ever found for my curly hair. When I contacted them, they suggested Dream Curls, which I tried. It&#x27;s a real disappointment. My hair is kind of sticky and the curls don&#x27;t hold up in the lightest breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know where to go from here.... Sigh.</li>
            <li> Love this spray! I&#x27;ve been using this spray for about a month now and I love the way my hair actually gets softer as is dries (instead of stiffer like with gels) and still holds the curls!  I use it pretty much every day that I don&#x27;t straighten my hair.  Works good for second day curls for those of us with hair that dries out too much if you wash it every day.  My hair does tend to dry out if this is the ONLY product I use so I still use a leave in conditioner and a little serum after washing my hair (but my hair is naturally dry so that&#x27;s not surprising).  Overall, I would reccomend this product, its the best one of it&#x27;s kind of I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product on my dresser for a while now but never really got around to using it. I recently bought a new blow dryer which came with a diffuser attachment so I&#x27;ve been using it like crazy. At first, my hair would look great for the first 2 hours after diffusing, then it would lose its curl and straighten out and I&#x27;d just be left with wavy hair with a bunch of mouse and hair spray in it all day, ew! So this weekend I pulled out this stuff. BEFORE putting in my mouse, I spritz this in my hair and scrunch it in as if its mouse. Then I scrunch in my mouse and once I think there&#x27;s enough, I start to diffuse. Also, I diffuse my hair until it is DRY. Before, I only did it half way (that&#x27;s what a YouTube video told me to do....didn&#x27;t work!!) so being new to a diffuser, I found it frustrating what I was left with a few hours later. But when I did this new method, my hair has SO much volume and curls!!! After I am done diffusing, I spritz a little more of the Jon Frieda dream curls spray to my hair and scrunch and twist a little more, add a little hair spray and voila!! My hair stays curled all day long and even if it loses a little volume, it&#x27;s still cute cause they curls are still bouncy. I get so many compliments!! And my husband loves it and says my hair smells great all the time! I&#x27;m never turning back to my straightener!! My hairs gotten longer and thicker as well. (Not from the product but because i straighten less ;) )This product is a little sticky but nothing like a mouse or hair spray. I mean how else do you want it to work?! As for shampoo and conditioner I used Pantene repair. I also used the curly mouse and detangler from Pantene. I use herbal essences hair spray:) hope y&#x27;all like my review and method and definitely check out this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different spray gels, only to keep coming back to John Frieda Frizz Ease. LOVE LOVE LOVE this spray gel. And for the price, can&#x27;t beat it!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this styling spray. It really tightens up my curls into ringlets. It does not make my hair hard or crunchy, it provides me with full movement. It merely takes away the frizz and defines the curl. It leaves your hair looking very natural, like you didn&#x27;t do a thing to it. It is very easy to use, just spray spray spray and you&#x27;re done. I like to spray it on and then take a towel to scrunch my hair to make the curls a little tighter. I have had the hardest time finding a good hair product for my curls and have been using this for some time now. I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also much cheaper on Amazon than it is at Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li> thanks for the package it came on time i appreciate the order. thanks so much for the order. have a good day.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that I can&#x27;t find locally.</li>
