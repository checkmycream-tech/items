            <li>Opi has wonderful colors.</li>
            <li>Was in excellent condition when I received it - got to me on time.</li>

            <li>fingers and toes look very nice now.</li>
            <li>always a good polish.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m delighted with the product and use this color most of the time.</li>
            <li>Everyone loves their great colors and clever names!</li>

            <li>I really love the Opi line of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite brand of polish.</li>
            <li>Love the price.</li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>many seashells.&lt;br /&gt;OPI</li>
            <li>I like this color because it matches most of the clothes that I wear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love Opi.</li>
            <li>Put a top coat on.</li>
            <li>love this color of polish</li>
            <li>Color was a bit to light for what I was looking for - but an overall excellent product.  </li>
            <li>It is widely regarded as the best polish on the market.</li>
            <li>Great shade of pink.</li>
            <li>The color is a bit more pastel pink than I anticipated (I like shades that are a bit more nude), but all in all, it is a nice color that goes on easily and has a subtle silver shimmer to it in the right light.</li>
            <li>It came very fast</li>
            <li>Great consistency, easy to apply, professional finish and very long lasting.</li>
            <li>Fast!</li>
            <li>At first it was the catchy name that attracted me</li>
            <li>This is a good go-to color if you like a soft, luminescent pink color.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be more of a tan color, but it turned out pretty pink.</li>
            <li>I am a dark skin african American and this polish looks great on my nails!</li>
            <li>Although the price is a little steep the quality is amazing.  </li>
            <li>the color is a lot more pink looking on your nails than the bottle looks.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty summer color that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mature (old) and don&#x27;t want to make my hands a focal point.  </li>
            <li>I love this soft, almost neutral, pink with its little bit of luminescence.</li>
            <li>Really does remind me of the pink color inside</li>

            <li> Love the color. I am not a nail polish person but this does the trick for me.&lt;br /&gt;My fingers and toes look very nice now.</li>
            <li> I really love the Opi line of nail polish.  Although the price is a little steep the quality is amazing.  This is definitely my favorite brand of polish.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit more pastel pink than I anticipated (I like shades that are a bit more nude), but all in all, it is a nice color that goes on easily and has a subtle silver shimmer to it in the right light.</li>
            <li> I bought the OPI Suzi Sells Sushi by the Seashore nail polish. This is a pretty summer color that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Fast! Thank You! Would use you again. Love the price. Opi has wonderful colors. Lady a long time.  Love the product</li>
            <li> Color was a bit to light for what I was looking for - but an overall excellent product.  Was in excellent condition when I received it - got to me on time.</li>
            <li> I like this color a lot, but be warned- the color is a lot more pink looking on your nails than the bottle looks. I thought it would be more of a tan color, but it turned out pretty pink. It still looks great, though!</li>
            <li> At first it was the catchy name that attracted me but now I&#x27;m delighted with the product and use this color most of the time.</li>
            <li> Great shade of pink. Sort of a coral/pink. It seems to stay on my nails for several. days without chipping</li>
            <li> This is a good go-to color if you like a soft, luminescent pink color.  Really does remind me of the pink color inside many seashells.&lt;br /&gt;OPI always a good polish.</li>
            <li> I like this color because it matches most of the clothes that I wear.  I&#x27;m mature (old) and don&#x27;t want to make my hands a focal point.  This color does the trick for me - the well groomed look without the &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; of a youthful jolt...</li>
            <li> This color works well with my skin tone.  It is also an &amp;#34;all-season&amp;#34; color. I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and I always end up going back to OPI. Lasts longer than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> What can you say about OPI?  It is widely regarded as the best polish on the market. Everyone loves their great colors and clever names!</li>
            <li> I am a dark skin african American and this polish looks great on my nails! I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love this soft, almost neutral, pink with its little bit of luminescence. Works with anything, anytime, all the time.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, no longer in production.  It came very fast (I&#x27;m a Prime customer) and I will wear it all summer on my toes.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Opi. Great consistency, easy to apply, professional finish and very long lasting. Put a top coat on.</li>
            <li> love this color of polish</li>
            <li> This is my favoite Nail Polish - I hope you will not discontinue this color.  I hope you do not discontinue this color.</li>
