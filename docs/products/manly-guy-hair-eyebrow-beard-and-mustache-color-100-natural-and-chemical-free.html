            <li>And best of all...</li>
            <li>I LOOK GREAT!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Awesome, awesome product!</li>
            <li>ordered this product on the off chance and hoped for the best.</li>
            <li>and I will recommend this to everybody - very good.</li>
            <li>still looks great.</li>
            <li>I think this product is great</li>
            <li>so it was great.</li>
            <li>But it came out great.  </li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>will take some getting use to it, did try on head hair never worked as good however great product</li>
            <li>or if the manufacturer is disingenuous about side effects, but either way I&#x27;m a good case study on this product.  </li>
            <li>Good for people who have skin problems like myself.</li>
            <li>so I gave it a fair shot.</li>
            <li>You will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>Quick and good quality very good product , I like it</li>
            <li>lmao..</li>
            <li>Oh, and use a plastic spoon to mix the powder and warm tap water, as henna may tarnish a metal one.  </li>
            <li>Then I rinsed with warm water.  </li>
            <li>is by far the best coloring product I came</li>
            <li>Good stuff for chemical free.</li>
            <li>Nice and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>As they tell you right on the package, be patient with learning the best method to use to get consistent results for your hair.</li>
            <li>Which reminds me, I better change my review on that one too...</li>
            <li>but the solutions have not been able to rid the redish burgundy color from my hair .still</li>
            <li>Nothing at most.  </li>
            <li>I popped in a favorite movie to keep myself still</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that this stuff works very well.</li>
            <li>and I will be getting more when I run out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>, I may have much better luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my beard before using this product.</li>
            <li>hit across this product from Henna King at Amazon and the reviews and descriptions impressed me and was tempted to try, so I ordered one pack which got delivered on-time and not only changed my hair color , also i found the hope that there exists a product which works</li>
            <li>So far so good been 2 weeks and color still looks good</li>
            <li>followed the instructions , and also the special email instruction from Henna king , the very first application gave a good coverage.</li>
            <li>The best part is you can use it as often as is needed to maintain your hair color without having to worry about the chemical in other hair dyes are affecting your health.</li>
            <li>Easy, worked as stated, over 3 wks and color</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hands down the best product out there.&lt;br /&gt;THAN YOU</li>
            <li>I leave it in for 3 hours and it does the job just fine</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t fit you anymore</li>
            <li>And the smell is earthy and something that a good smelling natural hair oil can cure.  </li>
            <li>To get the desired result, make sure you follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Somehow I think it would be easier and more comfortable if the company spokesperson was more masculine.</li>
            <li>And if you use a bleach based product right after your done, clean up is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m now a true believer.  </li>
            <li>Every fifteen minutes I paused and went back to moisten my moustache and apply a slightly more watery leftover paste to my chin, both to add moisture and shift the bottom parts to the top.  </li>
            <li>I put on for only 1 1/2 hours and it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, I mix about 3 heaping tablespoons of henna with 1/2 a capful of vinegar (I use apple cider, but any vinegar will do) and just enough warm water to achieve a toothpaste-like consistency after stirring.</li>
            <li>I mixed with warm water to make a pancake like batter and added a touch of salt per directions.  </li>
            <li>I think it is worth that effort.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Manly Guy Darkest Brown and it worked pretty well, although it takes time and repeated applications.</li>
            <li>but now I get consistent results every time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it many ways and there is only 1 way to do this:</li>
            <li>I had to do 2 applications the first time around.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise on the first attempt of use</li>
            <li>Also I got an email from the supplier indicating if I was willing to change my feedback, they will send me a two-step process kit, since I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;stubborn&amp;#34; hair..</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the result as I believe a total coloring looks unnatural and women seem to like the salt and pepper</li>
            <li>This was my first time using it.  </li>
            <li>Might have to cut out a few hairs here and there, but it does a good job on the fill in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not some; it&#x27;s quite strong and it smells like algae and general rotting flora.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I used this 2x, I am still 90+% dark hair, this fills in nicely (goatee only).</li>
            <li>last but not least thanks for the Prompt,quick ,courteous responses from the Henna King team.</li>
            <li>I read in other reviews that some hair/grey is resistant and since mine is kind of course..</li>
            <li>, I slather on the henna paste nice and thick, like cake frosting, making sure the ends of my beard hairs are completely coated and immersed in it to make sure they get dyed properly.  </li>
            <li>apply the henna paste to your beard then wrap your face with a long piece of plastic wrap (like Cling/Saran/Reynolds wrap), making sure not to cover your nose</li>
            <li>I used the product again today and it seems to have covered the grey hair better.</li>
            <li>No doubt about it this product is not as easy as regular dye.  </li>
            <li>but most of the time it doesn&#x27;t work (like one out of 10 tries).</li>
            <li>Manly guy Have been very helpful when I call</li>
            <li>you want a free itchy and no next day burning effect on your face,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did stink, but that was expected and much better than chemical dye smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They warn some hair is prone to absorbing indigo, meaning you become Bluebeard the Pirate after using the product.  </li>
            <li>the manufacturer&#x27;s guidance on how much powder to use.  </li>
            <li>Too much work for a head of hair</li>
            <li>Very ineffective product didn&#x27;t work at all .</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need as much as the instructions say (2 Tbs) since I keep a shorter, modern beard</li>
            <li>This product really works and I thoroughly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It really does.  </li>
            <li>so the amount provided lasts a LONG time, which makes it a far better value than the \\&quot;Just for..\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>The results were almost immediate but sure enough, next morning it looked very natural and just as good, if not better, than the Just for...  </li>
            <li>When I used the product the first time, after a couple of days it seemed to fade quickly, I will see how long it stays on my hair this time.</li>
            <li>still few greys visible let tne stubble grow for another 4 days reapplied and got full coverage great product something that actually works and looks natural, only downside is the smell when applying and waiting for the dye to work</li>
            <li>Gravity will pull the paste down, so thicker paste will hold better.  </li>
            <li>I use it a decent bit after going away from just for men.</li>
            <li>Use the high end of the recommendation.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time coloring my beard and my only other coloring experience was many years ago for a costume with temporary hair color meant to wash out in a couple</li>
            <li>I think is kind of hard for a man to admit he colors his hair.</li>
            <li>The only con is that it can be a little bit itchy, but overall it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t deserve better and the planet is crying and</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last 3 years and it is useful tome.</li>
            <li>have a suggestion is to reduce the shipping charges or at least make it Eligible for the Amazon free super saver shipping over $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product is free of any chemical that all the other brands use in their mix.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Some people may not need to let it set for a while before application, some may need to add lemon juice or vinegar, some a pinch of salt, some only need 1 hour of application time, some need 2, etc., but you can definitely get the exact results you want if you&#x27;re willing to play around with it.</li>
            <li>This is completely natural and the hair color that it produces is also very natural.</li>
            <li>Originally brown now black.</li>
            <li>For context I should point out I have sensitive skin and a salt-and-pepper beard.  </li>
            <li>I brush the henna into my beard using an old Just For Men applicator brush</li>
            <li>After using this product, my hair looks natural and no skin rash at all.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the product it did not cover my grey hairs.</li>
            <li>It was all natural and it did not irritate the scalp.</li>
            <li>Very time consuming compared to regular dye.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to rank this product the best and recommend for those people who use chemical products.  </li>
            <li>I use one tablespoon or a bit less for a full face goatee.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a typical guy that writes reviews on anything. ...</li>
            <li>Tried 2 times but no black.</li>
            <li>Who wants to leave dye in for that long?</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d have to either deal with the significant grey OR on special occasions use a little black mascara</li>
            <li>but I think the clay saved me from some major redness.</li>
            <li>and I have no other choice.</li>
            <li>If you are a JustFMen refugee, then you about have no other choice.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product and despite positive reviews (on other colors)</li>
            <li>If they mean it would turn the color of hair rather than, O, say, a primary color, then it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that because my grays are really more white than gray, I need to leave the henna in for about 3 hours in order to get that truly dark, jet black color that will last for days.</li>
            <li>This product is such a huge inconvenience, it&#x27;s a huge sloppy mess, especially to rinse off</li>
            <li>I use an old &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; applicator brush to make sure all the hairs are well coated down to the root, then use the back of the plastic spoon to slather on the remaining paste thickly over my beard hairs.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my exact process that produces jet black, lasting results every time.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I have allegies to regular hair dye and did not want to have a full on gray beard until I at least turn 50</li>
            <li>and my  hands away from my face while the dye was turning my dark hairs blue and my light hairs green.  </li>
            <li>The Jet Black didn&#x27;t get absorbed well at all, rinsing out completely with little or no change to my color.</li>

            <li> Use the high end of the recommendation.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time coloring my beard and my only other coloring experience was many years ago for a costume with temporary hair color meant to wash out in a couple</li>
            <li> I think is kind of hard for a man to admit he colors his hair.</li>
            <li> The only con is that it can be a little bit itchy, but overall it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t deserve better and the planet is crying and</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 3 years and it is useful tome.</li>
            <li> have a suggestion is to reduce the shipping charges or at least make it Eligible for the Amazon free super saver shipping over $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is free of any chemical that all the other brands use in their mix.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Some people may not need to let it set for a while before application, some may need to add lemon juice or vinegar, some a pinch of salt, some only need 1 hour of application time, some need 2, etc., but you can definitely get the exact results you want if you&#x27;re willing to play around with it.</li>
            <li> This is completely natural and the hair color that it produces is also very natural.</li>
            <li> Originally brown now black.</li>
            <li> For context I should point out I have sensitive skin and a salt-and-pepper beard.  </li>
            <li> I brush the henna into my beard using an old Just For Men applicator brush</li>
            <li> After using this product, my hair looks natural and no skin rash at all.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the product it did not cover my grey hairs.</li>
            <li> It was all natural and it did not irritate the scalp.</li>
            <li> Very time consuming compared to regular dye.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to rank this product the best and recommend for those people who use chemical products.  </li>
            <li> I use one tablespoon or a bit less for a full face goatee.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a typical guy that writes reviews on anything. ...</li>
            <li> Tried 2 times but no black.</li>
            <li> Who wants to leave dye in for that long?</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d have to either deal with the significant grey OR on special occasions use a little black mascara</li>
            <li> but I think the clay saved me from some major redness.</li>
            <li> and I have no other choice.</li>
            <li> If you are a JustFMen refugee, then you about have no other choice.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product and despite positive reviews (on other colors)</li>
            <li> If they mean it would turn the color of hair rather than, O, say, a primary color, then it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that because my grays are really more white than gray, I need to leave the henna in for about 3 hours in order to get that truly dark, jet black color that will last for days.</li>
            <li> This product is such a huge inconvenience, it&#x27;s a huge sloppy mess, especially to rinse off</li>
            <li> I use an old &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; applicator brush to make sure all the hairs are well coated down to the root, then use the back of the plastic spoon to slather on the remaining paste thickly over my beard hairs.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my exact process that produces jet black, lasting results every time.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I have allegies to regular hair dye and did not want to have a full on gray beard until I at least turn 50</li>
            <li> and my  hands away from my face while the dye was turning my dark hairs blue and my light hairs green.  </li>
            <li> The Jet Black didn&#x27;t get absorbed well at all, rinsing out completely with little or no change to my color.</li>
            <li> This will absolutely maintain the paste wet and active for the entire 3 hours you&#x27;ll need to leave the dye in for.  </li>
            <li> -2014&lt;br /&gt;It is a very frustrating product because the result is not consistent--sometimes it is just OK</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll only need to leave it on for an hour or so to revive the jet black color and dye the new growth.  </li>
            <li> Also, wear an old dark t-shirt you don&#x27;t mind getting some henna stains on by accident (though with the plastic wrp, that never happenns to me) or wear no shirt at all.  </li>
            <li> It did not last too long, about 4 weeks later&lt;</li>
            <li> but it did not last as long as stated, maximum two days and that the grays start showing.</li>
            <li> Results last just as long</li>
            <li> The instructions are inside the pouch so once you open it you find out how long it takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Color does not last very long, maybe 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, only 1 week and not 3 or 4 weeks as indicated</li>
            <li> Because it is natural, it would take you two and half hour for its application.</li>
            <li> You cant let it dry while its on, so you have to constantly keep it moist by misting with a spray bottle and work it in.</li>
            <li> Henna isn&#x27;t a chemical dye like JFM, it&#x27;s a natural plant based dye, so it only actively releasing its dye as long as it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer recommends using a spritzer or something similar to keep the paste wet.  </li>
            <li> After a few years of using Just For Men, I developed an allergy to PPD and had to give it up.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work I put it on for 3 hours still grey</li>
            <li> it worked and covered the grey on my beard.</li>
            <li> For the curious, I used L&#x27;Oreal Root Rescue (limited options at 9pm in the local drug store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nowhere in this product&#x27;s advertising is it explained that one has to leave this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; dye in for as long as three hours!  </li>
            <li> it last longer than any other of the henna products I used</li>
            <li> DO NOT LET IT DRY OUT</li>
            <li> Dark brown seems to last longer for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> I had the same weird color outcomes when I first began, but this is because wasn&#x27;t using the plastic wrap and let it dry out or tried to get fancy and add salt, etc.  </li>
            <li> My mustache is a blend of glaring white and jet black.</li>
            <li> Allow me to share some tips and the proper application technique to ensure you get a jet black beard every time.</li>
            <li> But if you apply it, and keep it moist and leave it in for 3 hours, it&#x27;ll come out jet black - no blue or greenish tint.  </li>
            <li> I have a short beard and naturally black hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right off the back, if it was said in the product description that the product needs to be on for one and a half to three hours before rinsing, I never would have purchased it, but I did</li>
            <li> Today is day-one, so we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts, but based on other user&#x27;s &#x27;I put it on for thirty minutes&#x27;</li>
            <li> After a few days, once the dyed hair grows out and your grays are showing again, the henna will probably fade a bit and your beard may appear somewhat purplish in direct sunlight during the day, but still look black indoors and at night.</li>
            <li> Another who has had a bad reaction to jfm tried most productswith</li>
            <li> so it stays wet for the 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li> The product arrive as scheduled and is as expected</li>
            <li> and I finally decided to give up coloring for few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I coated my beard liberally and left this on until it dried</li>
            <li> you mix and apply it, It looks and smells like you have wet spinach on your face.</li>
            <li> If you have grey and are wanting to go black</li>
            <li> I ordered Black and when I received the package, it said Red and another label that said black.</li>
            <li> less* burning than I felt on the non-hippie chemical product I bought later to fix the mess on my chin that I&#x27;ll be unfolding as I type.  </li>
            <li> Even after following instructions on using it, the beard turned a tinge of green, then indigo or dark purple.</li>
            <li> If you have fewer grays or they aren&#x27;t stark white, you may need less time.  </li>
            <li> Stopped using the other chemicals from the counter since they gave me severe rash and</li>
            <li> After using just for men and other chemical based products for years I started to get an allergic reaction to ppd.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other hair die.</li>
            <li> After about 3 hours (you may need less time), rinse off the henna paste with lukewarm water, then shampoo your face to reduce the herbal scent and pat your face dry with a dark towel or one</li>
            <li> Not to worry, the directions say, because it&#x27;s temporary and will darken in --direct quote-- &amp;#34;a few hours.&amp;#34;  If by &amp;#34;darken&amp;#34; they mean &amp;#34;turn a dark green&amp;#34; then it did.  </li>
            <li> You have to buy other stuff in order to get your hair black</li>
            <li> ordered Manly Guy BLACK hair, Beard &amp; Mustache Dye because I wanted to get the gray out of my beard without the chemical burns I get from other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take your time taking it off or you will get red by scubbing your face to hard...</li>
            <li> will try to leave it in for longer but not sure when I can find the time to leave a massive, smelly glob of green stuff on my face for 3 hours.</li>
            <li> I was still continually trying, I even purchase a  dark brown.</li>
            <li> I also am adding a bit of the dark brown for color adjustment.</li>
            <li> no success</li>
            <li> I do this when I can lay down.</li>
            <li> half a year</li>
            <li> This black hair color did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the holy grail: a jet black beard with no burning or blistering afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Some people here have complained about their beard turning green or blue.</li>
            <li> Your beard comes out jet black every time.</li>
            <li> manly guy black hair die is not meeting the requirement.</li>
            <li> 98 % black now.</li>
            <li> it ended up slightly gray than black as it was shown on the picture.</li>
            <li> Manly Guy Black covered well but did not cover all of the gray.</li>
            <li> Works in less than 24 hours as the package says.</li>
            <li> I knew the white was going to be hard to tame, so I applied the paste and went to bed.</li>
            <li> and I leave it in for about 2 hrs or somethimes a little less.</li>
            <li> But after I perfected my technique, it was less messy.  </li>
            <li> you missed a little spot of henna dye.  </li>
            <li> It was a little messy and smelly.  </li>
            <li> (It looked like it covered a few greys</li>
            <li> re-applying the thick paste to keep it wet and keeping any hairs from sticking out (again, per directions)</li>
            <li> I was puffy for a few days</li>
            <li> It turned my friends beard green.</li>
            <li> green when washed...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure when it will be black.</li>
            <li> , some small number of people, that includes me, have their gray/white hair turn green after application.  </li>
            <li> Twelve hours later I was in the aforementioned drug store with my blue-and-green beard trying to look like I didn&#x27;t just come from a bad Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day party</li>
            <li> I tried it this last week and either I am doing something wrong or the product doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not touching, so holding the paste in place is paramount.  </li>
            <li> I cut a small hole for my mouth (but still keep my mustache covered) and cut a hole for each ear, pulling them out and through</li>
            <li> When I saw the advertisement for Manly Man, it makes you feel not so uncomfortable using the product, thinking that only women color their hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is not over bearing like some I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I was having bad skin reaction to the old hair dye I was using.</li>
            <li> This product is sucks.</li>
            <li> I had tried chemaical dyes which all was painful  with Itches and scary red swelling on my scalp and also any skin parts touched by the dye, and tried some natural products they all turned my hair Orange which made look worse</li>
            <li> I had to give at least one start</li>
            <li> Your hair follicles must be coated all the way to their tips by a thick coat of henna.  </li>
            <li> Apply a reasonably thick coating of henna paste to your beard.</li>
            <li> Its just my opinion I don&#x27;t mean any offence.</li>
            <li> you still want to use this because, like, you hate your parents and have low self esteem and your little sister&#x27;s skinny jeans</li>
            <li> I had heard about henna dyes, but was highly skeptical it would produce a truly jet black beard the way J.F.M. did</li>
            <li> though they only handle the fulfillment of this product ,I am disappointed with &amp; embarrassed for Amazon for even associating with this product.</li>
            <li> Be sparing with the water to dissolve all the powder but keep the paste very very thick.  </li>
            <li> worse product i have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I wrap my beard and face with plastic wrap, pulling the wrap under my nose and tying it behind my head like a bandanna.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but again very very disappointed</li>
            <li> (duh) and then cutting a hole for your mouth and ears.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately, even after 2 hours, my hair had a noticeable orange tint.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Those here with complaints just did it wrong.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted for LIFE!</li>
            <li> When watching the video, again i felt uncomfortable with the guy demonstrating the product.</li>
            <li> truly it was but useless.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a mediocre substitute</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> was tired and frustrated with JFM and all the chemicals that literally destroyed my face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t so bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> so I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> It made me itch like crazy!</li>
            <li> After trying to follow the instructions and working with a product representative, I got nothing but horrible results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn skin like that awful Just for Men!</li>
            <li> The product smells horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> worse product i have ever bought.I followed the directions several times. The product did not color my mustache.</li>
            <li> Used product 4 times since receiving it and it did nothing to change the color of me hair in fact did not touch it at all. I had high hopes for this product, but again very very disappointed</li>
            <li> I tried this as an alternative to &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; because I am now allergic to it.  I followed the directions that came with the package but unfortunately, even after 2 hours, my hair had a noticeable orange tint.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to leave it in for longer but not sure when I can find the time to leave a massive, smelly glob of green stuff on my face for 3 hours.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;5-2014&lt;br /&gt;It is a very frustrating product because the result is not consistent--sometimes it is just OK (It looked like it covered a few greys but most of the time it doesn&#x27;t work (like one out of 10 tries). I tried to go back to the steps of the one time that  it did work, well kinda but I cant replicate it. Sometimes,I will leave it for 2-3 hours, rinse it and found out it did not even work. I was still continually trying, I even purchase a  dark brown. Which reminds me, I better change my review on that one too...</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter and after rinsing all of the gray reappeared!</li>
            <li> Ive had this in for almost a year, And ive washed my hair vigorously for a couple months now and the color has not even faded and im even beginning to thing its growing the color it was dyed. Originally brown now black. Im not complaining, i just was not expecting that.</li>
            <li> Manly guy Have been very helpful when I call but the solutions have not been able to rid the redish burgundy color from my hair .still trying .</li>
            <li> Have to leave this stuff in for close to an hr in order for it to work properly. Color does not last very long, maybe 2-3 days. Dark brown seems to last longer for whatever reason. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I need to find something to replace JFM, which burns and reminds you it did for weeks. I tried the Manly Guy Darkest Brown and it worked pretty well, although it takes time and repeated applications. The Jet Black didn&#x27;t get absorbed well at all, rinsing out completely with little or no change to my color. It may well work for those who&#x27;s hair absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I tried it this last week and either I am doing something wrong or the product doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I started using this product and the color remains for 3 or 4 days even when left for an hour. I followed the instructions but still it turns to purple within no time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a typical guy that writes reviews on anything. ...but I&#x27;m telling everyone that needs to find out about this best product I&#x27;ve ever used. .&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best coloring product I came across.&lt;br /&gt;I was tired and frustrated with JFM and all the chemicals that literally destroyed my face.&lt;br /&gt;This product is free of any chemical that all the other brands use in their mix.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a free itchy and no next day burning effect on your face,&lt;br /&gt; Then give it a try. .&lt;br /&gt;Hands down the best product out there.&lt;br /&gt;THAN YOU</li>
            <li> smell like poup and can only turn my bead red..lmao..</li>
            <li> Easy, worked as stated, over 3 wks and color still looks great. Did stink, but that was expected and much better than chemical dye smell. And NO allergic reaction as with chem dye.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for some time and intend to keep using it. It takes time for it to do its thing but it gets the job done. Stopped using the other chemicals from the counter since they gave me severe rash and this henna product helped solve the problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m a freak or if the manufacturer is disingenuous about side effects, but either way I&#x27;m a good case study on this product.  Basically everything that was a &amp;#34;rarely&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;occasionally&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;some users&amp;#34; happened to me, including what they claimed wouldn&#x27;t.  For context I should point out I have sensitive skin and a salt-and-pepper beard.  This is my first time coloring my beard and my only other coloring experience was many years ago for a costume with temporary hair color meant to wash out in a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, they say there&#x27;s no burning.  I definitely felt burning.  I felt *less* burning than I felt on the non-hippie chemical product I bought later to fix the mess on my chin that I&#x27;ll be unfolding as I type.  For the curious, I used L&#x27;Oreal Root Rescue (limited options at 9pm in the local drug store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, they warn about some plant odor.  It&#x27;s not some; it&#x27;s quite strong and it smells like algae and general rotting flora.  In the 1.5 hours I had it on my face (manufacturer recommended 1.5-2 hours) re-applying the thick paste to keep it wet and keeping any hairs from sticking out (again, per directions) I didn&#x27;t get used to the smell.  I didn&#x27;t consider it a problem because it promised to last for several weeks and, frankly, if it worked what&#x27;s an hour or two of stinky on the pain scale?  Nothing at most.  I mention it only so you&#x27;re prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They warn some hair is prone to absorbing indigo, meaning you become Bluebeard the Pirate after using the product.  They supply a workaround but I didn&#x27;t try it because there was no way I was putting this on my face again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some small number of people, that includes me, have their gray/white hair turn green after application.  Not to worry, the directions say, because it&#x27;s temporary and will darken in --direct quote-- &amp;#34;a few hours.&amp;#34;  If by &amp;#34;darken&amp;#34; they mean &amp;#34;turn a dark green&amp;#34; then it did.  If they mean it would turn the color of hair rather than, O, say, a primary color, then it didn&#x27;t.  Twelve hours later I was in the aforementioned drug store with my blue-and-green beard trying to look like I didn&#x27;t just come from a bad Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day party half a year late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still want to use this because, like, you hate your parents and have low self esteem and your little sister&#x27;s skinny jeans don&#x27;t fit you anymore so you don&#x27;t deserve better and the planet is crying and Mother Gaia! Mother Gaia! then here&#x27;s what I did.  Take from it what you will:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the manufacturer&#x27;s guidance on how much powder to use.  Use the high end of the recommendation.  You&#x27;ll look at the powder and say &amp;#34;that&#x27;s WAY too much&amp;#34; but, no, it isn&#x27;t.  Be sparing with the water to dissolve all the powder but keep the paste very very thick.  Gravity will pull the paste down, so thicker paste will hold better.  The manufacturer points out the paste won&#x27;t color hair it&#x27;s not touching, so holding the paste in place is paramount.  I popped in a favorite movie to keep myself still and my  hands away from my face while the dye was turning my dark hairs blue and my light hairs green.  Every fifteen minutes I paused and went back to moisten my moustache and apply a slightly more watery leftover paste to my chin, both to add moisture and shift the bottom parts to the top.  The manufacturer recommends using a spritzer or something similar to keep the paste wet.  I have no such thing except for bug spray and plant fertilizer; neither was going on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also can&#x27;t shampoo for 24 hours because it may &amp;#34;affect the final color.&amp;#34;  Not to harp on this, but my non-hippie chemical fix let me shampoo immediately after so I could stop walking around smelling like a three foot pond in summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, &amp;#34;Manly Guy,&amp;#34; but women&#x27;s hair color bailed you out.  In my book a man delivers.</li>
            <li> I ordered Black and when I received the package, it said Red and another label that said black. I threw it in the trash without opening it...didn&#x27;t want to look like a Leprechaun.</li>
            <li> I use it a decent bit after going away from just for men. I leave it in for 3 hours and it does the job just fine, just smells a bit funky but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that this stuff works very well. I have a mustach and gotee and I leave it in for about 2 hrs or somethimes a little less. Take your time taking it off or you will get red by scubbing your face to hard...just wash it off and take your time lightly taking off the stain that is left behind on your face. I think this product is great and I will be getting more when I run out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, only 1 week and not 3 or 4 weeks as indicated so I am disappointed. I have used it as instructed and thats the result.</li>
            <li> This black hair color did not irritate my skin.  It did not last too long, about 4 weeks later&lt;br /&gt;I have to re-do it again.</li>
            <li> Quick and good quality very good product , I like it and I will recommend this to everybody - very good.</li>
            <li> Too much work for a head of hair but I only needed it for mustache so it was great. Doesn&#x27;t burn and lasts longer than anything I&#x27;ve tried. 5 stars for mustache only.</li>
            <li> Ok, I used this 2x, I am still 90+% dark hair, this fills in nicely (goatee only). I put on for only 1 1/2 hours and it does a pretty good job. Need &#x27;saran wrap&#x27; with hole for mouth cut out. I make the consistency thinner than  toothpaste so it stays wet for the 1 1/2 hours. I do this when I can lay down. I got the rash with JustFMen after about 7 uses, I used Bentonite clay to cover it after about 6 hours, when I woke up and saw the burn marks. I was puffy for a few days but I think the clay saved me from some major redness. This product seems to work and I have no other choice. Might have to cut out a few hairs here and there, but it does a good job on the fill in. If you are a JustFMen refugee, then you about have no other choice. I use one tablespoon or a bit less for a full face goatee. I also am adding a bit of the dark brown for color adjustment.</li>
            <li> My mustache is a blend of glaring white and jet black. I knew the white was going to be hard to tame, so I applied the paste and went to bed. I woke up four hours later and washed it off. Voilà, it matched my hair color. Today is day-one, so we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts, but based on other user&#x27;s &#x27;I put it on for thirty minutes&#x27;, I may have much better luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product beats JFM, to which I am allergic.</li>
            <li> This is the holy grail: a jet black beard with no burning or blistering afterwards.  After a few years of using Just For Men, I developed an allergy to PPD and had to give it up.  I had heard about henna dyes, but was highly skeptical it would produce a truly jet black beard the way J.F.M. did but I&#x27;m now a true believer.  I myself went through some trial and error but now I get consistent results every time. Allow me to share some tips and the proper application technique to ensure you get a jet black beard every time. Those here with complaints just did it wrong.  1) THE DYE PASTE MUST BE KEPT MOIST THE ENTIRE TIME. DO NOT LET IT DRY OUT OR ELSE IT STOPS DYING.** Henna isn&#x27;t a chemical dye like JFM, it&#x27;s a natural plant based dye, so it only actively releasing its dye as long as it&#x27;s wet.  I&#x27;ve tried it many ways and there is only 1 way to do this: apply the henna paste to your beard then wrap your face with a long piece of plastic wrap (like Cling/Saran/Reynolds wrap), making sure not to cover your nose (duh) and then cutting a hole for your mouth and ears.  This will absolutely maintain the paste wet and active for the entire 3 hours you&#x27;ll need to leave the dye in for.  Oh, and use a plastic spoon to mix the powder and warm tap water, as henna may tarnish a metal one.  2) Your hair follicles must be coated all the way to their tips by a thick coat of henna.  I brush the henna into my beard using an old Just For Men applicator brush (you can use a toothbrush or whatever)and then using the same plastic spoon I mixed the powder with, I slather on the henna paste nice and thick, like cake frosting, making sure the ends of my beard hairs are completely coated and immersed in it to make sure they get dyed properly.  3) Yes, it&#x27;s a pain, but wait 3 hours. I&#x27;ve found that because my grays are really more white than gray, I need to leave the henna in for about 3 hours in order to get that truly dark, jet black color that will last for days. If you have fewer grays or they aren&#x27;t stark white, you may need less time.  4) After a few days, once the dyed hair grows out and your grays are showing again, the henna will probably fade a bit and your beard may appear somewhat purplish in direct sunlight during the day, but still look black indoors and at night. Hey, it&#x27;s not a chemical dye, so expect it to fade like clothing color does after a while. Just reapply it and keep on trucking.  My advice is to touch up your beard every 3 days or so. You&#x27;ll only need to leave it on for an hour or so to revive the jet black color and dye the new growth.  Some people here have complained about their beard turning green or blue. That&#x27;s because they dyed it incorrectly. I had the same weird color outcomes when I first began, but this is because wasn&#x27;t using the plastic wrap and let it dry out or tried to get fancy and add salt, etc.  But if you apply it, and keep it moist and leave it in for 3 hours, it&#x27;ll come out jet black - no blue or greenish tint.  Here&#x27;s my exact process that produces jet black, lasting results every time.  Note: You&#x27;ll need 3 hours time and then you&#x27;ll want to wash your beard with some fragrant shampoo to get the grassy smell of off your face. Also, wear an old dark t-shirt you don&#x27;t mind getting some henna stains on by accident (though with the plastic wrp, that never happenns to me) or wear no shirt at all.  Step 1) In a bowl, I mix about 3 heaping tablespoons of henna with 1/2 a capful of vinegar (I use apple cider, but any vinegar will do) and just enough warm water to achieve a toothpaste-like consistency after stirring. Add water in tiny, 1/2 tablespoon amounts until you achieve that consistency.  Step 2) Apply a reasonably thick coating of henna paste to your beard. I use an old &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; applicator brush to make sure all the hairs are well coated down to the root, then use the back of the plastic spoon to slather on the remaining paste thickly over my beard hairs.  Step 3) I wrap my beard and face with plastic wrap, pulling the wrap under my nose and tying it behind my head like a bandanna.  The I cut a small hole for my mouth (but still keep my mustache covered) and cut a hole for each ear, pulling them out and through so I can hear, then wait 3 hours.   Step 4) After about 3 hours (you may need less time), rinse off the henna paste with lukewarm water, then shampoo your face to reduce the herbal scent and pat your face dry with a dark towel or one you don&#x27;t mind staining JUST IN CASE you missed a little spot of henna dye.  Your beard comes out jet black every time. Awesome product...  As they tell you right on the package, be patient with learning the best method to use to get consistent results for your hair. Some people may not need to let it set for a while before application, some may need to add lemon juice or vinegar, some a pinch of salt, some only need 1 hour of application time, some need 2, etc., but you can definitely get the exact results you want if you&#x27;re willing to play around with it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SIMPLE INVENTION THAT WORKS FOR ANY HAIR PROBLEM COLOR BALD SPOT ETC...IT WILL SURPRISE YOU IF YOU TRY IT</li>
            <li> I found it just in time. I was having bad skin reaction to the old hair dye I was using. This is completely natural and the hair color that it produces is also very natural. I love it. The best part is you can use it as often as is needed to maintain your hair color without having to worry about the chemical in other hair dyes are affecting your health. Everyone who needs to dye their hair should use it and nothing else. To get the desired result, make sure you follow the directions exactly. You will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> Will not buy this brand again. If you have grey and are wanting to go black this is not the brand for you. It turned my friends beard green.</li>
            <li> This product is sucks. You spend a lot of money and did not work.  You have to buy other stuff in order to get your hair black</li>
            <li> The product arrive as scheduled and is as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my beard before using this product. I am addicted for LIFE!</li>
            <li> Very ineffective product didn&#x27;t work at all .</li>
            <li> manly guy black hair die is not meeting the requirement.</li>
            <li> It works if you follow the directions. I had to keep my indigo on my beard for several hours. Then I rinsed it out. The salt and pepper is gone. 98 % black now. Good for people who have skin problems like myself.</li>
            <li> still had an allergic reaction to the product</li>
            <li> I have to rank this product the best and recommend for those people who use chemical products.  I used to use &amp;#34;just for men&amp;#34; that causes skin rash and give people impression of skin illness.  After using this product, my hair looks natural and no skin rash at all.  Because it is natural, it would take you two and half hour for its application.</li>
            <li> I had tried chemaical dyes which all was painful  with Itches and scary red swelling on my scalp and also any skin parts touched by the dye, and tried some natural products they all turned my hair Orange which made look worse and I finally decided to give up coloring for few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hit across this product from Henna King at Amazon and the reviews and descriptions impressed me and was tempted to try, so I ordered one pack which got delivered on-time and not only changed my hair color , also i found the hope that there exists a product which works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions , and also the special email instruction from Henna king , the very first application gave a good coverage. Now placed repeat order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a suggestion is to reduce the shipping charges or at least make it Eligible for the Amazon free super saver shipping over $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last but not least thanks for the Prompt,quick ,courteous responses from the Henna King team.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product it did not cover my grey hairs. I used the product again today and it seems to have covered the grey hair better. When I used the product the first time, after a couple of days it seemed to fade quickly, I will see how long it stays on my hair this time. I think is kind of hard for a man to admit he colors his hair. I have been using JUST FOR MEN for years, but i am having an alergic reaction to that product. When I saw the advertisement for Manly Man, it makes you feel not so uncomfortable using the product, thinking that only women color their hair. When watching the video, again i felt uncomfortable with the guy demonstrating the product. Somehow I think it would be easier and more comfortable if the company spokesperson was more masculine. Its just my opinion I don&#x27;t mean any offence. I will re post in a week or two if the color does fade again.</li>
            <li> Nowhere in this product&#x27;s advertising is it explained that one has to leave this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; dye in for as long as three hours!  Who wants to leave dye in for that long? Also, it smells like grass, so imagine having to inhale the smell of grass for three hours! Save your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 3 years and it is useful tome. I recommend this product to the people who are allergic to the unnatural hair dyes.....</li>
            <li> Keeps changing colors...green when washed...kinda brown next and then kinda purplish brown next day. Not sure when it will be black. Tried 2 times but no black.</li>
            <li> Another who has had a bad reaction to jfm tried most productswith no success even the wolfshead beard dye avoid as does not work its almost just like applying mascara, thought give this product a go applied to short stubble left on for approx 2 hours washed off and it had dyed my stubble but still few greys visible let tne stubble grow for another 4 days reapplied and got full coverage great product something that actually works and looks natural, only downside is the smell when applying and waiting for the dye to work will take some getting use to it, did try on head hair never worked as good however great product</li>
            <li> Good stuff for chemical free.The smell is not over bearing like some I have used in the past. Helps condition the hair. The only con is that it can be a little bit itchy, but overall it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work I put it on for 3 hours still grey</li>
            <li> I gave it to my DAD but didn&#x27;t  stick to his hair it ended up slightly gray than black as it was shown on the picture. I bought it bec it is hypoallergenic&#x27; truly it was but useless.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  No burning, itching or irritation like JFM.  It was a little messy and smelly.  But after I perfected my technique, it was less messy.  And the smell is earthy and something that a good smelling natural hair oil can cure.  I had to do 2 applications the first time around.  But it came out great.  And it seems to last longer that JFM.  And if you use a bleach based product right after your done, clean up is quick and easy.  And best of all...I LOOK GREAT!</li>
            <li> Product works, no side effects but it did not last as long as stated, maximum two days and that the grays start showing.</li>
            <li> I started getting skin irritation, especially around my lips, from the Just for.. brand after using it for a decade or so.  I thought I&#x27;d have to either deal with the significant grey OR on special occasions use a little black mascara so it wasn&#x27;t so bad.  lol  I decided to try this product and despite positive reviews (on other colors) I was nervous.  I also waited until ALL THE DYE was gone.. henna over dye can sometimes turn greenish.  So do that..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t bad.  It smells, quite frankly, like bong water.  Herbal.  No big deal and it&#x27;s only until you rinse it off.  Meanwhile, I followed the instructions and left it on for 30 minutes.  It really didn&#x27;t work.  I read in other reviews that some hair/grey is resistant and since mine is kind of course.. I left if on for an hour.  The results were almost immediate but sure enough, next morning it looked very natural and just as good, if not better, than the Just for...  I thought this would be a mediocre substitute but it&#x27;s actually better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  No irritation - it&#x27;s natural!&lt;br /&gt;2.  Results last just as long (I&#x27;ve intentionally waited a couple weeks to test before writing the review)&lt;br /&gt;3.  I don&#x27;t need as much as the instructions say (2 Tbs) since I keep a shorter, modern beard so the amount provided lasts a LONG time, which makes it a far better value than the \\&quot;Just for..\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;4.  I can reapply as often as needed without worry about skin staining, sink/shower staining or the splatters of &#x27;Just for..&#x27; on my bathroom wall.  :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome, awesome product!</li>
            <li> Manly Guy Black covered well but did not cover all of the gray. It was all natural and it did not irritate the scalp.</li>
            <li> After using just for men and other chemical based products for years I started to get an allergic reaction to ppd.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product on the off chance and hoped for the best. To my surprise on the first attempt of use it worked and covered the grey on my beard. This product really works and I thoroughly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Tried it 4-5 times with and without salt as instructions indicated.  The Henna just washes off and the hair is the same color as before..Gray.  Save your money and buy something else.  Also I got an email from the supplier indicating if I was willing to change my feedback, they will send me a two-step process kit, since I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;stubborn&amp;#34; hair..</li>
            <li> So far so good been 2 weeks and color still looks good</li>
            <li> it last longer than any other of the henna products I used</li>
            <li> This product did not work as marketed. Even after following instructions on using it, the beard turned a tinge of green, then indigo or dark purple. After trying to follow the instructions and working with a product representative, I got nothing but horrible results. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product. It didn&#x27;t work for me. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Works in less than 24 hours as the package says. It doesn&#x27;t burn skin like that awful Just for Men! I wouldn&#x27;t use any other hair die.</li>
            <li> Know what you are getting here. it is a powder you mix with water then apply to reduce of eliminate gray.  I have a short beard and naturally black hair. I bought this because I have allegies to regular hair dye and did not want to have a full on gray beard until I at least turn 50 ( I am 45).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my experience.  The product smells horrible. It really does.  I mixed with warm water to make a pancake like batter and added a touch of salt per directions.  I coated my beard liberally and left this on until it dried (I did not use the bag).  This took about 40 minutes.  Then I rinsed with warm water.  Very time consuming compared to regular dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not totally eliminate gray for me but definitely blended it. I am satisfied with the result as I believe a total coloring looks unnatural and women seem to like the salt and pepper/blended look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all there is no irritation, redness or swelling.  No doubt about it this product is not as easy as regular dye.  It takes some effort to use.  I think it is worth that effort.  Just do this while you are watching a movie or something.  This was my first time using it.  The directions say that subsequent applications go a bit easier.</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not work for me. I&#x27;m allergic to something in it... It made me itch like crazy!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. I had to give at least one start so I could write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Manly Guy BLACK hair, Beard &amp; Mustache Dye because I wanted to get the gray out of my beard without the chemical burns I get from other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right off the back, if it was said in the product description that the product needs to be on for one and a half to three hours before rinsing, I never would have purchased it, but I did so I gave it a fair shot. The instructions are inside the pouch so once you open it you find out how long it takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you mix and apply it, It looks and smells like you have wet spinach on your face. You cant let it dry while its on, so you have to constantly keep it moist by misting with a spray bottle and work it in. This product is such a huge inconvenience, it&#x27;s a huge sloppy mess, especially to rinse off but then once you do rinse it off you&#x27;ll find that your gray hairs are now green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though they only handle the fulfillment of this product ,I am disappointed with &amp; embarrassed for Amazon for even associating with this product.</li>
