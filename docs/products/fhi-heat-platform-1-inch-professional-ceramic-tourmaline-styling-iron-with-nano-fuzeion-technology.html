            <li>I was pleased to find the best price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Loved it while it worked.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found out that the FHI Heat Platform was really good in straightening hair.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford the Runway, my hair stylist says the Platform series is good</li>
            <li>I always loved how my stylist straightened my hair, but I could never replicate it at home.  </li>
            <li>The seller is great also, super-fast shipping and nicely wrapped.</li>
            <li>I found it at Amazon with free shipping and also Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I heard a lot of good reviews about</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved this iron</li>
            <li>I have exceptionally frizzy hair and always have.  </li>
            <li>Very good irons, they&#x27;re smooth and eavy to handle, I&#x27;m a novice and still got salon looks with these irons</li>
            <li>and I have used many!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love this !</li>
            <li>This is DEFFENTALY the best straightner ever, and sold at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love the FHI styling iron!  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased!</li>
            <li>this iron is AMAZING, as I ran the iron through my daughters  </li>
            <li>They work amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I was able to add some gorgeous Shiney locks.</li>
            <li>I really think this is one of the best hair irons on the market - but take care of it</li>
            <li>WAS nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li>And I REALLY liked that one.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t seem to redo it as often, which is nice.</li>
            <li>This iron and the CHI produce a nice silky effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at the results, honestly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>but i just wanted to make sure it was good, so i tried it.</li>
            <li>I was between this and a CHI, but after using a CHI I decided that I honestly didn&#x27;t like what it did to my hair.</li>
            <li>and it comes in a nice box with a detachable case and heat resistant mat.</li>
            <li>The temperature control is perfect allowing you to gauge how much heat you are using on your hair to help you avoid split ends.</li>
            <li>The protective heat pad included is a nice touch, as well.  </li>
            <li>From the sleek design to the fast heating, buying it was the best decision I made.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute BEST.  </li>
            <li>it makes your hair nice and smoth</li>
            <li>I have nice hair, but still.....</li>
            <li>It does a great job, special after getting steroid shots from a car accident that made my hair feel and look like a Brillo pad.now</li>
            <li>I am a strong believer of good products</li>
            <li>I love my FHI and you should get it cause you will love it too!</li>
            <li>This ceramic iron is excellent for natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not the best flatiron I&#x27;ve ever had (they no longer make my old model)</li>
            <li>but so far its awesome!</li>
            <li>Just saying for all the wonderful reviews here, when it breaks don&#x27;t expect FHI to honor any warranty because \\&quot;we have determined that Amazon is not an authorized professional salon</li>
            <li>Make sure you sure the appropriate oil for straightening your hair too!</li>
            <li>But all in all, I was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>I asked my stylist how she got my hair so straight and beautiful</li>
            <li>The first one worked great for two weeks and then stopped heating up.</li>
            <li>I loved the FHI platform iron the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>This was such a good deal on a great iron.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>Additionally I love the adjustable heat setting.</li>
            <li>All I have to say is check the box and do your comparisons with an authentic FHI to the one that you are looking into purchasing on ebay/amazon.  </li>
            <li>so I am returning this for a better one probably from another buyer as well.</li>
            <li>fyi, make sure to purchase the FHI platform.  </li>
            <li>iron\\&quot; as many would describe it to be, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried every hair straightener and this one is the absolute best- 100% worth the money</li>
            <li>Simply the BEST .</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>SURE YOU GIVE IT A RUN FOR ITS MONEY TO MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>IT WORKS FOR MORE THAN 14 DAYS.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an issue for me because I was able to adjust.  </li>
            <li>Hope this helps. :)</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I purchased one for myself about a year ago and paid a lot more for it.  </li>
            <li>The FHI Platform straightens coarser hair without breakage, in fact, the more you use it the better your hair looks and the smoothier your ends.</li>
            <li>have different hair types so the dial control is great because I can adjust the temperature for each one!</li>
            <li>But, i love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wavy/puffy most of the time, but if I use products I can get a curl to come out.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Hope this review helps. :)</li>
            <li>I tried it and fell in love.</li>
            <li>It was magical.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It also had variable heat, which so many of the irons in this price range do not have.</li>
            <li>She finds the 1\\&quot; size to be the most flexible.</li>
            <li>I have loved my CHI and it has done a great job for several years now.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a buying must!! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>and it is a top quality straightener.</li>
            <li>just seemed to be better quality.  </li>
            <li>My younger sister has had hers for about 4 or 5 years and it still works beautifully!</li>
            <li>LOVE FHI.&lt;br /&gt;SPEND</li>
            <li>It works great and maintains the heat very well.  </li>
            <li>My hair look so much better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li>Most satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>im getting one more</li>
            <li>and I love the temp control.  </li>
            <li>Amazon often has better prices so the risk is up to you.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO many of these through the years.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and i am glad i choose this.</li>
            <li>Try it you will love it as well.</li>
            <li>I really love my ceramic tourmaline.  </li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just looking forward to learn how to make curls :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>I had the CHI before this straightner, and I like this one much better.</li>
            <li>This one heats up to 450 degrees, which makes you able to straighten your hair in minutes.</li>
            <li>It also does curls nicely and heat up extremely fast!!!</li>
            <li>This flat iron is ok, but not the best.</li>
            <li>The case is more impressive than the flat iron itself.  </li>
            <li>Pay no attention to any review that says this is not the most awesome flat iron ever.</li>
            <li>No wonder it is rated as one of the best flat irons on the market.</li>
            <li>Best flat iron ever.  </li>
            <li>After my flat iron burned up I did some research on which brand would be the best.  </li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s the best flat iron</li>
            <li>I have spend hundreds of dollars in search for the perfect flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Flat iron is great!!  </li>
            <li>in fact it was one of the best flat irons Ive ever used that could straighten my curls so well.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever used</li>
            <li>The flat iron worked wonderfully while it worked.  </li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length relaxed hair and this flat iron is amazing!!!!!!</li>
            <li>When it did work my daughter said it was the best flat iron she ever used and made her hair feel silky.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron--</li>
            <li>The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>This flat iron is Awesome!!!!</li>
            <li>This flat iron is the best.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron in the world!</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron ever!</li>
            <li>the best flat iron i have ever used!</li>
            <li>and i must say it did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>Mostly I consider Amazon.com to be THE top seller on the Internet due to their excellent customer service policy and their flexible ordering system.</li>
            <li>Doens&#x27;t pull, easy to clean, and still heats up nicely.</li>
            <li>couple up some great hair products with this flat iron &amp; you have a winning combination!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works quick, it&#x27;s light weight (unlike my original Solano that I loved so dearly), it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, you can use it to make curls as well as straighten, etc.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels smooth and healthy after each curl.</li>
            <li>She had been using my CHI flatiron because it worked so much more smoothly than the inexpensive one she had bought for herself.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was able to return the Sedu and replace it with this FHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, its great!</li>
            <li>The hair never gets caught during use and the grip makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and my hair is softer after I use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to spend hundreds of dollars pursuing legal action, so the best I can do is warn others.</li>
            <li>They are both great flat irons but for my hair type FHI was recommended the most.</li>
            <li>but this is hands down the best straightener I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this flat iron after doing a lot of research on it and thought it would be awesome and for such a good discount.</li>
            <li>I have to use a lot of product to stop my hair from reverting by the end of the day, which is fine because that means the ironing isn&#x27;t damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>I have to use a lot of product to stop my hair from reverting by the end of the day, which is fine because that means the ironing isn&#x27;t damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>but o have to say that I have fine hair</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, has a temperature gauge and is light weight.</li>
            <li>I like it very much it is so easy to use and makes the hair smooth rapidly</li>
            <li>I purchased the FHI Platform because of the reviews that I read for fine hair.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was safely packaged.</li>
            <li>Esp using Paul Mitchells Super Skinny sebrum(Expensive!)</li>
            <li>This flat iron curls beautifully but for some reason</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really nit-picky too, but I like that the plug doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space (like I can plug it in on top of my hair dryer) -- then it can start heating up while I&#x27;m finishing up drying my hair!</li>
            <li>It heats very quickly and does a great job straightening my coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my hair shiny and straight!!  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>It even had free Shipping..</li>
            <li>Iron is great for my coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I hope the price will be just a cheap.</li>
            <li>The adjustable temperature feature is great - it can go as low as 140 degrees to 450.</li>
            <li>My hair glided through the plates and was silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>It has cut my straightning time and my hair is a lot shinier and frizz free unlike Chi.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go cheap b/c</li>
            <li>Platform is smooth....</li>
            <li>and it was free.</li>
            <li>This iron is simply fabulous.  </li>
            <li>&quot; light was faded and the straightener wasn&#x27;t heating up.</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates are smooth and help to straighten and make your hair silky</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li>I try to order items &#x27;sold by Amazon&#x27; and if I can&#x27;t, I research the seller that is available.</li>
            <li>My roommate came home later that night and asked if I went to the salon, that is how great it looks.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the $200 as advertised nor can I tell that it&#x27;s better than a Chi iron.</li>
            <li>I am also pleased with the seller&#x27;s fast shipment and safe packaging of the item.  </li>
            <li>Because I love it so much, I purchased another one on Amazon at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>So, so far, so good.</li>
            <li>The best part is as we all approach economic hardships we can look like we just left the salon.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it is very light and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>What more can one say except that the price was right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money, and you get such a good deal here!    </li>
            <li>This is the absolute best flat iron ever.</li>
            <li>Hair is smoother, and gets hair straight, the best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Other than that we liked that the FHI had a variable heat setting, and it does do a good job of smoothing the hair.</li>
            <li>But like I said earlier, it curls very very very nicely</li>
            <li>This particular version has a much longer cord, which is great.</li>
            <li>Great Flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is GREAT.  </li>
            <li>Love it and would highly recommend it for anyone seeking healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It doesnt even show temperature setting but heats up so hot it smokes but does not damage hair because it has infrared, truly amazing and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It works every bit as well as my previous model, and my hair looks great -- so much better than it had with the Sedu.  </li>
            <li>SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>For example, they say that their hairdryer is unique because of its AC motor.</li>
            <li>Straightens my very curly hair so easily!  </li>
            <li>[...]  This is the best investment I have ever made for my hair.  I am so excited to be stylying my hair with same tool the professional use.  </li>
            <li>going on different websites looking at people reviews and checking out the latest technology in flat ironS and let me tell this is the best for the money.</li>
            <li>(at least when I wrote this review) Enjoy :D</li>
            <li>Leaves a smooth finish and allows quick styling.</li>
            <li>but the iron tends to make ur hair feel really clean...</li>
            <li>My hair looked so silky and felt so soft that I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite irons ever!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing flat iron ever!</li>
            <li>So I ordered another one and it arrived faster than I expected and it works great.  </li>
            <li>The day my FHI heat 1 inch Platform came, I spent 3 hours straightening, curling, flipping and having a great time.</li>
            <li>With Sincere Thanks.</li>
            <li>and im getting a full refund.</li>
            <li>After much research I&#x27;m glad I picked this one.  </li>
            <li>Oh, if you&#x27;re wondering why I didn&#x27;t stick with the ION from Sallys...well, the plates were showing signs of aging and it took more passes for me to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>Got it this week from Target, but had points, so I didn&#x27;t pay full price.   </li>
            <li>My hair looks very shiny after I use it, and it is able to withstand humidity.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not up to true FHI standards</li>
            <li>The straight lasted three weeks and prob even more if I didn&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought it again.</li>
            <li>The one I currently use is still in good condition after 2 years.</li>
            <li>Only lasted maybe a good year...</li>
            <li>It also curls much easier and leaves more bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is super shiny and I must say I am IN LOVE with my new FHI !!</li>
            <li>I wasnt expecting to run it more than twice since I have pretty much straight, fine, medum length hair with waves at the end</li>
            <li>In fairness, I should preface that this is the first new flat iron I&#x27;ve had in 10 years, but I&#x27;m incredibly impressed.</li>
            <li>It gets hot and stays hot, and the plates run very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a good flat iron</li>
            <li>The flat iron is good when it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li>i plugged it up, and i worked fine at first, but then it automatically shut off.</li>
            <li>this by far has been the best money spent.</li>
            <li>It makes the hair SUPER SILKY.....</li>
            <li>Vendor shipped quickly and product was just as advertised.</li>
            <li>She uses it on our eight year old daughter&#x27;s unprocessed hair to wonderful effect as well.</li>
            <li>It gets super hot and is a relatively light.</li>
            <li>I think the FHI is a great flat iron, heats up quickly and works very well</li>
            <li>FHI&#x27;s Hot Sauce makes a HUGE difference when using this iron</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll warn you that they get very hot.</li>
            <li>This is my second FHI flat iron and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot</li>
            <li>it may be a five star item, i just havent used it very much yet!</li>
            <li>also bought the heat protectant FHI Hot Sauce, but I decided I didn&#x27;t like it, because the flat iron would do such a great job making my hair nice and smooth that if I used the Hot Sauce my hair would get greasy</li>
            <li>It gets very hot, and maintains that heat.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Also I used this flat iron with the Hot Sauce heat protectant and it works amazing!</li>
            <li>It is very hot</li>
            <li>As long as you mosturize your hair before styling you are good to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to give a really good review, but I personally think the Hai worked better.</li>
            <li>The unit works really well, and heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>I dont even have to blow dry my hair good.</li>
            <li>Today was my first time using this baby, and my goodness it did wonders to my hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairstylist and these definitely would be my most used!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite flatiron by far!  </li>
            <li>Did not realize it at first as i had hair braided most of the time, when my daughter finally pulled out to use, barely able to do so as the heat was not as advertised.</li>
            <li>The FHI is a great flat iron that was highly recommended by my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>Excellent to straighten natural black hair.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous buying this product but to my surpise it works great.</li>
            <li>The flatiron gets hot quickly and work quickly.</li>
            <li>I can only tell you, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair smooth</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It does not fry your hair and is worth the $100.00.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>I paid about $200 for it, and it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>but I was looking for something more suited for natural and thicker hair.</li>
            <li>Left my hair with a nice sheen and did not feel damaged.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is better by far.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday because her old one broke after use for many years</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>but it was definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>the fact that this iron gets to 410 degrees like salon irons makes it worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>So since I didn&#x27;t think they were worth me.</li>
            <li>(It gets REALLY hot quick too)</li>
            <li>It stopped getting hot really quickly.  </li>
            <li>I went with this one based on the other good reviews.</li>
            <li>This flat iron does a nice job and is helping my hair to get smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the CHI, but for some reason it was making my hair very frizzy, so I returned it.</li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S NOT A BEAUTY COMPANY, SAYS SO RIGHT</li>
            <li>It cuts time to straighten my long hair to just 15minutes, I love it and my hair comes out silky smooth</li>
            <li>I am glad I invested the money into a new flat iron,because my hair seems to love it.</li>
            <li>And being a mom of two kids, a extra 20 min less of having to do my hair is awesome in my book.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use it for a while before reviewing, as my last flat iron was great to start but quickly deteriorated (it was a HAI for reference).</li>
            <li>had full head weave, none of my real hair out)</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and healthy and does a great job even with my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I certainly hope that Amazon gets on the ball and addresses this issue quickly.</li>
            <li>Of course FHI is a little more pricy than most</li>
            <li>These flat irons get very hot and make your hair very straight without burning or scorching your hair!!!</li>
            <li>The plates did not touch so my hair went right through the iron, didn&#x27;t see at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered FHI Irons before but for some reason this one was not as good as the previous one I owned.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, gets my hair straight and silky smooth and it stays that way.</li>
            <li>The first one got damaged in shipping and they replaced it right away - even before I returned the first one.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>very much it is the best&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope it last more than 4 years this time.</li>
            <li>and I would have to push them in and hold it at a funny angle to get the iron to heat</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to go any higher than 350 in fear of getting heat damage.</li>
            <li>I have had it for 5 years now, and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li>It still gets as hot as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>The first one we bought from Amazon lasted 1 year and then stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I actually like it better than the GVP (CHI knock off)</li>
            <li>**).    </li>
            <li>i just got this model and used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>and I can definitely say I am completely satisfied with my purchase of the FHI heat platform.</li>
            <li>However,if you are inexperienced,you should stick to the more wider plates that have a thicker back for heat protection.</li>
            <li>The first lasted 6 years, with almost-daily use.  </li>
            <li>and then my hair gets BONE STRAIGHT !</li>
            <li>First off, I qualified for Amazon Prime which meant my delivery would take 2 days</li>
            <li>I am going to the FHI Hot Sauce because I cant wait to see the results of the two combined together.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t even get as hot as my CHI</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and it made my hair healthier</li>
            <li>...the first one I had just died.</li>
            <li>My hair has met its match, thanks FHI!</li>
            <li>Still works as well as when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for two years and has not failed me.</li>
            <li>which I wasn&#x27;t aware of.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several CHI iron&#x27;s and FHI works way better.</li>
            <li>It works better than the chi and seems to make your hair last longer.</li>
            <li>I then decided that the because this product is still being sold on Amazon and at a higher cost than what I paid,  I decided that the seller and others needed to know that this product was defective.</li>
            <li>I even got the Hot Sauce by FHI and that still didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>Did not last more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying it daily</li>
            <li>Functional for the first year.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Flat iron is wasy to handle and very light weight.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this flat iron and I can honestly say it was one of the best purchases I have made in a long, long time.   </li>
            <li>After paying $90 dollars, I am highly upset and out of a once amazing flat iron and money.</li>
            <li>My wife says this one glides over her hair even more smoothly than the previous model.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does an overall fabulous job.</li>
            <li>I had an old and cheap Vidal Sassoon flat iron that was okay.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the purchase of this FHI Professional Ceramic Tourmaline 1 inch Styling Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li>I love my flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have semi curly/kinky hair, and I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>My clients love the results from this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many flat irons (including the CHI)</li>
            <li>Much better flat iron with a 4 year warranty -</li>
            <li>I have used this flat iron for 4 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>any event, I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON</li>
            <li>In any event, I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON</li>
            <li>I never thought you could fall in love with a flat iron</li>
            <li>She was using the Hai 2\\&quot; and wanted a 1\\&quot; flat iron to be able to also curl her hair.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so pleased with this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Never used a better  flat iron.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite flat irons.</li>
            <li>Love the iron works perfect but after a year had to replace it and purchase a new one the exact same because of the way my customers hair would shine and straighten after the first stroke, you dont have to keep going over the same section several different times</li>
            <li>FHI has been my favorite flat iron always!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally do reviews on products but had to do a review on this one!!  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist has done a wonderful job doing my hair but its getting to be very costly, and also difficult securing appointments.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to start wearing my t-laxed (texturized) hair straight more often.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive the fhi 1\\&quot; flat iron.</li>
            <li>The iron heats VERY fast and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde hair that styles pretty easily - but it does get frizzy sometimes.  </li>
            <li>Originally, I like it because it straightens my natural hair very well</li>
            <li>and all I was looking for was a more flat straight look.</li>
            <li>My cheap Jilbere (the light grey one with red plates) straightens my hair much better leaving it soft, silky and bouncy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, silky and full of body.</li>
            <li>Not only does this flat iron straighten my hair so good to the point where it looks like I have a relaxer, but it really does repel humidity as advertised.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super silky and soft.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly, made my hair soft and straightened it well</li>
            <li>This straightener is a good straightener, but it doesn&#x27;t last long for what you pay for it.</li>
            <li>They both look fine however felt different.</li>
            <li>The only thing I noticed that wasn&#x27;t too great was that if you&#x27;re not careful you can snag your hair on the end of the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I turn it on high and just use it when its feels hot.</li>
            <li>FHI was my first high end styling iron.</li>
            <li>It is straight, very manageable, and much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really speeds up the process of getting ready.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair very managable</li>
            <li>and I really like the look.</li>
            <li>and it really does the trick, check out his site.</li>
            <li>The rounded edge of the plates really do eliminate snags.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and east to use.</li>
            <li>It works really well 2.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll forget how much you paid for it.</li>
            <li>** update, this has happened to me, so I don&#x27;t use this iron as much anymore.</li>
            <li>there was absolutely a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied with this buy.</li>
            <li>I can create bouncy curls or a straight look that lasts for days.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this iron!</li>
            <li>My daughter used to have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t have a lock feature, I don&#x27;t really think that matters much.  </li>
            <li>The iron itself works really well</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I really recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>so much for saving any money..</li>
            <li>By not disclosing that Amazon is not authorized and that there is no warranty: 1) Amazon is legally responsibility for fulfilling the terms of the warranty.</li>
            <li>However just running the starightener once will not get it straight.</li>
            <li>atleast 3 times to get straight hair to my satisfaction versus running it 5 times with Chi.</li>
            <li>and it is straight and shiny thanks to FHI.</li>
            <li>I can run the iron through a segment of my hair once and it is straight.</li>
            <li>With the FHI I always get the same sleek, smooth look.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have so much body and volume, i cant stops swinging my hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and irons fast too.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair already, but wanted to keep the frizzies out and give it a bounce at the end.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays straight all day.</li>
            <li>; I have an FHI professional hair dryer that was also well worth the price (going on year 3 now).</li>
            <li>I like the fast heat up and the ceramic coating.</li>
            <li>This iron gives me silky straight hair at a lower temperature with one pass.</li>
            <li>I have AA relaxed bra-strap hair and this makes it silky, shinny and straight with one pass...</li>
            <li>If it can make my hair straight it can do anything.</li>
            <li>I can go from curly to straight with no blow out.</li>
            <li>It really straightens our hair really well.  </li>
            <li>Just saying, dont&#x27; expect much.</li>
            <li>I also find myself not having to straighten my hair as much with this iron.</li>
            <li>and they worked very well until sometime in Nov 2012.</li>
            <li>(I have really curly hair).</li>
            <li>The one thing that I like most about the iron is that it can get extremely hot and it runs smoothly down my hair shaft.</li>
            <li>In the end, my first iron started shorting, so I decided to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>Ok I just received the FHI iron in the mail today, and i definitely have to say it works very well, my own hair stylist uses a iron similar to this one, it was one of the main reasons i wanted it, due to almost a week after getting my hair done it would begin to frizz.</li>
            <li>and I have course frizzy hair and while it does do the job, my hair submits to heat and humidity very easily and straightening has little effect on subduing that.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how hot the iron should be, so I just kept trying out different heats on different strands.</li>
            <li>This flat iron doesn&#x27;t seem to leave her hair as smooth.</li>
            <li>The light appears to come on when plugged, but the flat iron will not heat up.</li>
            <li>Nothing negative to report it is simply just beautiful.</li>
            <li>Thank you all who wrote wonderful reviews in the past with such honesty and thank you amazon for saving me 50% on this flat iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Eventually I just dumped it and got a new one, and I am much more careful about storage.  </li>
            <li>I had to open and use it right away!</li>
            <li>So many perks: it literally took me half the time as before to straighten my hair, my hair stayed pin straight all day</li>
            <li>The CHI was effective, but left my hair feeling dry and took away some of the sheen.  </li>
            <li>i have curly spanish/african american hair (the good hair as black people call it), but</li>
            <li>make sure you buy an authentic one that is really covered by a warranty, because this fake iron is not.</li>
            <li>Even when I put the iron on 350, I still ended up with my normal straight texture.</li>
            <li>Straightening would take forever and by the afternoon it would be so full and wavy that I would have to pull it back.  </li>
            <li>When this flat iron arrived at my house, i was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t nearly get as hot as the CHI.  </li>
            <li>With the FHI, I was able to leave it down all day and no touch ups needed.  </li>
            <li>I would not buy this product again, and I would not recommend an FHI Heat tool to anyone interested in a product that offers high quality AND longevity.</li>
            <li>This flat iron has adjustable temp settings and it gets hair super straight.  </li>
            <li>Glad that I finally got a flat iron that does not snag or pull...heats up fast and straightens after one pass.</li>
            <li>On top of this, my straightening time is almost cut in half.</li>
            <li>Plus I think this one is an older version</li>
            <li>First of all, it took 5-10 minutes to get hot enough to style with it.</li>
            <li>I gave my older one to my mother since I moved out</li>
            <li>- it glides down my hair pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li>After washing and conditioning my hair with mixed chicks, and blow drying it with FHI Hot Sauce,the flat ironing was the easy part.</li>
            <li>As an African American female who recently decided to grow out my hair relaxer, these flat irons are perfect (they would be even if my hair was relaxed).</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try my new flat iron out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand.  </li>
            <li>The iron does an amazing job of getting my hair straight whether it is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I love this flat iron</li>
            <li>Maybe there is something else I should be coating my hair with prior to flat ironing to hold it better.</li>
            <li>Maybe there is something else I should be coating my hair with prior to flat ironing to hold it better.</li>
            <li>I got this flat iron 11 months ago as a gift and loved it until it just died a few days ago.  </li>
            <li>If you want a fully 100% guaranteed item with manufacturer warranty, then order from a FHI authorized seller and pay a little more.</li>
            <li>This flat iron manages to tame the fro and makes it look so gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>The use of this specific iron gives you soft beautiful hair without damaging due to dry heat.</li>
            <li>I  poo, DC then dried her hair and then the magic began .</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast, only 3 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>A Platform model would normally be around $[...], on sale.  </li>
            <li>My hair came out full of volume, and it lasted just as long as it does when I go to the hair salon; a month.</li>
            <li>It works great on my thick natural hair, so I can only imagine what It would do if you had a perm!</li>
            <li>My other one works fine, but I wanted to try this one.</li>
            <li>The flat iron worked pretty well, but I don&#x27;t really see what the hype is all about.</li>
            <li>One pass, and my naturally wavy hair is straight, shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>Oh and I am African American with fine to medium hair</li>
            <li>I am on #2 though, because I wasn&#x27;t careful about how I stored the original.  </li>
            <li>and if you are looking for a quality product this flat iron is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>However, when I use the Platform correctly, my hair is bouncy, silky, super soft, swinging and shiny and just as pretty if not prettier than it is when I go to the salon - especially when I style it with big waves or curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so please with my new FHI styling Iron.  </li>
            <li>It still works like new.</li>
            <li>I knew it was time for a new look.</li>
            <li>These plates smooth right through all types of hair with no resistance and leave behind intense SHINE!  </li>
            <li>so I definitely wild recommend this particular one.</li>
            <li>Your hair will look silky and healthy with these two products (plus a little jojoba oil!)</li>
            <li>I got mine for Christmas and was excited, and it did in fact work, my hair was straight and shiny and I have naturally tight curls,</li>
            <li>have to admit does not use on a regular basis, but only received no more than 5 good months of usage if that much with that item.  </li>
            <li>The only reson I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the first time I used it the FHI logo that covers the strews where the 2  plates meet fell off, however it continues to work well</li>
            <li>I originally used a Solano Blue Sapphire straightener and when it finally died, I freaked out.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fact that the outside doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it&#x27;s too unbearable to hold while styling.</li>
            <li>It lasted 4 years--FOUR YEARS--for those of you shopping for your first iron, four years is an ETERNITY for a straightening iron to last.</li>
            <li>The box and product appeared to be the same as my other fhi irons (which I purchased from an authorized dealer), authentic.  </li>
            <li>If you are wondering what brand to get... look no more, but make sure you get this one.</li>
            <li>you will more than likely not want to use any other product line.</li>
            <li>With other irons, I would have to turn the temperature up, or iron the same piece of hair 3 or 4 times, causing more damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>No breakage, no thinning and it glides and staightens with one pass, even on natural hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really easy to add a little curl to your hair.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic - it heats up super fast, just a few strokes and your hair is totally straight, but it&#x27;s not cheap, so do yourself a favor and do not wrap the cord around it when you&#x27;re not using it.  </li>
            <li>The previous iron, another very widely available make, just didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I usually ended up spending a lot of money, loving the results, but only having them for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am interested in purchasing the FHI flat iron again (after 4 yrs).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in purchasing the 3/4 inch flat iron in order to get close to the roots.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and coarse, usually takes me about 1 hr or more to get il really straight...</li>
            <li>First, let me give my review of this flat iron.</li>
            <li>The cord is extra long which has proven to be useful more than a few times.  </li>
            <li>With this one, though, the flat iron heats up fast, straightens my hair fast, and leaves my hair looking healthy - none of that flat iron dead looking frizz.</li>
            <li>With that in mind, if you don&#x27;t blow dry your hair out enough or you flat iron in sections that are too big it will not come out as nice.</li>
            <li>Let me just make it clear that if it is making your hair steam, it is drying it out and damaging your hair.</li>
            <li>I used this flatiron on my daughters naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t fault the product for that either, I completely blame myself.  </li>
            <li>I bought it from an authorized dealer an the differences were astonishing:(1) where there should be a registered trademark sign, there is just a degree sign, (2)There is no company information as far as contact information on the box of the non-authentic iron, (3)</li>
            <li>In short FHI works really well</li>
            <li>Since transitioning and going all natural I needed another iron.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I really recommend buying this product especially for the price thats advertised at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been to the hair dresser since i brought my FHI Heat Platform 1 Inch Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Styling Iron with Nano-Fuzeion Technology.</li>
            <li>i was using a revlon ceramic before which was a couple of years old, so it was time for an upgrade.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need to touch it up at all the next day, and it heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>Im an AA with natural hair</li>
            <li>I also like that it can last for a whole day with it puffing up.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>before i knew, my hair basically melted, and was just completely messed up</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it would straighter coarse hair jut as fast as it does mine.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky...not to mention the mobility.</li>
            <li>- I was hoping the FHI would pack the same punch, but in the end it takes me a couple passes to get it perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>They stated that they do not warranty any product not sold by them directly or through a professional beauty salon.</li>
            <li>So while any heat is damaging to the hair, i feel better knowing I&#x27;m using the least amount of heat</li>
            <li>FHI Professional Platform Flatiron 1\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and this is the professional unit.  </li>
            <li>the price at a \\&quot;professional salon\\&quot; or their website.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product</li>
            <li>At first it looked the same, but the half I straightened with FHI was much softer, felt a little straighter, and held more shine.</li>
            <li>and then I blow dry with my Gold and Hot hair drier and a comb attachment.</li>
            <li>I was very leary about using a flat iron and the FHI heat platform 1 inch professional ceramic tourmaline styling iron with nano-fuzeion technology was recommended to me by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>I really like this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I really recomend this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have used gold n hot and stove hot combs in the past but nothing every gave the results like the FHI Platform.</li>
            <li>I am a African American woman with very course kinky frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the CHI for a few years which I liked, but this one smooths and straightens my hair in a lot less time than the CHI.  </li>
            <li>They refused to replace the product because the return window had closed, even though they are aware that as being unauthorized resellers of the product the manufacturer&#x27;s guarantee does not apply.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron gets hot like it states, but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I purchased a jose&#x27; eber flat iron who is a world known celebrity stylist, although it is more expensive it is so worth the money.</li>
            <li>I cannot go to a new salon without being told that I \\&quot;have the thickest hair they&#x27;ve ever seen on a white girl\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>So far, this flat iron has done a great job of straightening my thick, coarse, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>The iron works very well on dry hair.</li>
            <li>It seems to work very well, does not leave hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with my straightening iron before it broke, but a short lifespan and unreliability from this product appear to be common complaints.</li>
            <li>(I have naturally thick curly/course hair which frizzez so easily).</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and it probably takes me half the time to get my hair super straight (I have really thick, naturally wavy hair too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a natural African American woman with 4b/4c hair and it got my hair silky straight with body and movement in only two passes per section at 350 degrees heat.</li>
            <li>It literally just stop heating up right when i was half way through finishing my hair for a touch up.</li>
            <li>Less than a year later, the cord is shorting out and the straightener won&#x27;t stay on unless I position the cord in such a way that the light remains lit.</li>
            <li>Whoever makes this fake actually makes a pretty decent iron, but I am sure you can get a flat iron for the same quality for cheaper.</li>
            <li>During the fall/winter I generally use it a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li>This flat iron was complete junk to me!</li>
            <li>It barely could straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I do not have a relaxer or anything and as soon as I step outside into even 1% humidity my hair would turn into dang near an afro..until I got my FHI heat platform.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that in addtion to getting my hair pin straight, I can also get a very loose curl with just a flick of the wrist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve retired my one year old $90 straightener and am currently seeking another.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had numerous comments on how soft my hair looks since I&#x27;ve got this.</li>
            <li>The hair has since fallen out and she has a bunch of short ends near her scalp.</li>
            <li>you want any warranty, then you have to buy directly from the FHI website where we will double the price\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the same iron directly from my salon to get a warranty.  </li>
            <li>For the amount I paid, I expected the iron to work for much longer than that.</li>
            <li>I love the fact you can set the temperature up to 400 degrees, I have thick curly hair that needs the extra heat, but I only need to set it at 370.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to look for a less expensive straightener on here with good reviews because in my opinion a straightener that&#x27;s close to $100 should last much longer than one year.</li>
            <li>I have thick short hair and it is easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>Her hair was extremely Shiney  and straight</li>
            <li>my flat iron just completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS FLAT IRON</li>
            <li>After using the flat iron my hair is soft, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I still lose hair due to the pulling effect but it still isnt as much as Chi.</li>
            <li>I purchased this flat iron in 2011 and it looks like new even with extensive wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a cheap iron and finally broke down and spent the money to buy a nicer one.  </li>
            <li>African American natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural african american hair</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about if it would really be professional grade, but I am pleasantly pleased to see that it is.  </li>
            <li>I started noticing a major difference in how my hair felt when I left the salon vs. when I did it myself.</li>
            <li>FHI won&#x27;t do anything since Amazon is not a \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; retailer and they can&#x27;t verify that it is even an original product, which is shady business practices in my opinion!</li>
            <li>However, I consider it a MAJOR flaw on Amazon&#x27;s part that they are not presently disclosing in the listing for this item that Amazon is not an authorized reseller and that the manufacturer will therefore not honor any warranty on this item.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised it has lasted this long, so if there are two things I will definitely vouch for 1.</li>
            <li>I only use my straightener about once a week-not nearly enough for this \\&quot;high quality product\\&quot; to last me such a short time.</li>
            <li>Paid too much for this; not worth the price.  </li>
            <li>The replacement one I had for almost a whole 30 days until it to broke just the other day and the same way!</li>
            <li>My hair is definitely straighter, smoother and silkier than when i used the old flat iron.</li>
            <li>and I only keep them set to barely 300 degrees.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like about the iron is that I expected my hair to get straighter than what it normally gets.</li>
            <li>Is this true and I am that naive or did FHI just slander Amazon???</li>
            <li>So I was super excited to get this flat iron, but ended up very disappointed after the first use!!</li>
            <li>with this flat iron I am done in less than 30 min, and it is suuuper straight!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disappointed with the flat iron because I thought buying a professional flat iron would last longer than 6 months.</li>
            <li>Forget all the wet to dry crap, if you want a reliable straightener that will work for years, this is the one to buy--definitely worth the price, and definitely superior to CHI.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve dropped my iron several times, so the plates are loose, but they&#x27;re old and dropping them is totally my fault</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> But it does a very nice job taking care of your hair and straighten it.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find the best price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Loved it while it worked.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found out that the FHI Heat Platform was really good in straightening hair.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t afford the Runway, my hair stylist says the Platform series is good</li>
            <li> I always loved how my stylist straightened my hair, but I could never replicate it at home.  </li>
            <li> The seller is great also, super-fast shipping and nicely wrapped.</li>
            <li> I found it at Amazon with free shipping and also Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good reviews about</li>
            <li> and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved this iron</li>
            <li> I have exceptionally frizzy hair and always have.  </li>
            <li> Very good irons, they&#x27;re smooth and eavy to handle, I&#x27;m a novice and still got salon looks with these irons</li>
            <li> and I have used many!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love this !</li>
            <li> This is DEFFENTALY the best straightner ever, and sold at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love the FHI styling iron!  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased!</li>
            <li> this iron is AMAZING, as I ran the iron through my daughters  </li>
            <li> They work amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I was able to add some gorgeous Shiney locks.</li>
            <li> I really think this is one of the best hair irons on the market - but take care of it</li>
            <li> WAS nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li> And I REALLY liked that one.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t seem to redo it as often, which is nice.</li>
            <li> This iron and the CHI produce a nice silky effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at the results, honestly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> but i just wanted to make sure it was good, so i tried it.</li>
            <li> I was between this and a CHI, but after using a CHI I decided that I honestly didn&#x27;t like what it did to my hair.</li>
            <li> and it comes in a nice box with a detachable case and heat resistant mat.</li>
            <li> The temperature control is perfect allowing you to gauge how much heat you are using on your hair to help you avoid split ends.</li>
            <li> The protective heat pad included is a nice touch, as well.  </li>
            <li> From the sleek design to the fast heating, buying it was the best decision I made.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST.  </li>
            <li> it makes your hair nice and smoth</li>
            <li> I have nice hair, but still.....</li>
            <li> It does a great job, special after getting steroid shots from a car accident that made my hair feel and look like a Brillo pad.now</li>
            <li> I am a strong believer of good products</li>
            <li> I love my FHI and you should get it cause you will love it too!</li>
            <li> This ceramic iron is excellent for natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not the best flatiron I&#x27;ve ever had (they no longer make my old model)</li>
            <li> but so far its awesome!</li>
            <li> Just saying for all the wonderful reviews here, when it breaks don&#x27;t expect FHI to honor any warranty because \\&quot;we have determined that Amazon is not an authorized professional salon</li>
            <li> Make sure you sure the appropriate oil for straightening your hair too!</li>
            <li> But all in all, I was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I asked my stylist how she got my hair so straight and beautiful</li>
            <li> The first one worked great for two weeks and then stopped heating up.</li>
            <li> I loved the FHI platform iron the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> This was such a good deal on a great iron.</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> Additionally I love the adjustable heat setting.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is check the box and do your comparisons with an authentic FHI to the one that you are looking into purchasing on ebay/amazon.  </li>
            <li> so I am returning this for a better one probably from another buyer as well.</li>
            <li> fyi, make sure to purchase the FHI platform.  </li>
            <li> iron\\&quot; as many would describe it to be, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried every hair straightener and this one is the absolute best- 100% worth the money</li>
            <li> Simply the BEST .</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> SURE YOU GIVE IT A RUN FOR ITS MONEY TO MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> IT WORKS FOR MORE THAN 14 DAYS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an issue for me because I was able to adjust.  </li>
            <li> Hope this helps. :)</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I purchased one for myself about a year ago and paid a lot more for it.  </li>
            <li> The FHI Platform straightens coarser hair without breakage, in fact, the more you use it the better your hair looks and the smoothier your ends.</li>
            <li> have different hair types so the dial control is great because I can adjust the temperature for each one!</li>
            <li> But, i love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wavy/puffy most of the time, but if I use products I can get a curl to come out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Hope this review helps. :)</li>
            <li> I tried it and fell in love.</li>
            <li> It was magical.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It also had variable heat, which so many of the irons in this price range do not have.</li>
            <li> She finds the 1\\&quot; size to be the most flexible.</li>
            <li> I have loved my CHI and it has done a great job for several years now.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a buying must!! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> and it is a top quality straightener.</li>
            <li> just seemed to be better quality.  </li>
            <li> My younger sister has had hers for about 4 or 5 years and it still works beautifully!</li>
            <li> LOVE FHI.&lt;br /&gt;SPEND</li>
            <li> It works great and maintains the heat very well.  </li>
            <li> My hair look so much better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li> Most satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> im getting one more</li>
            <li> and I love the temp control.  </li>
            <li> Amazon often has better prices so the risk is up to you.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many of these through the years.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and i am glad i choose this.</li>
            <li> Try it you will love it as well.</li>
            <li> I really love my ceramic tourmaline.  </li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just looking forward to learn how to make curls :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> I had the CHI before this straightner, and I like this one much better.</li>
            <li> This one heats up to 450 degrees, which makes you able to straighten your hair in minutes.</li>
            <li> It also does curls nicely and heat up extremely fast!!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is ok, but not the best.</li>
            <li> The case is more impressive than the flat iron itself.  </li>
            <li> Pay no attention to any review that says this is not the most awesome flat iron ever.</li>
            <li> No wonder it is rated as one of the best flat irons on the market.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever.  </li>
            <li> After my flat iron burned up I did some research on which brand would be the best.  </li>
            <li> She said it&#x27;s the best flat iron</li>
            <li> I have spend hundreds of dollars in search for the perfect flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Flat iron is great!!  </li>
            <li> in fact it was one of the best flat irons Ive ever used that could straighten my curls so well.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used</li>
            <li> The flat iron worked wonderfully while it worked.  </li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length relaxed hair and this flat iron is amazing!!!!!!</li>
            <li> When it did work my daughter said it was the best flat iron she ever used and made her hair feel silky.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron--</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> This flat iron is Awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron in the world!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron ever!</li>
            <li> the best flat iron i have ever used!</li>
            <li> and i must say it did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Mostly I consider Amazon.com to be THE top seller on the Internet due to their excellent customer service policy and their flexible ordering system.</li>
            <li> Doens&#x27;t pull, easy to clean, and still heats up nicely.</li>
            <li> couple up some great hair products with this flat iron &amp; you have a winning combination!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works quick, it&#x27;s light weight (unlike my original Solano that I loved so dearly), it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, you can use it to make curls as well as straighten, etc.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels smooth and healthy after each curl.</li>
            <li> She had been using my CHI flatiron because it worked so much more smoothly than the inexpensive one she had bought for herself.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I was able to return the Sedu and replace it with this FHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, its great!</li>
            <li> The hair never gets caught during use and the grip makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and my hair is softer after I use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to spend hundreds of dollars pursuing legal action, so the best I can do is warn others.</li>
            <li> They are both great flat irons but for my hair type FHI was recommended the most.</li>
            <li> but this is hands down the best straightener I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this flat iron after doing a lot of research on it and thought it would be awesome and for such a good discount.</li>
            <li> I have to use a lot of product to stop my hair from reverting by the end of the day, which is fine because that means the ironing isn&#x27;t damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to use a lot of product to stop my hair from reverting by the end of the day, which is fine because that means the ironing isn&#x27;t damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> but o have to say that I have fine hair</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, has a temperature gauge and is light weight.</li>
            <li> I like it very much it is so easy to use and makes the hair smooth rapidly</li>
            <li> I purchased the FHI Platform because of the reviews that I read for fine hair.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was safely packaged.</li>
            <li> Esp using Paul Mitchells Super Skinny sebrum(Expensive!)</li>
            <li> This flat iron curls beautifully but for some reason</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really nit-picky too, but I like that the plug doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space (like I can plug it in on top of my hair dryer) -- then it can start heating up while I&#x27;m finishing up drying my hair!</li>
            <li> It heats very quickly and does a great job straightening my coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my hair shiny and straight!!  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> It even had free Shipping..</li>
            <li> Iron is great for my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I hope the price will be just a cheap.</li>
            <li> The adjustable temperature feature is great - it can go as low as 140 degrees to 450.</li>
            <li> My hair glided through the plates and was silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It has cut my straightning time and my hair is a lot shinier and frizz free unlike Chi.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go cheap b/c</li>
            <li> Platform is smooth....</li>
            <li> and it was free.</li>
            <li> This iron is simply fabulous.  </li>
            <li> &quot; light was faded and the straightener wasn&#x27;t heating up.</li>
            <li> The ceramic plates are smooth and help to straighten and make your hair silky</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li> I try to order items &#x27;sold by Amazon&#x27; and if I can&#x27;t, I research the seller that is available.</li>
            <li> My roommate came home later that night and asked if I went to the salon, that is how great it looks.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the $200 as advertised nor can I tell that it&#x27;s better than a Chi iron.</li>
            <li> I am also pleased with the seller&#x27;s fast shipment and safe packaging of the item.  </li>
            <li> Because I love it so much, I purchased another one on Amazon at a much better price.  </li>
            <li> So, so far, so good.</li>
            <li> The best part is as we all approach economic hardships we can look like we just left the salon.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, it is very light and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> What more can one say except that the price was right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money, and you get such a good deal here!    </li>
            <li> This is the absolute best flat iron ever.</li>
            <li> Hair is smoother, and gets hair straight, the best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Other than that we liked that the FHI had a variable heat setting, and it does do a good job of smoothing the hair.</li>
            <li> But like I said earlier, it curls very very very nicely</li>
            <li> This particular version has a much longer cord, which is great.</li>
            <li> Great Flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is GREAT.  </li>
            <li> Love it and would highly recommend it for anyone seeking healthy hair.</li>
            <li> It doesnt even show temperature setting but heats up so hot it smokes but does not damage hair because it has infrared, truly amazing and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works every bit as well as my previous model, and my hair looks great -- so much better than it had with the Sedu.  </li>
            <li> SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> For example, they say that their hairdryer is unique because of its AC motor.</li>
            <li> Straightens my very curly hair so easily!  </li>
            <li> [...]  This is the best investment I have ever made for my hair.  I am so excited to be stylying my hair with same tool the professional use.  </li>
            <li> going on different websites looking at people reviews and checking out the latest technology in flat ironS and let me tell this is the best for the money.</li>
            <li> (at least when I wrote this review) Enjoy :D</li>
            <li> Leaves a smooth finish and allows quick styling.</li>
            <li> but the iron tends to make ur hair feel really clean...</li>
            <li> My hair looked so silky and felt so soft that I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite irons ever!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing flat iron ever!</li>
            <li> So I ordered another one and it arrived faster than I expected and it works great.  </li>
            <li> The day my FHI heat 1 inch Platform came, I spent 3 hours straightening, curling, flipping and having a great time.</li>
            <li> With Sincere Thanks.</li>
            <li> and im getting a full refund.</li>
            <li> After much research I&#x27;m glad I picked this one.  </li>
            <li> Oh, if you&#x27;re wondering why I didn&#x27;t stick with the ION from Sallys...well, the plates were showing signs of aging and it took more passes for me to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> Got it this week from Target, but had points, so I didn&#x27;t pay full price.   </li>
            <li> My hair looks very shiny after I use it, and it is able to withstand humidity.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not up to true FHI standards</li>
            <li> The straight lasted three weeks and prob even more if I didn&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought it again.</li>
            <li> The one I currently use is still in good condition after 2 years.</li>
            <li> Only lasted maybe a good year...</li>
            <li> It also curls much easier and leaves more bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is super shiny and I must say I am IN LOVE with my new FHI !!</li>
            <li> I wasnt expecting to run it more than twice since I have pretty much straight, fine, medum length hair with waves at the end</li>
            <li> In fairness, I should preface that this is the first new flat iron I&#x27;ve had in 10 years, but I&#x27;m incredibly impressed.</li>
            <li> It gets hot and stays hot, and the plates run very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a good flat iron</li>
            <li> The flat iron is good when it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> i plugged it up, and i worked fine at first, but then it automatically shut off.</li>
            <li> this by far has been the best money spent.</li>
            <li> It makes the hair SUPER SILKY.....</li>
            <li> Vendor shipped quickly and product was just as advertised.</li>
            <li> She uses it on our eight year old daughter&#x27;s unprocessed hair to wonderful effect as well.</li>
            <li> It gets super hot and is a relatively light.</li>
            <li> I think the FHI is a great flat iron, heats up quickly and works very well</li>
            <li> FHI&#x27;s Hot Sauce makes a HUGE difference when using this iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll warn you that they get very hot.</li>
            <li> This is my second FHI flat iron and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot</li>
            <li> it may be a five star item, i just havent used it very much yet!</li>
            <li> also bought the heat protectant FHI Hot Sauce, but I decided I didn&#x27;t like it, because the flat iron would do such a great job making my hair nice and smooth that if I used the Hot Sauce my hair would get greasy</li>
            <li> It gets very hot, and maintains that heat.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Also I used this flat iron with the Hot Sauce heat protectant and it works amazing!</li>
            <li> It is very hot</li>
            <li> As long as you mosturize your hair before styling you are good to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to give a really good review, but I personally think the Hai worked better.</li>
            <li> The unit works really well, and heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> I dont even have to blow dry my hair good.</li>
            <li> Today was my first time using this baby, and my goodness it did wonders to my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and these definitely would be my most used!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite flatiron by far!  </li>
            <li> Did not realize it at first as i had hair braided most of the time, when my daughter finally pulled out to use, barely able to do so as the heat was not as advertised.</li>
            <li> The FHI is a great flat iron that was highly recommended by my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> Excellent to straighten natural black hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous buying this product but to my surpise it works great.</li>
            <li> The flatiron gets hot quickly and work quickly.</li>
            <li> I can only tell you, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair smooth</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It does not fry your hair and is worth the $100.00.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I paid about $200 for it, and it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> but I was looking for something more suited for natural and thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Left my hair with a nice sheen and did not feel damaged.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is better by far.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday because her old one broke after use for many years</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> but it was definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> the fact that this iron gets to 410 degrees like salon irons makes it worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> so worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> So since I didn&#x27;t think they were worth me.</li>
            <li> (It gets REALLY hot quick too)</li>
            <li> It stopped getting hot really quickly.  </li>
            <li> I went with this one based on the other good reviews.</li>
            <li> This flat iron does a nice job and is helping my hair to get smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the CHI, but for some reason it was making my hair very frizzy, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S NOT A BEAUTY COMPANY, SAYS SO RIGHT</li>
            <li> It cuts time to straighten my long hair to just 15minutes, I love it and my hair comes out silky smooth</li>
            <li> I am glad I invested the money into a new flat iron,because my hair seems to love it.</li>
            <li> And being a mom of two kids, a extra 20 min less of having to do my hair is awesome in my book.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it for a while before reviewing, as my last flat iron was great to start but quickly deteriorated (it was a HAI for reference).</li>
            <li> had full head weave, none of my real hair out)</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and healthy and does a great job even with my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I certainly hope that Amazon gets on the ball and addresses this issue quickly.</li>
            <li> Of course FHI is a little more pricy than most</li>
            <li> These flat irons get very hot and make your hair very straight without burning or scorching your hair!!!</li>
            <li> The plates did not touch so my hair went right through the iron, didn&#x27;t see at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered FHI Irons before but for some reason this one was not as good as the previous one I owned.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, gets my hair straight and silky smooth and it stays that way.</li>
            <li> The first one got damaged in shipping and they replaced it right away - even before I returned the first one.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> very much it is the best&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hope it last more than 4 years this time.</li>
            <li> and I would have to push them in and hold it at a funny angle to get the iron to heat</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to go any higher than 350 in fear of getting heat damage.</li>
            <li> I have had it for 5 years now, and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li> It still gets as hot as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> The first one we bought from Amazon lasted 1 year and then stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I actually like it better than the GVP (CHI knock off)</li>
            <li> **).    </li>
            <li> i just got this model and used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> and I can definitely say I am completely satisfied with my purchase of the FHI heat platform.</li>
            <li> However,if you are inexperienced,you should stick to the more wider plates that have a thicker back for heat protection.</li>
            <li> The first lasted 6 years, with almost-daily use.  </li>
            <li> and then my hair gets BONE STRAIGHT !</li>
            <li> First off, I qualified for Amazon Prime which meant my delivery would take 2 days</li>
            <li> I am going to the FHI Hot Sauce because I cant wait to see the results of the two combined together.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t even get as hot as my CHI</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and it made my hair healthier</li>
            <li> ...the first one I had just died.</li>
            <li> My hair has met its match, thanks FHI!</li>
            <li> Still works as well as when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for two years and has not failed me.</li>
            <li> which I wasn&#x27;t aware of.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several CHI iron&#x27;s and FHI works way better.</li>
            <li> It works better than the chi and seems to make your hair last longer.</li>
            <li> I then decided that the because this product is still being sold on Amazon and at a higher cost than what I paid,  I decided that the seller and others needed to know that this product was defective.</li>
            <li> I even got the Hot Sauce by FHI and that still didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Did not last more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying it daily</li>
            <li> Functional for the first year.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Flat iron is wasy to handle and very light weight.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this flat iron and I can honestly say it was one of the best purchases I have made in a long, long time.   </li>
            <li> After paying $90 dollars, I am highly upset and out of a once amazing flat iron and money.</li>
            <li> My wife says this one glides over her hair even more smoothly than the previous model.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does an overall fabulous job.</li>
            <li> I had an old and cheap Vidal Sassoon flat iron that was okay.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of this FHI Professional Ceramic Tourmaline 1 inch Styling Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> I love my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have semi curly/kinky hair, and I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> My clients love the results from this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many flat irons (including the CHI)</li>
            <li> Much better flat iron with a 4 year warranty -</li>
            <li> I have used this flat iron for 4 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> any event, I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> In any event, I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> I never thought you could fall in love with a flat iron</li>
            <li> She was using the Hai 2\\&quot; and wanted a 1\\&quot; flat iron to be able to also curl her hair.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so pleased with this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Never used a better  flat iron.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite flat irons.</li>
            <li> Love the iron works perfect but after a year had to replace it and purchase a new one the exact same because of the way my customers hair would shine and straighten after the first stroke, you dont have to keep going over the same section several different times</li>
            <li> FHI has been my favorite flat iron always!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally do reviews on products but had to do a review on this one!!  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist has done a wonderful job doing my hair but its getting to be very costly, and also difficult securing appointments.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to start wearing my t-laxed (texturized) hair straight more often.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive the fhi 1\\&quot; flat iron.</li>
            <li> The iron heats VERY fast and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde hair that styles pretty easily - but it does get frizzy sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Originally, I like it because it straightens my natural hair very well</li>
            <li> and all I was looking for was a more flat straight look.</li>
            <li> My cheap Jilbere (the light grey one with red plates) straightens my hair much better leaving it soft, silky and bouncy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, silky and full of body.</li>
            <li> Not only does this flat iron straighten my hair so good to the point where it looks like I have a relaxer, but it really does repel humidity as advertised.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super silky and soft.</li>
            <li> It heated up quickly, made my hair soft and straightened it well</li>
            <li> This straightener is a good straightener, but it doesn&#x27;t last long for what you pay for it.</li>
            <li> They both look fine however felt different.</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed that wasn&#x27;t too great was that if you&#x27;re not careful you can snag your hair on the end of the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I turn it on high and just use it when its feels hot.</li>
            <li> FHI was my first high end styling iron.</li>
            <li> It is straight, very manageable, and much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really speeds up the process of getting ready.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair very managable</li>
            <li> and I really like the look.</li>
            <li> and it really does the trick, check out his site.</li>
            <li> The rounded edge of the plates really do eliminate snags.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and east to use.</li>
            <li> It works really well 2.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll forget how much you paid for it.</li>
            <li> ** update, this has happened to me, so I don&#x27;t use this iron as much anymore.</li>
            <li> there was absolutely a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied with this buy.</li>
            <li> I can create bouncy curls or a straight look that lasts for days.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this iron!</li>
            <li> My daughter used to have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t have a lock feature, I don&#x27;t really think that matters much.  </li>
            <li> The iron itself works really well</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I really recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> so much for saving any money..</li>
            <li> By not disclosing that Amazon is not authorized and that there is no warranty: 1) Amazon is legally responsibility for fulfilling the terms of the warranty.</li>
            <li> However just running the starightener once will not get it straight.</li>
            <li> atleast 3 times to get straight hair to my satisfaction versus running it 5 times with Chi.</li>
            <li> and it is straight and shiny thanks to FHI.</li>
            <li> I can run the iron through a segment of my hair once and it is straight.</li>
            <li> With the FHI I always get the same sleek, smooth look.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have so much body and volume, i cant stops swinging my hair.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and irons fast too.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair already, but wanted to keep the frizzies out and give it a bounce at the end.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays straight all day.</li>
            <li> ; I have an FHI professional hair dryer that was also well worth the price (going on year 3 now).</li>
            <li> I like the fast heat up and the ceramic coating.</li>
            <li> This iron gives me silky straight hair at a lower temperature with one pass.</li>
            <li> I have AA relaxed bra-strap hair and this makes it silky, shinny and straight with one pass...</li>
            <li> If it can make my hair straight it can do anything.</li>
            <li> I can go from curly to straight with no blow out.</li>
            <li> It really straightens our hair really well.  </li>
            <li> Just saying, dont&#x27; expect much.</li>
            <li> I also find myself not having to straighten my hair as much with this iron.</li>
            <li> and they worked very well until sometime in Nov 2012.</li>
            <li> (I have really curly hair).</li>
            <li> The one thing that I like most about the iron is that it can get extremely hot and it runs smoothly down my hair shaft.</li>
            <li> In the end, my first iron started shorting, so I decided to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> Ok I just received the FHI iron in the mail today, and i definitely have to say it works very well, my own hair stylist uses a iron similar to this one, it was one of the main reasons i wanted it, due to almost a week after getting my hair done it would begin to frizz.</li>
            <li> and I have course frizzy hair and while it does do the job, my hair submits to heat and humidity very easily and straightening has little effect on subduing that.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how hot the iron should be, so I just kept trying out different heats on different strands.</li>
            <li> This flat iron doesn&#x27;t seem to leave her hair as smooth.</li>
            <li> The light appears to come on when plugged, but the flat iron will not heat up.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to report it is simply just beautiful.</li>
            <li> Thank you all who wrote wonderful reviews in the past with such honesty and thank you amazon for saving me 50% on this flat iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually I just dumped it and got a new one, and I am much more careful about storage.  </li>
            <li> I had to open and use it right away!</li>
            <li> So many perks: it literally took me half the time as before to straighten my hair, my hair stayed pin straight all day</li>
            <li> The CHI was effective, but left my hair feeling dry and took away some of the sheen.  </li>
            <li> i have curly spanish/african american hair (the good hair as black people call it), but</li>
            <li> make sure you buy an authentic one that is really covered by a warranty, because this fake iron is not.</li>
            <li> Even when I put the iron on 350, I still ended up with my normal straight texture.</li>
            <li> Straightening would take forever and by the afternoon it would be so full and wavy that I would have to pull it back.  </li>
            <li> When this flat iron arrived at my house, i was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t nearly get as hot as the CHI.  </li>
            <li> With the FHI, I was able to leave it down all day and no touch ups needed.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again, and I would not recommend an FHI Heat tool to anyone interested in a product that offers high quality AND longevity.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has adjustable temp settings and it gets hair super straight.  </li>
            <li> Glad that I finally got a flat iron that does not snag or pull...heats up fast and straightens after one pass.</li>
            <li> On top of this, my straightening time is almost cut in half.</li>
            <li> Plus I think this one is an older version</li>
            <li> First of all, it took 5-10 minutes to get hot enough to style with it.</li>
            <li> I gave my older one to my mother since I moved out</li>
            <li> - it glides down my hair pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning my hair with mixed chicks, and blow drying it with FHI Hot Sauce,the flat ironing was the easy part.</li>
            <li> As an African American female who recently decided to grow out my hair relaxer, these flat irons are perfect (they would be even if my hair was relaxed).</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try my new flat iron out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand.  </li>
            <li> The iron does an amazing job of getting my hair straight whether it is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I love this flat iron</li>
            <li> Maybe there is something else I should be coating my hair with prior to flat ironing to hold it better.</li>
            <li> Maybe there is something else I should be coating my hair with prior to flat ironing to hold it better.</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron 11 months ago as a gift and loved it until it just died a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> If you want a fully 100% guaranteed item with manufacturer warranty, then order from a FHI authorized seller and pay a little more.</li>
            <li> This flat iron manages to tame the fro and makes it look so gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> The use of this specific iron gives you soft beautiful hair without damaging due to dry heat.</li>
            <li> I  poo, DC then dried her hair and then the magic began .</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast, only 3 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> A Platform model would normally be around $[...], on sale.  </li>
            <li> My hair came out full of volume, and it lasted just as long as it does when I go to the hair salon; a month.</li>
            <li> It works great on my thick natural hair, so I can only imagine what It would do if you had a perm!</li>
            <li> My other one works fine, but I wanted to try this one.</li>
            <li> The flat iron worked pretty well, but I don&#x27;t really see what the hype is all about.</li>
            <li> One pass, and my naturally wavy hair is straight, shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> Oh and I am African American with fine to medium hair</li>
            <li> I am on #2 though, because I wasn&#x27;t careful about how I stored the original.  </li>
            <li> and if you are looking for a quality product this flat iron is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> However, when I use the Platform correctly, my hair is bouncy, silky, super soft, swinging and shiny and just as pretty if not prettier than it is when I go to the salon - especially when I style it with big waves or curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so please with my new FHI styling Iron.  </li>
            <li> It still works like new.</li>
            <li> I knew it was time for a new look.</li>
            <li> These plates smooth right through all types of hair with no resistance and leave behind intense SHINE!  </li>
            <li> so I definitely wild recommend this particular one.</li>
            <li> Your hair will look silky and healthy with these two products (plus a little jojoba oil!)</li>
            <li> I got mine for Christmas and was excited, and it did in fact work, my hair was straight and shiny and I have naturally tight curls,</li>
            <li> have to admit does not use on a regular basis, but only received no more than 5 good months of usage if that much with that item.  </li>
            <li> The only reson I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the first time I used it the FHI logo that covers the strews where the 2  plates meet fell off, however it continues to work well</li>
            <li> I originally used a Solano Blue Sapphire straightener and when it finally died, I freaked out.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the outside doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it&#x27;s too unbearable to hold while styling.</li>
            <li> It lasted 4 years--FOUR YEARS--for those of you shopping for your first iron, four years is an ETERNITY for a straightening iron to last.</li>
            <li> The box and product appeared to be the same as my other fhi irons (which I purchased from an authorized dealer), authentic.  </li>
            <li> If you are wondering what brand to get... look no more, but make sure you get this one.</li>
            <li> you will more than likely not want to use any other product line.</li>
            <li> With other irons, I would have to turn the temperature up, or iron the same piece of hair 3 or 4 times, causing more damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> No breakage, no thinning and it glides and staightens with one pass, even on natural hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really easy to add a little curl to your hair.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic - it heats up super fast, just a few strokes and your hair is totally straight, but it&#x27;s not cheap, so do yourself a favor and do not wrap the cord around it when you&#x27;re not using it.  </li>
            <li> The previous iron, another very widely available make, just didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I usually ended up spending a lot of money, loving the results, but only having them for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am interested in purchasing the FHI flat iron again (after 4 yrs).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in purchasing the 3/4 inch flat iron in order to get close to the roots.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and coarse, usually takes me about 1 hr or more to get il really straight...</li>
            <li> First, let me give my review of this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The cord is extra long which has proven to be useful more than a few times.  </li>
            <li> With this one, though, the flat iron heats up fast, straightens my hair fast, and leaves my hair looking healthy - none of that flat iron dead looking frizz.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, if you don&#x27;t blow dry your hair out enough or you flat iron in sections that are too big it will not come out as nice.</li>
            <li> Let me just make it clear that if it is making your hair steam, it is drying it out and damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> I used this flatiron on my daughters naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t fault the product for that either, I completely blame myself.  </li>
            <li> I bought it from an authorized dealer an the differences were astonishing:(1) where there should be a registered trademark sign, there is just a degree sign, (2)There is no company information as far as contact information on the box of the non-authentic iron, (3)</li>
            <li> In short FHI works really well</li>
            <li> Since transitioning and going all natural I needed another iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I really recommend buying this product especially for the price thats advertised at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to the hair dresser since i brought my FHI Heat Platform 1 Inch Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Styling Iron with Nano-Fuzeion Technology.</li>
            <li> i was using a revlon ceramic before which was a couple of years old, so it was time for an upgrade.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t need to touch it up at all the next day, and it heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> Im an AA with natural hair</li>
            <li> I also like that it can last for a whole day with it puffing up.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> before i knew, my hair basically melted, and was just completely messed up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it would straighter coarse hair jut as fast as it does mine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky...not to mention the mobility.</li>
            <li> - I was hoping the FHI would pack the same punch, but in the end it takes me a couple passes to get it perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> They stated that they do not warranty any product not sold by them directly or through a professional beauty salon.</li>
            <li> So while any heat is damaging to the hair, i feel better knowing I&#x27;m using the least amount of heat</li>
            <li> FHI Professional Platform Flatiron 1\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and this is the professional unit.  </li>
            <li> the price at a \\&quot;professional salon\\&quot; or their website.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> At first it looked the same, but the half I straightened with FHI was much softer, felt a little straighter, and held more shine.</li>
            <li> and then I blow dry with my Gold and Hot hair drier and a comb attachment.</li>
            <li> I was very leary about using a flat iron and the FHI heat platform 1 inch professional ceramic tourmaline styling iron with nano-fuzeion technology was recommended to me by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I really recomend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have used gold n hot and stove hot combs in the past but nothing every gave the results like the FHI Platform.</li>
            <li> I am a African American woman with very course kinky frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the CHI for a few years which I liked, but this one smooths and straightens my hair in a lot less time than the CHI.  </li>
            <li> They refused to replace the product because the return window had closed, even though they are aware that as being unauthorized resellers of the product the manufacturer&#x27;s guarantee does not apply.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron gets hot like it states, but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I purchased a jose&#x27; eber flat iron who is a world known celebrity stylist, although it is more expensive it is so worth the money.</li>
            <li> I cannot go to a new salon without being told that I \\&quot;have the thickest hair they&#x27;ve ever seen on a white girl\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> So far, this flat iron has done a great job of straightening my thick, coarse, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The iron works very well on dry hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to work very well, does not leave hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with my straightening iron before it broke, but a short lifespan and unreliability from this product appear to be common complaints.</li>
            <li> (I have naturally thick curly/course hair which frizzez so easily).</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and it probably takes me half the time to get my hair super straight (I have really thick, naturally wavy hair too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a natural African American woman with 4b/4c hair and it got my hair silky straight with body and movement in only two passes per section at 350 degrees heat.</li>
            <li> It literally just stop heating up right when i was half way through finishing my hair for a touch up.</li>
            <li> Less than a year later, the cord is shorting out and the straightener won&#x27;t stay on unless I position the cord in such a way that the light remains lit.</li>
            <li> Whoever makes this fake actually makes a pretty decent iron, but I am sure you can get a flat iron for the same quality for cheaper.</li>
            <li> During the fall/winter I generally use it a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was complete junk to me!</li>
            <li> It barely could straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I do not have a relaxer or anything and as soon as I step outside into even 1% humidity my hair would turn into dang near an afro..until I got my FHI heat platform.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that in addtion to getting my hair pin straight, I can also get a very loose curl with just a flick of the wrist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve retired my one year old $90 straightener and am currently seeking another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous comments on how soft my hair looks since I&#x27;ve got this.</li>
            <li> The hair has since fallen out and she has a bunch of short ends near her scalp.</li>
            <li> you want any warranty, then you have to buy directly from the FHI website where we will double the price\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying the same iron directly from my salon to get a warranty.  </li>
            <li> For the amount I paid, I expected the iron to work for much longer than that.</li>
            <li> I love the fact you can set the temperature up to 400 degrees, I have thick curly hair that needs the extra heat, but I only need to set it at 370.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look for a less expensive straightener on here with good reviews because in my opinion a straightener that&#x27;s close to $100 should last much longer than one year.</li>
            <li> I have thick short hair and it is easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> Her hair was extremely Shiney  and straight</li>
            <li> my flat iron just completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> After using the flat iron my hair is soft, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li> I still lose hair due to the pulling effect but it still isnt as much as Chi.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron in 2011 and it looks like new even with extensive wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a cheap iron and finally broke down and spent the money to buy a nicer one.  </li>
            <li> African American natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural african american hair</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about if it would really be professional grade, but I am pleasantly pleased to see that it is.  </li>
            <li> I started noticing a major difference in how my hair felt when I left the salon vs. when I did it myself.</li>
            <li> FHI won&#x27;t do anything since Amazon is not a \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; retailer and they can&#x27;t verify that it is even an original product, which is shady business practices in my opinion!</li>
            <li> However, I consider it a MAJOR flaw on Amazon&#x27;s part that they are not presently disclosing in the listing for this item that Amazon is not an authorized reseller and that the manufacturer will therefore not honor any warranty on this item.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised it has lasted this long, so if there are two things I will definitely vouch for 1.</li>
            <li> I only use my straightener about once a week-not nearly enough for this \\&quot;high quality product\\&quot; to last me such a short time.</li>
            <li> Paid too much for this; not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> The replacement one I had for almost a whole 30 days until it to broke just the other day and the same way!</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely straighter, smoother and silkier than when i used the old flat iron.</li>
            <li> and I only keep them set to barely 300 degrees.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about the iron is that I expected my hair to get straighter than what it normally gets.</li>
            <li> Is this true and I am that naive or did FHI just slander Amazon???</li>
            <li> So I was super excited to get this flat iron, but ended up very disappointed after the first use!!</li>
            <li> with this flat iron I am done in less than 30 min, and it is suuuper straight!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disappointed with the flat iron because I thought buying a professional flat iron would last longer than 6 months.</li>
            <li> Forget all the wet to dry crap, if you want a reliable straightener that will work for years, this is the one to buy--definitely worth the price, and definitely superior to CHI.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve dropped my iron several times, so the plates are loose, but they&#x27;re old and dropping them is totally my fault</li>
            <li> My hair puffed a little in the rain but after re wrapping my hair it was flat and straight again.  </li>
            <li> only my second time ever flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> Two defective flat irons from the same company are enough for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this FHI flat iron as a birthday present about 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> I have had several flat irons before, including Chi...</li>
            <li> My FHI Platform flat iron arrived last week.</li>
            <li> To me, it flat ironed my hair the same as my last flat iron, which is an Andis.</li>
            <li> So, my stylist recommended this flat iron - especially because it has the temp control.  </li>
            <li> I bleach and color my hair every month and obviously use flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron definitely beats its competitors (Chi and Ghd).</li>
            <li> Next, I resection my hair and apply Bio Silk Serum on each section and flat iron my hair in 1/2 inch sections at a time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, as this is the only flat iron I have used.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using this I used a$35 flat iron from Target.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron because my CHI had a short in it and kept turning off while I was using it.  </li>
            <li> They say this flat iron makes hair healthier in 60 days of regular use</li>
            <li> I purchased a second FHI flat iron through Amazon, but it came from Discount Jungle.</li>
            <li> bought a couple of cheaper flat irons prior to this (regretfully) and wish I just went for this to begin with.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this flat iron and I finally decided to get one for myself.  </li>
            <li> I have had these flat irons for 1 year and 5 months and now they are currently not working.</li>
            <li> I have used the FHI several times and despite the current humidity and rain within the past week, my hair stayed straight, flat, shiny and without frizz.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently gotten into tourmaline/ceramic technology and shopped around for a long time before I decided on investing in a FHI.</li>
            <li> Next I section my EXTREMELY thick 3C hair and I distribute FHI Hot Sauce and Dermorganic Argan Oil into each section and comb it out</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t close down on my hair completely when I pulled it through.</li>
            <li> As far as the Technique model goes, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and therefore does not straighten my hair to my satisfaction (Japanese thick black course hair).  </li>
            <li> Upon using it a few times, I noticed the plates were not as smooth going down the hair shaft, nor did they straighten as well as the other fhi irons I have.  </li>
            <li> I have normally straight hair, so I usually leave it at around 300-370.</li>
            <li> I intent the purchase this flat iron again.</li>
            <li> The adjustable temp setting and the extra long swivel cord are a plus.</li>
            <li> Well long story short the end of 2010</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews of others for this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> However, I might say that if you paid for this flat iron what I paid for it, you can buy two from Amazon for the price of one from the FHI site.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SOLD on this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Also, try the FHI Nano Pro 2000 hair dryer before flat ironing (that&#x27;s what I did).</li>
            <li> My stylist turned me on to this flat iron some years ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a flat iron with adjustible heat settings.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron after my CHI broke on me after ONE month.</li>
            <li> I tried this flat iron instead of the CHI.</li>
            <li> It does not curl well like you can with a CHI flat iron.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time, received item on time, and hopefully the product will continue to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I recommend this Flat Iron, Sellers company and Amazon to others for purchases as I have suggested to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> NEVER AGAIN WILL I CONSIDER BUYING A FLAT IRON OF THIS BRAND.</li>
            <li> I never, ever review anything I buy, but after having this flat iron for 5 years now</li>
            <li> This flat iron is something I never leave town without.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quailty product that will last so long</li>
            <li> and I hope that it lasts me 5+ years like my ION Ceramic flat iron from Sallys.      </li>
            <li> I dropped my flat iron on a tile floor and it broke.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this FHI Heat Platform flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I researched the FHI online and found out that she was using this flat iron</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has grown an inch (this could be just growth regardless of the flat iron), and I haven&#x27;t had any split ends.</li>
            <li> I researched and read plenty of reviews before I made my decision of which flat iron to buy, but ended up trying all 3</li>
            <li> flat ironed with my stylist&#x27;s HAI every 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> I am not a pro at flat ironing</li>
            <li> I had a Andis flat iron but that lasted for a like year and some change</li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron if you don&#x27;t mind the price.</li>
            <li> I have been researching these flat irons for a minute now, and I decided to purchase this one.  </li>
            <li> After researching flat irons I decided to give the FHI Platform a try.</li>

            <li> My stylist flat irons</li>
            <li> I needed a flat iron that wouldn&#x27;t cause damage and would add shine.</li>
            <li> Discount Jungle offered to replace it, however, I have no confidence in the quality of the flat iron now and will go with another brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter as it was on her birthday wish list.  </li>
            <li> AND YES, they have Paul Mitchell flat irons.</li>

            <li> I decided to purchase a Sedu Revolution -- this $160 flat iron in no way compared to the FHI.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I have been researching flat irons for about six months...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my flat iron has died.</li>
            <li> , I have had these flat irons for almost a year</li>
            <li> etc they can make knock off FHI flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I would not be purchasing any any flat iron products from amazon at all.</li>
            <li> The flat iron quit working after ONE TIME.  </li>
            <li> I bought my second FHI Heat straightener a little over a year and a half ago, and it worked really well, until one day I turned on the straightener and the red</li>
            <li> It is nearly to my back so very long as well.</li>
            <li> Professional hairstylist who previously used CHI and Paul Mitchell flatirons.</li>
            <li> As a black woman wearing my hair natural, this straightens it with ease.</li>
            <li> It worked, but it took approximately twenty five minutes to completely straighten my dry hair, plus another 10 minutes in touch ups the next morning since my hair refused to stay straight.  </li>
            <li> My wife tried several cheaper versions but they did not live up to their promises.</li>
            <li> i 100% recommend this flat iron!!</li>
            <li> I basically wash, blow dry, and flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> Keep this in mind when buying the flat iron or buy from somewhere else!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this flat iron to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not hot enough to flat iron curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it straighten my hair, but my hair felt softer and silkier than it has with any other flat iron (vs. the CHI).</li>
            <li> It also has a long cord - because it&#x27;s made for professionals.  </li>
            <li> but it could have been because I was leaving it on for a long time.</li>
            <li> While in use, gives off strange fumes that create irritation of eyes and throat.</li>
            <li> My daughter also uses this iron and she has long, thinner hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good iron, but the ionic crap and all the extras they use to describe it to sale it is not anything I can see.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my hairstylist, and she is a true professional, whom I trust and believe would not steer me down the wrong path with my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I am a black female with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased two of the same shoe in a black and red patent leather.</li>
            <li> I have super heavy, thick hair (and lot&#x27;s of it) and</li>
            <li> When I went to purchase a new one, my usual store no longer carried FHI.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron and returned it two weeks later, for the money that is wanted for it, it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Basically, it&#x27;s near impossible to get it straight, even with my old flat iron.</li>
            <li> With my old flat iron I was never sure how my hair would turn out, it always depended on the weather and how often I was styling my hair.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I look forward to other items that they offer for sale in the future.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that because the head is only 1 inch it does take me a little longer to do my hair</li>
            <li> One was bigger than the other</li>
            <li> However I have one draw back of this iron and that is burns the scalp if u get too close but other</li>
            <li> I am a Hairstylist and have purchased less than 6 months ago and the flat iron has burned out because of constant use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will need to blow dry your hair before using the flat iron or let it air dry, it just won&#x27;t work on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flatiron for my daughter who has very long hair.</li>
            <li> Two minor issues that I did not like: (1) the cord gets very tangled and makes it hard to manuver at times, and (2) the temperature setting is on a dial and makes it very easy to change the degrees without realizing you&#x27;ve done so.</li>
            <li> After washing her hair if you don&#x27;t immediatey dry it or twist/braid it ,it becomes unruly.</li>
            <li> I get salon results at home and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> I realized that my stylist (and ALL the other stylists in the salon) used these flat irons -</li>
            <li> THE 100 DOLLARS AND CONSTANT REPLACEMENTS IS NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other options for using the flat iron that are explained in the video on the FHI website</li>
            <li> Good flat iron, however terrible warranty and the life span are not long if you are a Stylist.</li>
            <li> once I flat iron, it&#x27;s literally as thin and straight as any caucasian hair.  </li>
            <li> BUT THE FACT THAT IT BREAKS DOWN TWICE IN A ROW THE SAME WAY IN JUST A MATTER OF WEEKS</li>
            <li> burning down my house, I just put them back in their box and decided to buy another pair but not from an online seller.</li>
            <li> Not very pleased with this product that&#x27;s why I waited to write the review because i needed to see if the item would work or even last long.</li>
            <li> I expected more from FHI Heat, and their warranty system makes it very difficult to justify spending $100 or so on their products when I could spend it on a CHI straightener.</li>
            <li> I previously had the same model, and it lasted four years.</li>
            <li> I was scared that it wont flat iron it so it all came down to Chi and FHI.</li>
            <li> I have been very disappointed in this company&#x27;s products and they will lie all over their marketing to make them seem better than they really are.</li>
            <li> I will say one thing the little plastic disc on the end that says FHI fell off, but it&#x27;s not really a big deal.</li>
            <li> I wish it gripped on to my hair a little closer without me having to use bigger chunks of hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this a little over a year ago - have used it on occasion to straighten my daughter&#x27;s hair maybe a total of 20 times</li>
            <li> bucks I expected it to last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> Coming from an extremely humid state,I moved to Colorado where it is really dry.</li>
            <li> The ends won&#x27;t be as soft and it won&#x27;t look as silky.(I learned this the hard way when I decided to do a rushed \\&quot;flat-ironing / hair straightening job\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic even on a muggy, moisture-ridden Tennessee day.</li>
            <li> Be careful.  </li>
            <li> Straightens well with one try and minimal touch up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I spent alot of time researching this item and price.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> so im curious to find out on the 60 days!If</li>
            <li> They tend to short out and quit working after a few months.</li>
            <li> these little flat irons.</li>
            <li> The shipping took all of two days, but let me tell you I was SICK for those two days w/o this thing, as my hair swells up in humidity and this iron has always been my savior&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Rated low due to iron breaking within 30 days of purchase and not able to use wet to dry, like indicated on packaging.</li>
            <li> I am a black female with natural and very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I guess if I had used it everyday it would have broken within the first year and the warranty may or may not have coverd the damage.</li>
            <li> I had to set this iron almost to its highest temperature for it to perform like my other one.</li>
            <li> The other brands made my hair feel like straw.  </li>
            <li> The other line, FHI technique, does not have adjustable heat settings.</li>
            <li> I will use them again for other purchases.</li>
            <li> I bought this 1.5 years ago and it still works (I use it every other day).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bulky like some of the other irons out there.</li>
            <li> Note that some other FHI models do not have variable heat, but the Platform series does.</li>
            <li> and they said places like Amazon allow other sellers to sell counterfeit products through the Amazon website, therefore they will not even consider my case.</li>
            <li> Amazon does sell items but they are also a vehicle for other sellers.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning and breaking from using extreme heat and relaxers.</li>
            <li> but I would have to wiggle the cord and then other times they wouldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My hair texture is very thick and wavy, I have used flat irons ever since I was very young to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I sent it back immediately, which I rarely, if ever do.  </li>
            <li> I inspected the flat iron and compared it to my other fhi irons and noticed the product is not authentic.</li>
            <li> My Sedu got my hair straight, but left my ends hard and dry and made my hair look damaged, frizzy and horrible after about 2 days of wearing it straight, during the fall - with low</li>
            <li> After receiving a recommendation from my stylist to purchase the FHI flat iron, I have purchased 2 in the past month.</li>
            <li> So I have used flat irons in the past and none of them work for my hair except for Chi..</li>
            <li> I flat iron in small sections</li>
            <li> The base portion of the cord where it swivels is not the same as the other four irons I have (in various sizes), and the heating element seems to only work in the middle of the plate instead of evenly across among other inconsistencies.  </li>
            <li> ,  I am African-American with VERY thick hair, transitioning to natural.</li>
            <li> The results on my hair were fabulous, but I&#x27;m too frustrated to try it again.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint keeping this from being 5 stars is that the letters rub off from the heat.</li>
            <li> UNTIL IT BROKE DOWN just one Week after I got it in the mail</li>
            <li> IF IT BREAKS DOWN ON YOU AFTER THAT.</li>
            <li> I mean, they had them in all different sizes and everything!    </li>
            <li> i usually wash and air dry, when i am finish my hair</li>
            <li> I am a black girl 20 years old with crazy thick hair that reaches the middle of my back</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, african-american hair, so I was a little worried that it wasn&#x27;t going to do the job</li>
            <li> I previously owned a CHI and</li>
            <li> The previous iron I had just use to add to the problem.</li>
            <li> so when i tested it on my hair, i noticed black smoke from the iron.</li>
            <li> all 3 have burned out in less than 6</li>
            <li> so now I have to go a buy another pair of black patent leather pumps</li>
            <li> I compared the CHI Air and FHI by straightening half of my head with each iron.</li>
            <li> and I was a little disappointed at first because if was different than my sisters fhi platform , but it still works well</li>
            <li> Since the max temperature was the same as the T3, I thought I could save some $ by purchasing a less expensive flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have spent lots of $$ in the past for purchases on hair products and</li>
            <li> and I have long thick hair and use it every day since I bought it</li>
            <li> This one is for my granddaughters who have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I takes about 3 hours from start to finish, which is a lonnngggg time, and very tiresome, but very much worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, long hair and</li>
            <li> Also, the encircled logo where it says FHI has popped off which I found a little odd.</li>
            <li> you have thick, curly, coarse, or thin hair without body this flat iron is the way to go!</li>
            <li> However, after just a little over 6 months it no longer heats up.</li>
            <li> Purchased a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> that got a little concerned.</li>
            <li> We examined both irons and found that the FHI has some little clamps that appear to be holding the heating tile in place.</li>
            <li> My friend commented that another brand flat iron that she owns is not good and it was not inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I called and emailed the company and had no success!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER FHI PRODUCT !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it may burn out fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for a few months now</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t perform nearly as well and ends up sitting under my kitchen cabinet.</li>
            <li> and it was not dropped or handled in any harsh way.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just one of the few that were defective</li>
            <li> Have had mine for a few years.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves it, she is a Paul Mitchell trained stylist and works in a Paul Mitchell focus salon, This is one of the few items she uses that is not Paul Mitchell</li>
            <li> A damn waste of my money and no one likes to do that.</li>
            <li> I have semi thick, course, curly/wavy hair that I really hate most of the time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little stiff.  </li>
            <li> Turned it on and was shocked at how fast (less then 1</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s less expensive and it does not work the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually a little worried about getting electrocuted lately because you can hear it popping, so</li>
            <li> I finally decided to spring for an expensive ceramic iron.</li>
            <li> but it definitely proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> I was so angry, that even though I have used chi irons my entire life, I did not want to purchase another.</li>
            <li> Small chips of plastic fell and I did not know where from.</li>
            <li> and it is pointless to iron it in the humid GA summer.</li>
            <li> Ive used Chi for the past 5 yrs</li>
            <li> We had an FHI in the past, which regrettably stopped functioning.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time!</li>
            <li> Not better than the CHI.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> (literally poofed, i have no better way to explain it)</li>
            <li> It was past the 30 day return window for Amazon</li>
            <li> It usually runs for about $180 elsewhere</li>
            <li> It goes past 400 degrees which is one of the differences, and it straightens or flips or curls.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter whose hair was fried from using the chi--would recommend this straightener for anyone who uses a straightener everyday!</li>
            <li> Much worse, not disclosing that there is no warranty on THIS item puts the warranty on every other item sold by Amazon in doubt.</li>
            <li> However I was getting tired of my hair feeling burnt, frizz and losing hair due to the pull.</li>
            <li> but I have never bought a flat iron so expensive.</li>
            <li> She had one lame excuse after another.</li>
            <li> So disappointed that I spent $100 on such a faulty product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, now I don&#x27;t have an excuse for being late because of my hair.</li>
            <li> I learned that lesson the hard way.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that the switch is hard to get to, I was used to my chi with the switch on the side.</li>
            <li> It seems as though the biggest complaint is regarding the warranty of the product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this until too late and can&#x27;t return it now.  </li>
            <li> is wavy and on the thick side.</li>
            <li> and I have thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> We were disappointed to find that the new FHI would sometimes catch in her hair; whereas, the CHI had not.  </li>
            <li> If you are stilling looking for an iron look no more!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I must say, I have tried out ALOT of straightners before, but they were always to dull for me, because I have, thick, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed - it  hardly flattens my hair, even after running it through several times.</li>
            <li> Researched the FHI Irons extensively prior to purchase, and I am slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> anyone who buys will not be disappointed, and if you are then your just to picky and like spending $400 on a flat iron &#x3D;:0</li>
            <li> I have very, very thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and by the way, I have waist-length very thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick hair</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m very disappointed because it was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The FHI was reasonably priced (HANA was outrageous) and does the job I want for my hair in between salon appointments.    </li>
            <li> I am not happy about this product.</li>
            <li> Bought at the end of June and already broken in December.  </li>
            <li> unless u want DAMAGED, BURNT, AN UNHEALTHY HAIR, do not get this product.</li>
            <li> And the price on Amazon isn&#x27;t bad either, I dropped $150 for this iron at Ulta, and I just replaced it due to leaving it in Cali when I was visiting.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find that the new one arrived and started shorting out immediately.  </li>
            <li> The FHI iron leaves my hair dull and dry and gives it a horrible texture when straightening...</li>
            <li> A little disappointed with Amazon with how this was handled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why anybody would have a bad experience with this iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basically disappointed and not sure if I should trust the buyer or not because the picture was misleading too</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been unable to obtain salon results.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they told me that their warranty was void because I had purchased it at Amazon.com, which is not an authorized reseller.  </li>
            <li> I and sadly it makes my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> MAKES THIS ONE OF THE WORST FLAT IRONS TO PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> I found it appalling that someone would say that Amazon allows counterfeit products to be sold on their webite !!</li>
            <li> that was cutting on and off.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m extremely disappointed....</li>
            <li> Too bad after using the iron TWICE, it has already shorted out.  </li>
            <li> YOU will not be disappointed with this purchase. ..</li>
            <li> Sadly this straightener burns your hair and gave me awful split ends.</li>
            <li> (I was stupid)</li>
            <li> Eventually it messed up some of the wires at the base of the iron</li>
            <li> Crap.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> But when I received the FHI Platform I was very disappointed in the lack of quality.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The worst part is Amazon&#x27;s attitude towards the situation.  </li>
            <li> I have insanely curly hair, and this product gets ride of every trace of my curls.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I work in a salon and have been using FHI products for a while. This was such a good deal on a great iron. Just love it.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.  The iron does an amazing job of getting my hair straight whether it is wet or dry.  The cord is extra long which has proven to be useful more than a few times.  Additionally I love the adjustable heat setting.</li>
            <li> As an African American female who recently decided to grow out my hair relaxer, these flat irons are perfect (they would be even if my hair was relaxed). I started noticing a major difference in how my hair felt when I left the salon vs. when I did it myself. I used the same shampoo, conditioner, etc. Once I paid closer attention I realized that my stylist (and ALL the other stylists in the salon) used these flat irons - I mean, they had them in all different sizes and everything!    These flat irons get very hot and make your hair very straight without burning or scorching your hair!!! My hair feels smooth and healthy after each curl. I&#x27;ll warn you that they get very hot. I&#x27;ve had them for a few months now and I only keep them set to barely 300 degrees. (that may change as my relaxer continues to grow out, hehe)</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. No wonder it is rated as one of the best flat irons on the market. It gets super hot and is a relatively light. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am interested in purchasing the FHI flat iron again (after 4 yrs).  However, I discovered FHI does not warrant the product if sold by an unauthorized seller (Amazon).  Another reviewer is correct about the warranty information.  An Amazon customer representative (Maira) said that Amazon will replace the iron or refund my money with a year.  I intent the purchase this flat iron again. Let&#x27;s hope it last more than 4 years this time.</li>
            <li> I used this flatiron on my daughters naturally curly hair. After washing her hair if you don&#x27;t immediatey dry it or twist/braid it ,it becomes unruly. It took about a week to come in the standard mail. The day I got it I put it to the test. Turned it on and was shocked at how fast (less then 1 min)the flatiron reached 410 degrees (max). I  poo, DC then dried her hair and then the magic began . Let me tell u this iron is AMAZING, as I ran the iron through my daughters  hair I watched as this iron transformed her hair. Her hair was extremely Shiney  and straight and once I got the hang of it I was able to add some gorgeous Shiney locks. I have used gold n hot and stove hot combs in the past but nothing every gave the results like the FHI Platform. The only reson I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the first time I used it the FHI logo that covers the strews where the 2  plates meet fell off, however it continues to work well</li>
            <li> bought this item to replace the same model and brand.  Best flat iron ever.  saved about $50 by buying on Amazon.  It even had free Shipping.. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This ceramic iron is excellent for natural hair.  It straightened and leaves the hair with a silky shine.  I also have the 4/10 inch which is perfect for the edges.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is check the box and do your comparisons with an authentic FHI to the one that you are looking into purchasing on ebay/amazon.  I am stuck with a piece of junk that dries my hair out and does not hold up in any weather.  Be careful.  My stylist uses the FHI platform in the salon and I&#x27;ve tried the runway.  They work amazing.  So imagine my surprise when my FHI turns out to look nothing like theirs and doesn&#x27;t even compare in performance.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and works even on damp hair. It really speeds up the process of getting ready.  Unfortunately, now I don&#x27;t have an excuse for being late because of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love my flat iron.  I have used this product before but the one I had was dropped and the plate broke.  So I ordered another one and it arrived faster than I expected and it works great.  My co workers will be ordering theirs from you as well.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. It straightens the hair in one pass. The adjustable temp setting and the extra long swivel cord are a plus. It does not fry your hair and is worth the $100.00. I would reommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> After my flat iron burned up I did some research on which brand would be the best.  I think the FHI is a great flat iron, heats up quickly and works very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this iron almost a year twice a week. It&#x27;s works perfect. Great iron for this price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair straightener for about 4 years now.  I originally used a Solano Blue Sapphire straightener and when it finally died, I freaked out.  My hair dresser suggested this over the Chi that I was debating about and it worked great!  I am on #2 though, because I wasn&#x27;t careful about how I stored the original.  I used to just wrap the cord around the iron, and I later learned this is a big no-no.  Eventually it messed up some of the wires at the base of the iron and I would have to push them in and hold it at a funny angle to get the iron to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I just dumped it and got a new one, and I am much more careful about storage.  It works fantastic - it heats up super fast, just a few strokes and your hair is totally straight, but it&#x27;s not cheap, so do yourself a favor and do not wrap the cord around it when you&#x27;re not using it.  I learned that lesson the hard way.  I don&#x27;t fault the product for that either, I completely blame myself.  I&#x27;ve had my last one for over 2 years now and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works quick, it&#x27;s light weight (unlike my original Solano that I loved so dearly), it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, you can use it to make curls as well as straighten, etc.  I really think this is one of the best hair irons on the market - but take care of it so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I finally decided to spring for an expensive ceramic iron. After reading the reviews and seeing that Amazon had them on sale, I splurged. I can only tell you, it is amazing. I am so done with $20 irons that fry my hair. This iron makes my hair look like it does when my stylist does it.... Worth every penny</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d written a review a week ago, I&#x27;d have given this item 4 stars. It makes my hair very managable and I really like the look. Two minor issues that I did not like: (1) the cord gets very tangled and makes it hard to manuver at times, and (2) the temperature setting is on a dial and makes it very easy to change the degrees without realizing you&#x27;ve done so. But all in all, I was pretty happy with it. Until yesterday. When it. JUST. Quit. Working. Period. Kaput. It will not turn on anymore (and yes, I checked it in different outlets.) Three weeks after the 1-year warranty expired. Convenient ... for the manufacturer.    I will be replacing it, but I think I&#x27;m going to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She said it&#x27;s the best flat iron she&#x27;s ever had. Great Product.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron and returned it two weeks later, for the money that is wanted for it, it is not worth it. I purchased a jose&#x27; eber flat iron who is a world known celebrity stylist, although it is more expensive it is so worth the money. It truly eliminates frizz and if you are looking for a quality product this flat iron is well worth the money. It doesnt even show temperature setting but heats up so hot it smokes but does not damage hair because it has infrared, truly amazing and well worth the money. Oh and I am African American with fine to medium hair and it really does the trick, check out his site.</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron.  I&#x27;ve used the CHI for a few years which I liked, but this one smooths and straightens my hair in a lot less time than the CHI.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in 2008 and i must say it did a pretty good job. I previously owned a CHI and the temperature control on this iron was what I wanted because my CHI didn&#x27;t possess that. Well long story short the end of 2010 my flat iron just completely stopped working. I did some research and decided to get another FHI Heat Platform iron. I bought it from an authorized dealer an the differences were astonishing:(1) where there should be a registered trademark sign, there is just a degree sign, (2)There is no company information as far as contact information on the box of the non-authentic iron, (3) the iron itself looks different. Whoever makes this fake actually makes a pretty decent iron, but I am sure you can get a flat iron for the same quality for cheaper. If you are going to buy an FHI flatiron make sure you buy an authentic one that is really covered by a warranty, because this fake iron is not. Hope this helps! Caveat emptor!</li>
            <li> I received this FHI flat iron as a birthday present about 3 months ago. I wanted to use it for a while before reviewing, as my last flat iron was great to start but quickly deteriorated (it was a HAI for reference). So far, this flat iron has done a great job of straightening my thick, coarse, slightly wavy hair. It gets hot and stays hot, and the plates run very smoothly. This is a great flatiron for the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered FHI Irons before but for some reason this one was not as good as the previous one I owned. I had to set this iron almost to its highest temperature for it to perform like my other one. Plus I think this one is an older version so it probably explains why it doesn&#x27;t work properly. Also, the encircled logo where it says FHI has popped off which I found a little odd. I&#x27;m basically disappointed and not sure if I should trust the buyer or not because the picture was misleading too (it looks nothing like the iron I received). In short FHI works really well so I am returning this for a better one probably from another buyer as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews of others for this flat iron.  It seems as though the biggest complaint is regarding the warranty of the product.  I haven&#x27;t had any reason to use the warranty and therefore cannot comment.  However, I might say that if you paid for this flat iron what I paid for it, you can buy two from Amazon for the price of one from the FHI site.  Something to consider.    But let&#x27;s talk about this product!  It does everything it says it should.  I have spend hundreds of dollars in search for the perfect flat iron.  I&#x27;ve bought from salons, discount stores, department stores, infomercials....you name it.  None compare.  The rounded edge of the plates really do eliminate snags.  These plates smooth right through all types of hair with no resistance and leave behind intense SHINE!  No product necessary.      I&#x27;m SOLD on this flat iron.  I can&#x27;t wait to try others from FHI.</li>
            <li> I have had several flat irons before, including Chi...but this is hands down the best straightener I have ever used.  It makes my hair feel soft and healthy and does a great job even with my thick hair.  The other brands made my hair feel like straw.  I will never use a different brand again!</li>
            <li> Loved it while it worked. However, after just a little over 6 months it no longer heats up. FHI won&#x27;t do anything since Amazon is not a \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; retailer and they can&#x27;t verify that it is even an original product, which is shady business practices in my opinion!</li>
            <li> [...]  This is the best investment I have ever made for my hair.  I am so excited to be stylying my hair with same tool the professional use.  I am so please with my new FHI styling Iron.  It&#x27;s fast and east to use.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this from FHI (a lot more expensive but I wanted that warranty). Today was my first time using this baby, and my goodness it did wonders to my hair! My hair looked so silky and felt so soft that I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it! I have thick, coarse, african-american hair, so I was a little worried that it wasn&#x27;t going to do the job but it definitely proved me wrong. Don&#x27;t hesitate buying this product, people! It&#x27;s well worth the money, and you get such a good deal here!    Also, try the FHI Nano Pro 2000 hair dryer before flat ironing (that&#x27;s what I did). Your hair will look silky and healthy with these two products (plus a little jojoba oil!)</li>
            <li> I purchased this when my $200 T3 Tourmaline from Sephora was short circuited in Europe. Since the max temperature was the same as the T3, I thought I could save some $ by purchasing a less expensive flat iron.  Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t perform nearly as well and ends up sitting under my kitchen cabinet. I am extremely disappointed - it  hardly flattens my hair, even after running it through several times. I will not re-purchase. Looks like I have to pony up the $200 for another T3.</li>
            <li> I have semi curly/kinky hair, and I absolutely love this flat iron. My stylist turned me on to this flat iron some years ago and I use it on both my hair and my mom&#x27;s. And the price on Amazon isn&#x27;t bad either, I dropped $150 for this iron at Ulta, and I just replaced it due to leaving it in Cali when I was visiting. YOU will not be disappointed with this purchase. .. It heats up to 450 degrees!! I have spent lots of $$ in the past for purchases on hair products and this by far has been the best money spent. The shipping took all of two days, but let me tell you I was SICK for those two days w/o this thing, as my hair swells up in humidity and this iron has always been my savior&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a flat iron with adjustible heat settings.  Debated between Hana, Chi and FHI.  My hairdresser recommended FHI (it is the brand used in his salon).  The FHI was reasonably priced (HANA was outrageous) and does the job I want for my hair in between salon appointments.    fyi, make sure to purchase the FHI platform.  The other line, FHI technique, does not have adjustable heat settings.</li>
            <li> I just bought this iron and I was a little disappointed at first because if was different than my sisters fhi platform , but it still works well and I have long thick hair and use it every day since I bought it</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron after my CHI broke on me after ONE month. I was so angry, that even though I have used chi irons my entire life, I did not want to purchase another. I tried this flat iron instead of the CHI. I brought it back the very next day. Although it is in the same price range, there is no comparison to a CHI. My hair texture is very thick and wavy, I have used flat irons ever since I was very young to tame my hair. It is nearly to my back so very long as well. This flat iron was complete junk to me! First of all, it took 5-10 minutes to get hot enough to style with it. It does not curl well like you can with a CHI flat iron. It barely could straighten my hair. I won&#x27;t stray from a CHI again.</li>
            <li> Flat iron is great!!  I was skeptical about if it would really be professional grade, but I am pleasantly pleased to see that it is.  Flat iron is wasy to handle and very light weight.</li>
            <li> The flatiron gets hot quickly and work quickly. I&#x27;m african American and the flatiron does a great job of straightening my hair.  Although it&#x27;s not the best flatiron I&#x27;ve ever had (they no longer make my old model) this is a close second.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Everything was great! Shipped on time, received item on time, and hopefully the product will continue to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> My FHI Platform flat iron arrived last week. It came pretty fast, only 3 days after I ordered it. The following Saturday was my washday and I was excited to try my new flat iron out. The flat iron worked pretty well, but I don&#x27;t really see what the hype is all about. To me, it flat ironed my hair the same as my last flat iron, which is an Andis. The one thing that I like most about the iron is that it can get extremely hot and it runs smoothly down my hair shaft. It is not the \\&quot;perfect iron\\&quot; as many would describe it to be, but it gets the job done. What I don&#x27;t like about the iron is that I expected my hair to get straighter than what it normally gets. Even when I put the iron on 350, I still ended up with my normal straight texture. I don&#x27;t want to go any higher than 350 in fear of getting heat damage. This flat iron is ok, but not the best.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried every hair straightener and this one is the absolute best- 100% worth the money</li>
            <li> Simply the BEST . My clients love the results from this flat iron. It makes the hair SUPER SILKY..... I love it</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of this FHI Professional Ceramic Tourmaline 1 inch Styling Flat Iron.  It works and has all of the features that was described when advertised. I am also pleased with the seller&#x27;s fast shipment and safe packaging of the item.  I recommend this Flat Iron, Sellers company and Amazon to others for purchases as I have suggested to my family and friends. I look forward to other items that they offer for sale in the future.  With Sincere Thanks.</li>
            <li> Purchased a little over a year ago. Iron is great for my coarse hair. Use several irons, this one maybe 5 months out of the year and only once or twice a week. Small chips of plastic fell and I did not know where from. Now the plate has come unattached exposing the inside cords. Out of warranty and I have to replace it. I guess if I had used it everyday it would have broken within the first year and the warranty may or may not have coverd the damage. WAS nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li> So I bought this flat iron after doing a lot of research on it and thought it would be awesome and for such a good discount. I got mine for Christmas and was excited, and it did in fact work, my hair was straight and shiny and I have naturally tight curls, in fact it was one of the best flat irons Ive ever used that could straighten my curls so well. UNTIL IT BROKE DOWN just one Week after I got it in the mail and it was not dropped or handled in any harsh way. It literally just stop heating up right when i was half way through finishing my hair for a touch up. I thought it was just one of the few that were defective so amazon graciously replaced it for me. The replacement one I had for almost a whole 30 days until it to broke just the other day and the same way! It stopped heating up for no reason . I just sent mine in the mail and im getting a full refund. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS FLAT IRON THE 100 DOLLARS AND CONSTANT REPLACEMENTS IS NOT WORTH IT. AND BECAUSE AMAZON GIVES YOU ONLY 30 DAYS TO REPLACE OR REFUND IT YOUR OUT OF LUCK IF IT BREAKS DOWN ON YOU AFTER THAT. THE COMPANY FOR FHI WILL NOT!!!! HONOR YOUR 2 YEAR WARRANTY BECAUSE IT WAS PURCHASED ON AN INTERNET SIGHT THAT&#x27;S NOT A BEAUTY COMPANY, SAYS SO RIGHT IN THE BOOKLET THAT COMES IN THE BOX . SO IT DID WORK BUT THE FACT THAT IT BREAKS DOWN TWICE IN A ROW THE SAME WAY IN JUST A MATTER OF WEEKS MAKES THIS ONE OF THE WORST FLAT IRONS TO PURCHASE. NEVER AGAIN WILL I CONSIDER BUYING A FLAT IRON OF THIS BRAND. SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE RECENTLY BOUGHT IT MAKE SURE YOU GIVE IT A RUN FOR ITS MONEY TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS FOR MORE THAN 14 DAYS.</li>
            <li> I never, ever review anything I buy, but after having this flat iron for 5 years now I felt I owed it to the product. This flat iron is something I never leave town without. I have had it for 5 years now, and it has never failed me. I am very surprised it has lasted this long, so if there are two things I will definitely vouch for 1. It works really well 2. It&#x27;s a quailty product that will last so long you&#x27;ll forget how much you paid for it.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a good flat iron but I did not want to pay $400.  After much research I&#x27;m glad I picked this one.  The only thing I noticed that wasn&#x27;t too great was that if you&#x27;re not careful you can snag your hair on the end of the flat iron.  It&#x27;s not an issue for me because I was able to adjust.  Overall, I love this flat iron and I hope that it lasts me 5+ years like my ION Ceramic flat iron from Sallys.      Oh, if you&#x27;re wondering why I didn&#x27;t stick with the ION from Sallys...well, the plates were showing signs of aging and it took more passes for me to get my hair straight.  Since transitioning and going all natural I needed another iron.  Hope this helps. :)</li>
            <li> African American natural hair. This is the best of the best. The BEST of the best.</li>
            <li> this striaghtening iron i got for my wife and it works great to my knowledge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to stop relaxing my hair over a year now and have had to get my hair straighten in order for it to look presentable (I have naturally thick curly/course hair which frizzez so easily). My hair stylist has done a wonderful job doing my hair but its getting to be very costly, and also difficult securing appointments. I&#x27;ve purchased many flat irons (including the CHI) but I&#x27;ve been unable to obtain salon results. I&#x27;ve done some reasearch and I&#x27;ve found out that the FHI Heat Platform was really good in straightening hair. I&#x27;ve tried it twice and I LOVE it. Everyone complimented my hair because it looks so beautiful. My hair is soft, shiny and bouncy. The results have lasted in humid conditions (although I try to avoid humidity if possible). I really recommend buying this product especially for the price thats advertised at Amazon. I&#x27;m interested in purchasing the 3/4 inch flat iron in order to get close to the roots. I hope the price will be just a cheap.</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for 7 years now.  It still gets as hot as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> I purchased one for myself about a year ago and paid a lot more for it.  Because I love it so much, I purchased another one on Amazon at a much better price.  This one is for my granddaughters who have long thick hair. The FHI Platform straightens coarser hair without breakage, in fact, the more you use it the better your hair looks and the smoothier your ends. Excellent to straighten natural black hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second FHI flat iron and it is wonderful. My other one works fine, but I wanted to try this one. It heats up fast, gets my hair straight and silky smooth and it stays that way. I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used and I have used many! It leaves my hair soft, silky and full of body. I have four daughters and each have different hair types so the dial control is great because I can adjust the temperature for each one! I also like the fact that the outside doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it&#x27;s too unbearable to hold while styling.</li>
            <li> The flat iron is good when it&#x27;s working.  The first one we bought from Amazon lasted 1 year and then stopped working.  We bought a second one through Amazon and it lasted 6 months.  When I called FHI I was told they would not honor the warranty because Amazon is not an authorized dealer.  Save your money and go with the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium 1 1/2\\&quot;.  Much better flat iron with a 4 year warranty - and it&#x27;s cheaper than the FHI.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others that snagged and burned my hair.  I have blonde hair that styles pretty easily - but it does get frizzy sometimes.  The FHI is a great flat iron that was highly recommended by my hair stylist.  It also has a long cord - because it&#x27;s made for professionals.  It gets very hot so you only have to go over your hair once or twice.  The first one got damaged in shipping and they replaced it right away - even before I returned the first one.  The return policy is great and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I have used this flat iron for 4 years and love it.  It heats very quickly and does a great job straightening my coarse, curly hair. After using the flat iron my hair is soft, silky, and shiny. The hair never gets caught during use and the grip makes it easy to hold. I dropped my flat iron on a tile floor and it broke.  I couldn&#x27;t be without the FHI so I purchased the same one and had it sent in two days. The FHI is a must have for me.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for 4 months and now it won&#x27;t heat at all.  I am very disappointed in this product.  From what i understand, there is no warranty through FHI since it was purchased through Amazon.  I am not happy about this product.</li>
            <li> Got it this week from Target, but had points, so I didn&#x27;t pay full price.   I actually like it better than the GVP (CHI knock off) I bought from Sally&#x27;s. And I REALLY liked that one.  I only gave it 4 stars, because I see it broke on some people within a year (**** update, this has happened to me, so I don&#x27;t use this iron as much anymore. I am also relaxed now.*****).    Originally, I like it because it straightens my natural hair very well and I don&#x27;t seem to redo it as often, which is nice. It was every day with the GVP. Now it&#x27;s only been every 2 or 3 days. All I have to do is wrap my hair. I also use it between 300 &amp; 370 degrees. I also used a heat protectant with it, Beyond The Zone and Sabino Moisture Block. With this iron, I have a feeling I won&#x27;t have to use it as often, or apply product all the time.  So, so far, so good.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this FHI Heat Platform flat iron.  It arrived quickly and was safely packaged. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous buying this product but to my surpise it works great. As long as you mosturize your hair before styling you are good to go. Make sure you sure the appropriate oil for straightening your hair too! But, i love this product. I haven&#x27;t been to the hair dresser since i brought my FHI Heat Platform 1 Inch Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Styling Iron with Nano-Fuzeion Technology.</li>
            <li> I had a CHI (no temp dial) for about 3 years.  It was great.  I took it to Europe and even with a converter, it shorted out.  So, my stylist recommended this flat iron - especially because it has the temp control.  It&#x27;s just okay.  I am African-American.  I have mixed texture, unrelaxed hair.  This iron and the CHI produce a nice silky effect on my hair.  I just feel like the CHI got the job done quicker.</li>
            <li> i just got this model and used it for the first time today. there was absolutely a difference in my hair. i was using a revlon ceramic before which was a couple of years old, so it was time for an upgrade. I went with this one based on the other good reviews. My hair is definitely straighter, smoother and silkier than when i used the old flat iron. it may be a five star item, i just havent used it very much yet! but so far its awesome! i 100% recommend this flat iron!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item last month.  However, when I got the item, I was actually sent a FHI Technique G2 (lower end model).  I didn&#x27;t realize this until too late and can&#x27;t return it now.  When I called the vendor, I was told there was a mix-up in how the item was cataloged and the Technique price is showing up for the Platform model on Amazon.  A Platform model would normally be around $[...], on sale.  The vendor&#x27;s records showed it always as the Technique model and because they get their orders from Amazon, they don&#x27;t see your order details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor has given me a refund for the price difference between the Technique and Platform, but I&#x27;m still out $[...] bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may not experience this problem, but beware.  I see the current vendor is not the same vendor as when I bought it, but the price is close to what I paid which makes me suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of that, I don&#x27;t know what rating to give the Platform model because I have been using the Technique model.  As far as the Technique model goes, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and therefore does not straighten my hair to my satisfaction (Japanese thick black course hair).  If you can&#x27;t afford the Runway, my hair stylist says the Platform series is good (it&#x27;s a matter of ceramic coating versus all ceramic plates driving up the price for the Runway).</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied with this buy. The flat iron worked wonderfully while it worked.  Bought at the end of June and already broken in December.  The worst part is Amazon&#x27;s attitude towards the situation.  They refused to replace the product because the return window had closed, even though they are aware that as being unauthorized resellers of the product the manufacturer&#x27;s guarantee does not apply.  Keep this in mind when buying the flat iron or buy from somewhere else!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves at burnt smell on hair when at the highest heat setting and temperature seems to not be stable. Won&#x27;t use this in the salon. Just at home. I&#x27;m afraid it may burn out fast. Gonna search for another iron</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron because this is they type my stylist uses.  I was pleased to find the best price on Amazon.  This iron glides through my hair and straightens with one pass.  I am African American and my hair is relaxed.  I can create bouncy curls or a straight look that lasts for days.  I highly recommend this iron!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used. The service I received from the supplier was excellent. I will use them again for other purchases.</li>
            <li> My daughter used to have very curly hair. Now she doesn&#x27;t. The iron works very well on dry hair. The previous iron, another very widely available make, just didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. In fairness, I should preface that this is the first new flat iron I&#x27;ve had in 10 years, but I&#x27;m incredibly impressed. I have wavy to curly hair - it&#x27;s wavy/puffy most of the time, but if I use products I can get a curl to come out. Basically, it&#x27;s near impossible to get it straight, even with my old flat iron. With this one, though, the flat iron heats up fast, straightens my hair fast, and leaves my hair looking healthy - none of that flat iron dead looking frizz. It&#x27;s also really easy to add a little curl to your hair. Finally I can have magazine hair without spending tons of time or money.</li>
            <li> I always loved how my stylist straightened my hair, but I could never replicate it at home.  I researched the FHI online and found out that she was using this flat iron so I bought it.  I absolutely love it.  So many perks: it literally took me half the time as before to straighten my hair, my hair stayed pin straight all day and I didn&#x27;t need to touch it up at all the next day, and it heats up fast.  I was amazed at the results, honestly.  I have semi thick, course, curly/wavy hair that I really hate most of the time.  Straightening would take forever and by the afternoon it would be so full and wavy that I would have to pull it back.  With the FHI, I was able to leave it down all day and no touch ups needed.  Well worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li> Love it. It works great.</li>
            <li> I bleach and color my hair every month and obviously use flat iron. So my hair was taken a beat. This flat iron does a nice job and is helping my hair to get smoother and healthier. The previous iron I had just use to add to the problem. I don&#x27;t use it in the highest setting, it isn&#x27;t necessary. It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, no iron does. But it does a very nice job taking care of your hair and straighten it. It was voted #2 iron of 2007. And the price in Amazon is the best around!!! (at least when I wrote this review) Enjoy :D</li>
            <li> I bought this iron about three years ago for the oringal price (I got it from FHI&#x27;s official website.) I paid about $200 for it, and it is definitely worth it. The adjustable temperature feature is great - it can go as low as 140 degrees to 450. I have normally straight hair, so I usually leave it at around 300-370. It heats up very fast. Although it doesn&#x27;t have a lock feature, I don&#x27;t really think that matters much.  The iron itself works really well - it glides down my hair pretty smoothly. The only con is that the sides of the plates are not entirely curved, so my hair sometimes gets caught there, but that&#x27;s not a big issue. Also, I&#x27;ve dropped my iron several times, so the plates are loose, but they&#x27;re old and dropping them is totally my fault :) In conclusion, I really recommend this straightener. You won&#x27;t regret it!  Oh by the way, even though the plates are ceramic, it is essential to use an heat protectant before styling your hair. I didn&#x27;t even bother using a protectant for two years (I was stupid) so now my hair is fried..</li>
            <li> I am an African American with 4a type hair. I have been trying to find the perfect hair products for years, so I can save money going to the hair salon. Although my hair does not come out just like my hair dresser does it, it is the closest it has ever been. After washing and conditioning my hair with mixed chicks, and blow drying it with FHI Hot Sauce,the flat ironing was the easy part. I wasn&#x27;t sure how hot the iron should be, so I just kept trying out different heats on different strands. My hair came out full of volume, and it lasted just as long as it does when I go to the hair salon; a month. For my hair, I have had to find the perfect combination of products, and this was the icing on the cake! I am glad I invested the money into a new flat iron,because my hair seems to love it. as well. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has grown an inch (this could be just growth regardless of the flat iron), and I haven&#x27;t had any split ends.</li>
            <li> My FHI is the best and I wouldnt trade it for the world I am a black girl 20 years old with crazy thick hair that reaches the middle of my back I do not have a relaxer or anything and as soon as I step outside into even 1% humidity my hair would turn into dang near an afro..until I got my FHI heat platform. Not only does this flat iron straighten my hair so good to the point where it looks like I have a relaxer, but it really does repel humidity as advertised. I love it!!! This flat iron definitely beats its competitors (Chi and Ghd). Chi straightens well but once you hit that humidity you can forget about it its as if you never even straightened, then Ghd is trash I don&#x27;t even know why people consider it. I researched and read plenty of reviews before I made my decision of which flat iron to buy, but ended up trying all 3 and I can definitely say I am completely satisfied with my purchase of the FHI heat platform. Hope this review helps. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that the switch is hard to get to, I was used to my chi with the switch on the side. Straightens well with one try and minimal touch up in the morning. The manual says that it blinks until its heated to desired degree and mine has never stopped blinking...even waiting over an hour for a low 200 temp. I turn it on high and just use it when its feels hot.</li>
            <li> Before I bought the FHI Platform I had an old and cheap Vidal Sassoon flat iron that was okay. As soon as I recieved the FHI I tried it and fell in love. I love the fact you can set the temperature up to 400 degrees, I have thick curly hair that needs the extra heat, but I only need to set it at 370.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the heat protectant FHI Hot Sauce, but I decided I didn&#x27;t like it, because the flat iron would do such a great job making my hair nice and smooth that if I used the Hot Sauce my hair would get greasy fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to blow dry your hair before using the flat iron or let it air dry, it just won&#x27;t work on wet hair.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. It works great on my thick natural hair, so I can only imagine what It would do if you had a perm! The seller is great also, super-fast shipping and nicely wrapped. I would deff recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to start wearing my t-laxed (texturized) hair straight more often. Before purchasing this iron I used to go to the salon to have my hair flat ironed with my stylist&#x27;s HAI every 4-5 months. I usually ended up spending a lot of money, loving the results, but only having them for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*FHI vs SEDU*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using the FHI Platform I straightened my hair with my Sedu to do a comparison. My Sedu got my hair straight, but left my ends hard and dry and made my hair look damaged, frizzy and horrible after about 2 days of wearing it straight, during the fall - with low humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next week I used the FHI Platform. It was magical. My hair glided through the plates and was silky smooth and shiny. Keep in mind I am not a pro at flat ironing and it was only my second time ever flat ironing my hair. With that in mind, if you don&#x27;t blow dry your hair out enough or you flat iron in sections that are too big it will not come out as nice. The ends won&#x27;t be as soft and it won&#x27;t look as silky.(I learned this the hard way when I decided to do a rushed \\&quot;flat-ironing / hair straightening job\\&quot;).  However, when I use the Platform correctly, my hair is bouncy, silky, super soft, swinging and shiny and just as pretty if not prettier than it is when I go to the salon - especially when I style it with big waves or curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*My routine*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I wash and condition with Dermorganic shampoo and deep conditioner, then I use Morraccan oil&#x27;s deep treatment on my hair. Next I section my EXTREMELY thick 3C hair and I distribute FHI Hot Sauce and Dermorganic Argan Oil into each section and comb it out and then I blow dry with my Gold and Hot hair drier and a comb attachment. Next, I resection my hair and apply Bio Silk Serum on each section and flat iron my hair in 1/2 inch sections at a time. I takes about 3 hours from start to finish, which is a lonnngggg time, and very tiresome, but very much worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*FHI Platform&#x27;s performance in Humidity*&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t straightened my hair with this iron during the summer yet so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it holds in humidity. I have a feeling it wouldn&#x27;t hold too well though. I have to use a lot of product to stop my hair from reverting by the end of the day, which is fine because that means the ironing isn&#x27;t damaging my hair. Maybe there is something else I should be coating my hair with prior to flat ironing to hold it better. I&#x27;ll have to do some research over the summer if my assumption is correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON and I definitely recommend it!n&#x27;t straightened my hair with this iron during the summer yet so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it holds in humidity.

            <li> I got this flat iron 11 months ago as a gift and loved it until it just died a few days ago.  Since it was still within the one year warranty I called the manufacturer.  Unfortunately, they told me that their warranty was void because I had purchased it at Amazon.com, which is not an authorized reseller.  So, buyer beware.  I would have given it a 4 out of 5 stars, but for $100+ bucks I expected it to last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> I got this iron as a gift 4 years ago in 2007. It still works like new. I don&#x27;t nor have I ever used it daily. I have very curly hair and it is pointless to iron it in the humid GA summer. During the fall/winter I generally use it a couple of times a week. No complaints from me. I hope I get another four years out of it!</li>
            <li> I bought this 1.5 years ago and it still works (I use it every other day). It&#x27;s not too bulky like some of the other irons out there.</li>
            <li> I loved the FHI platform iron the first time I used it! I was using a Chi digital iron prior to this but it only went up to 392 Degrees. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still love my CHI but I was looking for something more suited for natural and thicker hair. As a hair stylist, I am always looking for the best products and tools to use on my clients so I definitely wild recommend this particular one. I&#x27;m not sure why anybody would have a bad experience with this iron. However,if you are inexperienced,you should stick to the more wider plates that have a thicker back for heat protection. Otherwise, I love this !</li>
            <li> I must say, I have tried out ALOT of straightners before, but they were always to dull for me, because I have, thick, frizzy hair! This is DEFFENTALY the best straightner ever, and sold at a reasonable price! SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> My daughter as bought this product before and it lasted 2 yrs . The one we purchased from World of Beauty only lasted 1 week and we had to send it back. We are still waitng since March 16th for a replacement.Not only was this unit defective I had to pay to send it back..so much for saving any money..</li>
            <li> This is the second FHI Platform I&#x27;ve owned.  The first lasted 6 years, with almost-daily use.  This version is lighter weight, but still gets the job done.      Vendor shipped quickly and product was just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Mostly I consider Amazon.com to be THE top seller on the Internet due to their excellent customer service policy and their flexible ordering system. However, I consider it a MAJOR flaw on Amazon&#x27;s part that they are not presently disclosing in the listing for this item that Amazon is not an authorized reseller and that the manufacturer will therefore not honor any warranty on this item. By not disclosing that Amazon is not authorized and that there is no warranty: 1) Amazon is legally responsibility for fulfilling the terms of the warranty. 2) Much worse, not disclosing that there is no warranty on THIS item puts the warranty on every other item sold by Amazon in doubt. I certainly hope that Amazon gets on the ball and addresses this issue quickly.</li>
            <li> Ive used Chi for the past 5 yrs and it was still functioning properly. However I was getting tired of my hair feeling burnt, frizz and losing hair due to the pull. After a lot of research I decided to settle for Fhi. It has cut my straightning time and my hair is a lot shinier and frizz free unlike Chi. I still lose hair due to the pulling effect but it still isnt as much as Chi. However just running the starightener once will not get it straight. I have to run it atleast 3 times to get straight hair to my satisfaction versus running it 5 times with Chi. I wasnt expecting to run it more than twice since I have pretty much straight, fine, medum length hair with waves at the end and all I was looking for was a more flat straight look.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my daughter.  It seems to work very well, does not leave hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I had the larger version of the FHI 1 1/2 and ordered these to straghten my hair. I have semi course hair which previouly I put a relaxer in every month however since these have arrived I have yet to place another relaxer. I basically wash, blow dry, and flat iron my hair. It is straight, very manageable, and much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love these little flat irons.</li>
            <li> Trust me I was doing my research on this thing for about a month. I had a Andis flat iron but that lasted for a like year and some change and I only used it on my weave(I had full head weave, none of my real hair out) Im an AA with natural hair and I havent relaxed it since 2008, neither have I EVER straigtened it ! I was scared that it wont flat iron it so it all came down to Chi and FHI. They are both great flat irons but for my hair type FHI was recommended the most. So I finally got it and then my hair gets BONE STRAIGHT ! Esp using Paul Mitchells Super Skinny sebrum(Expensive!) and Hollywood Tree olive oil my hair looked like I put a relaxer in it. I also like that it can last for a whole day with it puffing up. I love my FHI and you should get it cause you will love it too! (It gets REALLY hot quick too)</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this over the Chi and the T3 Tourmaline. I spent alot of time researching this item and price.  I found it at Amazon with free shipping and also Amazon had the best price. The unit works really well, and heats up very quickly. I like the fact that in addtion to getting my hair pin straight, I can also get a very loose curl with just a flick of the wrist. I haven&#x27;t tried the other options for using the flat iron that are explained in the video on the FHI website but I have watched my hairstylist use it and I can&#x27;t believe that it also works like a barrel roller. My hair feels softer and doesn&#x27;t seem to be fried.  The only drawback is that because the head is only 1 inch it does take me a little longer to do my hair ( I have below the shoulder length hair). I would recommend this flat iron if you don&#x27;t mind the price.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is great. My wife tried several cheaper versions but they did not live up to their promises. I stick by my saying that you get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t go cheap b/c your girlfriend or spouse will appreciate the extra expense and thought.</li>
            <li> This iron works great.  The end caps with the FHI insignia came off within a week.  This does not effect the functioning of the iron, but for $100.00 you&#x27;d think nothing would crack or break.    Left my hair with a nice sheen and did not feel damaged.  Platform is smooth....Good product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, as this is the only flat iron I have used.  I love it.  It works great.  My hair looks very shiny after I use it, and it is able to withstand humidity.  I use this daily, and I use it year-round.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I never thought you could fall in love with a flat iron but I have. Last summer I cut my hair like Rhianna and as I approached 2009 I knew it was time for a new look. So I decided to grow out my hair. I am a strong believer of good products but I have never bought a flat iron so expensive. First off, I qualified for Amazon Prime which meant my delivery would take 2 days and it was free. The day my FHI heat 1 inch Platform came, I spent 3 hours straightening, curling, flipping and having a great time. I&#x27;m thrilled. I have naturally curly hair and it is straight and shiny thanks to FHI. I am going to the FHI Hot Sauce because I cant wait to see the results of the two combined together. The best part is as we all approach economic hardships we can look like we just left the salon. Thank you all who wrote wonderful reviews in the past with such honesty and thank you amazon for saving me 50% on this flat iron.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this! We had an FHI in the past, which regrettably stopped functioning. It also had variable heat, which so many of the irons in this price range do not have. My wife says this one glides over her hair even more smoothly than the previous model. She finds the 1\\&quot; size to be the most flexible. Note that some other FHI models do not have variable heat, but the Platform series does. It gets very hot, and maintains that heat. She uses it on our eight year old daughter&#x27;s unprocessed hair to wonderful effect as well.</li>
            <li> When this flat iron arrived at my house, i was so excited to use it. I heard a lot of good reviews about and i couldn&#x27;t wait to test it out on my hair. so i go in the bathroom i plugged it up, and i worked fine at first, but then it automatically shut off. [Now let me just note the i am a teenager who&#x27;s african american with 100% natual hair]so i called the company and told them my problem. the company said that amazon is not an autorized seller. that got a little concerned. but i just wanted to make sure it was good, so i tried it. 1st off, the dang thing would only stay on if it were at 450 degrees. my mom told me to let it sit for about 10 min before i try it. so when i tested it on my hair, i noticed black smoke from the iron. IT COMPLETELY BURN OUT MY HAIR!!!!!!!!!! before i knew, my hair basically melted, and was just completely messed up and it was falling off my head. unless u want DAMAGED, BURNT, AN UNHEALTHY HAIR, do not get this product.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron in the world! I love it! I had one just like it for about 10 years and then the plates unglued but it could have been because I was leaving it on for a long time. I absolutely love it! It&#x27; perfect for my hair but o have to say that I have fine hair I don&#x27;t know if it would straighter coarse hair jut as fast as it does mine.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this flat iron and I can honestly say it was one of the best purchases I have made in a long, long time.   I have very, very thick wavy hair.  I cannot go to a new salon without being told that I \\&quot;have the thickest hair they&#x27;ve ever seen on a white girl\\&quot;.  I was between this and a CHI, but after using a CHI I decided that I honestly didn&#x27;t like what it did to my hair. The CHI was effective, but left my hair feeling dry and took away some of the sheen.  So I went with the FHI Platform. Prior to using this I used a$35 flat iron from Target.  It worked, but it took approximately twenty five minutes to completely straighten my dry hair, plus another 10 minutes in touch ups the next morning since my hair refused to stay straight.  I have used the FHI several times and despite the current humidity and rain within the past week, my hair stayed straight, flat, shiny and without frizz.  I didn&#x27;t have to touch it up the next morning at all.  On top of this, my straightening time is almost cut in half. I can run the iron through a segment of my hair once and it is straight. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron because my CHI had a short in it and kept turning off while I was using it.  I have loved my CHI and it has done a great job for several years now.  But when I received the FHI Platform I was very disappointed in the lack of quality.  It was so bad that I sent it back immediately, which I rarely, if ever do.  It wouldn&#x27;t even get as hot as my CHI that was cutting on and off. It was advertised as getting to 450 degrees and the CHI only to 410.  But it didn&#x27;t nearly get as hot as the CHI.  I would estimate that it was maybe 350 at its hottest.  That&#x27;s not hot enough to flat iron curly hair.  Waste of money and time!</li>
            <li> I purchased this flatiron for my daughter who has very long hair. She had been using my CHI flatiron because it worked so much more smoothly than the inexpensive one she had bought for herself. We were disappointed to find that the new FHI would sometimes catch in her hair; whereas, the CHI had not.  We examined both irons and found that the FHI has some little clamps that appear to be holding the heating tile in place. The CHI did not have any clamps that would interupt the sliding of the hair thru the iron.  Other than that we liked that the FHI had a variable heat setting, and it does do a good job of smoothing the hair.</li>
            <li> I have been researching these flat irons for a minute now, and I decided to purchase this one.  This iron is simply fabulous.  It leaves my hair soft and silky...not to mention the mobility. I have natural african american hair and I have never used an iron that works as well as this one does.  If you are stilling looking for an iron look no more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently gotten into tourmaline/ceramic technology and shopped around for a long time before I decided on investing in a FHI. PROS: My hair is definately softer and shinier after using this product, and it always gives me the same results. With my old flat iron I was never sure how my hair would turn out, it always depended on the weather and how often I was styling my hair. With the FHI I always get the same sleek, smooth look. CONS: A friend of mine bought a CHI turbo and that thing flattens your hair in one pass - I was hoping the FHI would pack the same punch, but in the end it takes me a couple passes to get it perfectly straight. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. SIDE NOTE: FHI&#x27;s Hot Sauce makes a HUGE difference when using this iron - it&#x27;s a buying must!! :)</li>
            <li> Professional hairstylist who previously used CHI and Paul Mitchell flatirons. Researched the FHI Irons extensively prior to purchase, and I am slightly disappointed. Rated low due to iron breaking within 30 days of purchase and not able to use wet to dry, like indicated on packaging. While in use, gives off strange fumes that create irritation of eyes and throat. Total waste of money. Not better than the CHI.</li>
            <li> This straightener leaves hair moisturized and shiny! For me it took about 2 times over the same hair but it was worth it! Also I used this flat iron with the Hot Sauce heat protectant and it works amazing! They say this flat iron makes hair healthier in 60 days of regular use I used it for the first time and it made my hair healthier so im curious to find out on the 60 days!If you dont have it you have to get it!</li>
            <li> I had a Sedu for about 3 years. It fell on the floor and broke apart. After researching flat irons I decided to give the FHI Platform a try. It&#x27;s just okay. The Sedu got hotter using a lower temperature setting as well as produced a silkier effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> ...the first one I had just died. It lasted 4 years--FOUR YEARS--for those of you shopping for your first iron, four years is an ETERNITY for a straightening iron to last. This is a great, durable, no-nonsense hair straightener. Forget all the wet to dry crap, if you want a reliable straightener that will work for years, this is the one to buy--definitely worth the price, and definitely superior to CHI. Oh, and by the way, I have waist-length very thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent straightener. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought my second FHI Heat straightener a little over a year and a half ago, and it worked really well, until one day I turned on the straightener and the red \\&quot;on\\&quot; light was faded and the straightener wasn&#x27;t heating up. I only use my straightener about once a week-not nearly enough for this \\&quot;high quality product\\&quot; to last me such a short time. I was satisfied with my straightening iron before it broke, but a short lifespan and unreliability from this product appear to be common complaints. I expected more from FHI Heat, and their warranty system makes it very difficult to justify spending $100 or so on their products when I could spend it on a CHI straightener. I would not buy this product again, and I would not recommend an FHI Heat tool to anyone interested in a product that offers high quality AND longevity.</li>
            <li> I am a Hairstylist and have purchased less than 6 months ago and the flat iron has burned out because of constant use. I&#x27;ve had 3 FHI&#x27;s and all 3 have burned out in less than 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon this is not considered an authorized distributor and warranty is considered void.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed with the flat iron because I thought buying a professional flat iron would last longer than 6 months. Good flat iron, however terrible warranty and the life span are not long if you are a Stylist.</li>
            <li> Sadly this straightener burns your hair and gave me awful split ends. It&#x27;s not up to true FHI standards and I&#x27;d recommend buying one of the pricier models.</li>
            <li> This straightener is a good straightener, but it doesn&#x27;t last long for what you pay for it. I bought mine last year for $90. Less than a year later, the cord is shorting out and the straightener won&#x27;t stay on unless I position the cord in such a way that the light remains lit. I&#x27;m actually a little worried about getting electrocuted lately because you can hear it popping, so I&#x27;ve retired my one year old $90 straightener and am currently seeking another. This is my second FHI straightener and I have course frizzy hair and while it does do the job, my hair submits to heat and humidity very easily and straightening has little effect on subduing that. I&#x27;m going to look for a less expensive straightener on here with good reviews because in my opinion a straightener that&#x27;s close to $100 should last much longer than one year.</li>
            <li> The product is everything it&#x27;s supposed to be. Fast shipping and it comes in a nice box with a detachable case and heat resistant mat. I am a natural African American woman with 4b/4c hair and it got my hair silky straight with body and movement in only two passes per section at 350 degrees heat. My hair puffed a little in the rain but after re wrapping my hair it was flat and straight again.  The straight lasted three weeks and prob even more if I didn&#x27;t wash it. It&#x27;s a great iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to replace my Helen of troy flat iron.  It was recommended by a hair dresser friend and works great. I would def recommend.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years since I ordered it and it is a top quality straightener.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron ever! I purchased this flat iron in 2011 and it looks like new even with extensive wear. The temperature control is perfect allowing you to gauge how much heat you are using on your hair to help you avoid split ends. The ceramic plates are smooth and help to straighten and make your hair silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick, curly, coarse, or thin hair without body this flat iron is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length relaxed hair and this flat iron is amazing!!!!!! My stylist flat irons my hair with the fhi, then wraps my hair and has me under the dryer with plastic wrap for about 5 minutes. I have so much body and volume, i cant stops swinging my hair. Works well on all hair types. I recommend this flat iron to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> The iron heats VERY fast and works very well.  I have thick short hair and it is easy to work with.  My daughter also uses this iron and she has long, thinner hair</li>
            <li> Ok I just received the FHI iron in the mail today, and i definitely have to say it works very well, my own hair stylist uses a iron similar to this one, it was one of the main reasons i wanted it, due to almost a week after getting my hair done it would begin to frizz. So i wanted to maintain my look in between getting my hair done. this was for a very good price, on FHI&#x27;s official website its almost $200 plus shipping. Amazon&#x27;s price is better by far. anyone who buys will not be disappointed, and if you are then your just to picky and like spending $400 on a flat iron &#x3D;:0</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a cheap iron and finally broke down and spent the money to buy a nicer one.  I will never go back.  I&#x27;ve had numerous comments on how soft my hair looks since I&#x27;ve got this. I definitely would recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite irons ever! It heats up fast and irons fast too. I love it so much I bought it again. This particular version has a much longer cord, which is great.</li>
            <li> Great Flat iron. I have never used one before, and I was hesitant.   Took a while to get used to using it, but once I did, it was great. I have straight hair already, but wanted to keep the frizzies out and give it a bounce at the end.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!! It also does curls nicely and heat up extremely fast!!! Very HAPPY!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a African American woman with very course kinky frizzy hair! I needed a flat iron that wouldn&#x27;t cause damage and would add shine. I asked my stylist how she got my hair so straight and beautiful and she told me FHI. I just got it in the mail today and like a kid on Christmas I had to open and use it right away! You will not be disappointed in this flat iron! No frizz, great body and shine! My hair has met its match, thanks FHI!</li>
            <li> I bought this year&#x27;s ago and it is still working great!</li>
            <li> The case is more impressive than the flat iron itself.  Not worth the price.  It&#x27;s sold in stores for a lesser price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday because her old one broke after use for many years and she just loves it</li>
            <li> After receiving a recommendation from my stylist to purchase the FHI flat iron, I have purchased 2 in the past month. The first one worked great for two weeks and then stopped heating up. Amazon took it back. I purchased a second FHI flat iron through Amazon, but it came from Discount Jungle. On the second day of using it, it sparked and burned my daughters hair, then shorted out and won&#x27;t heat up. The hair has since fallen out and she has a bunch of short ends near her scalp. Discount Jungle offered to replace it, however, I have no confidence in the quality of the flat iron now and will go with another brand. When it did work my daughter said it was the best flat iron she ever used and made her hair feel silky. The results on my hair were fabulous, but I&#x27;m too frustrated to try it again. Two defective flat irons from the same company are enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** Discount Jungle required ME to pay the return shipping and then charged ME a 10% \\&quot;restocking\\&quot; fee for the return. I would NEVER purchase anything from Discount Jungle again! Beware!!</li>
            <li> Glad that I finally got a flat iron that does not snag or pull...heats up fast and straightens after one pass.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing flat iron ever! Coming from an extremely humid state,I moved to Colorado where it is really dry. This iron has helped keep moisture in my hair along with creating a beautiful sheen. It was definitely worth the buy. My stylist from my humid state used this iron on my hair and I am getting the same results as she did. I am a black female with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this iron except the lack of flexibility in the cord.  It&#x27;s just a little stiff.  My last iron was a chi and the cord just seemed to be better quality.  But all in all, I&#x27;m happy with the iron itself.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair straightener! My hair stays straight all day. I was unsure about buying this product without trying it but it was definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and coarse, usually takes me about 1 hr or more to get il really straight... with this flat iron I am done in less than 30 min, and it is suuuper straight! Plus it lasts all day! Everyone has been comenting on my hair.    I really recomend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Have had mine for a few years.  Still works as well as when I first bought it.  My daughter and I use it every day for straightening and curling.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive the fhi 1\\&quot; flat iron. The box and product appeared to be the same as my other fhi irons (which I purchased from an authorized dealer), authentic.  Upon using it a few times, I noticed the plates were not as smooth going down the hair shaft, nor did they straighten as well as the other fhi irons I have.  I inspected the flat iron and compared it to my other fhi irons and noticed the product is not authentic. The base portion of the cord where it swivels is not the same as the other four irons I have (in various sizes), and the heating element seems to only work in the middle of the plate instead of evenly across among other inconsistencies.  This vendor is selling a knock off!  Needless to say I&#x27;m extremely disappointed....what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have insanely curly hair, and this product gets ride of every trace of my curls.  My younger sister has had hers for about 4 or 5 years and it still works beautifully!</li>
            <li> After my Chi died(The CHI used to pull my hair) I bought the FHI. I LOVE IT! It makes my hair so smooth. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. It heats up quickly and does an overall fabulous job. I&#x27;m so happy I found this brand. I will NEVER use a CHI again. If you are wondering what brand to get... look no more, but make sure you get this one. There is another FHI that&#x27;s less expensive and it does not work the same.</li>
            <li> It cuts time to straighten my long hair to just 15minutes, I love it and my hair comes out silky smooth</li>
            <li> There was a problem with the iron when it arrived.  I previously had the same model, and it lasted four years. In the end, my first iron started shorting, so I decided to purchase a new one. I was very disappointed to find that the new one arrived and started shorting out immediately.  I decided to return the iron and get another type since this appears to be a problem with the FHI Platform.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron-- LOVE FHI.&lt;br /&gt;SPEND&lt;br /&gt;THE&lt;br /&gt;MONEY&lt;br /&gt;ON&lt;br /&gt;THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a couple of cheaper flat irons prior to this (regretfully) and wish I just went for this to begin with. I have super heavy, thick hair (and lot&#x27;s of it) and the fact that this iron gets to 410 degrees like salon irons makes it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, reliable brand; I have an FHI professional hair dryer that was also well worth the price (going on year 3 now).</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my teen daughter. She was using the Hai 2\\&quot; and wanted a 1\\&quot; flat iron to be able to also curl her hair. It&#x27;s too early to give a really good review, but I personally think the Hai worked better. This flat iron doesn&#x27;t seem to leave her hair as smooth. On the positive side, it is very light and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> So I was super excited to get this flat iron, but ended up very disappointed after the first use!! This flat iron curls beautifully but for some reason if I use it on my mixed/curly hair to straighten, it does not do the job good at all!!! My cheap Jilbere (the light grey one with red plates) straightens my hair much better leaving it soft, silky and bouncy. The FHI iron leaves my hair dull and dry and gives it a horrible texture when straightening... But like I said earlier, it curls very very very nicely so i use the Jilbere to straighten and the FHI to curl...lol</li>
            <li> I love the FHI styling iron!  It works great and maintains the heat very well.  My daughter has very thick hair and it smooths it perfectly and my hair is thinner but it works just as well for me.  Very happy with my purchase.  I will say one thing the little plastic disc on the end that says FHI fell off, but it&#x27;s not really a big deal.</li>
            <li> My hair look so much better. It does a great job, special after getting steroid shots from a car accident that made my hair feel and look like a Brillo pad.now it feels and looks like my hair again</li>
            <li> So I have used flat irons in the past and none of them work for my hair except for Chi.. I have owned 3 in 5 years and they just seem to die after a while. I looked up reviews about the FHI and everyone seemed to LOVE IT !! I just got mine in the mail today and could not wait to try it out! It took 1/2 the time to do my hair from when I used the Chi !! And being a mom of two kids, a extra 20 min less of having to do my hair is awesome in my book. My hair is super shiny and I must say I am IN LOVE with my new FHI !! It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve had it for two years and has not failed me. Doens&#x27;t pull, easy to clean, and still heats up nicely. I tried the Croc but it isn&#x27;t any better. Tried the CHI and my hair poofed within the day. (literally poofed, i have no better way to explain it)</li>
            <li> FHI was my first high end styling iron. I&#x27;ve purchased two of these over the course of 6-7 years. I gave my older one to my mother since I moved out but the condition was well worn out and eventually the heat plates detached. The one I currently use is still in good condition after 2 years. I will be repurchasing this styling iron again when the time comes!</li>
            <li> FHI has been my favorite flat iron always! I&#x27;m a hairstylist and these definitely would be my most used! Even as a stylist and having to use them often, they have lasted over a year .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned CHI irons and thought I&#x27;d try this one.  It lasted only a month and, as someone else stated, there is no warranty....which I wasn&#x27;t aware of.  A little disappointed with Amazon with how this was handled.</li>
            <li> I was very leary about using a flat iron and the FHI heat platform 1 inch professional ceramic tourmaline styling iron with nano-fuzeion technology was recommended to me by my hairdresser. I like the fast heat up and the ceramic coating.It is easy to use, has a temperature gauge and is light weight. My hair comes out looking great and I never need to touch it up. My friend commented that another brand flat iron that she owns is not good and it was not inexpensive. I let her try mine and she loved it. What more can one say except that the price was right.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter as it was on her birthday wish list.  She is a hair stylist and specifically asked for this product.  She loves it and uses it daily.  Most satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best flat iron ever. Of course FHI is a little more pricy than most but I am telling you-so worth it. The use of this specific iron gives you soft beautiful hair without damaging due to dry heat. It&#x27;s amazing. Once you purchase and FHI you will more than likely not want to use any other product line.</li>
            <li> Love it im getting one more</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron and have used it to create some of the cutest hair styles. Not only did it straighten my hair, but my hair felt softer and silkier than it has with any other flat iron (vs. the CHI). I am so happy that I purchased the FHI platform, and I must say that Amazon&#x27;s shipping was great!</li>
            <li> I like it very much it is so easy to use and makes the hair smooth rapidly</li>
            <li> I purchased this in 2009, and today July 21, 2012, it is still working just like the day I got it!  It is very hot and I love the temp control.  This has out lasted every CHI I have ever owned.  I have thick, curly, long hair and this product can straighten my entire head in 15 minutes!  I highly recommend this brand.  When this one goes out on me I will be buying another.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally do reviews on products but had to do a review on this one!!  I am extremely happy with the service provided by Discount Jungle and how they stand by their products!  I would def&#x27;n purchase another item from this company!!  As way of product....it is a great product and I love the way it makes my hair shiny and straight!!  Love it!!  Thank you Discount Jungle!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, she is a Paul Mitchell trained stylist and works in a Paul Mitchell focus salon, This is one of the few items she uses that is not Paul Mitchell AND YES, they have Paul Mitchell flat irons.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER FHI PRODUCT !! I bought this for my daughter for her Birthday. She used it for about 5 weeks and it died. It was past the 30 day return window for Amazon so I contacted the manufacturer. They stated that they do not warranty any product not sold by them directly or through a professional beauty salon. I asked them why that was and they said places like Amazon allow other sellers to sell counterfeit products through the Amazon website, therefore they will not even consider my case. I found it appalling that someone would say that Amazon allows counterfeit products to be sold on their webite !! Is this true and I am that naive or did FHI just slander Amazon???</li>
            <li> Very good irons, they&#x27;re smooth and eavy to handle, I&#x27;m a novice and still got salon looks with these irons</li>
            <li> First, let me give my review of this flat iron. It&#x27;s amazing. The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used a lot.  I get salon results at home and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry. With other irons, I would have to turn the temperature up, or iron the same piece of hair 3 or 4 times, causing more damage to my hair. This iron gives me silky straight hair at a lower temperature with one pass. So while any heat is damaging to the hair, i feel better knowing I&#x27;m using the least amount of heat possible.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be put off by the low ratings, seems they received a counterfeit product.  When you purchase something from Amazon, you can see the name of the actual seller. Sometimes it&#x27;s Amazon and sometimes it&#x27;s not. I try to order items &#x27;sold by Amazon&#x27; and if I can&#x27;t, I research the seller that is available. Amazon does sell items but they are also a vehicle for other sellers. I have a friend that wrote a book and she sold it through Amazon. So anybody can use Amazon to sell whatever they want. Amazon often has better prices so the risk is up to you. If you want a fully 100% guaranteed item with manufacturer warranty, then order from a FHI authorized seller and pay a little more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite flatiron by far!  Worth the cost.  The protective heat pad included is a nice touch, as well.  Leaves a smooth finish and allows quick styling.</li>
            <li> It was great while it lasted. Only lasted maybe a good year...oh well.</li>
            <li> Pay no attention to any review that says this is not the most awesome flat iron ever. Just get it! It was recommended to me by my hairstylist, and she is a true professional, whom I trust and believe would not steer me down the wrong path with my hair care regimen. Nothing negative to report it is simply just beautiful.</li>
            <li> Purchased two of the same shoe in a black and red patent leather. They both look fine however felt different. One was bigger than the other so now I have to go a buy another pair of black patent leather pumps</li>
            <li> Only complaint keeping this from being 5 stars is that the letters rub off from the heat. As a black woman wearing my hair natural, this straightens it with ease. I dont even have to blow dry my hair good. Lol.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many of these through the years.  This flat iron is GREAT.  It heats up fast and it probably takes me half the time to get my hair super straight (I have really thick, naturally wavy hair too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really nit-picky too, but I like that the plug doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space (like I can plug it in on top of my hair dryer) -- then it can start heating up while I&#x27;m finishing up drying my hair!</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning and breaking from using extreme heat and relaxers. I went natrual and used titanium flat irons and noticed continued thinning and breakage. I was told to start using Ceramic styling tools, after research and word of mouth recomendations I purchased the FHI. I am so pleased! No breakage, no thinning and it glides and staightens with one pass, even on natural hair! Love it and would highly recommend it for anyone seeking healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Second flatiron I&#x27;ve owned.  It&#x27;s easy to use and my hair is softer after I use it.  Variable temperature is a great feature.  My stylist has one; her advice was just to keep the wand moving, don&#x27;t stop it or it&#x27;ll burn your hair.  One pass, and my naturally wavy hair is straight, shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> the best flat iron i have ever used!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!! A+++++ LOVE FHI STYLING IRONS!! This is the second one we have purchased. Def salon quality at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am a black female with natural and very thick hair.  I decided to save money by not going to the salon and doing my hair myself.  This flat iron manages to tame the fro and makes it look so gorgeous.  My roommate came home later that night and asked if I went to the salon, that is how great it looks.  I love this flat iron.  From the sleek design to the fast heating, buying it was the best decision I made.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I had a comparable model of the same brand that I used for about six years until I accidentally dropped and broke it.  When I went to purchase a new one, my usual store no longer carried FHI.  I decided to purchase a Sedu Revolution -- this $160 flat iron in no way compared to the FHI.  In fact, the heating in the Sedu began to go haywire after only 8 months.  Not only that, it took 2-3 passes to style my hair when the FHI only took one on the same temperature setting.  Fortunately, I was able to return the Sedu and replace it with this FHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with this flat iron.  It works every bit as well as my previous model, and my hair looks great -- so much better than it had with the Sedu.  I would recommend this flat iron to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the $200 as advertised nor can I tell that it&#x27;s better than a Chi iron. It&#x27;s a good iron, but the ionic crap and all the extras they use to describe it to sale it is not anything I can see.</li>
            <li> Great product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t close down on my hair completely when I pulled it through. I wish it gripped on to my hair a little closer without me having to use bigger chunks of hair. Other than that, its great!</li>
            <li> Love the iron works perfect but after a year had to replace it and purchase a new one the exact same because of the way my customers hair would shine and straighten after the first stroke, you dont have to keep going over the same section several different times</li>
            <li> This flat iron gets hot like it states, but doesn&#x27;t last. They tend to short out and quit working after a few months. Being a stylist, I can&#x27;t afford to replace every 5 months or so.</li>
            <li> I have been researching flat irons for about six months...going on different websites looking at people reviews and checking out the latest technology in flat ironS and let me tell this is the best for the money. The best imo would have to be the fhi runway but that runs at $400 so that was a HELL NO! lol...    I was going to choose either this or the sedu and i am glad i choose this. It usually runs for about $180 elsewhere so this is a deal.     However I have one draw back of this iron and that is burns the scalp if u get too close but other than that it is great...GET IT!  I have AA relaxed bra-strap hair and this makes it silky, shinny and straight with one pass...i usually wash and air dry, when i am finish my hair is wavy and on the thick side. I flat iron in small sections and i use a heat protectant. Also i dont know if it is the technology or something but the iron tends to make ur hair feel really clean...it is a plus tho cause the hair moves with ease.    GREAT BUY!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> FHI Professional Platform Flatiron 1\\&quot;. This is the absolute BEST.  I have exceptionally frizzy hair and always have.  Since the advent of flatirons, I have bought a gazillion and they just didn&#x27;t \\&quot;get it\\&quot;.  But, I heard from my stylist about this one and took her advice and now again I understand ALWAYS ASK THE PRO and this is the professional unit.  It goes past 400 degrees which is one of the differences, and it straightens or flips or curls. It is fantastic even on a muggy, moisture-ridden Tennessee day. Try it you will love it as well. If it can make my hair straight it can do anything.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is Awesome!!!! Perfect every time!!  Never used a better  flat iron.  I can go from curly to straight with no blow out.</li>
            <li> I like it  very much it is the best&lt;br /&gt;I recomand it for everyone&lt;br /&gt;and it makes your hair nice and smoth</li>
            <li> I really love my ceramic tourmaline.  It really straightens our hair really well.  I would recommend this item to friends and family.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best. I&#x27;ve had several CHI iron&#x27;s and FHI works way better. It really makes my hair smooth and I have thick wavy hair. I love it..</li>
            <li> Heating element went out within a week</li>
            <li> Loveeeeeee it! One of my favorite flat irons. It works better than the chi and seems to make your hair last longer.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I received the irons but they never worked. I called and emailed the company and had no success!</li>
            <li> FHI heat platform was all we were expecting. I&#x27;m just looking forward to learn how to make curls :)&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my flat iron has died. I loved this iron but I think it&#x27;s time I part ways with this brand.</li>
            <li> Once I got on the FHI train, there was no going back.  This flat iron has adjustable temp settings and it gets hair super straight.  i have curly spanish/african american hair (the good hair as black people call it), but once I flat iron, it&#x27;s literally as thin and straight as any caucasian hair.  Granted I have nice hair, but still..... couple up some great hair products with this flat iron &amp; you have a winning combination!</li>
            <li> I would go ZERO if possible. Bought this 11 months ago. Today it broke. It has a one year warranty, but they will only honor it if you bought it for 2-3x the price at a \\&quot;professional salon\\&quot; or their website.  Just saying for all the wonderful reviews here, when it breaks don&#x27;t expect FHI to honor any warranty because \\&quot;we have determined that Amazon is not an authorized professional salon and they could sell counterfeit products\\&quot;, yeah whatever could, but don&#x27;t. What if a salon sold it through Amazon, ever think of that?  So it&#x27;s your product that broke DURING you warranty period, you won&#x27;t honor your warranty. Made in Korea is what the label says, and that says it all I suppose. Crap. So, basically what they&#x27;ve said is \\&quot;if you want any warranty, then you have to buy directly from the FHI website where we will double the price\\&quot;. Just saying, dont&#x27; expect much.</li>
            <li> Paid too much for this; not worth the price.  have to admit does not use on a regular basis, but only received no more than 5 good months of usage if that much with that item.  It stopped getting hot really quickly.  Did not realize it at first as i had hair braided most of the time, when my daughter finally pulled out to use, barely able to do so as the heat was not as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had a CHI Air before I purchased this product. I found out about FHI through my hair lady. I compared the CHI Air and FHI by straightening half of my head with each iron. At first it looked the same, but the half I straightened with FHI was much softer, felt a little straighter, and held more shine. I also find myself not having to straighten my hair as much with this iron. It also curls much easier and leaves more bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW,  I am African-American with VERY thick hair, transitioning to natural. With FHI, I feel like I can get results of a perm with this iron!</li>
            <li> The Heat Platform did not work when I received it.  After reviewing the picture here and the the styling iron that I received is not the same.  I also compared my Styling Iron to one received by my Niece - both ordered at the same time and they are not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning the Styling Iron in hopes to get the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; FHI Heat Plaltform Styling Iron.</li>
            <li> I brought this product Jan 2012 and they worked very well until sometime in Nov 2012. Then in Dec 2012 they stopped working.  It seemed like a short in the cord; sometimes they would turn on when plugged in but I would have to wiggle the cord and then other times they wouldn&#x27;t.  So since I didn&#x27;t think they were worth me. burning down my house, I just put them back in their box and decided to buy another pair but not from an online seller. I then decided that the because this product is still being sold on Amazon and at a higher cost than what I paid,  I decided that the seller and others needed to know that this product was defective.</li>
            <li> Bought this a little over a year ago - have used it on occasion to straighten my daughter&#x27;s hair maybe a total of 20 times and it just stopped working. Will not heat at all. So disappointed that I spent $100 on such a faulty product. Do not waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these for my daughter in March. In November she told me it had stopped working. I contacted FHI client support. The woman asked me where I bought it, and as soon as I told her it was through Amazon she said they don&#x27;t honor the warranty if it&#x27;s purchased through an \\&quot;unauthorized distributor.\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t believe my ears and kept asking her how that was anything but crooked. She had one lame excuse after another. In my opinion they have no intention of honoring their warranty and provide their staff with a laundry list of excuses. I&#x27;m not going to spend hundreds of dollars pursuing legal action, so the best I can do is warn others. Do NOT purchase an FHI product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the FHI Platform because of the reviews that I read for fine hair. I and sadly it makes my hair frizzy. I have tried all temperatures and nothing seems to help. I even got the Hot Sauce by FHI and that still didn&#x27;t help. I would like to return this product.</li>
            <li> Not very pleased with this product that&#x27;s why I waited to write the review because i needed to see if the item would work or even last long. Hasn&#x27;t been a year and the damn thing stopped working. Of course discount jungle only gives you 30 days to return a product and FHI doesnt honor third party sellers so you cant even get the thing returned to the manufacturer. A damn waste of my money and no one likes to do that.</li>
            <li> Did not last more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> I had to return this iron because when I plugged it in nothing happened!  I ended up buying the same iron directly from my salon to get a warranty.  Amazon was helpful in taking my return and refunding me</li>
            <li> Great!!!!!!! I&#x27;m enjoying it.  I will need a bigger size shortly. I am enjoying it daily and so are my clients.</li>
            <li> After a year plates came off.  I did not even use daily.  Functional for the first year.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had the CHI before this straightner, and I like this one much better. This one heats up to 450 degrees, which makes you able to straighten your hair in minutes. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter whose hair was fried from using the chi--would recommend this straightener for anyone who uses a straightener everyday! Would never buy one that you can&#x27;t control the heat setting ever again! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Well Well Well, I have learned my lesson, I have had these flat irons for almost a year and they stopped working.  I thought I was getting a deal but I guess just like coach, louis vutton etc they can make knock off FHI flat irons.  I would not be purchasing any any flat iron products from amazon at all.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this flat iron and I finally decided to get one for myself.  Straightens my very curly hair so easily!  Doesn&#x27;t pull any hair and only have to go over each section once!  Wish I had bought one years ago!</li>
            <li> I originally bought the CHI, but for some reason it was making my hair very frizzy, so I returned it. I did some research and discovered the FHI. It had great reviews. I&#x27;m very happy with this product - I love it! It makes my hair super silky and soft.</li>
            <li> The FHI Platform is a great iron when it works.  Too bad after using the iron TWICE, it has already shorted out.  And as prviously stated, no warranty honored here.  I have learned my lesson and will now buy locally where returns are easier.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> They claim that this straightener does not burn your hair because it heats your hair from the \\&quot;inside out.\\&quot; Also because it produces steam not smoke. Let me just make it clear that if it is making your hair steam, it is drying it out and damaging your hair. I have been very disappointed in this company&#x27;s products and they will lie all over their marketing to make them seem better than they really are. For example, they say that their hairdryer is unique because of its AC motor. Any device that is plugged into a wall outlet uses AC power. Buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used FHI flatirons for years and when I broke my last one, I got another just like it.  They&#x27;ve improved on the style which seams sleeker but the results are just perfect!</li>
            <li> I had a FHI for almost 7 years before it stopped working. When I bought this one, it was working great. It heated up quickly, made my hair soft and straightened it well (I have really curly hair). Then, after about 3 months, it stopped working. For the amount I paid, I expected the iron to work for much longer than that. And the warranty is only for 30 days. Sadly, I&#x27;m very disappointed because it was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The plates did not touch so my hair went right through the iron, didn&#x27;t see at first this was then problem so after this discovery I sent it back</li>
            <li> The flat iron quit working after ONE TIME.  Will not heat up. Ridiculous.  Will be returning and getting it somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Works great! Hair is smoother, and gets hair straight, the best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned. Well worth the price, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have had these flat irons for 1 year and 5 months and now they are currently not working. I have never dropped them or mishandled them. The light appears to come on when plugged, but the flat iron will not heat up. After paying $90 dollars, I am highly upset and out of a once amazing flat iron and money.</li>
