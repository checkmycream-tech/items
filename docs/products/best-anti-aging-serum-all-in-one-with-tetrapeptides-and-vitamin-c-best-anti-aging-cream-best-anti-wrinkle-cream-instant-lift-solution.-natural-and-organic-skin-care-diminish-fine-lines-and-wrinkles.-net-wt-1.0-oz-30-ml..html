            <li>,  Feels nice on the skin,</li>
            <li>I liked the texture of the cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review</li>

            <li>This product is OK, but I havent noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it, but I&#x27;m looking for something better.</li>
            <li>I really love this serum.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product goes on my face.</li>
            <li>Bellafab is a fabulous company with amazing high-quality products.</li>
            <li>was given the opportunity to try Bellafab skincare martixyl 3000 serum free to try in return for an honest product review.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>:) recommend to everyone</li>
            <li>:):)</li>
            <li>Skin looks smoother and has a more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>The serum itself is more of a cream which I like because I don&#x27;t like watery serums.</li>
            <li>refreshing, you can feel the skin tightening effect</li>
            <li>serum also has some quality and proven ingredients such as the hyaluronic acid and vitamin C which are perfect ingredients for a serum!</li>
            <li>My favorite is that it&#x27;s a cream and not a liquid.  </li>
            <li>This product hydrates skin improves it by leaving it smooth and controls break outs also takes care of fine lines and expression line worth trying and great price.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s helping my fine lines and how evenly it absorbs.</li>
            <li>but I will say that so far it is easily a great competitor when paired against pricier anti-aging creams in its category.</li>
            <li>The good news is the product is reasonably priced, compared to all the products you buy in the mall or beauty shop.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products from Bellafab as well, and they continue to produce great products!</li>
            <li>I tried this out the first night I got it, and love it!  </li>
            <li>This skin care product is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>So this is very easy to apply and is quickly absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice face cream that has all the latest recommended products for younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>Because of the peppermint it also gives a sort of cool and refreshing feeling when I apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is how nice the packaging was, it felt high-end</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m kind of a packaging person, after all it&#x27;s the first</li>
            <li>Helped with the fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I am constant being asked what  I using and told how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li>This is important because this contains ingredients that will require exfoliating scrub and without the moisturizer, you will get flakes.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something light to wear under makeup and powder.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a light peppermint scent that is uplifting.</li>
            <li>When I apply the serum it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; on my skin.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Also, the pump is not like those cheaply made ones.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing because of how easy it is to use, the results you get and the natural ingredients the company uses to make this product.</li>
            <li>It feels like t has more elasticity and from what I understand, the results only get better!  </li>
            <li>First off I love the smell of this serum.</li>
            <li>You can also use this product anywhere on your body that is dry, and it has a great moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>#34;who needs botox when you can do it naturally&amp;#34; - and that&#x27;s true; and this product helps with firming, plumping, as well as lightening up your skin.</li>
            <li>I received my bottle complimentary although my thoughts are always honest and completely unbiased.</li>
            <li>so you are getting your money’s worth.</li>
            <li>Honest review for a deep discounted price</li>
            <li>She noticed that it easily is absorbed into her skin and there are no problems.</li>
            <li>Not much in the Bottle have not noticed in help with wrinkles but it feels good on my face</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh in the mornings after I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, which I think is so important, and it&#x27;s also paraben free, and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more smooth after using it for a few days!  :)</li>
            <li>The serum is silky and smooth, and absorbs quickly , and it leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>and I have seen results within the first week.</li>
            <li>I noticed within first two days of  application under my eyes was tightening and on my forehead the brown spots were getting lighter.</li>
            <li>OMG My face has never looked better after only two days and nights my face looks and feels smoother</li>
            <li>The texture is really creamy and the product absorbs really quickly into my skin and leaves it feeling super soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>My skin really smooth and I will update my review in a few weeks for more result..</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>Very luxurious product...</li>
            <li>Nothing visible after using whole bottle.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed tightness in my face and neck area (in the areas of my natural smile lines and creases ).</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very refreshed and renewed.  </li>
            <li>other great thing about this product is that it is made with 100% natural ingredients and has a 90 day money back guarantee!</li>
            <li>My husband bought this product for me several days ago, first of all it has a light creamy consistency which is extremely important for me and also contains only natural and organic science- based formula.</li>
            <li>Bellafab sent this to me to review, and I was really excited to see that my skin definitely started to even out while using this product.</li>
            <li>She loves this one is easy to apply on and doesn&#x27;t dry her skin.</li>
            <li>Great mosturizer ..Didnt see much of a difference where I had some dark pigmented areas along my lower jaw line due to hormonal acne..</li>
            <li>This cream has definitely helped me wake up with a much brighter complex and a more attentive looking face even when I am sleep deprived!</li>
            <li>My second is that it was absorbing in to my skin and hydrating right away.</li>
            <li>My skin has a healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to it after a few days of use.</li>
            <li>love it and use it everyday ...</li>
            <li>I actually like the cream version of the serum rather than the liquid version that most other serums are because they are easier to apply and the nozzle is just soo much</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry, especially in the winter and love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to reapply moisturizer during the day.</li>
            <li>Compared to other products, I enjoy the scent of this serum over others.</li>
            <li>I of course jumped at the opportunity to try something new and I have never used a martixyl serum</li>
            <li>I have not had any irritation, even my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The price surprised me because usually these ingredients like I say are more high end</li>
            <li>The serum itself comes in a nice looking  pump bottle, and you need very little, so it should last a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the sticky side, so I do use a moisturizer afterward, but the peppermint oil that is added to it makes my face feel super refreshed!</li>
            <li>It has helped soften a few of my fine lines and lighten some discoloration I have from Melasma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>old  </li>
            <li>and I really can see some difference in the wrinkles they are getting smaller.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how old we are-</li>
            <li>enjoy using it everyday.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin feeling soft as it</li>
            <li>This is a fast acting formula.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t had anything drastic change, I do think this product helps to make the overall skin appearance much nicer.</li>
            <li>After she uses the serum, her skin feels soft and renewed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any irritation; I say this because my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really quickly into my skin and has helped to add moisture back into my normally dry skin.</li>
            <li>but it worked well for me to even my skin tone once I included a highly moisturizing cream on alternate nights</li>
            <li>So smooth and firm!  </li>
            <li>This product goes on so well with just a little bit used and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>which is a major plus because some serums are.</li>
            <li>and I see major improvement</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see any real difference.</li>
            <li>I am a 28 year old African/Irish American.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin fell so soft and is a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;i am looking forword to use it a long time and hope i will see a big difference.</li>
            <li>I also mix it will coconut oil before applying it has been a month and the bags under my eyes, are nearly gone, I still see them but not nearly what they were.</li>
            <li>In the few days I&#x27;ve had this, mine is like it was the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product although unfortunately I have yet to see any huge dramatic results.</li>

            <li> ,  Feels nice on the skin,</li>
            <li> I liked the texture of the cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review</li>
            <li> /&gt;The serum itself has an amazing, refreshing scent which comes from the Peppermint Oil in it.  </li>
            <li> and I am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice peppermint scent and easily spreads on your face.</li>
            <li> It has a nice creamy texture and a pleasant smell but those are the only good things I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I will buy more soon.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I have purchased my second bottle and I am very happy with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is OK, but I havent noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it, but I&#x27;m looking for something better.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product goes on my face.</li>
            <li> Bellafab is a fabulous company with amazing high-quality products.</li>
            <li> was given the opportunity to try Bellafab skincare martixyl 3000 serum free to try in return for an honest product review.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> :) recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> :):)</li>
            <li> Skin looks smoother and has a more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> The serum itself is more of a cream which I like because I don&#x27;t like watery serums.</li>
            <li> refreshing, you can feel the skin tightening effect</li>
            <li> serum also has some quality and proven ingredients such as the hyaluronic acid and vitamin C which are perfect ingredients for a serum!</li>
            <li> My favorite is that it&#x27;s a cream and not a liquid.  </li>
            <li> This product hydrates skin improves it by leaving it smooth and controls break outs also takes care of fine lines and expression line worth trying and great price.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s helping my fine lines and how evenly it absorbs.</li>
            <li> but I will say that so far it is easily a great competitor when paired against pricier anti-aging creams in its category.</li>
            <li> The good news is the product is reasonably priced, compared to all the products you buy in the mall or beauty shop.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products from Bellafab as well, and they continue to produce great products!</li>
            <li> I tried this out the first night I got it, and love it!  </li>
            <li> This skin care product is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> So this is very easy to apply and is quickly absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice face cream that has all the latest recommended products for younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Because of the peppermint it also gives a sort of cool and refreshing feeling when I apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is how nice the packaging was, it felt high-end</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m kind of a packaging person, after all it&#x27;s the first</li>
            <li> Helped with the fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I am constant being asked what  I using and told how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li> This is important because this contains ingredients that will require exfoliating scrub and without the moisturizer, you will get flakes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something light to wear under makeup and powder.</li>
            <li> It goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> It has a light peppermint scent that is uplifting.</li>
            <li> When I apply the serum it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; on my skin.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Also, the pump is not like those cheaply made ones.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing because of how easy it is to use, the results you get and the natural ingredients the company uses to make this product.</li>
            <li> It feels like t has more elasticity and from what I understand, the results only get better!  </li>
            <li> First off I love the smell of this serum.</li>
            <li> You can also use this product anywhere on your body that is dry, and it has a great moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> #34;who needs botox when you can do it naturally&amp;#34; - and that&#x27;s true; and this product helps with firming, plumping, as well as lightening up your skin.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle complimentary although my thoughts are always honest and completely unbiased.</li>
            <li> so you are getting your money’s worth.</li>
            <li> Honest review for a deep discounted price</li>
            <li> She noticed that it easily is absorbed into her skin and there are no problems.</li>
            <li> Not much in the Bottle have not noticed in help with wrinkles but it feels good on my face</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh in the mornings after I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, which I think is so important, and it&#x27;s also paraben free, and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more smooth after using it for a few days!  :)</li>
            <li> The serum is silky and smooth, and absorbs quickly , and it leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> and I have seen results within the first week.</li>
            <li> I noticed within first two days of  application under my eyes was tightening and on my forehead the brown spots were getting lighter.</li>
            <li> OMG My face has never looked better after only two days and nights my face looks and feels smoother</li>
            <li> The texture is really creamy and the product absorbs really quickly into my skin and leaves it feeling super soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> My skin really smooth and I will update my review in a few weeks for more result..</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> Very luxurious product...</li>
            <li> Nothing visible after using whole bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed tightness in my face and neck area (in the areas of my natural smile lines and creases ).</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very refreshed and renewed.  </li>
            <li> other great thing about this product is that it is made with 100% natural ingredients and has a 90 day money back guarantee!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this product for me several days ago, first of all it has a light creamy consistency which is extremely important for me and also contains only natural and organic science- based formula.</li>
            <li> Bellafab sent this to me to review, and I was really excited to see that my skin definitely started to even out while using this product.</li>
            <li> She loves this one is easy to apply on and doesn&#x27;t dry her skin.</li>
            <li> Great mosturizer ..Didnt see much of a difference where I had some dark pigmented areas along my lower jaw line due to hormonal acne..</li>
            <li> This cream has definitely helped me wake up with a much brighter complex and a more attentive looking face even when I am sleep deprived!</li>
            <li> My second is that it was absorbing in to my skin and hydrating right away.</li>
            <li> My skin has a healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to it after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> love it and use it everyday ...</li>
            <li> I actually like the cream version of the serum rather than the liquid version that most other serums are because they are easier to apply and the nozzle is just soo much</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry, especially in the winter and love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to reapply moisturizer during the day.</li>
            <li> Compared to other products, I enjoy the scent of this serum over others.</li>
            <li> I of course jumped at the opportunity to try something new and I have never used a martixyl serum</li>
            <li> I have not had any irritation, even my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The price surprised me because usually these ingredients like I say are more high end</li>
            <li> The serum itself comes in a nice looking  pump bottle, and you need very little, so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the sticky side, so I do use a moisturizer afterward, but the peppermint oil that is added to it makes my face feel super refreshed!</li>
            <li> It has helped soften a few of my fine lines and lighten some discoloration I have from Melasma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> old  </li>
            <li> and I really can see some difference in the wrinkles they are getting smaller.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how old we are-</li>
            <li> enjoy using it everyday.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin feeling soft as it</li>
            <li> This is a fast acting formula.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t had anything drastic change, I do think this product helps to make the overall skin appearance much nicer.</li>
            <li> After she uses the serum, her skin feels soft and renewed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any irritation; I say this because my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> It absorbs really quickly into my skin and has helped to add moisture back into my normally dry skin.</li>
            <li> but it worked well for me to even my skin tone once I included a highly moisturizing cream on alternate nights</li>
            <li> So smooth and firm!  </li>
            <li> This product goes on so well with just a little bit used and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> which is a major plus because some serums are.</li>
            <li> and I see major improvement</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see any real difference.</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old African/Irish American.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin fell so soft and is a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;i am looking forword to use it a long time and hope i will see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I also mix it will coconut oil before applying it has been a month and the bags under my eyes, are nearly gone, I still see them but not nearly what they were.</li>
            <li> In the few days I&#x27;ve had this, mine is like it was the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product although unfortunately I have yet to see any huge dramatic results.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long enough to tell,  </li>
            <li> I have not used long enough.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to test the long term affects</li>
            <li> I am only giving a partial review because I have only been using this for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks very classy and just a little bit of lotion goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have to say that while I give it 5 stars, my gf did find out that she is little sensitive to it</li>
            <li> Look forward to seeing what the long term results are.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After washing and toning, apply this product and then when it is dry, apply a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film on your skin nor does it seem still dry after use.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is actually very different from every other serum that I have taken because it is just like a cream that you apply to your face!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first but gave it a try</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on a daily basis for the past 30 days now.  </li>
            <li> What sets this serum apart from other vitamin C/hyaluronic acid serums out there is the slight menthol feeling it leaves on your face.</li>
            <li> Matryxl 3000 is an anti aging serum made to help reduce wrinkles, dark circles, even out your skin tone, and tightens your skin.</li>
            <li> Has a slight smell but not too over powering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this skin cream for a few days now</li>
            <li> After using it for a week she has felt her skin being firm and tightened.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly heavy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles but a few that I would like to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Have noticed a difference in my skin in just the few days I have been testing it.  </li>
            <li> it dried my skin out alot</li>
            <li> No strong fragrance and does not irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving it a try for the past few days</li>
            <li> Not sure if is works</li>
            <li> All you need is a small amount to cover your face and neck</li>
            <li> Hard to get all of it out of the container.</li>
            <li> Kudos for not putting aloe in this, which seems to be the craze for Amazon products lately.  </li>
            <li> By problems, I mean there is no irritation.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think this might be a good product but it didn&#x27;t last long enough to tell,  I was convinced enough to order it again.</li>
            <li> This smells really good</li>
            <li> It is a great smell and feels great</li>
            <li> Still using it without a noticeable result yet!</li>
            <li> This stuff is  great it really works.I am 57 yrs. old  and I do have wrinkles but started using this stuff and I really can see some difference in the wrinkles they are getting smaller. I am on my second bottle  and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Very luxurious product... Thankyou!</li>
            <li> I used this product for almost 2 months daily and saw no difference in how my skin looked or felt. It has a nice creamy texture and a pleasant smell but those are the only good things I&#x27;ve noticed. I had never heard of this company but because the reviews were so great I decided to give it a try. I guess they gave all the good samples to the bloggers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this skin cream for a few days now and I am pretty happy with it. I purchased it as part of a deal where I got a coupon for my review and I have added the face cream to my daily routine. I like that it is non-greasy and dries without leaving a residue. It has a minty smell to it. My skin has a healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to it after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this product for me several days ago, first of all it has a light creamy consistency which is extremely important for me and also contains only natural and organic science- based formula. Someone said: &amp;#34;who needs botox when you can do it naturally&amp;#34; - and that&#x27;s true; and this product helps with firming, plumping, as well as lightening up your skin. Doesn&#x27;t matter how old we are- everyone should protect skin and that&#x27;s why i recommend this best Anti Aging Face Cream- I will buy more soon. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I see a definite difference in the tightness and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing visible after using whole bottle.</li>
            <li> .. i am a huge fan of a cream.. and i could say this one is almost perfect...it lightens my acne scar.. and at the same time it give me a glowing face!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Was skeptical at first but gave it a try and I have seen results within the first week. I am constant being asked what  I using and told how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li> this is a very effective product for smoothing out and giving the face a nice youthful glow</li>
            <li> Love this. Iam noticing smoother skin. It looks youthful and glowing .  I rally love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Works just as described!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Not sure if is works but my skin likes it.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice face cream that has all the latest recommended products for younger looking skin. This product has a nice peppermint scent and easily spreads on your face. After washing and toning, apply this product and then when it is dry, apply a moisturizer. This is important because this contains ingredients that will require exfoliating scrub and without the moisturizer, you will get flakes. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Amazing skin care product, I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> good for skin. i use coupons to buy it. honestly, good product. enjoy using it everyday. will but it again</li>
            <li> So far I like this product, I mix it with another product I have with Hyalluric acid and Matryxil 3000 I also mix it will coconut oil before applying it has been a month and the bags under my eyes, are nearly gone, I still see them but not nearly what they were.</li>
            <li> you can feel it working. love it</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a serum and she has tried many and could not find one that was a good cream based serum until this one. She loves this one is easy to apply on and doesn&#x27;t dry her skin. After using it for a week she has felt her skin being firm and tightened. So we recommend that you try this if you been using a liquid type serum.</li>
            <li> I have seen an improvement in my skin in just 3 weeks</li>
            <li> This is a very nice serum.  Kudos for not putting aloe in this, which seems to be the craze for Amazon products lately.  Aloe should not be in quality skin care.</li>
            <li> This product goes on so well with just a little bit used and it absorbs quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film on your skin nor does it seem still dry after use. It is perfectly balanced and has a great smell as well. I love it!</li>
            <li> My skin really smooth and I will update my review in a few weeks for more result..</li>
            <li> received my Bellafab Face Cream and with just one use my face feels softer, great product I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I have purchased my second bottle and I am very happy with this moisturizer. I was looking for something light to wear under makeup and powder. My skin is very dry, especially in the winter and love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to reapply moisturizer during the day. Great value too!</li>
            <li> Product works great. Would def buy again</li>
            <li> I tend to use this as a day cream. It&#x27;s not overly heavy but I feel like I have some protection from the elements as well as the benefits of retinol.</li>
            <li> This product is OK, but I havent noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it, but I&#x27;m looking for something better.</li>
            <li> I received a discount code to purchase this product in order to review it. It is very good on my face. I like how it feels and refreshes my skin. I can see using this in my daily facial routine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awesome. I hope you guys have more!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on a daily basis for the past 30 days now.  I use it after each shower in the morning followed by a moisturizer as the directions recommend.  I have noticed my skin is softer, but I have not noticed any changes on the wrinkles yet.  I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles but a few that I would like to get rid of. I will continue to use this product to see if it requires longer duration before any change is noticed.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the product on my skin but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see any real difference.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking AMAZING.  So smooth and firm!  I  am loving this product!  It feels like t has more elasticity and from what I understand, the results only get better!  So pleased with this!</li>
            <li> This skin care product is so easy to use. I noticed within first two days of  application under my eyes was tightening and on my forehead the brown spots were getting lighter. Definitely would recommend this product to anyone to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this product for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are high-quality and the product is very effective</li>
            <li> I really love this serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week or so now and so has my husband and we both agree that it makes our faces feel AMAZING! It&#x27;s a little on the sticky side, so I do use a moisturizer afterward, but the peppermint oil that is added to it makes my face feel super refreshed! My face feels tighter even after just using it a week, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what results we get after longterm use!</li>
            <li> This product was packaged rather nicely. It goes on really smooth. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to test the long term affects but I will say that so far it is easily a great competitor when paired against pricier anti-aging creams in its category.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product goes on my face. I can feel it tighten as I put it on. It also leaves my skin feeling soft as it&lt;br /&gt;moistures at the same time. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bellafab is a fabulous company with amazing high-quality products. I always look forward to trying anything from them!&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try Bellafab skincare martixyl 3000 serum free to try in return for an honest product review. I of course jumped at the opportunity to try something new and I have never used a martixyl serum before!&lt;br /&gt;This serum is definitely lives up to its hype! My skin looks so much brighter and clearer. Helped with the fine lines and wrinkles. Tightened up the extra skin underneath my chin as well as tightening up thise pesky bags underneath my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on nice and rubs in well leaving my skin feel nice and moisturized. All you need is a small amount to cover your face and neck so you are getting your money’s worth. A must try!</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel. I have noticed a difference in my skins appearance since I started using it.  It has a pleasant peppermint smell and is not greasy!</li>
            <li> This is truley the best face serum!!! It&#x27;s non greasy which is a major plus because some serums are. This is a fast acting formula. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and I see major improvement :) recommend to everyone :):)</li>
            <li> Have noticed a difference in my skin in just the few days I have been testing it.  Skin looks smoother and has a more even skin tone.  No strong fragrance and does not irritate the skin at all. Great addition to your beauty routine.  Look forward to seeing what the long term results are.  Great product and service!</li>
            <li> First off I love the smell of this serum. It has a light peppermint scent that is uplifting. Because of the peppermint it also gives a sort of cool and refreshing feeling when I apply it to my skin. The serum itself is more of a cream which I like because I don&#x27;t like watery serums. When I apply the serum it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; on my skin. It also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily at all. It absorbs really quickly into my skin and has helped to add moisture back into my normally dry skin. On the bottle it boasts that this is the alternative to needle injections. While I haven&#x27;t had anything drastic change, I do think this product helps to make the overall skin appearance much nicer. It helped with dryness and made my skin texture feel a ton smoother. Compared to other products, I enjoy the scent of this serum over others. This is a nice product although unfortunately I have yet to see any huge dramatic results. I do think over time this would definitely improve your overall skin tone, texture, as well as add moisture. I received my bottle complimentary although my thoughts are always honest and completely unbiased.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin fell so soft and is a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;i am looking forword to use it a long time and hope i will see a big difference.</li>
            <li> Use this serum every night. Will order again</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any improvement.</li>
            <li> This is a quality serum!  Bellafab sent this to me to review, and I was really excited to see that my skin definitely started to even out while using this product.</li>
            <li> Great mosturizer ..Didnt see much of a difference where I had some dark pigmented areas along my lower jaw line due to hormonal acne.. After an hr of applying this product my face did become quite oily... I will not use on my face anymore I will mix it with a body lotion and see what kind of results I get.Honest review for a deep discounted price</li>
            <li> This product smells good and my wife loves it. She noticed that it easily is absorbed into her skin and there are no problems. By problems, I mean there is no irritation. She uses it on her face, arms and a couple of spots on her legs. She likes how the serum improves how her skin looks and feels. After she uses the serum, her skin feels soft and renewed. She is happy she had to a chance to review this product for free. The good news is the product is reasonably priced, compared to all the products you buy in the mall or beauty shop. This product is amazing because of how easy it is to use, the results you get and the natural ingredients the company uses to make this product.</li>
            <li> I just got it couple of days ago.  I don&#x27;t see any changes on my skin.  It makes my skin duller then before.  It might work on someone else skin but not mine.  I will have to return it.</li>
            <li> Not much in the Bottle have not noticed in help with wrinkles but it feels good on my face</li>
            <li> This lotion feels so good! I&#x27;ve been giving it a try for the past few days and I&#x27;m thrilled with my results! I love how it&#x27;s helping my fine lines and how evenly it absorbs. The bottle looks very classy and just a little bit of lotion goes a long way! I&#x27;ve already incorporated it into my daily routine and I look forward to seeing more awesome results! I did receive a discount on this product but the price doesn&#x27;t change how happy I am with our results, nor does it effect my review!</li>
            <li> love it and use it everyday ...</li>
            <li> Was a great product! Received my order in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> it dried my skin out alot but it worked well for me to even my skin tone once I included a highly moisturizing cream on alternate nights</li>
            <li> refreshing, you can feel the skin tightening effect</li>
            <li> I am only giving a partial review because I have only been using this for 2 weeks. I am a 28 year old African/Irish American. Pros : I have been using the Bellafab Skincare for two weeks now. I have really dry skin. After using the Bellafab Skincare, my skin is stays moisturized all day. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film. I have also noticed tightness in my face and neck area (in the areas of my natural smile lines and creases ). I will update my review once the product is finished.</li>
            <li> Just started using and have been using for about a week now ... makes my face feel smooth and wonderful.  Has a slight smell but not too over powering. Like the pump on the bottle, dispenses the perfect amount each time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! What sets this serum apart from other vitamin C/hyaluronic acid serums out there is the slight menthol feeling it leaves on your face. It is especially great to use in the morning as sort of a &amp;#34;wake me up.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My skin feels more smooth after using it for a few days!  :)</li>
            <li> works well for the price. Hard to get all of it out of the container.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  I ordered it for the ingredients that are in this product.  The price surprised me because usually these ingredients like I say are more high end so I wanted to try it out.  Very good.</li>
            <li> feels nice on skin; can&#x27;t see any change yet...but I&#x27;m hopeful!</li>
            <li> This product hydrates skin improves it by leaving it smooth and controls break outs also takes care of fine lines and expression line worth trying and great price.</li>
            <li> I have not used long enough.,  Feels nice on the skin,</li>
            <li> OMG My face has never looked better after only two days and nights my face looks and feels smoother the finger lines around my eyes are almost gone!! I love this product!! I will update again after one week!</li>
            <li> I thought that Bellafab Skincare- Best Face Cream and Moisturizer is an easy to use product. I liked the texture of the cream. It felt great on my skin. I didn&#x27;t have any irritation; I say this because my skin is sensitive. My skin looks fresh in the mornings after I use it. I plan on  to continue using it and if I run out I will buy more!</li>
            <li> Bellafab sent me this wonderful serum to review for my blog, GlamRiver.  The first thing I noticed is how nice the packaging was, it felt high-end and I&#x27;m kind of a packaging person, after all it&#x27;s the first impression!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself has an amazing, refreshing scent which comes from the Peppermint Oil in it.  The texture is really creamy and the product absorbs really quickly into my skin and leaves it feeling super soft and hydrated.  It has helped soften a few of my fine lines and lighten some discoloration I have from Melasma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great thing about this product is that it is made with 100% natural ingredients and has a 90 day money back guarantee!</li>
            <li> Love this!  My face feels and looks better no kidding!  It does what it say and that&#x27;s a plus in my book.  Give this a try.</li>
            <li> Matryxl 3000 is an anti aging serum made to help reduce wrinkles, dark circles, even out your skin tone, and tightens your skin.The serum itself comes in a nice looking  pump bottle, and you need very little, so it should last a while. The serum is silky and smooth, and absorbs quickly , and it leaves your skin feeling soft. It&#x27;s gentle on your skin. My skin is prone to irritation, and I had no problems with this product. You can also use this product anywhere on your body that is dry, and it has a great moisturizing effect. Of coarse the product is not going to produce results over night but my skin feels great and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The product contains peptides, Vitamin C, and Hyaluronic Acid. These ingredients are known to be awesome for your skin. It&#x27;s all natural, which I think is so important, and it&#x27;s also paraben free, and hypoallergenic.I think this is a great safe product for your skin, and I&#x27;m happy to have tried it.</li>
            <li> This serum is a great anti-aging serum! This is actually very different from every other serum that I have taken because it is just like a cream that you apply to your face! So this is very easy to apply and is quickly absorbed by my skin. I actually like the cream version of the serum rather than the liquid version that most other serums are because they are easier to apply and the nozzle is just soo much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum also has some quality and proven ingredients such as the hyaluronic acid and vitamin C which are perfect ingredients for a serum! This cream has definitely helped me wake up with a much brighter complex and a more attentive looking face even when I am sleep deprived! This serum is great for wrinkles, discoloration, and just  The serum is a good size of 1oz/30mL. I definitely recommend this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review</li>
            <li> I have to say that while I give it 5 stars, my gf did find out that she is little sensitive to it and it made her break out.  Personally, I think it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  It makes my skin feel very refreshed and renewed.  The applicator is well designed and allows for good portion control.  I have tried other products from Bellafab as well, and they continue to produce great products!</li>
            <li> I tried this out the first night I got it, and love it!  My favorite is that it&#x27;s a cream and not a liquid.  My second is that it was absorbing in to my skin and hydrating right away. It is creamy in texture &amp; not so gel like. I have not had any irritation, even my very sensitive skin.  Also, the pump is not like those cheaply made ones.  In the few days I&#x27;ve had this, mine is like it was the first day I used it.</li>
