            <li>I used this to do a burn makeup I have never done any kind of makeup before.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on nicely over the latex.</li>
            <li>I bought it to blend in latex ear tip appliances for Halloween and it works perfectly, drying crystal clear and accepting makeup as needed</li>
            <li>super fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li>Fantastic for foam latex appliances and flesh!</li>
            <li>Repeat the steps; add more TP and more latex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>doing those steps to work on layering and adding more effect to your zombie wounds.</li>
            <li>I opened this and the smell of ammonia was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Glue works great, held costume ears on very well.</li>
            <li>the bottle is about the size of my index finger if that helps :3</li>
            <li>Not the product&#x27;s fault, we need more practice???</li>
            <li>It dries very fast and can make really good gore makeup.</li>
            <li>and I think it came out pretty good.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great product!!</li>
            <li>I use a qtip to apply it around my nails and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Never used liquid latex before but this stuff was easy to use and held up all night.</li>
            <li>Like many people on here, I bought this stuff to use around my nails when I do nail designs for easy clean up.</li>
            <li>But we felt it was worth it - the masks really turned out great.  </li>
            <li>Strong odor,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable putting this on my skin.</li>
            <li>It works great, but u actually had to spend additional money in order to have the product in a bottle with a brush</li>
            <li>We applied several coats and it worked great.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and removal is easy.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like old eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>I made awesome wounds out of toilet paper using this liquid latex, which stayed on the skin even after many layers of other stage makeup.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It peels up very easily and with no mess.</li>
            <li>this product is highly recommended for special effects makeup!</li>
            <li>The packaging was great too, small box with the 2oz bottle in a plastic baggie.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying this brand</li>
            <li>It turned out exactly the way we were hoping it would.  </li>
            <li>I poured this into a clean, empty nail polish bottle and use it around my nails for easy cleanup and nail art.</li>
            <li>It works really well and dries pretty quickly, but, IT SMELLS LIKE OLD CAT PEE.</li>
            <li>but it is very smelly.</li>
            <li>i was hesitant to try a different brand of latex than i normally would use, but i am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of getting used to when you&#x27;re working with it but quite comfortable when wearing for a long time.</li>
            <li>Great results and a small bottle can go a long way!</li>
            <li>Now this is the state where the Walking Dead all began, I&#x27;m just glad it all went</li>
            <li>Works great and a little bit goes a long way, I only used 1/8 bottle for one costume for a large open wound on my neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small amount, but good for only tour personal use if I&#x27;d say</li>
            <li>Since it dries clear, covering with a liquid foundation was no problem at all</li>
            <li>and I had just run out of my old liquid latex.</li>
            <li>I received an old batch.</li>
            <li>Some caution when applying the liquid directly to your face (which is what we did)</li>
            <li>The product was dry and tacky straight out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong but it is to be expected.</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s always that small instinct of fear that someone might think it&#x27;s the real deal and you end up getting shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tear apart toilet paper.</li>
            <li> you can mix acrylic paint into this liquid latex to make it any color you want - we mixed in black acrylic paint for our masks.</li>
            <li> spent 5 minutes</li>
            <li> (I purchased some empty nail polish bottles for this).</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I used this for my Halloween costume using a simple Youtube tutorial, by pouring a little bit of the latex on a paper plate and building up thin layers with a new makeup sponge each time.</li>
            <li> Dang we had high hopes for webbed hands and we even watched a youtube tutorial, but it ended poorly.</li>
            <li> No need to spend $22 on a small tube of Liquid Palisade - actually a tiny tube of 0.35 fl oz.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems with this product!  </li>
            <li> it is dried</li>
            <li> I have a convention in a few weeks</li>
            <li> It was difficult to spread and it&#x27;s possible</li>
            <li> ADD (fake) BLOOD to finish the look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She likes it and uses it as needed to make fake Scars</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful, smells like dead rat.</li>
            <li> VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE</li>
            <li> (see pic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the liquid latex smells bad!</li>
            <li> so, I&#x27;ll just pinch my nose and go on with my bad latex self!</li>

            <li> I purchased this to use for nail art.  It works great when you apply it around the skin when you are water marbling, sponging, or stamping a design on to your nail.  It dries quickly and removal is easy.  No need to spend $22 on a small tube of Liquid Palisade - actually a tiny tube of 0.35 fl oz.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but it is to be expected.

            <li> Ordered this to do my nail art and it works great! I use a qtip to apply it around my nails and it dries very quickly. By the time I get all my nails done it is dried and I can then do my nails. It peels up very easily and with no mess.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping, great product! i was hesitant to try a different brand of latex than i normally would use, but i am not disappointed. this product is highly recommended for special effects makeup!</li>
            <li> Excellent for use with nail polish applications</li>
            <li> Best brand out there! Fantastic for foam latex appliances and flesh! Super easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is some really good latex! It dries very fast and can make really good gore makeup. Heads up though, the smell isn&#x27;t pleasant</li>
            <li> Perfect! Used this to create a zombie look for Halloween. Tip for creating zombie wound: Tear apart toilet paper. 2. Lay on skin with liquid latex (let it sit for 30 seconds) 3. Repeat the steps; add more TP and more latex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep doing those steps to work on layering and adding more effect to your zombie wounds. ADD (fake) BLOOD to finish the look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent 5 minutes and I think it came out pretty good. (see pic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the liquid latex smells bad! Kind of like old eyelash glue. My BF asked me to keep the cup I had it in away from his face. ;-)</li>
            <li> Never used liquid latex before but this stuff was easy to use and held up all night. Very happy with how it worked.</li>
            <li> I hope that most liquid latex is not made with ammonia! I opened this and the smell of ammonia was overwhelming.  I should have done research, but I didn&#x27;t expect this product to have ammonia in it.  I don&#x27;t feel comfortable putting this on my skin.</li>
            <li> Like many people on here, I bought this stuff to use around my nails when I do nail designs for easy clean up. It works really well and dries pretty quickly, but, IT SMELLS LIKE OLD CAT PEE. I took a look at the ingredients list, and it does have ammonia in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Ammonia is a corrosive ingredient and may cause or lead to irritations on the skin, burns, and/or cell damage. Use at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I do not feel like I will use this enough to cause health problems so, I&#x27;ll just pinch my nose and go on with my bad latex self!</li>
            <li> I bought this to attack a mask to my face.  Worked perfectly.  It would stay of my face all day with out any issues.</li>
            <li> I used this for my Halloween costume and loved it. I just wished it was compatible with  makeup. I loved the fact that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> Good if you have never used a product like this before - builds easily !</li>
            <li> This stuff is the truth. So sticky, but all residue can be removed once it dries. I made awesome wounds out of toilet paper using this liquid latex, which stayed on the skin even after many layers of other stage makeup.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly. Great product.</li>
            <li> Liquid latex is always a great makeup tool.</li>
            <li> My daughter does theatrical makeup work this liquid lay text does the job!  Absolutely no problems with this product!  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Glue works great, held costume ears on very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Works really great. It&#x27;s a small amount, but good for only tour personal use if I&#x27;d say</li>
            <li> Great product, lasted all night and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great quality!  I bought it to blend in latex ear tip appliances for Halloween and it works perfectly, drying crystal clear and accepting makeup as needed</li>
            <li> Can wait to start using this, r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered this (2oz) because it said in the questions portion that the bottoms comes with a brush in the lid. I plan to use the liquid latex as a barrier for nail art. It works great, but u actually had to spend additional money in order to have the product in a bottle with a brush (I purchased some empty nail polish bottles for this). The ONLY reason I deducted a star is for the lack of brush. Other than that it is a great product!!</li>
            <li> I have a convention in a few weeks and I had just run out of my old liquid latex. This was my first time buying this brand but it works great! The packaging was great too, small box with the 2oz bottle in a plastic baggie.</li>
            <li> Strong odor, but that&#x27;s to be expected. It was difficult to spread and it&#x27;s possible I received an old batch. The product was dry and tacky straight out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I used this to do a burn makeup I have never done any kind of makeup before. Takes a bit of getting used to when you&#x27;re working with it but quite comfortable when wearing for a long time. Makeup goes on nicely over the latex. Great results and a small bottle can go a long way!</li>
            <li> This is really really great, I used it on halloween to be a zombie and I went ALL THE WAY OUT. Make up, costume, walking barefoot, blood. It was great xD Scared the hell out of everyone on my college campus, walking around, riding the bus, chasing people, and wandering inside classrooms. Now this is the state where the Walking Dead all began, I&#x27;m just glad it all went well (: There&#x27;s always that small instinct of fear that someone might think it&#x27;s the real deal and you end up getting shot.&lt;br /&gt;First semester was a win! #freshman #NoIDidNotLoseABet #HellYeaImAGirl #zombielove&lt;br /&gt;and the bottle is about the size of my index finger if that helps :3</li>
            <li> I poured this into a clean, empty nail polish bottle and use it around my nails for easy cleanup and nail art. Way cheaper than the purple stuff everyone online is using and it works great!</li>
            <li> Dang we had high hopes for webbed hands and we even watched a youtube tutorial, but it ended poorly. Had to abandon the effort and go to Plan B. Not the product&#x27;s fault, we need more practice??? Or maybe we are too evolved for webbed hands lol</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and because the customer service was excellent I&#x27;ll definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Bought it for nail art and works like magic!!</li>
            <li> My fiancé and I used this to make reusable latex superhero masks for Halloween via an online tutorial. We applied several coats and it worked great. It turned out exactly the way we were hoping it would.  Some caution when applying the liquid directly to your face (which is what we did) - it appears to be acetone-based (the stuff that&#x27;s in nail polish remover) so we got a bit of a chemical burn on our faces in the shape of the mask, and the acetone fumes that were coming off of it as it dried on our face really irritates the eyes.  But we felt it was worth it - the masks really turned out great.  Pro tip: you can mix acrylic paint into this liquid latex to make it any color you want - we mixed in black acrylic paint for our masks.</li>
