            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Wife loved it happy wife happy husband</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful color I love it</li>
            <li>IT STREAKS AND NEED 3 COATS TO GET A GOOD COLOR.</li>
            <li>I am experienced with doing my own gel polish.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s drying it crinkles up and doesn&#x27;t look too good.</li>
            <li>This is a good size nail polish</li>
            <li>just as good in every way.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve continually used sensational primer, to and bottom coat.</li>
            <li>Very nice and love the color.  </li>
            <li>will be getting more colors of this brand!</li>
            <li>I did love the color though!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>amazing, and got here in time.</li>
            <li>AND IT WAS A NICE COAT</li>
            <li>Nice color for Spring or Summer, received lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, nail polish should not require more than 2 maybe 3 coats ( and 3 is pushing it) I had bought the color based on the good reviews and the customer images that were posted.</li>
            <li>I did upload one of my own pictures with its own caption that states the color</li>
            <li>Which worked nicely</li>
            <li>great classic color, worked great with my gelish top and bottom coat.</li>
            <li>It has not shimmer, but it was not so easy to apply for me, needed four or more coats to get a good coverage on nails.</li>
            <li>I used this for a &amp;#34;Pink and White manicure look&amp;#34; was a perfect color......</li>
            <li>and then I added white stripe LOVE this color!!!!</li>
            <li>LOVE FIREWORKS BTW</li>
            <li>I love the color.  </li>
            <li>Nails holding up OK on day one, I like the color</li>
            <li>Love the color but a bit too lite</li>
            <li>It went on better after I shook it.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I really love this polish....</li>
            <li>the color is great and it came fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this color.</li>
            <li>This color would be appropriate to wear anywhere.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>well in the end I upgraded to a much better kit</li>
            <li>but it gave me an idea if I wanted to fork over more money.    </li>
            <li>but I found many stores don&#x27;t have a lot of colors to pick from.</li>
            <li>Love ibd just gel, but i can&#x27;t get around this color.&lt;br /&gt;Cute</li>
            <li>for a pre-teen, too pinky for most anything.</li>
            <li>My first manicure after fuse was sensational.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the polish is great,  the brush is the right size,  and this color has just the right among of pigment.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully the top coat flattens out and makes it smooth but.</li>
            <li>This is a very beautiful light pink.</li>
            <li>Wonderful light pink creamy color.</li>
            <li>It might not be what you expect, but is overall beautiful.</li>
            <li>(hint put it in a bowl and then in a bowl of hot water to warm it up..</li>
            <li>But others are perfectly fine after two.    </li>
            <li>The Juliet color is a very pretty opaque kind of bubblegum color, but it bubbled up on the first layer (whaaaaaat?!?)</li>
            <li>Very pretty, I love to use Gelish June Bride sparkles.</li>
            <li>and it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>It has fantastic coverage, I applied three coats and it turned out fantastic.</li>
            <li>Until one day I found this cheap kit at target \\&quot;fuse\\&quot;....</li>
            <li>but I was surprised and the paint looked good until I removed it on day 13.    </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve experimented with fuse, sensational, gelish, And ibd.</li>
            <li>I encourage anyone who hadn&#x27;t tried the gel polish to do so cause its fast and easy also better than going to the shop.</li>
            <li>I used this color for my first DIY gel manicure with g-ish foundation and top it</li>
            <li>Its a great shade of pink!</li>
            <li>and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t coat very even and when using gel you need to paint lightly.</li>
            <li>Where ibd seems superior to the other brands is in the removal.</li>
            <li>I do my own shellac at home, and I&#x27;ve been able to get lazy because it always works so well.  </li>
            <li>Also it &amp;#34;pools&amp;#34; to the sides of the nail no matter what you do to avoid it, or how much you clean up the sides before curing.</li>
            <li>Opi gel is much better and worth the extra money</li>
            <li>This color is more of a light pastel pink.</li>
            <li>You can easily see that the nails are polished,  but it isn&#x27;t a loud Color.</li>
            <li>ITS A LOT MORE SHEER</li>
            <li>I will be buying a lot more of it in the future!</li>
            <li>The only downside I&#x27;ve found is I can&#x27;t find it in store and many of the Amazon seller&#x27;s don&#x27;t use prime, so I have to wait longer.    </li>
            <li>A light shade of pink, opaque with 3 coats, easy application, comparable to Essie muchi muchi, not too milky colored, nice formula, preferred over gelish pink smoothie.</li>
            <li>FAST CAUSE</li>
            <li>The color in the picture looked more like a bubblegum pink.</li>
            <li>I received the polish really fast</li>
            <li>The color is very feminine</li>
            <li>They seek them for roughly $5 vs Amazon which is more than $10.    </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really recommend</li>
            <li>Ibd once it&#x27;s soaked comes off in half the time or even more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a little time to learn how to get the right amount and on smooth (five nails).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The color is extremely light, barely pink.</li>
            <li>Polish color also lasts a long time, stays true.  </li>
            <li>I normally use CND colors and the quality of this is inferior.</li>
            <li>poor quality, doesn&#x27;t look good on nails.</li>
            <li>Small amount of streakiness goes away after top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First time I buy outside the Gelish line &amp;</li>
            <li>I love the cost vs amount I get with the Ibd I can spend roughly the same on sensational..but have smaller bottles..or spend twice as much on gelish.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s kind of gross.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a flashy pink.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have about this, if you consider it a complaint is it has a thinner consistency and requires two coats to get a nice look, but I love the soft pink color it gives.</li>
            <li>well worth the price as it is less expensive than most &#x27;gel polish&#x27;.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s starting to show signs of wear on the very edge of the nail, but it&#x27;s hard to see because of the natural looking color.</li>

            <li> This is another one that just doesn&#x27;t want to last a long time.</li>
            <li> With sensational and gelish the removal even with soaking is horrible...it does peel off but in small sections and is tedious work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands that either yellow or fade with sun exposure.</li>
            <li> If soaked enough requires little to no scraping.</li>
            <li> it took two coats of pink</li>
            <li> Came in a timely fashion if not faster then expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking for other colors made by IBD.</li>
            <li> Its Barbie pink, got a lot of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> All other brands I&#x27;m looking at 30-45 minutes..    </li>
            <li> I typically buy gel polish at a beauty supply store in town but have decided to start looking online.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve included a picture (con fusion) the slight chipping occurred on day 2 because I broke a nail and cut all of them as a result.</li>
            <li> Thin coats are key.</li>
            <li> I have worn it a few times and do like it.. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This color requires three coats to appear opaque, but three coats still leaves faint streaks if you look closely enough.</li>
            <li> did not find the color to be thin as mentioned in other reviews</li>
            <li> I really did:(</li>
            <li> Hate it so much shrinkage</li>
            <li> -IT&#x27;S SO SUBTLE AND 3D.</li>
            <li> Which also made it difficult for it to turn out the way I had wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I expected at that point they would chip horribly</li>
            <li> The smell of this was horrible but it was too small of amount to pay to return it.</li>
            <li> Color is very thin and took three coats and still not fully opaque!</li>
            <li> so I had to soak it off and restart (grr).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I used this for a &amp;#34;Pink and White manicure look&amp;#34; was a perfect color...... did not find the color to be thin as mentioned in other reviews it took two coats of pink and then I added white stripe LOVE this color!!!! and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> The smell of this was horrible but it was too small of amount to pay to return it. I tossed it.  It might have worked well, but could not stand the smell.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS BRAND-MANY CHOICES AND AFFORDABLE. ITS A LOT MORE SHEER AND YOU HAVE TO WORK FAST CAUSE IT STREAKS AND NEED 3 COATS TO GET A GOOD COLOR. I BOUGHT FIREWORKS AND IT WAS A NICE COAT TO CAMO THE STREAKS. LOVE FIREWORKS BTW-IT&#x27;S SO SUBTLE AND 3D.</li>
            <li> I love the color.  It&#x27;s not a flashy pink.  Works well if you wanted to use a the back color and have white tips.</li>
            <li> Color is very thin and took three coats and still not fully opaque! Would not buy this brand again! Opi gel is much better and worth the extra money</li>
            <li> I do my own shellac at home, and I&#x27;ve been able to get lazy because it always works so well.  This. is not. that.  The Juliet color is a very pretty opaque kind of bubblegum color, but it bubbled up on the first layer (whaaaaaat?!?) so I had to soak it off and restart (grr).  This stuff is streaky, got EVERYWHERE (I never paint my cutitcles, and yet I&#x27;m picking it off this morning), dented an hour later (again, whaaaaaat?!?) and left a rubbery residue on my hands.  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s kind of gross.  Nails holding up OK on day one, I like the color and it was cheap.  But going forward, I&#x27;ll probably just pony up for shellac.</li>
            <li> This color is awesome but it is so opaque I have to apply 3 layers and even then you get a patchy color. It&#x27;s not a uniform even color.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t coat very even and when using gel you need to paint lightly.</li>
            <li> The color is extremely light, barely pink. like a creamy color. It might not be what you expect, but is overall beautiful.</li>
            <li> A light shade of pink, opaque with 3 coats, easy application, comparable to Essie muchi muchi, not too milky colored, nice formula, preferred over gelish pink smoothie.</li>
            <li> Love the color but a bit too lite</li>
            <li> I used this color for my first DIY gel manicure with g-ish foundation and top it off.&lt;br /&gt;It took a little time to learn how to get the right amount and on smooth (five nails). It went on better after I shook it. Wipe almost all the polish off the brush. Thin coats are key. Small amount of streakiness goes away after top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting more colors of this brand! Great Deal!</li>
            <li> This is another one that just doesn&#x27;t want to last a long time. I can get it to stay for about 4 days and then it starts to chip.</li>
            <li> Love the color. Came in a timely fashion if not faster then expected!</li>
            <li> Hate it so much shrinkage</li>
            <li> I really love this polish....the color is great and it came fast in the mail. I would recommend to all!</li>
            <li> Nice color for Spring or Summer, received lots of compliments.  Polish color also lasts a long time, stays true.  I&#x27;ve bought other brands that either yellow or fade with sun exposure. I&#x27;ll be looking for other colors made by IBD.</li>
            <li> This color requires three coats to appear opaque, but three coats still leaves faint streaks if you look closely enough. Also it &amp;#34;pools&amp;#34; to the sides of the nail no matter what you do to avoid it, or how much you clean up the sides before curing. I am experienced with doing my own gel polish. I normally use CND colors and the quality of this is inferior. I did love the color though!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this, if you consider it a complaint is it has a thinner consistency and requires two coats to get a nice look, but I love the soft pink color it gives.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it happy wife happy husband</li>
            <li> Very nice and love the color.  This is a good product and well worth the price as it is less expensive than most &#x27;gel polish&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Great color! Its Barbie pink, got a lot of compliments on it! Great for summer or the beach. Its a great shade of pink!</li>
            <li> The color is so transparent that it takes 4-5 coats for it to not be transparent. Which also made it difficult for it to turn out the way I had wanted it to. In my opinion, nail polish should not require more than 2 maybe 3 coats ( and 3 is pushing it) I had bought the color based on the good reviews and the customer images that were posted. The color in the picture looked more like a bubblegum pink. This color is more of a light pastel pink. I did upload one of my own pictures with its own caption that states the color is actually 2-3 shades lighter than the picture. I wanted to love this color. I really did:(</li>
            <li> The consistency of the polish is great,  the brush is the right size,  and this color has just the right among of pigment.  You can easily see that the nails are polished,  but it isn&#x27;t a loud Color. This color would be appropriate to wear anywhere. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a very beautiful light pink. I have worn it a few times and do like it.. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This polish is great. It has fantastic coverage, I applied three coats and it turned out fantastic. I&#x27;ve had it on for two weeks now and it&#x27;s starting to show signs of wear on the very edge of the nail, but it&#x27;s hard to see because of the natural looking color.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful color I love it and it doesn&#x27;t chip. Well be buying this again.I encourage anyone who hadn&#x27;t tried the gel polish to do so cause its fast and easy also better than going to the shop. All you need is a uv lamp and the polish</li>
            <li> great classic color, worked great with my gelish top and bottom coat. Very pretty, I love to use Gelish June Bride sparkles.</li>
            <li> I typically buy gel polish at a beauty supply store in town but have decided to start looking online.  I received the polish really fast and I love it. The color is very feminine and I don&#x27;t feel like a teenager with neon nails. This is a great product. I will be buying a lot more of it in the future!</li>
            <li> I was always intrigued by this gel polish fad..but could never bring myself to pay the $$.    Until one day I found this cheap kit at target \\&quot;fuse\\&quot;....well in the end I upgraded to a much better kit..but it gave me an idea if I wanted to fork over more money.    My first manicure after fuse was sensational. Which worked nicely but I found many stores don&#x27;t have a lot of colors to pick from. So I went on a mission to try different brands and came across ibd.    The only downside I&#x27;ve found is I can&#x27;t find it in store and many of the Amazon seller&#x27;s don&#x27;t use prime, so I have to wait longer.    Some colors I&#x27;ve used (ie: north wind) seem to take Three, sometimes four coats to get everything even. But others are perfectly fine after two.    I love the cost vs amount I get with the Ibd I can spend roughly the same on sensational..but have smaller bottles..or spend twice as much on gelish.    So far I&#x27;ve experimented with fuse, sensational, gelish, And ibd. Application aside from fuse is the same for all. And I&#x27;ve continually used sensational primer, to and bottom coat. They all apply with about the same amount of difficulty or lack there of.    Where ibd seems superior to the other brands is in the removal. While the prices is the same for all...buff the polish up, soak in acetone (hint put it in a bowl and then in a bowl of hot water to warm it up..it helps) then scratch it off. Sensational has an excellent removal tool...I highly recommend. But get it from Wal-Mart or target. They seek them for roughly $5 vs Amazon which is more than $10.    With sensational and gelish the removal even with soaking is horrible...it does peel off but in small sections and is tedious work. Ibd once it&#x27;s soaked comes off in half the time or even more. If soaked enough requires little to no scraping. I&#x27;d say I can get ibd off in 15-20 minutes tops. All other brands I&#x27;m looking at 30-45 minutes..    I have had no problem with chipping. I&#x27;ve included a picture (con fusion) the slight chipping occurred on day 2 because I broke a nail and cut all of them as a result. I expected at that point they would chip horribly but I was surprised and the paint looked good until I removed it on day 13.    Five stars. Definitely my go to brand.</li>
            <li> Love ibd just gel, but i can&#x27;t get around this color.&lt;br /&gt;Cute for a pre-teen, too pinky for most anything.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  My girls loved the color!</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s drying it crinkles up and doesn&#x27;t look too good. Thankfully the top coat flattens out and makes it smooth but. This is a good size nail polish but I don&#x27;t really recommend</li>
            <li> Wonderful light pink creamy color. It has not shimmer, but it was not so easy to apply for me, needed four or more coats to get a good coverage on nails.</li>
            <li> poor quality, doesn&#x27;t look good on nails.</li>
            <li> First time I buy outside the Gelish line &amp; I regret not doing it sooner...just as good in every way.</li>
            <li> amazing, and got here in time.</li>
