    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great for all hair types and length!</li>
            <li>These are perfect.</li>
            <li>Simply awesome.</li>
            <li>These are great.  </li>
            <li>these were advertised as being perfect for fine g&lt;br /&gt;hair ...</li>
            <li>I think the colors are good - they are Neutral.  </li>
            <li>I bought these at a good price.</li>
            <li>Good product, just not for me.</li>
            <li>Good value, easy to use and doesn&#x27;t slide off my head.</li>
            <li>They do not even make a suitable slingshot or spitball launcher.</li>
            <li>You can tell they are very cheap.</li>
            <li>love the sticky rubber lining, makes the head band stay in place.</li>
            <li>but I had purchased too many</li>
            <li>Stays in better if you are wrapping hair around it, otherwise it slips every time I move my head.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a better price than Amazon.</li>
            <li>and they are priced at $4.00 or more for the 4 pack.</li>
            <li>They fit snugly, which is fine; however, the plastic grip on the underside does not keep the band in place.  </li>
            <li>These are great and hold my hair back like they should.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that the rubbery elastic on the underside would keep these in my hair so I could get off cheap, but they slide off pretty easily.</li>
            <li>overall good product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pulling my hair back as it grows out, which takes a fair bit of patience...</li>
            <li>Like that its non slip I&#x27;m currently trying to try new hair styles so its great for that</li>
            <li>These hold a little better but could still use more grip.</li>
            <li>I like the rubbery inner to hold onto hair, but I have naturally very smooth hair</li>
            <li>The first time I put one of the headwraps on, it broke at the seam.  </li>
            <li>Slips more then the regular ones</li>
            <li>but if you get it wet and then wear it they will stretch out a little, or you can just use them for your children and they&#x27;ll be perfect.</li>
            <li>They are kind of tight on my head and pull on my hair.  </li>
            <li>and the width is great as well not to thin</li>
            <li>selection of colors is nice, a few browns/khakis.</li>
            <li>My hair can get quite soft, so the headbands without grip, slide right off.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to spend more than a few bucks on headbands, especially since it&#x27;s so easy to lose them.</li>
            <li>I got these to keep my short hair corralled during workouts, but I spend too much time re-adjusting my headbands!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d be fine for someone with coarse or thin hair, but my hair is very fine yet thick.</li>
            <li>Pulls small hairs, doesn&#x27;t stay in place,  stretched out easily.</li>
            <li>I use these for &amp;#34;puffs&amp;#34; in which I double the headband and slide it back on my head to make it look like I have a long, large ponytail.  </li>
            <li>- I usually get headaches or they slip (even with the grip), but I think that they are worth giving a go.</li>

            <li> - I usually get headaches or they slip (even with the grip), but I think that they are worth giving a go.</li>
            <li> I tried it anyway, and they still slipped so that the loop was far back and behind my head, and besides not doing a thing to hold my hair it looked really dopey.</li>
            <li> A little tight at first</li>
            <li> The elastic has started to wear it stretched out after One use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using plain old clips, I guess.</li>
            <li> Its slips a few inches back and even off my head entirely.  </li>
            <li> They are tight enough without squeezing the life out of my head.</li>
            <li> I did not go to the trouble of sending them back.</li>
            <li> Thinner than expected, but work well.</li>
            <li> Definitely subtle, with enough color selection to go with several (if not all) of my outfits.</li>
            <li> I am black with natural, thick hair.</li>
            <li> A waste of my money, and it took a long time for them to be mailed</li>
            <li> I was wearing them (trying to wear them) with a ponytail, and wondered if maybe they&#x27;re designed to be worn with your hair down, which I never do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite to a spot where I can wear these without also putting in bobby pins, but eventually the weight of my growing hair will hold these down in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus found them for Half the price at rite aide.</li>
            <li> Too tight on my hear.</li>
            <li> These are too tight.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a plain black band to wear during my workouts.  </li>
            <li> (I have to use at least three elastics tied on tight to hold a ponytail for an extended amount of time) and a hairline that starts farther up on my forehead, so this didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> I bought these after cutting my hair too short for barrettes in the hop that I&#x27;d have something to keep my hair out of my face while cooking and doing other things.  </li>
            <li> Plus, they were really small.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to fix them 3-4 times during a 30 minute run on the elliptical.</li>
            <li> They slip like mad, making them completely useless; they slide back so far that the elastic is relaxed, and the loop is just sitting there on my head.</li>
            <li> Not liked at all.  </li>
            <li> Was annoyed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even with the silicone backing, these still slide off my head.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I need something to keep flyaways in place for a windy and dirty outdoor job.</li>
            <li> The no-slip part meant that it was basically impossible to put on.  </li>
            <li> I hated these headbands.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love the sticky rubber lining, makes the head band stay in place.</li>
            <li> I got these but I had purchased too many so I returned.  I think the colors are good - they are Neutral.  They do have the silicone on them.  I do not know how they feel - I usually get headaches or they slip (even with the grip), but I think that they are worth giving a go.</li>
            <li> I hated these headbands.  The no-slip part meant that it was basically impossible to put on.  It just grabbed at your hair.  Plus, they were really small.  I just threw them away.</li>
            <li> They are kind of tight on my head and pull on my hair.  Serves its purpose though!  overall good product</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t stay on at all. A waste of my money, and it took a long time for them to be mailed</li>
            <li> The first time I put one of the headwraps on, it broke at the seam.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair can get quite soft, so the headbands without grip, slide right off. These hold a little better but could still use more grip. It is just a line of the gripy stuff...not enough for me.</li>
            <li> These are great.  A little tight at first but if you get it wet and then wear it they will stretch out a little, or you can just use them for your children and they&#x27;ll be perfect.</li>
            <li> Stays in better if you are wrapping hair around it, otherwise it slips every time I move my head. I have yet to find any headbands that do not slip...</li>
            <li> I bought these at a good price. Good value, easy to use and doesn&#x27;t slide off my head. Great for all hair types and length!</li>
            <li> I use these for &amp;#34;puffs&amp;#34; in which I double the headband and slide it back on my head to make it look like I have a long, large ponytail.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that can do this for me wonderfully--and it does not slip out.</li>
            <li> The wraps move and do not stay in place.  You can tell they are very cheap. Definitely would not order these again.</li>
            <li> I just cut my hair short and needed a way to keep my hair out of my eyes when I work out. These are perfect. They have a non skid surface which keeps it from falling off your head. You can&#x27;t get a better price than Amazon. I know because I looked everywhere and they are priced at $4.00 or more for the 4 pack.</li>
            <li> Simply awesome. I am black with natural, thick hair. These are great and hold my hair back like they should. They are tight enough without squeezing the life out of my head.</li>
            <li> I bought these after cutting my hair too short for barrettes in the hop that I&#x27;d have something to keep my hair out of my face while cooking and doing other things.

            <li> I was looking for a plain black band to wear during my workouts.  Unfortunately, these did not work for me.  They fit snugly, which is fine; however, the plastic grip on the underside does not keep the band in place.  Its slips a few inches back and even off my head entirely.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> can i give no stars? can I? these were advertised as being perfect for fine g&lt;br /&gt;hair ... NOT. I did not go to the trouble of sending them back. I gave them to my nephew to play with. They do not even make a suitable slingshot or spitball launcher.</li>
            <li> The elastic has started to wear it stretched out after One use. Different then the one I purchased at cvs</li>
            <li> I like the rubbery inner to hold onto hair, but I have naturally very smooth hair (I have to use at least three elastics tied on tight to hold a ponytail for an extended amount of time) and a hairline that starts farther up on my forehead, so this didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped. Good product, just not for me.</li>

I was wearing them (trying to wear them) with a ponytail, and wondered if maybe they&#x27;re designed to be worn with your hair down, which I never do. I tried it anyway, and they still slipped so that the loop was far back and behind my head, and besides not doing a thing to hold my hair it looked really dopey. I&#x27;ll be using plain old clips, I guess. Or nothing.</li>
            <li> These are too tight. I didn&#x27;t think I had a big head, but these don&#x27;t stay well so I guess I must. I got these to keep my short hair corralled during workouts, but I spend too much time re-adjusting my headbands!</li>
            <li> Thinner than expected, but work well.</li>
            <li> Not liked at all.  Pulls small hairs, doesn&#x27;t stay in place,  stretched out easily.</li>
            <li> Like that its non slip I&#x27;m currently trying to try new hair styles so its great for that and the width is great as well not to thin</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to spend more than a few bucks on headbands, especially since it&#x27;s so easy to lose them. I was hoping that the rubbery elastic on the underside would keep these in my hair so I could get off cheap, but they slide off pretty easily. I usually have to fix them 3-4 times during a 30 minute run on the elliptical.</li>
            <li> ...without tearing my hair out! I&#x27;m pulling my hair back as it grows out, which takes a fair bit of patience...I&#x27;m not quite to a spot where I can wear these without also putting in bobby pins, but eventually the weight of my growing hair will hold these down in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The selection of colors is nice, a few browns/khakis. Definitely subtle, with enough color selection to go with several (if not all) of my outfits.</li>
            <li> Slips more then the regular ones</li>
