            <li>That I really have to work with to get flat even with the best of the best flat irons.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC</li>
            <li>This company makes it sound like this product is so revolutionary, but it didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.</li>

            <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair naturally but it gets wavy in humidity and will get creases very easily.</li>
            <li>It takes only the slightest bit of flat iron to get it neatened up and looking great.  </li>
            <li>I highly endorse it for my wavy/straight haired sisters!!</li>
            <li>went after the first usage to review videos on youtube about the aforementionned Living proof Straight) and all reviews were positive, and corroborate my opinion.</li>
            <li>B0050NE88M Living proof Straight Spray, 5.5 oz.]]  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It really increases the smoothness and shine of your hair during the flatiron process.  </li>
            <li>It came out very frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>

            <li>It is a high quality product as well</li>
            <li>but I really like the light weight, slick feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>Sure - if you want stick straight hair with only a blow dry - it might not live up to your expectations.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair straight even when it is humid outside.</li>
            <li>I have had a total of 3 bottles of this (goes quickly with my long hair and sometimes I use it twice a day)</li>

            <li>My mother uses this, too, and has naturally curly, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; in it is pretty heavy but fades...</li>

            <li> I just can&#x27;t believe the negative reviewer actually used this product correctly.  I have the frizziest thick hair and this really makes an impact on the feel of my hair. Best of all, it straightens it out (not completely - but nicely smoothed) without it looking devoid of life.  Sure - if you want stick straight hair with only a blow dry - it might not live up to your expectations.  It takes only the slightest bit of flat iron to get it neatened up and looking great.  It definitely keeps my hair clean longer and feeling nice if I run my hands through it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It does have a strong smell but I think it smells good and it keeps my hair straight even when it is humid outside. I have had a total of 3 bottles of this (goes quickly with my long hair and sometimes I use it twice a day) and my sis has ordered me another bottle for Christmas. I have straight hair naturally but it gets wavy in humidity and will get creases very easily. This spray along with my flat iron keeps the creases away. I do not have anything to report to ladies with curly hair as I have not had any friends with curly hair use this. I highly endorse it for my wavy/straight haired sisters!!</li>
            <li> I am a skeptic when it comes to products but I really like the light weight, slick feel of my hair. My style last longer and has that just out of the salon look.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0050NE88M Living proof Straight Spray, 5.5 oz.]]  By using this product, you will cut your blow dry time down dramatically.  Your hair will feel silky.  It does keep your hair cleaner longer.  It can be used on both wet and dry hair.  I&#x27;ve used it with an Instyler, a flat iron and a curling iron.  I have naturally curly hair that has be treated with the Japanese hair straightening.  My mother uses this, too, and has naturally curly, coarse hair.  Their Frizz shampoo and conditioner are also excellent.</li>

            <li> I had high hopes when I ordered this product based on the reviews I read. However I was disappointed. I have thick wavy hair. That I really have to work with to get flat even with the best of the best flat irons. Especially on the crown of my head. I hoped that a product like this I would see even a slight help but nothing. :(</li>
            <li> My Greek girlfriend swears by it. Though it worked well through the styling process, it didn&#x27;t hold up for me.</li>
            <li> Really love this hair product.  Help to straighten out my hair and keep it that way.  Highly recommend this product!</li>

            <li> I had this before and loved it but it was and still is pricey but I&#x27;ve had a lot of others not work like this so I&#x27;ve had to come back to this and will not go back to anything else. LOVE IT, PERFECT despite the price, it&#x27;s totally worth it. Would recommend to friend and will buy again in future.</li>
            <li> I gave it to a friend. She&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li> This company makes it sound like this product is so revolutionary, but it didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.
