    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>IT WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there is a way to get a perfect sunless tan at home.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not throwing this out yet because it might turn out to be the best option.</li>
            <li>It even applies flawlessly on my hands (which have always been a problem for me).  </li>
            <li>My search for the perfect sunless tanner and my quest for an even tan on my hands and feet is OVER.  </li>
            <li>but I use the medium shade and it works great!</li>
            <li>Best have someone do it for you.</li>

            <li>and it worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to hold it about 7 inches away.</li>
            <li>and it comes out perfect.</li>
            <li>and I had a very attractive set of orange stripes.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer that&#x27;s for sure!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d consider this one of the best, though if you&#x27;re very fair skinned like me</li>
            <li>I am very, very fair skinned...</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and used the \\&quot;medium/two shades darker\\&quot; tone.  </li>
            <li>As she has very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin</li>
            <li>I am very fair</li>
            <li>This is great for hands because you aren&#x27;t having to wash your hands after the application like with the lotions so</li>
            <li>great people to work with and thank you</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you want your legs colored orange.</li>
            <li>it works great</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t take the chance with this product again, as I have since read that others have experienced this nozzle issue.</li>
            <li>I just have not found this to be very effective.</li>
            <li>Spray goes on perfect, never have to rub it in the spray is perfect, even and very covering.  </li>
            <li>it smells amazing also and gives a beautiful glow even for darker tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;caution:</li>
            <li>works great, very satisfied</li>
            <li>I tried this one because I had heard good reviews about it, and Neutrogena has good products.</li>
            <li>and you are fair skinned</li>
            <li>Im fair</li>
            <li>It gives me the best, streak free color of any product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>So good deal!!!!idn&#x27;t gert that at all.  </li>
            <li>and I am fair skin.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>I buy this stuff faithfully and love it!</li>
            <li>So for that reason I&#x27;ve docked this product (my favorite product!)</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>If you apply it once per day, in about 3 days you should have a nice bronze look.  </li>
            <li>smells nice, still leaves that sunless tanner smell at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>but there is one thing that is kind of a tint in buy</li>
            <li>Under my own opinion.  </li>
            <li>at end take a nail scrub brush with warm soap and water</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly with great packaging.</li>
            <li>color is perfectly bronze very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>but dis is the best so far.</li>
            <li>This one by far is the best.  </li>
            <li>The mist is very fine.</li>
            <li>They must have just improved their formula, because the mist is very fine and even, so I don&#x27;t have to touch any of the areas where I apply it at all (unlike some others who have reviewed the product).  </li>
            <li>The spray is very fine.</li>
            <li>The spray is very fine</li>
            <li>Go very light over your elbows and knees.</li>
            <li>And to be clear, I am very, very fair.</li>
            <li>So I ran across this product from Neutrogena, and I am a HUGE fan of their products!</li>
            <li>I canceled my mystic tan membership and I love that I can do this at home instead driving to the salon.</li>
            <li>The spray applicator on this is probably the best of the several brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>way more than 2 shades darker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy my legs are no longer bright white</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to rub it in and worry about colored palms (which I somehow always end up with when I use the tanning lotions even when I wash my hands afterwards).  </li>
            <li>My biggest tips;  use about 2 hours before bedtime, that way your skin has more time to absorb the color and settle in.  </li>
            <li>This seemed to work ok on my daughters skin.</li>
            <li>The medium is okay.  </li>
            <li>If I sprayed more than four time it froze</li>
            <li>This product is overall not the best.</li>
            <li>So, unfortunately- my favorite brand is failing me.</li>
            <li>But the smell can be a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still my favorite product.</li>
            <li>But the smell can be a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still my favorite product.</li>
            <li>This is the easiest tanner I have ever used, and I have used so many.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I do wish that it smelled better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is much better than lotions.</li>
            <li>and absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that it actually worked in two days, no streaking</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is a brand I trust, but this stuff has more problems than benefits.  </li>
            <li>And one more FYI (yES I got a lto to say)</li>
            <li>And one more FYI (yES I got a lto to say)</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it come every spring and summer.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this spray.</li>
            <li>This is the best on the market sunless tanning spray, for several reasons.</li>
            <li>So I thought I was playing it safe by going with the medium.</li>
            <li>My favorite brand of self tanner on the market.</li>
            <li>Each time there would be one or two things that would keep the products from being just right for my fair skin, lifestyle and maintenance routine.  </li>
            <li>and i am pretty fair skined in the winter.  </li>
            <li>The spray top is easy to use, and apply.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that I am a very fair skinned, freckled Irish girl.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy:)</li>
            <li>After a couple of hours, look at the results and do more light applications until you achieve the desired color.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve had great results with banana boat summer color self-tanning lotion</li>
            <li>okay i think its important for woman of color to read this.</li>
            <li>Surprising, because I&#x27;d sprayed myself in the garage and really taken my time.</li>
            <li>the spray feature did not work, it was defective but the other 500 cans (exagetated) that I bought worked perfect!</li>
            <li>It could easily overpower anyone&#x27;s senses.</li>
            <li>as strong-</li>
            <li>I would give this product 5 stars, but because of the strong odor I gave it 4 starts.</li>
            <li>Also requires many applications and reapplications to maintain color if you shower every day, but that&#x27;s true with all of them.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever using any kind of a spray tan.</li>
            <li>I quickly do the top of my shoulders and around my neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible smell- just a powerful one.</li>
            <li>so I did a light coat</li>
            <li>My advice is to hold it about 6 inches away and spray a light coat over the area you want tanned.  </li>
            <li>As we know, all self-tanners have some kind of odor or scent, but this Neutrogena product really is one of the scent-iest self-tanners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>, I sprayed some in my palm and smoothed over my face rather than spray it; then washed my hands and sprayed the tops lightly.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy my spray tan, doesn&#x27;t get everywhere except where I want.</li>
            <li>And my legs also have a light &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>You will also want to spray it on in a shower or tub, as the particles do travel and there will be some that might not make it on your body, and it makes clean up easy.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t make for a smooth and even application.  </li>
            <li>are also a few tips for perfect coverage.</li>
            <li>and to my complete shock, I am STILL fair as ever...</li>
            <li>It worked good enough but the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; color was much better.</li>
            <li>The big problem with this sunless tanning spray is that no matter how much you rub it in, and do your best not to miss any spots, you get streaks.</li>
            <li>Another issue is that right away it is colored when you spray it, so if you go over an area twice accidently, be sure to be prepared for some darker pigments all over.</li>
            <li>I very rarely have problems with it clogging or the nozzle breaking.</li>
            <li>Great for all types of skin and for any occasions, daily use or before special events.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Also, came off in first shower while it said it would stay on for 4 or more showers OR even baths.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m pretty sure I didn&#x27;t follow the correct way to spray either.  </li>
            <li>It does clean out well, but you wont want to wear that look out.</li>
            <li>If I have special plans and I want to appear tan, I shower that morning and after my shower I mist myself generously and them</li>
            <li>(of course, right?)!</li>
            <li>It is SO strong and people with asthma or allergies to strong perfume-y scents should really beware and think twice before buying this product.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure-</li>
            <li>Such a good product on your skin it and your skin for like two or three days stays tan before  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice natural looking tan color as well as glow.</li>
            <li>Like, see my veins through the skin, blindingly white in winter fair.</li>
            <li>So not really a bad complaint.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about it was the fine mist spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors and cannot believe how wonderful Neutrogena smells compared to other tanners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to go out in public after being sprayed :)</li>
            <li>I applied the mist before bed, showered it off the next morning, and was very happy with the sheer, even color it</li>
            <li>I use several on a daily basis, and this spray tan had excellent reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually really really mild.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually really really mild.  </li>
            <li>Product dries so quickly.  </li>
            <li>It really does go on easily and evenly.  </li>
            <li>Just ok...I like this better than most of the lotions because it has even application as long as you keep moving while spraying.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>I would probably burn to a crisp and get cancer!  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!</li>
            <li>Because it sprays you can do your own back.</li>
            <li>I find it looks more natural if my face is a shade or two lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Secondly, I was hoping for a nice colour which never happened.  </li>
            <li>I have since done 2 more coats and have a natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>I finally just gave up decided if I get a natural tan, great, but if not, oh well.  </li>
            <li>I even spray this on my fresh exfoliated face and on my hands and have never had streaks or lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no need to rub in, and looks very natural!</li>
            <li>Since it has been raining all summer, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to spend much time in the sun, so this has been very useful.</li>
            <li>Just did not work right for me.</li>
            <li>with my right hand thumb.  </li>
            <li>The only downside to this spray is the VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li>To start off, I am naturally fair, but since I&#x27;ve been tanning for some time I would be around a medium and dark tan.</li>
            <li>even though that is a bad thing to happen to you this product is the best thing you can get on Amazon.:)</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena tanning spray is quick and you get results fast.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast.  </li>
            <li>Blending is very much required.</li>
            <li>Just do exactly as the instructions say</li>
            <li>it says to apply to your face by first spraying into your hands and then rubbing the product onto your face-</li>
            <li>I LOVE those but thought this product would save me the time of rubbing in... big mistake.</li>
            <li>This is the first spray tanner that I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I hold the blowdryer to my skin on cool or warm for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I went back to my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>This, to me, works so much better than foams and lotions because it truly does get an even application over the entire body.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it is a NIGHTMARE to apply as the spray was clogged</li>
            <li>On a pretty designed tan</li>
            <li>My legs smell funny for a day</li>
            <li>the bottle was most likely defected and has nothing to do with the tanner itself.</li>
            <li>but pretty tan inside</li>
            <li>now for this product my problem areas are my legs which have the most on the backs of my calfs and inner thighs.</li>
            <li>i purchased the medium shade because being a woman of color i didn&#x27;t want to darker my complexion more than necessary.</li>
            <li>please wait the 2 to 4 hours for the spray to develop before spraying again after first session.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying that I absolutely LOVE the Micro-Mist Sunless Spray in DEEP.</li>
            <li>Shower first and exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>I start with my face and neck first.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re very fair skinned, but want a deep tan without the odd blotches-</li>
            <li>It really does take practice in getting the application right.</li>
            <li>I am fair and I used medium, the first time I looked a bit peachy in spots where I am very white, like the under of my arms and inside of my thighs, but after a shower and reapplication the next day it evened out.</li>
            <li>It looks like a nice base tan - and best of all, it looks natural!  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ve just reapplied to fill the bare spots; hope it looks smooth.</li>
            <li>The one huge negative, as with all self tanning sprays, is the smell is super strong and</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for women with sensitive stomachs or who are pregnant.</li>
            <li>my face has a mild natural looking color to it.  </li>
            <li>also use it on my face for a nice airbrush look, that requires way less foundation.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use with the nozzle that can even reach my back.</li>
            <li>And I did read another review saying this stuff was too strong, but actually I didn&#x27;t gert that at all.  </li>
            <li>But my mother, being the smart woman she is, said &amp;#34;No.&amp;#34; and offered up the alternative of a spray tan.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m as white as a ghost, and this fine mist spray isn&#x27;t changing that.</li>
            <li>i have a really hard time getting tan because my skin is so fair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple applications and I&#x27;m not seeing a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This sprays on very evenly and doesn&#x27;t streak or run.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Neutrogena&#x27;s Micro-Mist Sunless Tanning Spray</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to smell like citrus, but it&#x27;s just straight up chemical.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a color change.  </li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t really afford the $100.00 salon quality spray tans-</li>
            <li>The mist works really well and gets even coverage.</li>
            <li>The mist works really well and gets even coverage.</li>
            <li>Whether or not it is because of my skin tone (olive) should not have really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a change in tones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After one application of Neutrogena at noon, it took about 12 hours for the color to really deepen (not the 2-4 hours the can says).</li>
            <li>even when it felt like it wasn&#x27;t much on there</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t very noticeable once on, but the particles can be cloudy in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The color on me was very orange too.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not 100% enthusiastic about the product because it is so hard to get the application right.  </li>
            <li>many other reviewers</li>
            <li>Every other product I&#x27;ve tried has been better for me than this.</li>
            <li>It does get that classic \\&quot;tanner\\&quot; smell over time, but it&#x27;s not nearly as offensive or strong as Sublime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My arms were naturally tanned but my legs weren&#x27;t and after 3 applications to my legs, the color is an exact match to my arms.  </li>
            <li>I did a full body spray but only noticed a color change on my forearms and thighs.</li>
            <li>I really am surprised this product doesn&#x27;t have higher reviews.</li>
            <li>No MESS IN YOUR HOUSE OR SMELL FROM THIS!!!</li>
            <li>No MESS IN YOUR HOUSE OR SMELL FROM THIS!!!</li>
            <li>The change was not subtle at all.</li>
            <li>Unlike the others which all gave me decent color</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, ( i have smelled a lot worse).</li>
            <li>all I did was a light quick little spritz from far away on feet.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend turning a fan on.</li>
            <li>And for everyone else I highly suggest using it in an airy room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do it in our outdoor sauna and open the door right away.</li>
            <li>Use blow drier cool heat to really dry product evenly and quicker.  </li>
            <li>This is the 5th brand of spray tanners (banana boat, fake bake, tan wise, and true blue spa) i&#x27;ve tried out.</li>
            <li>-a-days I live in Alaska, and</li>
            <li>use spray tan pretty regularly (I have a toddler, so visiting tanning salons is a no-go!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than 3 stars, but not good enough to give it a full 4.</li>
            <li>my stretch marks are not deeply pitted they are pretty leveled with my skin.</li>
            <li>and lightly spread it all over my face and down my neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few brands, but Neutrogena easily became my go-to one.</li>
            <li>, is that it&#x27;s CLEAR.</li>
            <li>A clear ultra-fine mist...who knew?  </li>
            <li>Remember this is a buildable sunless spray tan and comes out clear</li>
            <li>Since it does come out clear</li>
            <li>There is never anything natural about it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nowhere near</li>
            <li>I pleasantly surprised with this product-</li>
            <li>It is a gradual and natural look, not orange at all.</li>
            <li>I am fairly light skinned with a few freckles</li>
            <li>Since a young age sun screen has been lathered on my body like it was going out of style.</li>
            <li>I am now trying to fix the stripes with my old tanner.</li>
            <li>My knees, feet and ankles look so natural as well.  </li>
            <li>so they are old.</li>
            <li>I would rate this a 10 by far.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make me orange or streaky, but only because it didn&#x27;t really give me any color at all.</li>
            <li>I love this spray tan above all others I&#x27;ve dried..  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s seriously that overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I have tried other sprays and gotten streaks because the nozzle gets clogged and more will spray in one area than the other.</li>
            <li>this is a technique I highly recommend for a constant even tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am an addict, and love the way it looks, even on very pale skin!</li>
            <li>I will exfoliate very well in the shower and dry off completely.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the application was as easy as 1-2-3 and only took a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many over the years and most were either too complicated to get it just right (streaked or uneven) or it was too dark for me, or it was too orange.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually reviewed the deep one as well, so feel free to check that out for other info on how well it works and how to apply it</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;ll restart on the new area, until my entire body is finished.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is the overwhelming fumes..  </li>
            <li>This was a waste of money I expected more from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a fake tan, as I am red headed, and fair complection.  </li>
            <li>(I advise not touching or sitting on anything for a good half-hour after spraying -- the same precaution when getting sprayed at a tanning booth -- and being very careful about rubbing the skin for several hours after, IMO.</li>
            <li>In fact there&#x27;s a major smell if you&#x27;re doing it in a confined space like a bathroom.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have trouble with the nozzle, as so many other reviewers report, and I felt the application provided even coverage.</li>
            <li>I just thought I&#x27;d try it my way and use long steady strokes.  </li>
            <li>After the first application I saw spots that I missed around my ankles and knees (and some dark streaks which I scrubbed off)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return it because it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>I do believe this is largely in part due to my albino-like skin tone.</li>
            <li>The only complaint i could say about this product is, that it goes on Clear, kinda hard to know where it&#x27;s going, but if you used enough self tanners, you have a good idea as to where it&#x27;s going.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been spray tanning, UV tanning, and just tanning outside in general for over 4 years.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, the smell does not stay on your body too long.</li>
            <li>I always thought that mystic would fade kinda funny, after a few days, and after shaving, but this product seems to fade evenly.</li>
            <li>I would never try to do my whole body in less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The first coat dried and then I applied a second coat.  </li>
            <li>As the can says, be aware of potential splotches on ankles and other places with tough skin and prevent it by blotting the areas with a tissue right after applying.</li>
            <li>in all this product has it&#x27;s good and bad traits.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> IT WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there is a way to get a perfect sunless tan at home.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not throwing this out yet because it might turn out to be the best option.</li>
            <li> It even applies flawlessly on my hands (which have always been a problem for me).  </li>
            <li> My search for the perfect sunless tanner and my quest for an even tan on my hands and feet is OVER.  </li>

            <li> and it comes out perfect.</li>
            <li> and I had a very attractive set of orange stripes.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d consider this one of the best, though if you&#x27;re very fair skinned like me</li>
            <li> I am very, very fair skinned...</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and used the \\&quot;medium/two shades darker\\&quot; tone.  </li>
            <li> As she has very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin</li>
            <li> I am very fair</li>
            <li> This is great for hands because you aren&#x27;t having to wash your hands after the application like with the lotions so</li>
            <li> great people to work with and thank you</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want your legs colored orange.</li>
            <li> it works great</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t take the chance with this product again, as I have since read that others have experienced this nozzle issue.</li>
            <li> I just have not found this to be very effective.</li>
            <li> Spray goes on perfect, never have to rub it in the spray is perfect, even and very covering.  </li>
            <li> it smells amazing also and gives a beautiful glow even for darker tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;caution:</li>
            <li> works great, very satisfied</li>
            <li> I tried this one because I had heard good reviews about it, and Neutrogena has good products.</li>
            <li> and you are fair skinned</li>
            <li> Im fair</li>
            <li> It gives me the best, streak free color of any product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> So good deal!!!!idn&#x27;t gert that at all.  </li>
            <li> and I am fair skin.</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff faithfully and love it!</li>
            <li> So for that reason I&#x27;ve docked this product (my favorite product!)</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> If you apply it once per day, in about 3 days you should have a nice bronze look.  </li>
            <li> smells nice, still leaves that sunless tanner smell at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> but there is one thing that is kind of a tint in buy</li>
            <li> Under my own opinion.  </li>
            <li> at end take a nail scrub brush with warm soap and water</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly with great packaging.</li>
            <li> color is perfectly bronze very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> but dis is the best so far.</li>
            <li> This one by far is the best.  </li>
            <li> The mist is very fine.</li>
            <li> They must have just improved their formula, because the mist is very fine and even, so I don&#x27;t have to touch any of the areas where I apply it at all (unlike some others who have reviewed the product).  </li>
            <li> The spray is very fine.</li>
            <li> The spray is very fine</li>
            <li> Go very light over your elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> And to be clear, I am very, very fair.</li>
            <li> So I ran across this product from Neutrogena, and I am a HUGE fan of their products!</li>
            <li> I canceled my mystic tan membership and I love that I can do this at home instead driving to the salon.</li>
            <li> The spray applicator on this is probably the best of the several brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> way more than 2 shades darker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy my legs are no longer bright white</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to rub it in and worry about colored palms (which I somehow always end up with when I use the tanning lotions even when I wash my hands afterwards).  </li>
            <li> My biggest tips;  use about 2 hours before bedtime, that way your skin has more time to absorb the color and settle in.  </li>
            <li> This seemed to work ok on my daughters skin.</li>
            <li> The medium is okay.  </li>
            <li> If I sprayed more than four time it froze</li>
            <li> This product is overall not the best.</li>
            <li> So, unfortunately- my favorite brand is failing me.</li>
            <li> But the smell can be a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still my favorite product.</li>
            <li> But the smell can be a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still my favorite product.</li>
            <li> This is the easiest tanner I have ever used, and I have used so many.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I do wish that it smelled better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is much better than lotions.</li>
            <li> and absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that it actually worked in two days, no streaking</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is a brand I trust, but this stuff has more problems than benefits.  </li>
            <li> And one more FYI (yES I got a lto to say)</li>
            <li> And one more FYI (yES I got a lto to say)</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it come every spring and summer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this spray.</li>
            <li> This is the best on the market sunless tanning spray, for several reasons.</li>
            <li> So I thought I was playing it safe by going with the medium.</li>
            <li> My favorite brand of self tanner on the market.</li>
            <li> Each time there would be one or two things that would keep the products from being just right for my fair skin, lifestyle and maintenance routine.  </li>
            <li> and i am pretty fair skined in the winter.  </li>
            <li> The spray top is easy to use, and apply.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I am a very fair skinned, freckled Irish girl.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy:)</li>
            <li> After a couple of hours, look at the results and do more light applications until you achieve the desired color.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve had great results with banana boat summer color self-tanning lotion</li>
            <li> okay i think its important for woman of color to read this.</li>
            <li> Surprising, because I&#x27;d sprayed myself in the garage and really taken my time.</li>
            <li> the spray feature did not work, it was defective but the other 500 cans (exagetated) that I bought worked perfect!</li>
            <li> It could easily overpower anyone&#x27;s senses.</li>
            <li> as strong-</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars, but because of the strong odor I gave it 4 starts.</li>
            <li> Also requires many applications and reapplications to maintain color if you shower every day, but that&#x27;s true with all of them.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using any kind of a spray tan.</li>
            <li> I quickly do the top of my shoulders and around my neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible smell- just a powerful one.</li>
            <li> so I did a light coat</li>
            <li> My advice is to hold it about 6 inches away and spray a light coat over the area you want tanned.  </li>
            <li> As we know, all self-tanners have some kind of odor or scent, but this Neutrogena product really is one of the scent-iest self-tanners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> , I sprayed some in my palm and smoothed over my face rather than spray it; then washed my hands and sprayed the tops lightly.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy my spray tan, doesn&#x27;t get everywhere except where I want.</li>
            <li> And my legs also have a light &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You will also want to spray it on in a shower or tub, as the particles do travel and there will be some that might not make it on your body, and it makes clean up easy.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t make for a smooth and even application.  </li>
            <li> are also a few tips for perfect coverage.</li>
            <li> and to my complete shock, I am STILL fair as ever...</li>
            <li> It worked good enough but the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; color was much better.</li>
            <li> The big problem with this sunless tanning spray is that no matter how much you rub it in, and do your best not to miss any spots, you get streaks.</li>
            <li> Another issue is that right away it is colored when you spray it, so if you go over an area twice accidently, be sure to be prepared for some darker pigments all over.</li>
            <li> I very rarely have problems with it clogging or the nozzle breaking.</li>
            <li> Great for all types of skin and for any occasions, daily use or before special events.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Also, came off in first shower while it said it would stay on for 4 or more showers OR even baths.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m pretty sure I didn&#x27;t follow the correct way to spray either.  </li>
            <li> It does clean out well, but you wont want to wear that look out.</li>
            <li> If I have special plans and I want to appear tan, I shower that morning and after my shower I mist myself generously and them</li>
            <li> (of course, right?)!</li>
            <li> It is SO strong and people with asthma or allergies to strong perfume-y scents should really beware and think twice before buying this product.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure-</li>
            <li> Such a good product on your skin it and your skin for like two or three days stays tan before  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice natural looking tan color as well as glow.</li>
            <li> Like, see my veins through the skin, blindingly white in winter fair.</li>
            <li> So not really a bad complaint.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about it was the fine mist spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors and cannot believe how wonderful Neutrogena smells compared to other tanners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to go out in public after being sprayed :)</li>
            <li> I applied the mist before bed, showered it off the next morning, and was very happy with the sheer, even color it</li>
            <li> I use several on a daily basis, and this spray tan had excellent reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually really really mild.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually really really mild.  </li>
            <li> Product dries so quickly.  </li>
            <li> It really does go on easily and evenly.  </li>
            <li> Just ok...I like this better than most of the lotions because it has even application as long as you keep moving while spraying.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I would probably burn to a crisp and get cancer!  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!</li>
            <li> Because it sprays you can do your own back.</li>
            <li> I find it looks more natural if my face is a shade or two lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Secondly, I was hoping for a nice colour which never happened.  </li>
            <li> I have since done 2 more coats and have a natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> I finally just gave up decided if I get a natural tan, great, but if not, oh well.  </li>
            <li> I even spray this on my fresh exfoliated face and on my hands and have never had streaks or lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no need to rub in, and looks very natural!</li>
            <li> Since it has been raining all summer, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to spend much time in the sun, so this has been very useful.</li>
            <li> Just did not work right for me.</li>
            <li> with my right hand thumb.  </li>
            <li> The only downside to this spray is the VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li> To start off, I am naturally fair, but since I&#x27;ve been tanning for some time I would be around a medium and dark tan.</li>
            <li> even though that is a bad thing to happen to you this product is the best thing you can get on Amazon.:)</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena tanning spray is quick and you get results fast.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast.  </li>
            <li> Blending is very much required.</li>
            <li> Just do exactly as the instructions say</li>
            <li> it says to apply to your face by first spraying into your hands and then rubbing the product onto your face-</li>
            <li> I LOVE those but thought this product would save me the time of rubbing in... big mistake.</li>
            <li> This is the first spray tanner that I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I hold the blowdryer to my skin on cool or warm for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I went back to my favorite brand.</li>
            <li> This, to me, works so much better than foams and lotions because it truly does get an even application over the entire body.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it is a NIGHTMARE to apply as the spray was clogged</li>
            <li> On a pretty designed tan</li>
            <li> My legs smell funny for a day</li>
            <li> the bottle was most likely defected and has nothing to do with the tanner itself.</li>
            <li> but pretty tan inside</li>
            <li> now for this product my problem areas are my legs which have the most on the backs of my calfs and inner thighs.</li>
            <li> i purchased the medium shade because being a woman of color i didn&#x27;t want to darker my complexion more than necessary.</li>
            <li> please wait the 2 to 4 hours for the spray to develop before spraying again after first session.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I absolutely LOVE the Micro-Mist Sunless Spray in DEEP.</li>
            <li> Shower first and exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> I start with my face and neck first.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re very fair skinned, but want a deep tan without the odd blotches-</li>
            <li> It really does take practice in getting the application right.</li>
            <li> I am fair and I used medium, the first time I looked a bit peachy in spots where I am very white, like the under of my arms and inside of my thighs, but after a shower and reapplication the next day it evened out.</li>
            <li> It looks like a nice base tan - and best of all, it looks natural!  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve just reapplied to fill the bare spots; hope it looks smooth.</li>
            <li> The one huge negative, as with all self tanning sprays, is the smell is super strong and</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for women with sensitive stomachs or who are pregnant.</li>
            <li> my face has a mild natural looking color to it.  </li>
            <li> also use it on my face for a nice airbrush look, that requires way less foundation.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use with the nozzle that can even reach my back.</li>
            <li> And I did read another review saying this stuff was too strong, but actually I didn&#x27;t gert that at all.  </li>
            <li> But my mother, being the smart woman she is, said &amp;#34;No.&amp;#34; and offered up the alternative of a spray tan.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m as white as a ghost, and this fine mist spray isn&#x27;t changing that.</li>
            <li> i have a really hard time getting tan because my skin is so fair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple applications and I&#x27;m not seeing a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This sprays on very evenly and doesn&#x27;t streak or run.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Neutrogena&#x27;s Micro-Mist Sunless Tanning Spray</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to smell like citrus, but it&#x27;s just straight up chemical.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a color change.  </li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t really afford the $100.00 salon quality spray tans-</li>
            <li> The mist works really well and gets even coverage.</li>
            <li> The mist works really well and gets even coverage.</li>
            <li> Whether or not it is because of my skin tone (olive) should not have really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a change in tones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After one application of Neutrogena at noon, it took about 12 hours for the color to really deepen (not the 2-4 hours the can says).</li>
            <li> even when it felt like it wasn&#x27;t much on there</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t very noticeable once on, but the particles can be cloudy in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The color on me was very orange too.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not 100% enthusiastic about the product because it is so hard to get the application right.  </li>
            <li> many other reviewers</li>
            <li> Every other product I&#x27;ve tried has been better for me than this.</li>
            <li> It does get that classic \\&quot;tanner\\&quot; smell over time, but it&#x27;s not nearly as offensive or strong as Sublime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My arms were naturally tanned but my legs weren&#x27;t and after 3 applications to my legs, the color is an exact match to my arms.  </li>
            <li> I did a full body spray but only noticed a color change on my forearms and thighs.</li>
            <li> I really am surprised this product doesn&#x27;t have higher reviews.</li>
            <li> No MESS IN YOUR HOUSE OR SMELL FROM THIS!!!</li>
            <li> No MESS IN YOUR HOUSE OR SMELL FROM THIS!!!</li>
            <li> The change was not subtle at all.</li>
            <li> Unlike the others which all gave me decent color</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, ( i have smelled a lot worse).</li>
            <li> all I did was a light quick little spritz from far away on feet.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend turning a fan on.</li>
            <li> And for everyone else I highly suggest using it in an airy room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do it in our outdoor sauna and open the door right away.</li>
            <li> Use blow drier cool heat to really dry product evenly and quicker.  </li>
            <li> This is the 5th brand of spray tanners (banana boat, fake bake, tan wise, and true blue spa) i&#x27;ve tried out.</li>
            <li> -a-days I live in Alaska, and</li>
            <li> use spray tan pretty regularly (I have a toddler, so visiting tanning salons is a no-go!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than 3 stars, but not good enough to give it a full 4.</li>
            <li> my stretch marks are not deeply pitted they are pretty leveled with my skin.</li>
            <li> and lightly spread it all over my face and down my neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few brands, but Neutrogena easily became my go-to one.</li>
            <li> , is that it&#x27;s CLEAR.</li>
            <li> A clear ultra-fine mist...who knew?  </li>
            <li> Remember this is a buildable sunless spray tan and comes out clear</li>
            <li> Since it does come out clear</li>
            <li> There is never anything natural about it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nowhere near</li>
            <li> I pleasantly surprised with this product-</li>
            <li> It is a gradual and natural look, not orange at all.</li>
            <li> I am fairly light skinned with a few freckles</li>
            <li> Since a young age sun screen has been lathered on my body like it was going out of style.</li>
            <li> I am now trying to fix the stripes with my old tanner.</li>
            <li> My knees, feet and ankles look so natural as well.  </li>
            <li> so they are old.</li>
            <li> I would rate this a 10 by far.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me orange or streaky, but only because it didn&#x27;t really give me any color at all.</li>
            <li> I love this spray tan above all others I&#x27;ve dried..  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s seriously that overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have tried other sprays and gotten streaks because the nozzle gets clogged and more will spray in one area than the other.</li>
            <li> this is a technique I highly recommend for a constant even tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am an addict, and love the way it looks, even on very pale skin!</li>
            <li> I will exfoliate very well in the shower and dry off completely.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the application was as easy as 1-2-3 and only took a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many over the years and most were either too complicated to get it just right (streaked or uneven) or it was too dark for me, or it was too orange.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually reviewed the deep one as well, so feel free to check that out for other info on how well it works and how to apply it</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;ll restart on the new area, until my entire body is finished.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the overwhelming fumes..  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money I expected more from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fake tan, as I am red headed, and fair complection.  </li>
            <li> (I advise not touching or sitting on anything for a good half-hour after spraying -- the same precaution when getting sprayed at a tanning booth -- and being very careful about rubbing the skin for several hours after, IMO.</li>
            <li> In fact there&#x27;s a major smell if you&#x27;re doing it in a confined space like a bathroom.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have trouble with the nozzle, as so many other reviewers report, and I felt the application provided even coverage.</li>
            <li> I just thought I&#x27;d try it my way and use long steady strokes.  </li>
            <li> After the first application I saw spots that I missed around my ankles and knees (and some dark streaks which I scrubbed off)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return it because it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I do believe this is largely in part due to my albino-like skin tone.</li>
            <li> The only complaint i could say about this product is, that it goes on Clear, kinda hard to know where it&#x27;s going, but if you used enough self tanners, you have a good idea as to where it&#x27;s going.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spray tanning, UV tanning, and just tanning outside in general for over 4 years.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, the smell does not stay on your body too long.</li>
            <li> I always thought that mystic would fade kinda funny, after a few days, and after shaving, but this product seems to fade evenly.</li>
            <li> I would never try to do my whole body in less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The first coat dried and then I applied a second coat.  </li>
            <li> As the can says, be aware of potential splotches on ankles and other places with tough skin and prevent it by blotting the areas with a tissue right after applying.</li>
            <li> in all this product has it&#x27;s good and bad traits.</li>
            <li> I guess, sure, the color isn&#x27;t as dark as mystic tan, but it&#x27;s less orange, and like I said, no streaks, and I think you can apply almost everyday to keep the color, whereas with mystic- going too often makes you orange.</li>
            <li> As for People complaining about the fumes, i have no idea what you are doing wrong, but the fumes are a lot less than a can of hairspray in my own opinion.  </li>
            <li> ointments etc., flat cotton ball?)</li>
            <li> I put old towels down and all</li>
            <li> I put old towels down and all</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll return my 2nd can and try the &#x27;deep&#x27; version of this, though I&#x27;m not very optimistic at all.  </li>
            <li> I did notice one tiny little spot on upper outer thigh but&#x27;s its just a barely noticeable off-evenness.  </li>
            <li> It has taken away the pasty white and given me a little color, nothing major, which is what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like how long it took to put lotion on.</li>
            <li> Before my vacation I applied it twice a day and looked like I had been in the sun all summer long.</li>
            <li> I just got the 2 shades darker version last night and based on the other reviews, I was hesitant</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to rub this one in after applying, I just let it dry</li>
            <li> After I let it dry for about 10 minutes then I apply my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> towel dry, DO NOT USE LOTION.  </li>
            <li> Apply Tanner to dry skin in circular motion about 6 inches away, just like CAN says.  </li>
            <li> this one, though, my main comment is that it&#x27;s simply not effective.</li>
            <li> I have tried every sunless tanning product on the market--- from very expensive department store brands to the tried and true Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking to be really dark; I just wanted to not be so WHITE for a wedding I am attending this weekend.</li>
            <li> Definitely put a towel down on the floor in your bathroom when you spray</li>
            <li> I previously paid monthly to do mystic tan at the tanning salon, but a friend recently recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deep hue worked well for me in the past, but I&#x27;m not seeing a big change with the medium.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a regular user of Fake Bake aerosol, however, I ran out of it and needed something stat &amp; thought I&#x27;d give Neutrogena Micro-Mist in medium a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product does transfer slightly, but will be noticeable on white clothing, sheets, furniture and towels.</li>
            <li> it transforms the silver to a brown color acting as a camouflage and making it less noticeable in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Press down on the nozzle firmly, and spray in a back and fourth motion continuously until I&#x27;ve finished the area I was targeting.</li>
            <li> and I actually skipped the knees complety as I felt a little bit fall on them.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as most of the lotions.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful to spray evenly.  </li>
            <li> careful as I was</li>
            <li> The smell is minimal and it lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> This really is the most dreadful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly pale (blue eyes, freckles, strawberry blond).</li>
            <li> but that was just due to my not being careful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of any store-bought tanning products, so I went on here to look at the reviews.</li>
            <li> but I have seen spots that I missed which were lighter than other areas</li>
            <li> Applicaton usually takes about 30 seconds total.</li>
            <li> 3 coats of this spray (while even &amp; not splotchy) is not even close to one coat of the other self tanning spray I have used.  </li>
            <li> Way milder than what I remember from other brands.  </li>
            <li> Way milder than what I remember from other brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been as pale as snow for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> But, with my pale skin, when it began to wash off after 4 to 5 days, I was left an odd blotchy mess.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever gotten your Jersey Shore on and gone to a salon for a spray tan, Neutrogena&#x27;s Micro-Mist is hardly the same thing.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking to get really dark with this</li>
            <li> I had been using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Sublime Tanner (the one that sparkles), which has the advantage of a dark color so you can see where you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t know how dark it will be.</li>
            <li> I always by the dark</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly not worth it.</li>
            <li> It gets EVERYWHERE, you can use the can sideways upside down, you name it.</li>
            <li> and I also to 2 swipes one up one down.</li>
            <li> having a dark tan in mid-winter would just be odd.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through products good and bad, and unfortunately this product isn&#x27;t on the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; side.</li>
            <li> In fact you can do your entire body without needing to call on the help of a personal friend (no one needs to know your tan is fake- except you!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically start at my lower calf.</li>
            <li> this one was little to no color.</li>
            <li> it reads like little dots where you didn&#x27;t get this like rub in your tan</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than getting it done professionally, and unlike lotion self tanners I haven&#x27;t noticed this staining any clothes or bedding.</li>
            <li> On my face, I sprayed a little on a cotton round (used for face creams</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always orange, streaked, and uneven.  </li>
            <li> So I got impatient and did another round of spraying and went to bed.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I exfoliated in the shower, dried off and applied the spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have never had an uneven tan.</li>
            <li> I sprayed half the can and do not see any difference except in small patches over my body.</li>
            <li> I was really really pale</li>
            <li> In high school I desperately wanted to go tanning- in tanning beds.</li>
            <li> In high school I was desperate to be darker-</li>
            <li> and I had to press down so hard</li>
            <li> Apparently I was looking on the wrong sites because this product does not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just missed a few spots while showering.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is has a after smell that is slightly sweaty smell which isn&#x27;t bad but kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> It was such a bad product that I didn&#x27;t even bring it back with me.  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m here to tell you not to waste your money!  </li>
            <li> My favorite for color is still Clinique, but they don&#x27;t have a spray and their formula is horribly sticky.</li>
            <li> I apply every weekend no more than two nights in a row.  </li>
            <li> Pointless though if it&#x27;s not gonna work.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the spray I usually use was sold out.</li>
            <li> When I got up this morning, I had very uneven coverage</li>
            <li> Plus, I think this smell was the worst behind true blue spa.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is another review of how the bottle didn&#x27;t even spray and how hard it was to get the product to come out...</li>
            <li> My kids could hardly stand up for laughing when they saw it.</li>
            <li> you may want to try the \\&quot;deep\\&quot; color and apply it at least twice a day until you get the shade you want.  </li>
            <li> color is NOT effective.</li>
            <li> and it takes at least two or three days to get off</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to go for the deep shade.</li>
            <li> By far the worst results I&#x27;ve ever had in spite of following all the tips.</li>
            <li> This is the least forgiving product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It makes me cough and it is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might turn out too dark</li>
            <li> Frustrating.</li>
            <li> It applies very subtle color each time, but does not require me to rub it in at all.  </li>
            <li> By far the worst.</li>
            <li> So even if you&#x27;re skeptical, like I was-</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> but you failed me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying St. Tropez, Fake bake, or Zen tan over this.</li>
            <li> I am darker without looking like I have a fake tan.</li>
            <li> This is non cosmogentic, I may have spelled that wrong</li>
            <li> Every sunless tanning product I have ever tried has been so disappointing.  </li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> and then it looks really really bad</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> but it looks like a horrible spray tan gone bad.</li>
            <li> What a terrible product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This sprays on very evenly and doesn&#x27;t streak or run. Since it has been raining all summer, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to spend much time in the sun, so this has been very useful.</li>
            <li> Every sunless tanning product I have ever tried has been so disappointing.  I&#x27;m always orange, streaked, and uneven.  There is never anything natural about it.  Thanks to Neutrogena&#x27;s Micro-Mist Sunless Tanning Spray, I am now singing a different song.  I wasn&#x27;t looking to be really dark; I just wanted to not be so WHITE for a wedding I am attending this weekend. It really does go on easily and evenly.  I&#x27;ve done two applications and there is no orange in site. It looks like a nice base tan - and best of all, it looks natural!  I highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer that&#x27;s for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I previously paid monthly to do mystic tan at the tanning salon, but a friend recently recommended this product to me. I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of any store-bought tanning products, so I went on here to look at the reviews. A couple of the reviews said the stuff either didn&#x27;t work or left them splotchy/streaky- my biggest fears with this product. I decided to try it anyway. IT WORKS GREAT! Just do exactly as the instructions say (of course, right?)! Just like with mystic tan, if you stand too close to the sprayer, then you get streaks. I haven&#x27;t gotten any streaks yet. It also beats mystic in that the formula hasn&#x27;t gotten concentrated in my hands/knees/elbows- it seems to stay even. The smell is nowhere near as strong- I&#x27;ve been able to go out in public after being sprayed :) One thing I do do differently from the directions- it says to apply to your face by first spraying into your hands and then rubbing the product onto your face- but I cheat and just spray my face- it still goes on evenly, and hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes. I always thought that mystic would fade kinda funny, after a few days, and after shaving, but this product seems to fade evenly. I guess, sure, the color isn&#x27;t as dark as mystic tan, but it&#x27;s less orange, and like I said, no streaks, and I think you can apply almost everyday to keep the color, whereas with mystic- going too often makes you orange. I pleasantly surprised with this product- I canceled my mystic tan membership and I love that I can do this at home instead driving to the salon. So even if you&#x27;re skeptical, like I was- it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> i have a really hard time getting tan because my skin is so fair. i tried everything but dis is the best so far. i just ordered my scond bottle!</li>
            <li> I bought this product last night, in fact, I bought 2 bottles of it.  Let me start off by saying that I am a very fair skinned, freckled Irish girl.  I have tried many types of fake tanning from Salon spraying, gradually tanning lotions and now this micro mist.  Well, I&#x27;m here to tell you not to waste your money!  What a terrible product.  I am very, very fair skinned... and I saw NO difference.  I sprayed as directed, waited 2 hrs... nada.  Waited 4 hours (can says you will notice tan in 2-4 hrs), nada.  So I got impatient and did another round of spraying and went to bed.  I woke up and ran to the mirror... and to my complete shock, I am STILL fair as ever... I see NO difference at all, anywhere on mu body, and I used 1/2 the can last night.  I think I&#x27;ll return my 2nd can and try the &#x27;deep&#x27; version of this, though I&#x27;m not very optimistic at all.  My advice to all reading this is to use a gradual self tanning lotion... I LOVE those but thought this product would save me the time of rubbing in... big mistake.</li>
            <li> Could not get this product to spray evenly. Also, came off in first shower while it said it would stay on for 4 or more showers OR even baths. Just did not work right for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d consider this one of the best, though if you&#x27;re very fair skinned like me the color has a definite copper-red undertone. Also requires many applications and reapplications to maintain color if you shower every day, but that&#x27;s true with all of them. My favorite for color is still Clinique, but they don&#x27;t have a spray and their formula is horribly sticky. The spray applicator on this is probably the best of the several brands I&#x27;ve used. The one huge negative, as with all self tanning sprays, is the smell is super strong and overpowering- I literally hold my breath while spraying in the shower, then step out after each body area...it&#x27;s seriously that overwhelming. It&#x27;s supposed to smell like citrus, but it&#x27;s just straight up chemical. I think it goes with the territory and it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than getting it done professionally, and unlike lotion self tanners I haven&#x27;t noticed this staining any clothes or bedding.</li>
            <li> I tried Jergens tanning lotion last year but did not see any noticeable difference. I also didn&#x27;t like how long it took to put lotion on. The Neutrogena tanning spray is quick and you get results fast. I have applied it 3 times in two days and already see a difference! It is a gradual and natural look, not orange at all. As the can says, be aware of potential splotches on ankles and other places with tough skin and prevent it by blotting the areas with a tissue right after applying. Definitely put a towel down on the floor in your bathroom when you spray so you don&#x27;t get orange feet!  The only downside to this spray is the VERY strong smell. It makes me cough and it is not pleasant. As far as I know, the smell does not stay on your body too long.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using any kind of a spray tan. I tried this one because I had heard good reviews about it, and Neutrogena has good products. Apparently I was looking on the wrong sites because this product does not work. I sprayed half the can and do not see any difference except in small patches over my body. This was a waste of money I expected more from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I used the 2 shades darker formula to get rid of the winter pallor on my legs. The change was not subtle at all. It looks like my legs have been at the beach for a week: way more than 2 shades darker. The color is OK...where it went on evenly. The tricky part was the application. After the first application I saw spots that I missed around my ankles and knees (and some dark streaks which I scrubbed off) so I did a second coat. I&#x27;m happy my legs are no longer bright white but I&#x27;m not 100% enthusiastic about the product because it is so hard to get the application right.  I don&#x27;t know if there is a way to get a perfect sunless tan at home. But I&#x27;m not throwing this out yet because it might turn out to be the best option.</li>
            <li> This is the first spray tanner that I&#x27;ve ever used and I love it.  I am very fair skinned and used the \\&quot;medium/two shades darker\\&quot; tone.  I was afraid it might turn out too dark but it isn&#x27;t.  I applied it twice a day until I got the shade I wanted and then once a day to maintain it. It has taken away the pasty white and given me a little color, nothing major, which is what I wanted.  If you are looking to get really dark with this and you are fair skinned you may want to try the \\&quot;deep\\&quot; color and apply it at least twice a day until you get the shade you want.  Anyway, the application was as easy as 1-2-3 and only took a few seconds.  Spray 6 inches away from your skin. It dries very fast.  I have not had a problem with streaking but I have seen spots that I missed which were lighter than other areas but that was just due to my not being careful and that would happen with regular lotion tanners.  I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to rub it in and worry about colored palms (which I somehow always end up with when I use the tanning lotions even when I wash my hands afterwards).  This is great for hands because you aren&#x27;t having to wash your hands after the application like with the lotions so the back of your hands are tanned but the palms stay white.  I haven&#x27;t had problems with the spray clogging as mentioned before.  The mist is very fine. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I love this spray tan above all others I&#x27;ve dried..  The only complaint I have is the overwhelming fumes..  Definitely use in a WELL ventilated room.  My biggest tips;  use about 2 hours before bedtime, that way your skin has more time to absorb the color and settle in.  Wait about 10 minutes to dress and wear baggy clothing so you dont sweat (the color will seep out and you&#x27;ll look tie dye).  To use on your face, hold it arms length away and wrap a towel around your hair (if it gets in your hair, it dries it and it turns to frizz).  I am fairly light skinned with a few freckles so I use the 2 tones darker.  I apply every weekend no more than two nights in a row.  Enjoy:)</li>
            <li> I have tried every sunless tanning product on the market--- from very expensive department store brands to the tried and true Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow.  Each time there would be one or two things that would keep the products from being just right for my fair skin, lifestyle and maintenance routine.  Then, I found Neutrogena Micromist.  I will now be buying this in bulk.  I spray it on each night after I bathe.  Applicaton usually takes about 30 seconds total. It applies very subtle color each time, but does not require me to rub it in at all.  It even applies flawlessly on my hands (which have always been a problem for me).  They must have just improved their formula, because the mist is very fine and even, so I don&#x27;t have to touch any of the areas where I apply it at all (unlike some others who have reviewed the product).  If you apply it once per day, in about 3 days you should have a nice bronze look.  Before my vacation I applied it twice a day and looked like I had been in the sun all summer long. My search for the perfect sunless tanner and my quest for an even tan on my hands and feet is OVER.  Thank you Neutrogena!!</li>
            <li> I use to tan religously! With that being said I am now in my 30&#x27;s and care about the future of my skin so I have stopped tanning. I buy this stuff faithfully and love it! In fact at the end of summer I stock up on about 4-5 cans to get me through the winter because I can not find it anywhere in the winter for some reason. I only use it on my face, neck and chest area. I always have the best tan of all my friends that still go to the dreadful tanning salon. I have had the experience one time where I bought a can and the spray feature did not work, it was defective but the other 500 cans (exagetated) that I bought worked perfect! Im fair but I use the medium shade and it works great! If I have special plans and I want to appear tan, I shower that morning and after my shower I mist myself generously and them I hold the blowdryer to my skin on cool or warm for a few minutes. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 years now and I swear by it!</li>
            <li> This seemed to work ok on my daughters skin. As she has very fair skin. great people to work with and thank you</li>
            <li> The medium is okay.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a color change.  If I sprayed more than four time it froze and I had to wait to do the rest of my body.  It worked good enough but the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; color was much better.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful to spray evenly.  Best have someone do it for you.</li>
            <li> I used this twice in a row to ensure I would receive color.  The first coat dried and then I applied a second coat.  The color was perfect!!  I am so impressed!</li>
            <li> This is the 5th brand of spray tanners (banana boat, fake bake, tan wise, and true blue spa) i&#x27;ve tried out. By far the worst. Unlike the others which all gave me decent color this one was little to no color. Plus, I think this smell was the worst behind true blue spa. The only thing I liked about it was the fine mist spray. Pointless though if it&#x27;s not gonna work.</li>
            <li> So being all about the tanning lifestyle, with this review I know what I am talking about. I&#x27;ve been spray tanning, UV tanning, and just tanning outside in general for over 4 years. I&#x27;ve gone through products good and bad, and unfortunately this product isn&#x27;t on the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; side. To start off, I am naturally fair, but since I&#x27;ve been tanning for some time I would be around a medium and dark tan. The big problem with this sunless tanning spray is that no matter how much you rub it in, and do your best not to miss any spots, you get streaks. Another issue is that right away it is colored when you spray it, so if you go over an area twice accidently, be sure to be prepared for some darker pigments all over. This product is overall not the best. Sorry Neutrogena but you failed me.</li>
            <li> smells nice, still leaves that sunless tanner smell at the end of the day. I am fair and I used medium, the first time I looked a bit peachy in spots where I am very white, like the under of my arms and inside of my thighs, but after a shower and reapplication the next day it evened out. I spray in my bathroom and it doesn&#x27;t get on anything else, hasn&#x27;t stained my clothes when I was dressed and did touch ups. hasn&#x27;t made me break out or anything, or stained my sheets while I slept either. will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this because the spray I usually use was sold out. Full disclosure- I&#x27;ve used it before and been unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;I use spray tan pretty regularly (I have a toddler, so visiting tanning salons is a no-go!). I just applied my 3rd coat today (I showered after the 2nd application, because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell anymore-only to apply again before bed, because I guess  committee to a tan).&lt;br /&gt;The smell is bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;The color is NOT effective. 3 coats of this spray (while even &amp; not splotchy) is not even close to one coat of the other self tanning spray I have used.  Frustrating.</li>
            <li> Skin cancer, sun spots, and freckles are a hereditary trait passed along in my mother&#x27;s side of the family. Since a young age sun screen has been lathered on my body like it was going out of style. I&#x27;ve been as pale as snow for as long as I can remember. In high school I desperately wanted to go tanning- in tanning beds. But my mother, being the smart woman she is, said &amp;#34;No.&amp;#34; and offered up the alternative of a spray tan. We couldn&#x27;t really afford the $100.00 salon quality spray tans- so I started looking for at-home tans at our local department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few brands, but Neutrogena easily became my go-to one. In high school I was desperate to be darker- so I often used the &#x27;deep shade&#x27;. This spray gave me the deep tan I yearned for. But, with my pale skin, when it began to wash off after 4 to 5 days, I was left an odd blotchy mess. Around the 4th day, I&#x27;d deeply exfoliate by mixing baking soda into my body wash. It would strip the tan from my body and I could start anew. If you&#x27;re very fair skinned, but want a deep tan without the odd blotches- this is a technique I highly recommend for a constant even tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now-a-days I live in Alaska, and having a dark tan in mid-winter would just be odd. So I started looking for a spray that would make me a hue or two darker without people assuming I&#x27;d ran off to vacation in Hawaii for a week. I went back to my favorite brand. Neutrogena. This time I went for the &#x27;medium&#x27; hue. Honestly, I&#x27;m as white as a ghost, and this fine mist spray isn&#x27;t changing that. I&#x27;ve tried multiple applications and I&#x27;m not seeing a huge difference. I do believe this is largely in part due to my albino-like skin tone. So, unfortunately- my favorite brand is failing me. I&#x27;m just not seeing a change in color. And I guess that&#x27;s the entire point of the spray. So for that reason I&#x27;ve docked this product (my favorite product!) a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray comes in an aerosol can. I very rarely have problems with it clogging or the nozzle breaking. Occasionally (like once in every 20 cans) I&#x27;ll get a dud that can&#x27;t spray. The spray is very fine. Literally a mist. This, to me, works so much better than foams and lotions because it truly does get an even application over the entire body. Because it sprays you can do your own back. In fact you can do your entire body without needing to call on the help of a personal friend (no one needs to know your tan is fake- except you!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like one reviewer mentioned- don&#x27;t do your feet. Go very light over your elbows and knees. Wash the palms of your hands when your finished (and in between your fingers). I typically start at my lower calf. I do the front of my leg. The outside. The inside. And the back. I follow this procedure up my legs. When I get to my midsection I do my front, then my back, then each side. I quickly do the top of my shoulders and around my neck. Then I do each arm- the front and then underneath. I&#x27;ll hold the can about 6 inches from my body. Press down on the nozzle firmly, and spray in a back and fourth motion continuously until I&#x27;ve finished the area I was targeting. Then I&#x27;ll restart on the new area, until my entire body is finished. I don&#x27;t do my face- I find it looks more natural if my face is a shade or two lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a bit of a smell to this product. In fact there&#x27;s a major smell if you&#x27;re doing it in a confined space like a bathroom. I highly recommend turning a fan on. I do it in our outdoor sauna and open the door right away. The spray is very fine so it remains in the air- and you need ventilation. It could easily overpower anyone&#x27;s senses. It&#x27;s not a terrible smell- just a powerful one. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for women with sensitive stomachs or who are pregnant. And for everyone else I highly suggest using it in an airy room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this product has it&#x27;s good and bad traits. It&#x27;s deep hue worked well for me in the past, but I&#x27;m not seeing a big change with the medium. The mist works really well and gets even coverage. The spray can allows you to tan yourself by yourself. But the smell can be a bit overwhelming. Weighing the pros and cons it&#x27;s still my favorite product. I think I&#x27;ll just opt for the deep color next time.he medium. The mist works really well and gets even coverage. The spray can allows you to tan yourself by yourself. But the smell can be a bit overwhelming. Weighing the pros and cons it&#x27;s still my favorite product. I think I&#x27;ll just opt for the deep color next time.</li>
            <li> The spray didn&#x27;t work well. I didn&#x27;t return it because it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble. The color was no to my liking.</li>
            <li> I bought this on my recent trip to the States and found some problems with the product.    Firstly, it is a NIGHTMARE to apply as the spray was clogged and I had to press down so hard I thought I was going to injure myself.  Secondly, I was hoping for a nice colour which never happened.  Whether or not it is because of my skin tone (olive) should not have really made a difference.  It was such a bad product that I didn&#x27;t even bring it back with me.  I chucked it in the bin.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just got the 2 shades darker version last night and based on the other reviews, I was hesitant so I did a light coat and it worked wonderfully.  I have since done 2 more coats and have a natural looking tan.  My arms were naturally tanned but my legs weren&#x27;t and after 3 applications to my legs, the color is an exact match to my arms.  My advice is to hold it about 6 inches away and spray a light coat over the area you want tanned.  After a couple of hours, look at the results and do more light applications until you achieve the desired color.</li>
            <li> Such a good product on your skin it and your skin for like two or three days stays tan before  I was really really pale and now I am taking. On a pretty designed tan but there is one thing that is kind of a tint in buy see when you don&#x27;t spray areas of your tan it reads like little dots where you didn&#x27;t get this like rub in your tan and then it looks really really bad and it takes at least two or three days to get off even though that is a bad thing to happen to you this product is the best thing you can get on Amazon.:)</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars, but because of the strong odor I gave it 4 starts. This is the easiest tanner I have ever used, and I have used so many. It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks and makes my body look evenly tanned. I love this stuff. I do wish that it smelled better. Even with the window open in my bathroom it is still unbearable. My legs smell funny for a day but it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much better than lotions. It really does take practice in getting the application right. It&#x27;s best to hold it about 7 inches away. When you spray your feet hold it further away and spread your toes apart. I don&#x27;t even spray my knees because the over spray gets it and it comes out perfect. I also stand on a towel because if I don&#x27;t, the floor will get sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another review of how the bottle didn&#x27;t even spray and how hard it was to get the product to come out... the bottle was most likely defected and has nothing to do with the tanner itself. I have bought about 4 cans of this stuff of the \\&quot;2 shades darker\\&quot; and absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I just have not found this to be very effective. I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a change in tones. I would recommend trying St. Tropez, Fake bake, or Zen tan over this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want your legs colored orange. And not just orange but orange stripes or dots or patches. This really is the most dreadful product. It doesn&#x27;t cover well, it doesn&#x27;t cover uniformly and the color is horrendous. You have been warned.... My kids could hardly stand up for laughing when they saw it.</li>
            <li> I used this self tanner as directed and it left me with blotches and marks on my legs. I&#x27;m not sure if I just missed a few spots while showering. Either way it&#x27;s been 2 months and I still have these marks on one of my legs. I need to know if this happened to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I just bought this last night. I exfoliated in the shower, dried off and applied the spray. When I got up this morning, I had very uneven coverage and it was blotchy in the areas that it did manage to \\&quot;tan\\&quot;. I did a full body spray but only noticed a color change on my forearms and thighs. I have very fair skin so I used the medium spray. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this again. So far, I&#x27;ve had great results with banana boat summer color self-tanning lotion - I think I&#x27;ll be sticking with what I know!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this product.  It&#x27;s better than 3 stars, but not good enough to give it a full 4. First of all, I&#x27;m a regular user of Fake Bake aerosol, however, I ran out of it and needed something stat &amp; thought I&#x27;d give Neutrogena Micro-Mist in medium a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; of this product, (and something that Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t appear to advertise), is that it&#x27;s CLEAR. A clear ultra-fine mist...who knew?  My pillowcases thank Neutrogena.  Neutrogena would do well to make this a selling point for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to rub it in after applying the mist (but then again, I only used it on my face (hold your breath), neck, chest and shoulders - maybe that has something to do with it.) I didn&#x27;t have trouble with the nozzle, as so many other reviewers report, and I felt the application provided even coverage. I applied the mist before bed, showered it off the next morning, and was very happy with the sheer, even color it provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is the scent.  It is SO strong and people with asthma or allergies to strong perfume-y scents should really beware and think twice before buying this product.  As we know, all self-tanners have some kind of odor or scent, but this Neutrogena product really is one of the scent-iest self-tanners I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Warning: blend this product. I put this on about an hour before leaving my house and then went shopping. I looked at my legs around 3 hours later and I had a very attractive set of orange stripes. I am now trying to fix the stripes with my old tanner. Blending is very much required.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that it actually worked in two days, no streaking but it turned by skin orange in the daylight  but pretty tan inside but it looks like a horrible spray tan gone bad.</li>
            <li> I had been using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Sublime Tanner (the one that sparkles), which has the advantage of a dark color so you can see where you&#x27;re applying it. However Sublime&#x27;s smell is god-awful and of course those sparkles, yet the coverage was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s spray (Deep #3). I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors and cannot believe how wonderful Neutrogena smells compared to other tanners. It does get that classic \\&quot;tanner\\&quot; smell over time, but it&#x27;s not nearly as offensive or strong as Sublime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one application of Neutrogena at noon, it took about 12 hours for the color to really deepen (not the 2-4 hours the can says). I&#x27;m fairly pale (blue eyes, freckles, strawberry blond). When I woke up the next day, there were lots of white \\&quot;holes\\&quot; where I&#x27;d missed. Surprising, because I&#x27;d sprayed myself in the garage and really taken my time. Anyway, I&#x27;ve just reapplied to fill the bare spots; hope it looks smooth. (I advise not touching or sitting on anything for a good half-hour after spraying -- the same precaution when getting sprayed at a tanning booth -- and being very careful about rubbing the skin for several hours after, IMO. So, care is needed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful color, not orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, I sprayed some in my palm and smoothed over my face rather than spray it; then washed my hands and sprayed the tops lightly. Perfect in both places.</li>
            <li> It gives me the best, streak free color of any product I&#x27;ve used.  My only complaint is that is has a after smell that is slightly sweaty smell which isn&#x27;t bad but kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever gotten your Jersey Shore on and gone to a salon for a spray tan, Neutrogena&#x27;s Micro-Mist is hardly the same thing.  Neutrogena is a brand I trust, but this stuff has more problems than benefits.  Oh wait, I can&#x27;t think of any benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems:&lt;br /&gt;if you continually spray this in your bathroom, your walls and floor will get a tan.  I applied mine in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not for me, and the amount of fumes made me wish for a painter&#x27;s mask.  Granted, this may have been because I applied it in the shower, an enclosed space, but still, I didn&#x27;t like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As careful as I was, I ended up with a streaky tan and missed spots.  I&#x27;m going back to Jergens Daily Glow to get my tan on.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly with great packaging. Really enjoy my spray tan, doesn&#x27;t get everywhere except where I want. No streaking or dripping. I am very fair so I wanted &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;Dark&amp;#34; and this is perfect. I am darker without looking like I have a fake tan.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fake tan, as I am red headed, and fair complection.  I&#x27;ve tried so many over the years and most were either too complicated to get it just right (streaked or uneven) or it was too dark for me, or it was too orange.  I finally just gave up decided if I get a natural tan, great, but if not, oh well.  It is what it is.  Well ...my sister just keeps raving about tanning beds but I just don&#x27;t see if as feasible with me.  I would probably burn to a crisp and get cancer!  So I ran across this product from Neutrogena, and I am a HUGE fan of their products! ( or the ones I&#x27;ve tried anyway) I use several on a daily basis, and this spray tan had excellent reviews so I ordered it, and just tried last night.  I shaved, scrubbed, exfoliated, and lotioned up.( that was in am)  I also scrubbed and exfoliated in my nite bath but skipped the lotion this time.  I sprayed as evenly as I could and I actually skipped the knees complety as I felt a little bit fall on them.  And I tell you by no means did I measure the 6&amp;#34; recommended distance to spray. And I&#x27;m pretty sure I didn&#x27;t follow the correct way to spray either.  I just thought I&#x27;d try it my way and use long steady strokes.  On my face, I sprayed a little on a cotton round (used for face creams ointments etc., flat cotton ball?) and lightly spread it all over my face and down my neck. even when it felt like it wasn&#x27;t much on there I just went on anyway.  So end result...my face has a mild natural looking color to it.  That&#x27;s what I was shooting for!  And my legs also have a light &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; look to them with virtually No streaks!!  I did notice one tiny little spot on upper outer thigh but&#x27;s its just a barely noticeable off-evenness.  big deal.  My knees, feet and ankles look so natural as well.  See I skipped the knees and ankles.  all I did was a light quick little spritz from far away on feet.  So I&#x27;m very very pleased!!!  And I did read another review saying this stuff was too strong, but actually I didn&#x27;t gert that at all.  It&#x27;s actually really really mild.  Way milder than what I remember from other brands.  And as an added bonus...my legs actually feel a ltitle softer too!  I will definitely be buying this again when I run out!!!!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!! NEUTROGENA HAS YET AGAIN...MADE ME A HAPPY WOMAN!!  OH, FYI: It says it takes 2-4 hours to turn to tan, but I put it  on about 3 hours before bed and when I woke up this am I was tan!! And one more FYI (yES I got a lto to say) No MESS IN YOUR HOUSE OR SMELL FROM THIS!!! I put old towels down and all but it didn&#x27;t even stain em up at all!  So good deal!!!!idn&#x27;t gert that at all.  It&#x27;s actually really really mild.  Way milder than what I remember from other brands.

            <li> Just ok...I like this better than most of the lotions because it has even application as long as you keep moving while spraying. I am not a fan of the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as most of the lotions.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it come every spring and summer. It gives a nice natural looking tan color as well as glow. I always feel much prettier with a tan, and this is healthier then laying out in the sun everyday to get one. If you plan on wearing white, I would suggest waiting for it to set for a day, and shower any residue off before wearing white. This product does transfer slightly, but will be noticeable on white clothing, sheets, furniture and towels. It does clean out well, but you wont want to wear that look out. You will also want to spray it on in a shower or tub, as the particles do travel and there will be some that might not make it on your body, and it makes clean up easy. And you should open the window for ventilation, since it is an arousal fume. The smell isn&#x27;t very noticeable once on, but the particles can be cloudy in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my face for a nice airbrush look, that requires way less foundation. The spray top is easy to use, and apply. I get about 2-3 uses out of one can, for my entire body, which lasts about 3-4 weeks. I apply it about once a week to 10 days, or when I notice I need it.</li>
            <li> I really am surprised this product doesn&#x27;t have higher reviews. I LOVE this spray. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have never had an uneven tan. There is no bronzer, so you won&#x27;t see where it is spraying, but no worries - it sprays EVENLY all the time.The smell is minimal and it lasts about a week. It gets EVERYWHERE, you can use the can sideways upside down, you name it. I have tried other sprays and gotten streaks because the nozzle gets clogged and more will spray in one area than the other. I don&#x27;t even have to rub this one in after applying, I just let it dry (did I also mention it is the fastest drying one I have tried yet?). I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily wear white after applying it, but cannot recall any times where this product has rubbed off on my clothes. I also notice a difference in color after only one application, where I have tried others up to three times before seeing any hint of color.</li>
            <li> okay i think its important for woman of color to read this. iam classified African- American and I have silver stretch marks so they are old. my skin complexion is the color of a shiny penny. now for this product my problem areas are my legs which have the most on the backs of my calfs and inner thighs. NOTE: my stretch marks are not deeply pitted they are pretty leveled with my skin. my stretch marks are from pregnancy and weight lost. i purchased the medium shade because being a woman of color i didn&#x27;t want to darker my complexion more than necessary. it works great it transforms the silver to a brown color acting as a camouflage and making it less noticeable in my opinion. just follow the directions hold the can 6 inches away for flawless coverage. it smells amazing also and gives a beautiful glow even for darker tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;caution: please wait the 2 to 4 hours for the spray to develop before spraying again after first session. it does work give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is the best on the market sunless tanning spray, for several reasons. This is how I use it. I will exfoliate very well in the shower and dry off completely. This is the key step. I spray before I moisturize. Remember this is a buildable sunless spray tan and comes out clear so you don&#x27;t know how dark it will be. I always by the dark and I am fair skin. This is non cosmogentic, I may have spelled that wrong but my Dr says to only buy products that say that. I hold the can about 6 inches from the skin and I also to 2 swipes one up one down. Since it does come out clear it starts to show in 2 to 4 hours and does not have to be reapplied every day. After I let it dry for about 10 minutes then I apply my moisturizer. I even spray this on my fresh exfoliated face and on my hands and have never had streaks or lines. This is something that I use after a shower in the evening. I will use it every evening until I get the desired color. Everyone thinks I have been to the beach. It is easy to use with the nozzle that can even reach my back. I would rate this a 10 by far. It can be purchased at Walgreens and CVS also. I love it! and recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> works great, very satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I absolutely LOVE the Micro-Mist Sunless Spray in DEEP. I&#x27;ve actually reviewed the deep one as well, so feel free to check that out for other info on how well it works and how to apply it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this one, though, my main comment is that it&#x27;s simply not effective. It didn&#x27;t make me orange or streaky, but only because it didn&#x27;t really give me any color at all. And to be clear, I am very, very fair. Like, see my veins through the skin, blindingly white in winter fair. So I thought I was playing it safe by going with the medium. Nope. It&#x27;s honestly not worth it. Don&#x27;t be afraid to go for the deep shade. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I suppose it is possible that I had the one can with a defective spray nozzle.  I could only get it to spray (occasionally) with my right hand thumb.  This didn&#x27;t make for a smooth and even application.  I won&#x27;t take the chance with this product again, as I have since read that others have experienced this nozzle issue.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this product. By far the worst results I&#x27;ve ever had in spite of following all the tips. This is the least forgiving product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I tried this because I like that it&#x27;s a spray/mist but that seemed to be the reason the result was so streaky. The color on me was very orange too. Every other product I&#x27;ve tried has been better for me than this. Will be throwing this away.</li>
            <li> My favorite brand of self tanner on the market. Easy to apply, no need to rub in, and looks very natural! And for the cost, it beats any salon spray tan! I am an addict, and love the way it looks, even on very pale skin! Great for all types of skin and for any occasions, daily use or before special events. You cannot go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried every self tanner out there. This one by far is the best.  Let me touch on all the points that matter.  Unless you are whiter than the background of this review, buy the DEEP color Micro Mist.  For those who stated they recieved no color from the Medium, I never buy anything but the darkest when it comes to self tanner and i am pretty fair skined in the winter.  The Deep Micro Mist is Zero Orange!!! color is perfectly bronze very natural looking.  Spray goes on perfect, never have to rub it in the spray is perfect, even and very covering.  The smell is pleasant, ( i have smelled a lot worse). As for People complaining about the fumes, i have no idea what you are doing wrong, but the fumes are a lot less than a can of hairspray in my own opinion.  If you are overwelmed by the fumes, then you should do sections while breaking for the next like i do.  I would never try to do my whole body in less than 5 minutes.  That has to be the issue.  Never ever stained my clothing or my bathroom.  Product dries so quickly.  The only complaint i could say about this product is, that it goes on Clear, kinda hard to know where it&#x27;s going, but if you used enough self tanners, you have a good idea as to where it&#x27;s going.  Also probably why this product does not stain clothing etc.  So not really a bad complaint.&lt;br /&gt;Here are also a few tips for perfect coverage. Under my own opinion.  Shower first and exfoliate.  towel dry, DO NOT USE LOTION.  Apply Tanner to dry skin in circular motion about 6 inches away, just like CAN says.  I start with my face and neck first.  spray rest of body taking breaks so you dont kill yourself from the fumes ( no brainer) when you do your legs and arms, do not spray hands or feet or ankles,  spray falls with gravity and it will cover those spots.  Apply 2 coats everywhere.  Use blow drier cool heat to really dry product evenly and quicker.  at end take a nail scrub brush with warm soap and water scrub your palms and around wrist area and in between fingers and toes and toe nails.  I have done this for years and it works like a charm.  also around angle and heel area of feet.  Good luck and I hope my review helps.between fingers and toes and toe nails.
