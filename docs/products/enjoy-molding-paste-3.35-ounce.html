            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite all-time finds.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for years</li>
            <li>but my favorite is this molding paste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get much better than this if you have my type of hair.</li>
            <li>its ok.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really hold that great</li>
            <li>but I love the consistency and the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy or gloppy.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I really love this product for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy.</li>
            <li>This stuff goes into your hair really easily.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT LOVE IT for my spikes, and to lay down my fly aways.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t enjoy it at all</li>
            <li>Great product to add texture to short hair without stiffness.</li>
            <li>I received a gift basket with lots of Enjoy products in it.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It hold your hair for the whole day and is able to shape it terrifically.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product especially if you know how to use stuff like this.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>(dont need too much if you have fine hair.)</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth the price and would buy it again and again, which I plan on doing when I run out.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like grapefruit which is &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; but not necessarily offensive and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>Important not to use too much at a time and run fingers next to scalp rather than on top for lift.</li>
            <li>It really holds the style.  </li>
            <li>pliable if you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I use it lightly to tame fly away hair and dry brittle ends!  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is an excellent product, but it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li>At first I put too much and ended up with kind of stiff hair (which I can&#x27;t handle), but I&#x27;ve used it several times now and have adjusted the amount as well as added another product with less hold to apply to my hair and things</li>
            <li>My fine hair goes limp.</li>
            <li>I recommend using as little as possible to start so that you get the most use for your money.</li>
            <li>More trouble to send it back.  </li>
            <li>It holds my thick hair very well and feels light.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 of the same product and when I opened one I thought maybe it shifted in shipping, I opened all 3 and the consistency being watery of the product as well as the contents being half full, left me no alternative but to return it to Amazon.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and holds for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a white paste that isn&#x27;t super thick, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, very thin short hair</li>

            <li> I have very fine, very thin short hair</li>
            <li> Normally I need at least 2 hair products to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with a couple of drops of argan oil and it gives a little extra shine.</li>
            <li> I also use other products along with this.</li>
            <li> It is medium-length (barely) and fairly thick with about 10-15% body to it.  </li>
            <li> paste doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy and provides medium hold so your hair has movement &amp; hold without looking plastered down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy, but my husband swears by it.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little like Pledge</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy or crunchy.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few years.</li>

            <li> It is NOT sticky, crunchy or stiff.  </li>
            <li> It was less expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Poor hold.</li>
            <li> I hate when hair products make you hair feel weighed down or immovable.</li>
            <li> Leaves a sticky yuck film in hair that is difficult to wash out.  </li>
            <li> It would be rather difficult to end up with a &amp;#34;greasy look&amp;#34; using this product unless you aren&#x27;t paying attention to where you&#x27;re applying</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the product, however this is not 3.35oz.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t enjoy it at all (see what I did there?).  Leaves a sticky yuck film in hair that is difficult to wash out.  Not for me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It really holds the style.  I have an undercut pixie so this paste is great!  Great hold, pliable if you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.  It hold your hair for the whole day and is able to shape it terrifically.  It also does not leave that greasy shiny residue in your hair after you use it, which is why I use this product.  Its definitely worth the price and would buy it again and again, which I plan on doing when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a gel kinda guy. This stuff goes into your hair really easily. (dont need too much if you have fine hair.) My hair stylist used this once and I really liked the look. Went out and bought some for myself.  Good brand. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Great product to add texture to short hair without stiffness. I mix it with a couple of drops of argan oil and it gives a little extra shine.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I am enjoying Enjoy&#x27;s Molding Paste! It does not feel heavy or crunchy. It&#x27;s just right. I would definitely recommend this product. Great price!</li>
            <li> The Wife goes through a jar of this about every 6-7 weeks. She says it&#x27;s great stuff, and I wish it wasn&#x27;t so I didn&#x27; have to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells nice!  I use it lightly to tame fly away hair and dry brittle ends!  Buy it!</li>
            <li> Was introduced to this product by a hairstylist and have been using it since (about 2 years). I have very fine, very thin short hair and this helps boost the volume and give it some heft. I also use other products along with this. It&#x27;s one of my favorite all-time finds.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for years</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t come close to what I&#x27;ve been buying at my local salon, which I have been using for years! I bought 3 of the same product and when I opened one I thought maybe it shifted in shipping, I opened all 3 and the consistency being watery of the product as well as the contents being half full, left me no alternative but to return it to Amazon. For $13 dollars that Amazon charges as opposed to $24 in my local salon, as the saying goes &#x27;You get what you pay for&#x27; As another saying goes &#x27;If it sounds too good to be true..it probably is&#x27; Just went to the beauty it is web-site and it&#x27;s not sold anymore. I can only assume Amazon bought there remaining inventory at a fraction of the price, so people like me think their getting the same product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live and learn!</li>
            <li> The best paste ever! I received a gift basket with lots of Enjoy products in it. It&#x27;s a great brand but my favorite is this molding paste. It holds the hair without making it stiff or sticky. I was buying it in a beauty supply store until one day I decided to look it up on Amazon. It was less expensive on Amazon. I got my best friend hooked on it as well.</li>
            <li> This is an all around good hair product.  It gives you medium hold and allows you to shape your hair.  I just put it on and scrunch my short hair style into place.  Not greasy.  Been using it for a few years.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  More trouble to send it back.  Don&#x27;t bother.  Poor hold.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this hair product and uses it daily.  Molding paste great for giving hair a lift!  Good price, too!</li>
            <li> Not greasy, smells great.  It&#x27;s a little pricy, but my husband swears by it.  I would recommend this product, yes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over 6 years since I&#x27;ve had a stand-alone hair styling product which actually worked for my specific hair type.  Normally I need at least 2 hair products to get the job done.  My hair is essentially a straight-out &#x27;80s bowl-do without hair product.  It is medium-length (barely) and fairly thick with about 10-15% body to it.  Again, my hair is STRAIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paste doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  It has a MEDIUM HOLD and a MEDIUM SHINE.  It is NOT sticky, crunchy or stiff.  It has an amazing GRAPEFRUIT SCENT.  It would be rather difficult to end up with a &amp;#34;greasy look&amp;#34; using this product unless you aren&#x27;t paying attention to where you&#x27;re applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get much better than this if you have my type of hair.</li>
            <li> tried this at a friend&#x27;s in Florida, loved it so ordered it when I returned home, came in two days!  Important not to use too much at a time and run fingers next to scalp rather than on top for lift.</li>
            <li> Does not hold my hair. My fine hair goes limp. Still searching for a product that works.</li>
            <li> its ok. doesn&#x27;t really hold that great</li>
            <li> It smells a little like Pledge but I love the consistency and the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy or gloppy.  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT for my spikes, and to lay down my fly aways. LOVE IT AND IT SMELLS SO GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this product for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy. This holding paste does just that, it holds volume to your hair without creating build-up. I hate when hair products make you hair feel weighed down or immovable. It&#x27;s not greasy or gel-like. It&#x27;s a white paste that isn&#x27;t super thick, but it gets the job done. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now, and still love it!</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my hairdresser.  It holds my thick hair very well and feels light.</li>
            <li> This product works well on hair.  It looks natural and holds for a long time.  Unlike foams and gels, it does not lose hold if you comb through it.  Overall, it is an excellent product, but it is very expensive.  I recommend using as little as possible to start so that you get the most use for your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hairdresser nor even someone who is good at fixing my own hair.  My stylist suggested I try this and so I did.  At first I put too much and ended up with kind of stiff hair (which I can&#x27;t handle), but I&#x27;ve used it several times now and have adjusted the amount as well as added another product with less hold to apply to my hair and things are starting to work well.  I think it&#x27;s a good product especially if you know how to use stuff like this.  It smells kind of like grapefruit which is &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; but not necessarily offensive and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have a very short, pixie-style hair cut and I love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months and would never use anything else. It is not greasy and provides medium hold so your hair has movement &amp; hold without looking plastered down. Highly recommend!!!</li>
