            <li>I get lots of compliments when I wear it, but mostly wear it when I&#x27;m with my husband.</li>
            <li>Love the smell love the price.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Makes me think about her even more.</li>
            <li>To top it off it was a gift to me from my hubby &amp; 1 of the decorations</li>
            <li>I love all of Marc Jacob&#x27;s scents.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and the bottle is quite large.</li>
            <li>️This perfume is a true meaning of sexy.</li>
            <li>and I was delighted because, in general, I love Marc Jacobs brand a lot.  </li>
            <li>I was less impressed with the scent.  </li>
            <li>It smells fabulous and showed up on time .</li>
            <li>But the bottle is fun and for young woman who wants to wear light perfume during the day, this is a perfect gift.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent, it is light, fresh, clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on in the morning and the clean scent is still at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Light, fresh, clean and feminine.</li>
            <li>I used MARC JACOBS perfume (with white flowers - jasmine) and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Was well worth it.</li>
            <li>I just had to have this when i first smelled it.</li>
            <li>but it is not perfect &amp; to me 5 represents perfect.  </li>
            <li>Nice little item with a nice little price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you want the real deal!</li>
            <li>Bottle is really cute even though the wings make it kinda wide....</li>
            <li>For me personally, it wears off quickly.  </li>
            <li>I still love it, I tried to glue the little wing/dot (?)</li>
            <li>I love this scent, even though it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>The only reason or reasons it does not get the full five is that I personally feel that perfumes and things of that sort are very over priced.  </li>
            <li>Its not fast wearing, I will put it on in the morning and will still be able to smell it the next day!!</li>
            <li>so it was like two gifts in one as far as she was concerned.</li>
            <li>It was a very generous present</li>
            <li>So good that i randomly smell it when im at work.</li>

            <li> Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She had wanted it forever and was thrilled. The scent is very nice and the bottle is quite large. She loves the bottle design so it was like two gifts in one as far as she was concerned.</li>
            <li> My favorite.  A little cheaper than buying at Macy&#x27;s.  I get tons of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It&#x27;s well worth every penny. I spray it on in the morning and the clean scent is still at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, even though it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Light, fresh, clean and feminine. The bottle is adorable.</li>

            <li> I just had to have this when i first smelled it. It smell good enoug to est. I got it for a very very good price and enjoy it often.</li>
            <li> Delivered just as presented.  Smells wonderful - my daughter and I share it.  Bottle is really cute even though the wings make it kinda wide....</li>
            <li> Perfect. Came in great condition and exactly as described. Its not fast wearing, I will put it on in the morning and will still be able to smell it the next day!! Great. Highly recommended if you want the real deal!</li>
            <li> This perfume is a very sexy and seductive fragrance! My husband purchased a small bottle for me when we went on a cruise. The small bottle was much more expensive than the large one. I&#x27;m truly hooked on Marc Jacobs❤️This perfume is a true meaning of sexy. I get lots of compliments when I wear it, but mostly wear it when I&#x27;m with my husband. It&#x27;s a sweet long lasting subtle fragrance that lasts all day and night.</li>
            <li> It smells fabulous and showed up on time . Was well worth it. We are so extrordinarily excited and happy</li>
            <li> Love the smell love the price.  It came all in one piece.  I was worried buying parfum through the mail.  Nice little item with a nice little price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. I normally buy it at the department store, but found it on here for less. IT smells great, lasts and I can tell its as fresh as if I bought it at the store!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife for christmas and smells wonderful. So good that i randomly smell it when im at work. :D Makes me think about her even more. I recommend</li>
            <li> I love this scent, it is light, fresh, clean smelling.  The only reason or reasons it does not get the full five is that I personally feel that perfumes and things of that sort are very over priced.  To top it off it was a gift to me from my hubby &amp; 1 of the decorations fell off during shipping.  There is no way the shipper or seller, or even the maker could have known this because it was in a box that still had the cellophane on it.  I kind of wavered on taking that 1 star off but it is not perfect &amp; to me 5 represents perfect.  I still love it, I tried to glue the little wing/dot (?) back on but nope, it would not stick.  I love all of Marc Jacob&#x27;s scents.</li>
            <li> I have received this perfume from my best friend for my birthday.  It was a very generous present and I was delighted because, in general, I love Marc Jacobs brand a lot.  However, I must say that the best thing about this perfume is the bottle.  If you know a woman who likes lady bugs and butterflies, just the bottle alone is the keeper.  I was less impressed with the scent.  For me personally, it wears off quickly.  I used MARC JACOBS perfume (with white flowers - jasmine) and LOVED it.  I cannot say the same for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy this perfume for myself.  There are other brands I would rather spend my money on.  But the bottle is fun and for young woman who wants to wear light perfume during the day, this is a perfect gift.  She can keep used bottle as a decoration in her room, or in her office (if she is working).</li>
