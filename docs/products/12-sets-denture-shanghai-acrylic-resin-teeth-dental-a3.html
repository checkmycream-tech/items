            <li> Excellent material... üëç</li>
            <li> I purchased these for work on special effects prosthetics and they look and feel like real teeth.  They are exactly what I wanted and at a great price.</li>
            <li> You have 12 sets to play with. I just wish instruction came with it or a YouTube video explaining the product.</li>
            <li> These are amazing quality for their price, cheapest and best imitation I&#x27;ve come across. They look just as good as the pictures show, really lightweight, excellent color, perfect for making masks/busts for special effects.</li>
            <li> have a purpose in mind for these....waiting on one more item to use these but from the looks of them they will work just fine.</li>
            <li> my roommates were doing acid and i brought out a box of these and some dental tools and i totally ruined their day</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown though lighter in color, small size great for my project with leftovers for another idea that may come to mind...lol...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the realistic look of these teeth! They&#x27;re the size and shape of the crowns of normal human teeth. While not disgustingly yellow, neither are they porcelain-white; they&#x27;re a fairly natural tooth color. There&#x27;s a little surface translucence, as with natural teeth, which enhances the look.&lt;br /&gt; They&#x27;re made with a small amount of \\&quot;root\\&quot; which gives them extra stability when you can push them into a substrate (papier-m√¢ch√©, clay, polymer).  The root portion is quite short, though, and the teeth should also be glued in place. Epoxy, silicone adhesive, or Super Glue products work fine for that.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very good for the quality, so if you have any projects calling for realistic-looking teeth, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> fantastic color match great structure and A! consistency  easy to apply in model and even easier to align recommended for the advanced denture technician.</li>
            <li> THESE LOOK EXACTLY LIKE REAL TEETH!!!</li>
            <li> These teeth look so real! I&#x27;m using them in the zombies that I make for Halloween.</li>
            <li> Came in handy, arrived with in 8 days</li>
            <li> They are very realistic looking with a nice flat edge on the lower half of the back for gluing into place.  It is actually 6 sets, not 12.  Those 6 sets are full upper and lower.  I had figured as much by the pictures in the product description so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.  I will probably by another set soon.</li>
            <li> This is the only set of teeth that look real that I have seen so far.  Nicely packed for further use</li>
            <li> It was excellent. It best fits to my requirements.I feel satisfied. It is the best choice in such a small money.</li>
            <li> Used to be dental lab. tech exactly what I was looking for</li>
