            <li>Amazing Amazon, for having this product on your site!</li>

            <li>if I find when I am done with this tube that it works really good and helps I will give this 5 stars</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is really good.  </li>
            <li>It IS refreshing and aids sensitivity as it says it does!  </li>
            <li>I have always liked Arm and Hammer tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and tried this toothpaste, It was the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Best sensitive one I&#x27;ve found &amp; I love the flavor.</li>
            <li>I honestly do get compliments on my bright smile.  </li>
            <li>Better consistancy</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I love the taste of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It tastes better too without all the sweetness.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I will deal with the taste and like it..&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Another wonderful reason to be a loyal Arm &amp; Hammer Sensitive user!</li>
            <li>but this does get rid of sensitivity and makes your mouth feel very clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>Product is excellent, and does a much better job at helping with sensitive teeth than the paste more commonly thought of as being best.  </li>
            <li>Now that there was an Arm &amp; Hammer sensitive toothpaste, I was happy about it and purchased it.</li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>the water&#x27;s taste (tap water) is better than any spring water that one can purchase at a cool temperature of around 48 F.  </li>
            <li>And yes, I am comparing accurately.</li>
            <li>Good toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste, but I needed a sensitive version.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is just as good, as more advertised toothpastes, that are similar in what they do!</li>
            <li>Not only does it work well for the sensitivity, it also does a great job keeping my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>this toothpaste makes my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste smells good, helps with my sensitivity and the baking soda leaves my mpouth feeling much more clean than other brands.  </li>
            <li>I love this product that is so new to me, and will continue to use it because of a renewed sensitivity to my mouth since I have quit the smoking habit for almost three years, now!  </li>
            <li>and I had to quickly use another toothpaste to get rid of the taste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Sensodine and other brand&#x27;s version of sensitive tooth paste and find this one works the best.  </li>
            <li>Anticavity Fluoride, Whitening, Fresh Mint 4.5 Oz</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also read many reviews that give me concern about what is actually shipped compared to listed photos/descriptions.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that works for me and love that its whitening.  </li>
            <li>Gentle toothpaste, fresh breath.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t make my teeth feel as clean as using Arm &amp; Hammer Complete Care toothpaste, which is what I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li>First found this product when I was experiencing tender teeth - not sure if that is good grammar - and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling very clean too thanks to the extra texture from the baking soda.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prime has been great for other things such as books and electronics but not for household items.</li>
            <li>So now I have to make sure to keep the paste off my tongue, so I don&#x27;t have that strange feeling</li>
            <li>My whole mouth was burning from it.  </li>
            <li>It also taste so much better than the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is EXTREMELY minty, more minty than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Having suffered from super sensitive teeth my whole life I have tried every brands sensitive toothpaste, sensodyne, Colgate, etc</li>
            <li>Sensodyne is so much more expensive and is no where near as effective.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel better than they did, using the other toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s working any better than other sensitive tooth products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money to buy Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time the last two days, more than I should have, to ensure I price sheet for sheet.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I tried this toothpaste because my teeth have always been sensitive and normally use Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t even have sensitive teeth and won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy for as long as the price is right.</li>
            <li>Trying out Prime but so far, after checking Bounty paper towels, Northern bathroom tissue and Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste, I have yet to find any reason to purchase from Amazon vice Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For example:&lt;br /&gt;Arm &amp; Hammer Sensitive Toothpaste,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Arm &amp; Hammer Sensitive for years.  </li>
            <li>far as whether or not it cleans my teeth well, the answer is a resounding</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I had been using Sensodyne and Colgate sensitive for years and not liking the smell or the way they made my mouth feel afterwards.  </li>
            <li>the sensitive parts of my teeth and mouth don&#x27;t burn and hurt like they do with the Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li>This tootpaste fixed it.</li>
            <li>Since using sensodyne my teeth have become sensitive to hot things and the sensitivity has gone to the other side of my mouth now as well.</li>
            <li>In general baking soda is too abrasive as a tooth cleanser.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going back to using the Complete Care.</li>
            <li>I also need to use the Sensitve style toothpastes, but I can no longer find the Arm &amp; Hammer Sensitive in any of the local grocery, drug or any store that carries toothpastes (e.g. Target, WalMart, etc.)</li>
            <li>This toothpaste fixed my suddenly achy mouth in short order - just a day or two.  </li>
            <li>Something about the baking soda leaves your mouth and breath feeling fresh longer than the usual toothpaste.</li>
            <li>A&amp;H tastes good and is less expensive.</li>

            <li> It does, however, make my teether feel cleaner than other sensitive toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Crest Total Whitening user and after a sample of this paste I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I had been using a whitening toothpaste for a long, long time, and I think I overdid it.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it long term anyway  because I value my tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> Also, it lasts all day long until I brush to go to bed.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was going nuts, because the middle/back of my tongue felt swollen and strange.</li>
            <li> The only down side is, that nearly every tube seems to have an air pocket which makes it appear that there is less product.</li>
            <li> The snsetive toothpastes all have the same amount of active ingediants so the choice is taste and price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I will finish the other tubes I have</li>
            <li> It also makes my teeth feel cleaner than any other toothpaste, whitening or not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any other toothpaste before.</li>
            <li> I buy it when I can find it, sometime the entire supply because it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li> The pain just is not worth using anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased it locally in the past, but can no longer find it!  </li>
            <li> Tastes a little salty but is in no way unpalatable.  </li>
            <li> I had seen it before, but I would usually, buy the other one!</li>
            <li> I have fillings and with this paste I don&#x27;t feel the occasional random sharp pain in my nerves.</li>
            <li> A few years ago my teeth began to become sensitive to cold.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be VERY HARSH which in my opinion counters any help with sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I have never experienced this problem with any other toothpaste before.</li>
            <li> Now why is it SO HARD TO FIND?</li>
            <li> It lightened mine, but I stopped using it after a few days when it began irritating my gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about her chemistry, but whatever the case, it works well!</li>
            <li> I returned the wrong one and now need to figure out how to find the correct version.</li>
            <li> It leaves a bad taste in my mouth that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> It makes your tongue numb, too!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Using an RX toothpaste, and wanted to try this.  Better consistancy and it helps with the sensitivity.  Also lasts a bit longer.  Just wish they had it in a pump.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  Best sensitive one I&#x27;ve found &amp; I love the flavor. I&#x27;ve purchased it locally in the past, but can no longer find it!  Amazon.com to the rescue!  Thank God you can find everything on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste because my teeth have always been sensitive and normally use Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste. Now that there was an Arm &amp; Hammer sensitive toothpaste, I was happy about it and purchased it. I don&#x27;t think it worked in terms of helping with the sensitivity and it didn&#x27;t make my teeth feel as clean as using Arm &amp; Hammer Complete Care toothpaste, which is what I&#x27;ve been using for years. I will finish the other tubes I have but I&#x27;m going back to using the Complete Care.</li>
            <li> The snsetive toothpastes all have the same amount of active ingediants so the choice is taste and price. A&amp;H tastes good and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Whitening formula of this toothpaste and was sent Enamel Repair. The website shows the correct formula. I returned the wrong one and now need to figure out how to find the correct version.</li>
            <li> Trying out Prime but so far, after checking Bounty paper towels, Northern bathroom tissue and Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste, I have yet to find any reason to purchase from Amazon vice Target or Walmart. Amazon is NOT cheaper. And yes, I am comparing accurately. I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time the last two days, more than I should have, to ensure I price sheet for sheet. Toothpaste was the same size so that was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example:&lt;br /&gt;Arm &amp; Hammer Sensitive Toothpaste, Anticavity Fluoride, Whitening, Fresh Mint 4.5 Oz&lt;br /&gt;Amazon: (Pack of 3) $15.78 ($5.26 / Item)&lt;br /&gt;Walmart: $3.48 / Each&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t what I expected. I&#x27;ve also read many reviews that give me concern about what is actually shipped compared to listed photos/descriptions. There are also some quality issues with products such as paper towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prime has been great for other things such as books and electronics but not for household items. Hmmmmmmm. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this toothpaste.  I also need to use the Sensitve style toothpastes, but I can no longer find the Arm &amp; Hammer Sensitive in any of the local grocery, drug or any store that carries toothpastes (e.g. Target, WalMart, etc.)</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been a long time Crest Total Whitening user and after a sample of this paste I&#x27;m sold. I have fillings and with this paste I don&#x27;t feel the occasional random sharp pain in my nerves. It tastes better too without all the sweetness. I&#x27;ll buy for as long as the price is right.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I had been using a whitening toothpaste for a long, long time, and I think I overdid it.  This toothpaste fixed my suddenly achy mouth in short order - just a day or two.  Tastes a little salty but is in no way unpalatable.  I will keep using it for a while, and I will go back to it if I have a recurrence of achy teeth.  Good value.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and this is the only toothpaste that works for me. It also taste so much better than the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Also it is made in America</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. People ask me who did my teeth whitening. It&#x27;s just this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Sensodine and other brand&#x27;s version of sensitive tooth paste and find this one works the best.  It leaves my teeth feeling very clean too thanks to the extra texture from the baking soda.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and tried this toothpaste, It was the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Now why is it SO HARD TO FIND? Hello Arm and Hammer this is a great product! I buy it when I can find it, sometime the entire supply because it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has helped me quite a bit.  I&#x27;ve had to wait a month for my dentist to work on my sore tooth and this has got me through it.</li>
            <li> the product is perfect.  now if they can just lower the shipping costs</li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste once and threw the rest away.  It felt like I had a mouthful of salt and I had to quickly use another toothpaste to get rid of the taste.  It&#x27;s worth the extra money to buy Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> WAY too abrasive to use every day. In general baking soda is too abrasive as a tooth cleanser. This toothpaste ups the grit. It definitely cleans and it can help remove surface stains. It lightened mine, but I stopped using it after a few days when it began irritating my gums. I wouldn&#x27;t use it long term anyway  because I value my tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> Very effective both as a cleaning agent, but also relieving sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;It tastes good too!</li>
            <li> A bit on the salty side,but I guess that&#x27;s the baking soda in it.  Seems to be doing the job. Just cannot adjust to the saltiness. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth that lasts all day. Can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s working any better than other sensitive tooth products.</li>
            <li> My #1 choice for toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve been using Arm &amp; Hammer Sensitive for years.  Occasionally I have tried different toothpastes, but after only a couple of brushings my sensitivity comes back.  The pain just is not worth using anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as whether or not it cleans my teeth well, the answer is a resounding yes!  I honestly do get compliments on my bright smile.  Another wonderful reason to be a loyal Arm &amp; Hammer Sensitive user!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be VERY HARSH which in my opinion counters any help with sensitivity.  My whole mouth was burning from it.  I have never experienced this problem with any other toothpaste before.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent, and does a much better job at helping with sensitive teeth than the paste more commonly thought of as being best.  The only down side is, that nearly every tube seems to have an air pocket which makes it appear that there is less product.</li>
            <li> This product is represented well!  It delivers as advertised.  It IS refreshing and aids sensitivity as it says it does!  A reliable test for me is to drink a glass of water after brushing...the water&#x27;s taste (tap water) is better than any spring water that one can purchase at a cool temperature of around 48 F.  Hours after use, mouth continues to feel refreshed!  I love this product that is so new to me, and will continue to use it because of a renewed sensitivity to my mouth since I have quit the smoking habit for almost three years, now!  Just try one tube of this toothpaste, and you will be convinced that this IS a great choice!  Thank-you Amazing Amazon, for having this product on your site!</li>
            <li> Having suffered from super sensitive teeth my whole life I have tried every brands sensitive toothpaste, sensodyne, Colgate, etc... This is the only one that works for me and love that its whitening.  It also makes my teeth feel cleaner than any other toothpaste, whitening or not.  My husband doesn&#x27;t even have sensitive teeth and won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth.  I had been using Sensodyne and Colgate sensitive for years and not liking the smell or the way they made my mouth feel afterwards.  This toothpaste smells good, helps with my sensitivity and the baking soda leaves my mpouth feeling much more clean than other brands.  Arm and hammer form now on!</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste for sensitive teeth. Better than sensodyne but not the best. It does, however, make my teether feel cleaner than other sensitive toothpastes.</li>
            <li> First found this product when I was experiencing tender teeth - not sure if that is good grammar - and decided to try it. Not only does it work well for the sensitivity, it also does a great job keeping my teeth clean. Oh, and I like the taste too.</li>
            <li> Brushing once per day does Nothing for tooth stains but this does get rid of sensitivity and makes your mouth feel very clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  Sensodyne is so much more expensive and is no where near as effective.  When I brush with the Arm and Hammer the sensitive parts of my teeth and mouth don&#x27;t burn and hurt like they do with the Sensodyne.  Also, it lasts all day long until I brush to go to bed.  I strongly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is EXTREMELY minty, more minty than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tried. It causes my geographic tongue to flare up and even makes the skin on my tongue peel. I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any other toothpaste before. I had to switch to something else. I didn&#x27;t notice it helping with my sensitivity either, not like it would matter since I can&#x27;t tolerate using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I just started using this toothpaste. I was using sensodyne but it didn&#x27;t seem to be helping.  Since using sensodyne my teeth have become sensitive to hot things and the sensitivity has gone to the other side of my mouth now as well. I got a tube of this at the store. The taste isn&#x27;t too bad. I am not a big fan of the baking soda taste but I can deal with it. If this works like I hope it does I will deal with the taste and like it..&#x3D;) this toothpaste makes my teeth feel really clean.I like the baking soda cause it works good for whitening...&#x3D;) if I find when I am done with this tube that it works really good and helps I will give this 5 stars but where I just started using it I have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste!!!! I have looked locally and could not find it anymore. Yay Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Everything was as promised, and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste, but I needed a sensitive version. I was ecstatic when I found this product existed, and ordered it immediately!  I think it works well, but there is one problem. It makes your tongue numb, too!  I thought I was going nuts, because the middle/back of my tongue felt swollen and strange. Then I figured it out. So now I have to make sure to keep the paste off my tongue, so I don&#x27;t have that strange feeling all the time. Otherwise, I like the product quite well and recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is just as good, as more advertised toothpastes, that are similar in what they do! My teeth feel better than they did, using the other toothpaste! I had seen it before, but I would usually, buy the other one!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is really good.  I have been using it for a while now.  It is great for sensitive teeth.  I especially liked the opportunity to buy it in a multi-pack.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Arm and Hammer tooth paste.  A few years ago my teeth began to become sensitive to cold. This tootpaste fixed it.</li>
            <li> Gentle toothpaste, fresh breath. Something about the baking soda leaves your mouth and breath feeling fresh longer than the usual toothpaste. A dental hygienist told me it was because the baking soda changes the pH of your mouth. I&#x27;m not sure about her chemistry, but whatever the case, it works well!</li>
