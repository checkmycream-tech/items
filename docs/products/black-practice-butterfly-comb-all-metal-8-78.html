    <ol>
            <li>I got it on time and it looks awesome</li>
            <li>A good buy.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good to practice with.</li>
            <li>it fell apart eqsily bit its ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great for practice but it will break the first day if you use it a lot if it does its an easy fix with star tipped screwdrivers</li>
            <li>If you keep track of the screws and keep them tightened, it should be fine.  </li>
            <li>Really cool comb.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t underestimate how quickly the screws will fall out.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Not bad but not amazing, works for just flipping around, but not that great for combing your hair.</li>
            <li>Within the first 4 days of using it, it just broke apart like it was nothing.</li>
            <li>Within the first 2 days, the axle on the comb itself started to loosen up.</li>
            <li>Screws came off on the first day, parts went everywhere</li>
            <li>Fell apart first day do not buy</li>
            <li>I think it is because of how large the comb part is.</li>
            <li>Works like a real butterfly knife.  </li>
            <li>I thought if I spent a little more than the majority it would be better quality (metal comb instead of plastic).  </li>
            <li>Definitely looks cool.</li>
            <li>Take note that I am new to the tricking scene</li>
            <li>If you use this, the screws will fall out very frequently.  </li>
            <li>It was fun for the first few hours...</li>

            <li> It was fun for the first few hours...</li>
            <li> It completely broke apart in less than one day!</li>
            <li> screws are constantly loose,</li>
            <li> By the fourth day, the latch flew off and one of the bottom screws holding together the handle went missing.</li>
            <li> This was a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Gets a little loose but holds together</li>
            <li> After a few weeks it started to wiggle loosely.</li>
            <li> Right now, both axles are missing, the latch is missing and one of the handles are split rendering this comb useless.</li>
            <li> Comb is all metal and can hurt a little if you catch your fingers.</li>
            <li> Feel like I absolutely wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Broke within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and it is a bad quality</li>
            <li> Too bad it started falling apart within 2 days after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Terrible</li>

            <li> I got it on time and it looks awesome</li>
            <li> After a few weeks it started to wiggle loosely.</li>
            <li> It broke within 2 weeks. The pin came out.</li>
            <li> A good buy.  My son loves it.</li>
            <li> Terrible and it is a bad quality</li>
            <li> After a week of use the save handle became extreamly use, to the point were it is unusable, I tighten it about 2-3 times a day and it still manages to become loss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great for practice but it will break the first day if you use it a lot if it does its an easy fix with star tipped screwdrivers</li>
            <li> Definitely looks cool. I thought if I spent a little more than the majority it would be better quality (metal comb instead of plastic).  I bought one for my husband and one for my son. They were both unusable after 2 days!!!  Feel like I absolutely wasted my money.</li>
            <li> If you use this, the screws will fall out very frequently.  If you keep track of the screws and keep them tightened, it should be fine.  But don&#x27;t underestimate how quickly the screws will fall out.</li>
            <li> It was fun for the first few hours... It completely broke apart in less than one day! It really isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Broke almost instantly! DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Within the first 4 days of using it, it just broke apart like it was nothing. Take note that I am new to the tricking scene so I tend to drop it a bit trying to do a couple spins and throws. Within the first 2 days, the axle on the comb itself started to loosen up. By the fourth day, the latch flew off and one of the bottom screws holding together the handle went missing. Right now, both axles are missing, the latch is missing and one of the handles are split rendering this comb useless.</li>
            <li> Broke within a few weeks. This was a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> it fell apart eqsily bit its ok</li>
            <li> Really cool comb.  All metal and well-constructed.  Works like a real butterfly knife.  Comb is all metal and can hurt a little if you catch your fingers.</li>
            <li> Like the concept.  I went for the metal comb thinking it would last longer than a plastic comb. however, the kids opened it on Christmas morning.  One of them broke just after lunch.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s made out of metal and it&#x27;s good to practice with. Too bad it started falling apart within 2 days after I bought it.</li>
            <li> screws are constantly loose,</li>
            <li> Not bad but not amazing, works for just flipping around, but not that great for combing your hair. I think it is because of how large the comb part is.</li>
            <li> Screws came off on the first day, parts went everywhere and now it&#x27;s not operable...?!</li>
            <li> Fell apart first day do not buy</li>
            <li> Gets a little loose but holds together</li>
            <li> Fell apart within minutes</li>
