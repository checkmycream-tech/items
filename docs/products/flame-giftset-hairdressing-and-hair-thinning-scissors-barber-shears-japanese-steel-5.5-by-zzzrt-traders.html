            <li> so if your cutting alot they become uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> so i didnt want to purchase very expensive shears.</li>
            <li> and then they got stolen :(</li>

            <li> Was only able to use for about five days...after that you couldn&#x27;t cut paper if you wanted to..</li>

            <li> The case is very cute, especially the little gold accents on the edges. I love the scissors. They aren&#x27;t to heavy to hold very manageable and cuts well, the thinning shears was why I only gave it 4 stars. They grab at the hair, and to get them working you might have to loosen or tighten the screw, and add a little scissor oil. Other than that great product.</li>
            <li> thinners are dull scissors however are nice and sharp</li>

            <li> Both very sharp, easy to use.</li>
            <li> She is left handed didn&#x27;t pay attention when I got them but she said the work perfectly for right and left handed people</li>
            <li> I bought these to groom my two poodles. Cuts very quickly and hasn&#x27;t dulled yet. Bought a pair from somewhere else and was only able to use them one time. If these ever go dull I will reorder.</li>
            <li> They are ok starter shears but fell apart quickly</li>
