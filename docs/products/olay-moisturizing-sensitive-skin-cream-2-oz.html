            <li>Exactly what I ordered, works great for these winter months.</li>

            <li>Love to use it at bedtime for moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t make me itch.</li>
            <li>Its ok,.... I love it.</li>
            <li>Most creams make me break out or itch.  </li>
            <li>Thank you, Amazon, for making this available!</li>
            <li>Love this cream....</li>
            <li>It also helps the Nivea to spread a bit more easily.</li>
            <li>I especially love to use this product through the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>If you love olay and have sensitive skin or allergic reactions, this is great crème.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>My face feels very clean and light,</li>
            <li>Light, non-greasy; easily smooths into skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to see this formula back.</li>
            <li>It feels great the next day.</li>
            <li>This is a light moisturizer I like for summer time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s smooth, glides on well—not oily, and absorbs well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do enjoy how light the cream is on my skin.</li>
            <li>They sent me a coupon to get a free olay item</li>
            <li>and when I asked for my mothers advice on the best product to specifically told me Olay moisturizer for sensitive skin, and olay facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>and she was right!</li>
            <li>so effective for razor  burn and  for keeping the  wife&#x27;s skin soft and supple</li>
            <li>I typically spend a lot more on moisturizers, but bought this one the first time at a dollar store on the fly for an impromptu getaway.  </li>
            <li>olay, please never stop making this exact, fragrance free face cream.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a  long time.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON!!</li>
            <li>do appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my super sensitive skin which has rejected many &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li>and it is very moisturizing yet light on my face.</li>
            <li>also grateful that it really is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>So far both of my girls love it including my husband too.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and love this product.</li>
            <li>This is among the only 3 face creams that won&#x27;t cause a flare up on my face, and this is absolutely the best in terms of keeping my dry, flaky skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t experience too many hot days yet, but during those days I have found that this is the moisturizer I have reached for instead of my thicker sensitive SPF 15 version from Olay.</li>
            <li>Its is exactly the right balance.</li>
            <li>Winter was making my skin very dry and using this every night has made my skin nice and moist.</li>
            <li>but as always, I can count on Amazon to have low prices and free shipping!  </li>
            <li>It makes me kinda hot though but</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and soft, just like baby skin.</li>
            <li>Making a repeat order--larger than the first order.  </li>
            <li>Olay Moisturizing Sensitive Skin Cream doesn&#x27;t do either, light &amp; hydrating - leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li>The cream doesn&#x27;t have much smell.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t believe putting body lotion on their face.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely will recommend this to friends</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, and gets dry and irritated with most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have loyally used Oil Olay Sensitive Skin (night) moisturizer for over 7 years now (for some reason, the lighter sensitive skin day cream in the bottle doesn&#x27;t work as well with my skin).</li>
            <li>and to be honest ive never regularly used any facial moisturizer because my skin is so sensitive, and everything breaks my skin out into a rash or makes it burn, itch or tingle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that they are pretty much all the same - between Simple&#x27;s night cream or Neutrogena&#x27;s Light Night cream, and none of them irritate my face.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Truly for sensitive skin--NO fragrances!!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no smell to it, no burning if you have a rash or super dry skin.  </li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I purchase this for a neighbor lady who is 97 years old.</li>
            <li>skin so soft and no redness for rosacea sufferers</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this cream</li>
            <li>I ordered this cream because it was for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But when i got it i saw that it is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It irritated my skin eventhough it&#x27;s described as being for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I meant to order Olay Complete for sensitive skin with a SPF 15.</li>
            <li>My face is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>I seem to be on a rotating routine of sensitive skin night creams.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I have had to use regular Olay.</li>
            <li>I had to contact olay because I use olay complete and beauty fluid and neither have ever broke my face out</li>
            <li>This cream was very much the same, but with less of a chemical smell that the others have.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little heavy when I put it on but in the morning it soft and smooth</li>
            <li>So I have been looking for a face cream that is simple not many weird ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce and light plus scent free.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive middle aged skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have very sensitive middle aged skin</li>
            <li> The other two moisturizers were the Aveeno Ultra-Calming and Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive daily moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> At least I very much hope it&#x27;s the same.</li>
            <li> My face gets really dry and tight, and this lotion really helps.</li>
            <li> My skin, especially on my face, is very very dry, sensitive, and prone to allergic reactions due to eczema.</li>
            <li> Olay Sensitive Skin Cream gets harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and need the moisture without the perfume.  </li>
            <li> Winters tend to dry out there face</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry or greasy in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and can&#x27;t always tell the difference.</li>
            <li> She uses a small amount every day and could, in my opinion can pass for a young 60.</li>
            <li> This one made my face red and flaky within a half hour.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> So, I mix in a little German Nivea cream, and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> I literally, for the last few years, had my aunt from Canada send me boxes of the cream they would buy at the store there until I realized this year that I could just order it from Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It definitely took off the layer of dead skin.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my face feeling oily or sticky or powdery or wet in anyway.</li>
            <li> Its ingredients soothed my face and cleared-up irritation from the other two products.</li>
            <li> Sometimes that isn&#x27;t the case with other products.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this especially if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t need all those perfumes and fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t tried this as I inadverently ordered the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> I have two little girls</li>
            <li> and I do not like to layer my face with different creams because it gives my skin an oily appearance and it feels almost like my skin is suffocating.</li>
            <li> I also have had a hard time with finding moisturizer that doesnt clog my pores.</li>
            <li> At least for my allergy prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s not too thick</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that I can&#x27;t buy it in local stores anymore</li>
            <li> No scent, non irritating, non comedogenic, non greasy.</li>
            <li> I was so sad when they stopped selling it in stores in the US.</li>
            <li> I seldom use it in winter for not so cold days....</li>
            <li> Helps to hydrate my skin in cold, Wisconsin winters.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT have anything in it that stinks!  </li>
            <li> and there skin looks horribly uckky.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I like Olay products but this one in particular is very good for those of us who cannot tolerate scented creams.  I have very dry skin and it is very moisturizing yet light on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to see this formula back. At least I very much hope it&#x27;s the same. My skin is sensitive and I have had to use regular Olay. The results are not as good.  Thank you, Olay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I am 64 and have no visible wrinkles or crows feet on my face.  I am disappointed that I can&#x27;t buy it in local stores anymore but as always, I can count on Amazon to have low prices and free shipping!  THANKS AMAZON!!</li>

            <li> Its ok,.... I love it. It makes me kinda hot though but its good</li>
            <li> Love this cream! I have very sensitive middle aged skin and I&#x27;ve tried lots of creams &amp; they either break me out or leave a funky smell on my skin. Olay Moisturizing Sensitive Skin Cream doesn&#x27;t do either, light &amp; hydrating - leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; fresh! Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t have much smell. It feels great the next day. I put it on at night. It feels a little heavy when I put it on but in the morning it soft and smooth</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, and gets dry and irritated with most moisturizers. I purchased three different face moisturizers to see how they worked... side-by-side. This one made my face red and flaky within a half hour. The other two moisturizers were the Aveeno Ultra-Calming and Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive daily moisturizing cream. Only the Burt&#x27;s Bees moisturizer worked for me. Its ingredients soothed my face and cleared-up irritation from the other two products.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me in the winter. So, I mix in a little German Nivea cream, and it does the trick. It also helps the Nivea to spread a bit more easily. It&#x27;s perfect on its own in the summer, when my skin isn&#x27;t so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my super sensitive skin which has rejected many &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; products. Even the ones that are supposed to reduce redness turn my face bright red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also grateful that it really is fragrance free. Sometimes that isn&#x27;t the case with other products.</li>
            <li> This is a great mositurizer if you are hypoallegenic like I am.  Most creams make me break out or itch.  This one doesn&#x27;t..  I have dry skin and need the moisture without the perfume.  This works!!!</li>
            <li> skin so soft and no redness for rosacea sufferers</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer!!  You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this especially if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t need all those perfumes and fragrances.  You can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore.  Why do the manufacturers have to put perfume in everything?  Yuck!  This product does NOT have anything in it that stinks!  Thank you, Amazon, for making this available!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and price</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else after using this. No scent, non irritating, non comedogenic, non greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have sensitive skin and this cream doesn&#x27;t bother it at all. Winter was making my skin very dry and using this every night has made my skin nice and moist. I also like that it&#x27;s not too thick and it has no smell.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.... so effective for razor  burn and  for keeping the  wife&#x27;s skin soft and supple</li>
            <li> Excellent, great!. This is a light moisturizer I like for summer time. I seldom use it in winter for not so cold days....</li>
            <li> I have loyally used Oil Olay Sensitive Skin (night) moisturizer for over 7 years now (for some reason, the lighter sensitive skin day cream in the bottle doesn&#x27;t work as well with my skin). I was so sad when they stopped selling it in stores in the US. I literally, for the last few years, had my aunt from Canada send me boxes of the cream they would buy at the store there until I realized this year that I could just order it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful that Amazon has this product. My skin, especially on my face, is very very dry, sensitive, and prone to allergic reactions due to eczema. This is among the only 3 face creams that won&#x27;t cause a flare up on my face, and this is absolutely the best in terms of keeping my dry, flaky skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smooth, glides on well—not oily, and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil olay, please never stop making this exact, fragrance free face cream.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream because it was for sensitive skin. But when i got it i saw that it is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I thought i could replace my chamomile night Oil of Olay which I&#x27;ve been using for years with this. It irritated my skin eventhough it&#x27;s described as being for sensitive skin. Cancelled my subscribe and save order and am trying Cerave now.</li>
            <li> I especially love to use this product through the dry winter months. It is so soothing to put on before going to bed at night.</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent  and I can no longer find it locally.  I bought 5 jars,  just in case.  Local stores in Dallas only stock the one with sunscreen.  All sunscreens burn my eyes.  The moisturizer is very good.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t experience too many hot days yet, but during those days I have found that this is the moisturizer I have reached for instead of my thicker sensitive SPF 15 version from Olay. I think one of the downfalls of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have some type of SPF in it and I do not like to layer my face with different creams because it gives my skin an oily appearance and it feels almost like my skin is suffocating. I do enjoy how light the cream is on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. I think it does an excellent job with regulating the oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t tried this as I inadverently ordered the wrong product.  I meant to order Olay Complete for sensitive skin with a SPF 15.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful and light hydrating cream . i have very sensitive skin and this is perfect . no irritation</li>
            <li> I have two little girls and I really don&#x27;t believe putting body lotion on their face.  Winters tend to dry out there face and there skin looks horribly uckky.  So I have been looking for a face cream that is simple not many weird ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce and light plus scent free.  So far both of my girls love it including my husband too.  And the price is good.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered, works great for these winter months.</li>
            <li> This is the best face moisturizer ive ever used. My face is extremely sensitive. and to be honest ive never regularly used any facial moisturizer because my skin is so sensitive, and everything breaks my skin out into a rash or makes it burn, itch or tingle. I also have had a hard time with finding moisturizer that doesnt clog my pores. this moisturizer is perfect!it does not burn or itch or tingle on my face. My face feels very clean and light, like there is no gunk on it. It definitely took off the layer of dead skin.It does not leave my face feeling oily or sticky or powdery or wet in anyway. Its is exactly the right balance. My skin is so smooth and soft, just like baby skin. No joke.It looks like it might have evened my skin tone a bit. And ive only used this one time. My skin feels so wonderful. It hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a  long time. Not to mention before I used this product I also used Olay facial cleanser as well. Olay has never failed my mother or my great grandmother. and when I asked for my mothers advice on the best product to specifically told me Olay moisturizer for sensitive skin, and olay facial cleanser. and she was right! as she always is. lol. this is a wonderful product. I absolutely will recommend this to friends and im looking forward to seeing my results in a month from now. even sooner than that.</li>
            <li> I seem to be on a rotating routine of sensitive skin night creams.  I&#x27;ve found that they are pretty much all the same - between Simple&#x27;s night cream or Neutrogena&#x27;s Light Night cream, and none of them irritate my face.  This cream was very much the same, but with less of a chemical smell that the others have.  I like it and my skin isn&#x27;t irritated, so 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night cream after showering. My face gets really dry and tight, and this lotion really helps. It&#x27;s nice and light, and absorbs quickly. My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry or greasy in the morning.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can put on my face without break outs...Olay Sensitive Skin Cream gets harder and harder to find. I hope I NEVER have to use anything else!!! This is by far, my BEST FRIEND!!!</li>
            <li> I typically spend a lot more on moisturizers, but bought this one the first time at a dollar store on the fly for an impromptu getaway.  Turns out it is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve found for winter when my skin is drier!</li>
            <li> Excellent skin cream.  Light, non-greasy; easily smooths into skin.  Truly for sensitive skin--NO fragrances!! Making a repeat order--larger than the first order.  Helps to hydrate my skin in cold, Wisconsin winters.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is a great lightweight nighttime moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I had to contact olay because I use olay complete and beauty fluid and neither have ever broke my face out but this did. They sent me a coupon to get a free olay item but if you have any sensitivities to anything I wouldn&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> The only face cream on the market I&#x27;m not allergic to.  my farmers tan is almost gone after using this product</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and love this product. I also have sinus and allergy problems, so even those ones without perfumes, often have something in there that you can still smell. This one doesn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s great for morning or night under my makeup. I use their night cream in the day time sometimes too. I have dry skin and can&#x27;t always tell the difference.</li>
