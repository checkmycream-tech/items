            <li>This BB cream does a great job of covering imperfections and evening skin tone without covering my freckles.</li>

            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s perfect for my skin</li>
            <li>If your skin sounds like mine at all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, however I&#x27;m sure it works great for some!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it :)</li>
            <li>Great product! :)</li>
            <li>which is a good 25 min walk</li>
            <li>i LOVED it from day 1.</li>
            <li>Good coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel oily on my combination skin.</li>
            <li>Color isn&#x27;t good for fair complexions.</li>
            <li>It looks like mud on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>But it really is good stuff.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fair, and it worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>you have fair skin, I&#x27;d go with Holika Holika Petit BB cream.</li>
            <li>, It gives good coverage and good color corrections.</li>
            <li>Not for fair complected skin despite the fair formulation.</li>
            <li>Great coverage for a bb cream with a really nice finish.</li>
            <li>it looked just as good as my Estee&#x27; Lauder foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I am 40 with a family history of melanoma and still struggle with acne, this is a fairly good solution.</li>
            <li>So i have the SPF coverage AND my neck and chest look smooth and flawless too!  </li>
            <li>Great coverage and very smooth</li>
            <li>Blends great and stays on, eliminates most oil (not all-</li>
            <li>This is great for summertime because you won&#x27;t look like The Joker by mid-afternoon :-)  </li>
            <li>It looks great, feels light, and is good for my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin looked beautiful, smooth and matte with the cream on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for three weeks now, and I love how my skin looks!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Today I wore this BB cream all day at work, which was hot, &amp; at the end of shift it still looked awesome!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love that this product is a concealer and sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Perfect for when its hot out</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed</li>
            <li>otherwise the consistency was great and easy application with beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great for LIGHT coverage.</li>
            <li>coverage is just amazing</li>
            <li>It takes a light dusting of powder without caking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a great price.  </li>
            <li>But it goes on AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I honestly could have cried.</li>
            <li>but it would have been nice if it lived up to it&#x27;s advertisement.</li>
            <li>Then, I tried to exchange it and here is what Amazon&#x27;s site says when you go to return this:  &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I bought yesterday, but honestly didnÂ´t work,</li>
            <li>Nice medium coverage.</li>
            <li>It still kind of looks orangey</li>
            <li>Gives a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and evens color, but I don&#x27;t look like a clown.  </li>
            <li>This product may be doing more harm than good.</li>
            <li>I feel confident that my skin looks good, also.</li>
            <li>I received a tube of this bb cream from buzz agent in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>The coverage is really nice for a bb cream...</li>
            <li>I plan to make this my \\&quot;warm weather\\&quot; make-up, and I may end up making it my \\&quot;year &#x27;round\\&quot; make up.  </li>
            <li>Goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t make my face look cakey.</li>
            <li>The matte is nice for our humid weather.</li>
            <li>Nice for putting on additional make up, like powder blush or eye shadow.</li>
            <li>Color is perfect and leaves a matte finish, still don&#x27;t know about oil control during the whole day, I&#x27;m testing it</li>
            <li>My skin tone looks nice and even</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to have a makeup that helps with my oily face and also helps my skin improve over time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not drying and does a great job hiding any uneven-ness or redness without doing a full face coverage of foundation.</li>
            <li>Wearing any product on my face is supposed to make it look perfect and normal in any scenario, pictures included.</li>
            <li>Great price, Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I would love more color options to choose from for us that are fair or darker</li>
            <li>It blends very easily and leaves me truly matte all day.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident wearing it, so I will be sticking with this bb cream!</li>
            <li>I love (love!)</li>
            <li>When i started trying BB creams i wasn&#x27;t expecting to have any good results with brands on the cheap side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, this was by far the best product I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>This is magic to my face, in seconds my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I love that it has sunblock in it and the coverage is amazing.</li>
            <li>So if you have oily skin, BE SURE that you get the kind that is for oily skin).   </li>
            <li>the coloring wasn&#x27;t a complete perfect, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be&lt;</li>
            <li>GREAT BUY ADDS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF COLOR AND GOES ON JUST LIKE LOTION</li>
            <li>I was initially surprised by how runny this product is, but it blended into my skin perfectly and gave me a nice matte finish that still looks flawless three hours later - a record for me!  </li>
            <li>I loved the original Garnier BB.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many foundations and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>This BB cream is easy and fast to apply and the coverage is perfect for most days.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the creamier garnier BB cream and was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>It also goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>very light like I&#x27;m wearing nothing</li>
            <li>This is a VERY light coverage, which is all I want or need.  </li>
            <li>It blends easily and leaves a nice finish.</li>
            <li>I love this product because It goes on very smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bonus: the tube is huge!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT AND CHEAPER THEN</li>
            <li>I just love how this product applies on without being streaky or greasy and also not breaking me out.</li>
            <li>I  like to cover  them up (most just tell me they think I&#x27;m having a alergic reaction</li>
            <li>I love this product, I just wish they would make this in a fair/light option.</li>
            <li>to finish with the Pros, it helped my skin to recover from make up caused blackhead, my skin started to look better without make</li>
            <li>It just melted and i need make up that i dont have to retouch many times a day.</li>
            <li>It has lots of not so safe ingredients, i wanted to use a</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to wear it</li>
            <li>Eh it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>If they do create more options</li>
            <li>If they do create more options</li>
            <li>I decided to try this out because I love Garnier Products.</li>
            <li>and I do need to reapply at times, but for the most part, it does its job.</li>
            <li>Running errands or walking the dogs is what I mostly use it for.</li>
            <li>so for those with yellow undertones, this might not be the best match for you.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this product, is how it evens skin tone, without looking like caked on make up.</li>
            <li>I feel like it almost makes pimples/bumps more noticeable, because it evens out the rest of your skin so well.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>yes my skin look better than nothing, but now is looks like cracked</li>
            <li>Definitely love it</li>
            <li>The cream used to be more of a lotion consistency and now it&#x27;s runnier - more like a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After not using it for a week, the breakouts are mostly cleared up.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and love the coverage.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I made the exception.</li>
            <li>i love how it blends on my skin.</li>
            <li>Five stars for this! :)</li>
            <li>and I was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the price and the purchase.</li>
            <li>It works better than what I was using, but it still has some flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>coverage wears after around 4-5 hours, but still leaves an okay coverage</li>
            <li>I LOVE ITTTT</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>watery and more like a foundation than a bb cream.</li>
            <li>I, too, have very oily skin - great for not developing wrinkles, but many make-ups cause break-outs.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, my skin is moisturized but not greasy, and I feel like I&#x27;m not wearing much more than moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>and when i used it, i fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>it does an excellent job of evening out my skintone and controlling my gross, oily skin.</li>
            <li>But this stuff has helped my oily skin and mg pores do look better.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Looks great from a distance, but up close not so much.  </li>
            <li>Also, most foundations give me oily skin as the day progresses, but this stuff helps my skin stay non-oily.  </li>
            <li>It looks GREAT on, kept me pretty much oil free with a beautiful even toned look all day</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>many do.</li>
            <li>More liquid/lotion than cream.</li>
            <li>It is better than the foundation I was already using, but still my face gets all shiny during the day.</li>
            <li>love that is also has SPF 20</li>
            <li>My brither love this, he do makeup business peaples,, and he said all hes costumer love it,,</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, and this has been great for controlling shine.</li>
            <li>Contains octinoxate, a known hormone disrupting chemical used in many sunblocks.</li>
            <li>There are more out there of course; you just have to do some research on the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use moisturizers because most break me out</li>
            <li>love the size of this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the refreshing, cucumber-like scent and the fact that this product contains vitamin C because it works well with my vitamin C serum to brighten my skin.</li>
            <li>Thus, you get more acne medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, this has replaced my foundations for most days (though I use it as a primer under foundation on days</li>
            <li>I LOVE the refreshing, cucumber-like scent and the fact that this product contains vitamin C because it works well with my vitamin C serum to brighten my skin.</li>
            <li>Thus, you get more acne medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, this has replaced my foundations for most days (though I use it as a primer under foundation on days</li>
            <li>Most days, I skip the concealer and foundation and just apply this and a touch of bronzer.  </li>
            <li>I love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>Seems to brighten my face with a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a brush or sponge would work better.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this BB cream,first its size is bigger than others,the price is fair and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>Love this product, use it every day.</li>
            <li>i like it  :)  </li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>When I looked in the mirror after I got home, I was pleased to see that the BB cream was still in place.</li>
            <li>HG worthy product for sure!</li>
            <li>has pretty good coverage to hide my breakouts</li>
            <li>It goes on well, has pretty good coverage</li>
            <li>I had been using Estee Lauder BB cream and hoped this would be almost as good, but it&#x27;s pretty inferior.  </li>
            <li>So excited to find something that works for me!</li>
            <li>I love garnier products because whatever they claim is true and you can see the results in a week!</li>
            <li>The &#x27;light&#x27; skin color is more for tan people, so I won&#x27;t really be able to use it, as it makes me look orange.</li>
            <li>, the coverage is great and you can build it up, i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and have had great success using cleansing oils, and this creme has the right amount of oils to hydrate, give a dewy glow, but not clog my pores.</li>
            <li>Its very light and smooth on skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light and smooth going on and blends well.</li>
            <li>This offered nice coverage, the tint was good, and I was thrilled that I was getting sunscreen, which I would not normally wear.  </li>
            <li>Garnier OIL FREE bb cream seems to be the magic formula for my skin.</li>
            <li>This will stay in my makeup drawer until I find a better fit.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to look really oily through out the day and this keeps it looking good and lasts a quite a while.</li>
            <li>work good on skin say what it should do and did so thanks.</li>
            <li>However, I really need the \\&quot;fair</li>
            <li>This is a good product, I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I really recommend this one for having good coverage and minimizing oil.</li>
            <li>w/a light(ish) warm complexion, and the Light/Medium shade blends right in.</li>
            <li>How sad is this, because otherwise this is a very good cream, at a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>How sad is this, because otherwise this is a very good cream, at a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this pretty impulsively at Target, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>The oil control bb cream is much more watery compared to the original garnier bb cream.</li>
            <li>It also seems more \\&quot;makeup-y\\&quot; than the original</li>
            <li>Really not bad at all!</li>
            <li>I also have very mild rosacea and some redness on the cheeks because of that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin use to breakout easily, but with this BB cream I haven&#x27;t noticed any undesired reaction.</li>
            <li>With that said, it does come off easily</li>
            <li>and the reason I like BB creams is that they&#x27;re supposed to be foolproof and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It never seem to &#x27;set&#x27; and would just wipe off easily.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this BB cream basically to use as a sunscreen for my face, I figured it would make me oily and shiny and probably cause acne, because most sunscreens made specially for your face still make me break out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and much cheaper on here than it was at Kroger!</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product it was amazing with my oily skin</li>
            <li>The medium dark works best for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get 30 boxes of this cream in a New York Minute, because I loved everything, but the color palette.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get 30 boxes of this cream in a New York Minute, because I loved everything, but the color palette.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes off easily as well with light face washing, don&#x27;t need to scrub it off.</li>
            <li>Like the coverage but instead of minimizing the fine lines it accentuates them.</li>
            <li>this held up wonderfully and because i was lazy after i got home, i didnt wash my face and towards bedtime, my skin still looked smooth and even, as if i was wearing foundation!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for my light-colored skin, but if you&#x27;re truly a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; tone, this might be too pale.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super oil skin &amp; most BB creams &amp; foundations don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>I used to use this as a primer under my foundation (because this works as the best primer I have used in a long time), but now I feel confident just using this and a light amount of concealer because my skin has become that much</li>
            <li>I will continue to wear it as it has great coverage for my hyper pigmentation and does not break me out, but I do wish the necessary changes were made!</li>
            <li>Let me tell you one thing, I  have Smashbox BB cream and their tinted moisturizer, Oil free.</li>
            <li>The texture was silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to the oil free formulation since I&#x27;m prone to acne</li>
            <li>Its just a cheap watery product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t not like it was too runny and too light and too drying</li>
            <li>This is such a great bargain</li>
            <li>It looks like a foundation when youre wearing it, stays matte and shine free all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just use a light liquid foundation-</li>
            <li>but it was too light for me</li>
            <li>Light-medium was too light.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a oil free mate finish BB cream</li>
            <li>Too light in color as well.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price and more.</li>
            <li>I bought light 2</li>
            <li>to light\\&quot; instead of a \\&quot;light to medium\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It provide the light coverage I&#x27;m looking for, and I can tell it has improved my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It gives my face a smooth look.</li>
            <li>I still put my mineral foundation on top of this for complete coverage, but many of you may be able to use this alone.</li>
            <li>But overall the price is good, and it works like a bb cream for the most part.</li>
            <li>And i tried it right away :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I liked how it looked so much that I put it aside to use for special dress up occassions.  </li>
            <li>, bad.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really hoping that in time Garnier will create more options with more colors and better, more natural hues, we don&#x27;t have orange-colored faces.</li>
            <li>, bad.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really hoping that in time Garnier will create more options with more colors and better, more natural hues, we don&#x27;t have orange-colored faces.</li>
            <li>I first bought this and tried it because I had heard so much about BB cream and how good they are.  </li>
            <li>I run on my lunch break every day and wanted something quick and easy to apply after my shower.</li>
            <li>The product applies smoothly and feels great - with a little powder on top, my face feels matte and non-greasy for hours (basically a miracle for me).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that oily sheen on my face like the original formula did.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try, it is worth it!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect makeup to throw on when I don&#x27;t feel like doing my usual routine</li>
            <li>Ive tried so many bb cream even the original korean BB cream when it first came out</li>
            <li>I use the original formula Garnier BB cream with SPF15 and ordered this because it has SPF20, but this is nothing like the original formula.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and surprised.</li>
            <li>Some of the clean brands of BB creams are Juice, Tarte, Philosophy, and Stila.</li>
            <li>I love the new formula--it seems very watery right out of the tube, but has good coverage and after applying it feels silky/powdery.  </li>
            <li>I love everything else about it, but I won&#x27;t be able to wear it unless I get a major tan.</li>
            <li>i might keep a tube and use it for special occasions where i only need to look good for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I have pretty light skin, but this light to medium works well for me.</li>
            <li>I applied it in my bedroom where I thought I had good lighting, but obviously it wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li>I applied it in my bedroom where I thought I had good lighting, but obviously it wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li>Good for covering pimples and red areas after acid peels etc.</li>
            <li>and it is still full.</li>
            <li>In addition, I have experienced some dryness/flakiness along my hairline, along with a few fine bumps, which I have never had before.</li>
            <li>The color match is very close, it goes on great with my elf small stippling brush, and the coverage is nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there are really any skin benefits, but this is the kind of makeup you can put a little bit on your fingers and smear all over your face for the perfect light coverage, and the oily skin version stays relatively matte.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and easy to put on, it covers most discoloration without looking like i have something on, very natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I slap this on over a toner with a quick brush of blush and mascara</li>
            <li>My skin is super oily and I find that it does not oxidize and get orange-y as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>My skin gets SUPER oily through the day, not just on my T-zone but EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>My skin is super oily</li>
            <li>HG worthy product for sure!bout Neutrogena or Clinique).</li>
            <li>Finally a product for oily skin, this won&#x27;t be just a summer foundation either, I&#x27;ve got huge plans for it all day any day and every season,I just wish I was able to get my hands on it sooner but was never able to find it, If I can&#x27;t good ol amazon will sure have it! .</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me it does exactly what it says and it isn&#x27;t runny at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely impressed with this and am surprised the overall reviews aren&#x27;t much stronger on the plus side than they are.</li>
            <li>and it also provides great coverage for blemishes and dark circles.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take any longer to apply than my normal moisturizer and I love that.  </li>
            <li>It easily fills in large pores without having to scrub it into them.</li>
            <li>The Garnier BB cream for oily/combination does the job of keeping my T Zone matte, while also providing nice, easy to apply/blend coverage, without over drying the dry areas of my face</li>
            <li>I added extra cream on the areas that had blemishes and the covering was pretty good</li>
            <li>and then ai found this one and by far true to what this cream claims and more.</li>
            <li>it is oily, but you have dry skin , it is good for you.</li>
            <li>It is completely non greasy and soaks right into your skin very easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great affordable option if you have relatively decent skin and are looking for something to provide minimal coverage and a nice, natural, truly skin-like finish.</li>
            <li>My favorite BB cream so far!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first since i don&#x27;t usually buy my foundation at the drug store, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write product reviews, but this stuff is too good not to tell everyone!  </li>
            <li>Great texture, the cream it is indeed a little runny (storage it in an upright position, always)</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that has an oily T-zone after a few hours, so I thought this would be great.</li>
            <li>and my face is shine free, which is saying something because I really really struggle with oily skin.</li>
            <li>more natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>It blends in seconds and feels fresh and light, from all the BB creams I have tried, this texture was the lightest and easier to apply, just a pea-size amount covers my whole face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use foundation anymore for casual days, the color matchs perfect to me, and it keeps me oil free all day.</li>
            <li>but I love this one so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close, but no cigar and that is kind of a big deal for foundation.</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for a better BB cream but in the meantime, this works and I can&#x27;t really complain too much about the cons.</li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>The texture was runnier than expected but it dries to a nice smooth matte finish.</li>
            <li>The color is good but the product is thinner than I expected.  </li>
            <li>this one just wasn&#x27;t worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>I feels nice on my skin, and didn&#x27;t look cakey on my face, which is a constant problem with BB creme.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely cover all of my post acne marks, but it does make my face look so much better with it on.</li>
            <li>I usually write good reviews, I&#x27;m pretty easily pleased, but for some reason this just didn&#x27;t catch with me.</li>
            <li>I t does have a more natural look and it feels lighter than foundation</li>
            <li>normally wear Bare Minerals in Golden Fair and</li>
            <li>BB cream is supposed to be thick like the original formula which worked great</li>
            <li>Has more of a tint than other bb creams I&#x27;ve used, which I love.</li>
            <li>Love this product, use it as my &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; and it works really well for those that don&#x27;t want to cake on the liquid makeup but want some coverage with a decent SPF.</li>
            <li>And when I washed my face in the evening I found I was right.  </li>
            <li>I put it on right after getting out of the shower and let it set in for 10 min before applying foundation to my T-zone.  </li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m not super impressed.</li>
            <li>Also, unlike most acne makeup, this contains 2% salicylic acid vs. the 0.5% generally found in complexion saving makeup.</li>
            <li>Also, unlike most acne makeup, this contains 2% salicylic acid vs. the 0.5% generally found in complexion saving makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite fair skinned, so when I purchased this, it was too dark for me.  </li>
            <li>I an fair skinned and the light/medium was too dark.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a bit too dark for my fair skin, but I prefer it this way (instead of looking like a gost).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a little more tan, so I use a bit more of this into my mix of creams now.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin with pink undertones, red hair and a face full of light freckles...</li>
            <li>I rarely use two coats because one coat is generally enough to cover most of my blemishes, but you can use two without breaking the bank because you basically get 4Xs</li>
            <li>First the colors are extremely light, even going for a shade darker than normal.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised that It made my face seem pore-less a nd smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have very very very oily skin</li>
            <li>Leaves skin very smooth and covers some red areas that I have.</li>
            <li>I like the BB creams, the give little coverage, but add all the good stuff to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now THIS is what i expected when I first started hearing raves about \\&quot;BB Cream.\\&quot;  MUCH better than the original or \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Garnier BB Cream formula.  </li>
            <li>After using the original Garnier BB the new Combination to Oily Skin product is like using water on my face.  </li>
            <li>I been looking for a good BB cream for many many months, until I found this one, I have tried other over the counter brands and all of them had greasy, thick textures with ashy, grayish hues for the color.</li>
            <li>Coverage is pretty good, but wish it was a little thicker.</li>
            <li>At first I had just assumed it was the lighting change that made my skin tone appear darker, but I realize now that it is the product.</li>
            <li>Yea okay after suffering from white heads and skin break outs, just too creamy for me.</li>
            <li>I put some primer on first and powder after and that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li>Refill of a product I was currently using; appears authentic vs store bought product.</li>
            <li>my face look really shine!</li>
            <li>So, I got this a while ago at my local drug store and I have been holding onto the receipt and box just to make sure that this would work for me.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty oily</li>
            <li>I think FTC and FDA will be interested in this as well.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, it broke me out.  </li>
            <li>and it also provides a light and natural coverage.</li>
            <li>The first time I opened it</li>
            <li>so this is pretty much a first impression.</li>
            <li>I dont have to worry  any more about how I look at mid day</li>
            <li>but I wanted a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>This is a first impression as I just got this and needed to try it out.</li>
            <li>The shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li>and my skin instantly looked 100 times better.</li>
            <li>This is my first BB cream.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to see that at the end of the day I didn&#x27;t look like \\&quot;orange\\&quot; (my makeup sometimes looks orange if my skin is extra oily.)  </li>
            <li>I tried this on a whim, and I really like it!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, I think my skin might just be improving overall, now that I&#x27;ve been using this product.  </li>
            <li>Be sure you order the one for oily skin as there is a regular one, also.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wears pretty well, too.</li>
            <li>far as the shade goes, instead of light/medium, I&#x27;d call this LIGHT.</li>
            <li>However, for what I use it for, as a quick alternative to my normal routine, it does the job.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great for most of the year when my face has a touch of color to it, but currently in the dead of winter, I needed something with a little more color.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin with pink under tones, and I bought the Light/Medium shade and it does everything it offers on my skin.</li>
            <li>I rated this item very high because with the right skin tone, this works very well, and doesn&#x27;t create a cakelike appearance</li>
            <li>One tip I have, LESS IS MORE!</li>
            <li>one positive is that I don&#x27;t get too shiny by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply, and then lightly dust my T zone with some bare minerals mineral veil.</li>
            <li>(for the Medium-Deep Oil Free BB Cream), holy smokes, I wanted to cry, I been using it for months and never realized how orange it was until i saw myself under natural light at noon, outside.</li>
            <li>(for the Medium-Deep Oil Free BB Cream), holy smokes, I wanted to cry, I been using it for months and never realized how orange it was until i saw myself under natural light at noon, outside.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and I was worried that this might make me break out, however, I really haven&#x27;t had any problems!</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I put on way too much</li>
            <li>, I have to do some major blending magic to make it look like I don&#x27;t have a super tan face and a white neck/body.  </li>
            <li>and I have not gotten a new blemish since I started using this two weeks ago (which is bizarre because I have tried Neutrogena clear-skin makeup and clinique acne-free makeup with no success and more blemishes).</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed, I took it off, put on less, and now it looks better!</li>
            <li>Regular bb creams leave me even more oily than I normally am.</li>
            <li>So this week I decided to stop using it for a couple days and noticed that my forehead is not as oily or dry any more.</li>
            <li>It covers the red easily plus absorbs oil.  </li>
            <li>I have strong yellow under tones</li>
            <li>I have never used a BB cream that covers blemishes entirely, particularly large blemishes, but I will say that this covers 80-90% of my small black-heads, enlarged pours, light hyper-pigmentation and most of my faded, post-acne marks.</li>
            <li>There is no question that it makes my skin look smoother, hides large pores.</li>
            <li>Once I put on the cream it has an cooling feeling which is nice and keeps my oily skin under control (and I mean super oily).</li>
            <li>The light medium was too light (I&#x27;m a NC30 in Mac), but nothing a little bronzer couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>This is a great cc cream makeup but a little sheer for what I needed.  </li>
            <li>It is very nice and matte finish, which is very hard for me to find in a foundation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also given me back 10 minutes in the morning, which any working woman will know is HUGE.</li>
            <li>Second, the fabulous texture is gone, now it is a runny liquid.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Gives a much better cover than I expected for a bb cream.</li>
            <li>This product contains propylene glycol which is very harmful for the skin, causes breakouts expecially.</li>
            <li>because I was breaking out so much at the beginning.</li>
            <li>and I had to pat my skin with oil absorbing sheets</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This product gave me acne and is very runny.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t really control oil very well.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>I like the color and the coverage is better than expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>and this really helped.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li>I really Like this product</li>
            <li>and it really highlighted my freckles rather than mute them.  </li>
            <li>The cream is very runny -</li>
            <li>I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>very oily skin  </li>
            <li>Only one I will use anymore, light and does not make my face breakout.</li>
            <li>Clogs up in your pores very noticably.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of acne and freckles, and this covers them very well.</li>
            <li>Very forgiving for imperfect skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rather watery formula as opposed to a viscous cream, which I happen to like; the consistency I feel really suits my combination skin.</li>
            <li>i dont always have time to get ready.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like wearing foundation though, so</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>I did really like except</li>
            <li>and they ALL made my skin very oily.</li>
            <li>It just makes you slimy and oilier really.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have hundreds of dollars to spend figuring out which ones don&#x27;t cause my skin to yell at me, but this alone moisturizes my skin as much as it needs to each morning</li>
            <li>I really want to sparkle and shine).</li>
            <li>I really want to sparkle and shine).</li>
            <li>Within 3 hours your face will look really shiny/oily.</li>
            <li>(Not totally acne free</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It works really well in controlling oil and perfecting your skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash off your hands very well either so you have to use a sponge.</li>
            <li>, let&#x27;s be real, here.</li>
            <li>It covers nicely without being heavy.</li>
            <li>Most concealers I have tried always seem to make my face worse over time, but not BB cream :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I live in a sunny,  hot and humidity weather</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but with this product I had to!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still looking for more coverage and a little higher SPF since I work in the sun.</li>
            <li>Better at oil control than almost any other lotion with a spf that I have tried.</li>
            <li>It has more coverage than I expected (yay!)</li>
            <li>, I expected to be really gross and shiny when I finally looked in a mirror, but I was shine free and sunburn free, and after a week of wearing this, still acne free.</li>
            <li>This one for combination/oily skin offers great coverage, but its still &#x27;thin&#x27; and light enough that I can also put it all over my neck and chest area.</li>
            <li>So far I really like it!</li>
            <li>It is a little too dark for my skin tone right now, so I wish they had a lighter color, but the product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I live in Michigan, and after a long winter with barely any sun, I am truly &amp;#34;light skinned.&amp;#34; If I hit the tanning bed for a few weeks, then this would be a good match, however with my light skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several BB creams that supposedly work for oily skin but they always left me even more shiny than I started out.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m older than you&#x27;d think!)&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>This matches up to my skin tone better than any other foundation because it&#x27;s pretty sheer, but somehow covers up redness really well.  </li>
            <li>Besides this issue and the mess that occurs from the product being squeezed out, I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the very first one that actually matches my skin color.</li>
            <li>If I have a small acne cyst that is red, raised and inflamed, then no, this will not cover it completely, but it greatly reduces the amount of concealer that</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the high ratings for this stuff.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin and really did not expect this to work, but so far, I really love it and haven&#x27;t even used any other make up.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that is very prone to breaking out.  </li>
            <li>After washing my face tonight my skin feels softer than normal.</li>
            <li>Not only do I have a TON left, it really doesn&#x27;t take much for my skin to look smooth, even and natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thinner than normal foundation.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is worth your time and money if you&#x27;re in the market for a Bb cream.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin looking fresh with just enough shine to appear a bit dewy (which you can cover with powder if you prefer).</li>
            <li>im not crazy into wearing a lot of makeup, because i actually workout</li>
            <li>(I broke out like crazy at some point, due to a surfeit of stress not the BB Cream) and goes on smooth and really blends beautifully.</li>
            <li>The price point is right on the low end</li>
            <li>I rarely have the time, especially during the busy part of the week, to apply foundation and all!</li>
            <li>This is made fir light people who are extremely oily</li>
            <li>also, i think it&#x27;s important to share my review for the benefit of other women, because we, customers, need unbiased reviews rather than subsidized \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; by magazines and blogs who get advertising money from a lot of the brands they \\&quot;review.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>But I regret spending $50 dollars, when really all I needed to spend was less than 20, that product is a god send, at least for me and my oily skin, definitly my new best friend, I never developed oily spots on my forehead cheeks the creases between my nose</li>
            <li>Looked forward to the new formula for combo and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Will be looking for a new product.</li>
            <li>I have been using the new Garnier BB Cream combo/oily skin light/med for a week now.</li>
            <li>I am Latina, my skin is eternally tanned, with yellow warm undertones, during summer I tan easily into a golden brown and during winter I get a little pale, but always maintaining some yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>Color match is fine--because this is is such a sheer product (i.e. minimal/light coverage), I believe that each of the 2 available shades would \\&quot;match&#x27; quite a variety of skin tones.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and have not had any problems using this product.</li>
            <li>Instead of the thick, lotion like texture of the other one, this one has a thin, watery texture that sets to a near perfect matte finish that mostly stays put.</li>
            <li>The light medium is too dark for me, I always find myself orange if i wear this product alone.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be the same except for the higher SPF20.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m simultaneously very impressed and disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li>Well my skin was shinny and oily feeling (more so than usual)</li>
            <li>It stays supple and fresh all day long with caking at all (something I cannot say about Neutrogena or Clinique).</li>
            <li>ive only just got this, so this is just a first impression.  </li>
            <li>Last night I went to a concert with some friends and got rather hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li>The cream really settled into my lines and actually made me look older.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to take this down onto my neck (indication of just how light a coverage to expect).</li>
            <li>While the formulation is thinner (more fluid) and less moisturizing than the original, I find it harder to apply evenly because it&#x27;s too runny.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this one, thanks to Pinterest, but it looked ghastly on me--chalky white,</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any new breakouts yet, so I have very high hopes that this might be the product I&#x27;ve waited for my entire life.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this because I thought it would give all the benefits of a BB minus some of the intense moisture, but the extra effort makes it kind of pointless.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t live up to the original Garnier BB which was thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li>, this is a little more sheer and natural-looking, if you want your face like a plastic mask, then buy a foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightweight, doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, hardly need anything else on top.</li>
            <li>This is not concealer or foundation, so do not except complete coverage, this is a little more sheer and natural-looking, if you want your face like a plastic mask, then buy a foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think because it is such a smooth/light/silky formula, it has a hard time covering any kind of bumps.</li>
            <li>so do not except complete coverage</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and my skin broke out after using it.</li>
            <li>so you should test it on your skin before using if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Her skin looks natural, but perfected with it.  </li>
            <li>and it gives my face a natural look and helps to prevent shiny skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have professional make up on</li>
            <li>(*NOTE, I have used the regular version of this product, the one that doesn&#x27;t specifically say for oily skin, and that version leaves your skin very oily.</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>Wow - within a week I was covered in breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the color much lighter (medium)</li>
            <li>It provides coverage and moisture and leaves my skin feeling soft and not over caked.</li>
            <li>This is a complete deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li>In my opinion though, that means absolutely nothing as everybody&#x27;s skin and body chemistry is so different.</li>
            <li>and it does look really natural.</li>
            <li>The key is to use a foundation brush ( I recommend Real Techniques), it makes all the difference.</li>
            <li>Toting my normal bare minerals foundation around wasn&#x27;t practical</li>
            <li>I took my son to the park, stood in the sun for a couple hours and got completely sweaty</li>
            <li>With or without the extra water, it&#x27;s very streaky and takes a lot of blending to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;  What is with this?&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying more expensive brands because I didn&#x27;t think a drugstore brand would be worth bothering with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and I love the product.</li>
            <li>The first few days or using I broke out mildly, but I think it was because I had just tried something different on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have pale skin and light/medium was the lightest color available.</li>
            <li>My skin looked moisturized and never tight, greasy or cakey, the texture looked quite natural and beautiful.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>My skin looked moisturized and never tight, greasy or cakey, the texture looked quite natural and beautiful.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was the sunscreen in it that did it, but I returned it today back to Walmart, and hope my face returns to normal soon!</li>
            <li>Sounds odd but its true.</li>
            <li>It provides only slightly less coverage than traditional foundations, so if you want a more unison look, then two coats is what you need.</li>
            <li>I had my evening College classes canceled, that being said I had an 2 hours to kill, so I spent it walking on a mildly hot day exerting myself quite a bit by making a trek to the near by mall.</li>
            <li>Finally no more shiny t zone, feels so much better then regular foundation.</li>
            <li>And no, I do not typically break out.</li>
            <li>In the past I have worn a mattifier underneath my foundation, in addition to powder, so I was hoping this all in one product would make my makeup routine more simple for the upcoming summer months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very pale, either.</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for a bb cream and or foundation to fight my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday, whether it&#x27;s for a full makeup application or just a quickie coverage.</li>
            <li>and this stuff offers enough coverage to hide blemishes and lighten freckles giving you a smooth clean complexion without looking fake</li>
            <li>I was actually going makeup-less most of the time, which was hard 1.</li>
            <li>I generally use light/medium cream/foundation, but my face appears darker with this cream--I don&#x27;t usually use the fairest option in makeup, but I wish there were a lighter one available for this.</li>
            <li>I have a very red complexion (not rosacea, just red) plus very oily skin</li>
            <li>I found it dried rather quickly to a satiny finish</li>
            <li>My only minor complaint would be that by the end of the day my forehead does look a little oily, but to be fair, I have a really oily t-zone and summertime doesn&#x27;t help matters.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t believe the shine even on my dry skin!  </li>
            <li>and even being a little on the dry side, this bb cream is still just fine for me, not TOO matte.</li>
            <li>I feel really bad by not giving this a better rating, but after my experience I had to share my thoughts, specially for Latina women out there.</li>
            <li>I am now a daily Pro-Activ user and also steam my face every day and it stays mostly clear.</li>
            <li>I can barely feel it on my face.</li>
            <li>The product goes on fingers very Watery so Be careful.</li>
            <li>and really like it except that the coverage is minimal.  </li>
            <li>The product was really watery which results in slipping and sliding of the cream if no powder is applied.</li>
            <li>However, these things so far are not enough to make me toss the BB cream to the side.  </li>
            <li>It fits my skin very well, not so thick but still covers very well!</li>
            <li>However if not careful this product can get cakey, so applying in thin layers and gradually putting more on is the preferred method.</li>
            <li>Most creams contain chemicals but some are worse than others.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about this product since i hadn&#x27;t done much research (outside of a quick glance at Amazon comparing this and one other while I was standing in Target.)</li>
            <li>Initiallly, I obviously thought it was decent but the 2nd bottle I bought seemed different somehow, like it was reformulated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other BB creams that you just swipe on in 20 seconds and you&#x27;re ready to go-</li>
            <li>Much lighter than other light/medium toned bb creams</li>
            <li>the original bb cream from Garnier seemed way too thick for that.</li>
            <li>The coverage is sheer to begin with, but I had no trouble blending and layering enough product to produce an even, \\&quot;medium\\&quot; coverage.  </li>
            <li>I do have combination to oily skin and this cream does not dry my face out or make it oily</li>
            <li>the product due to the packages large size versus a traditional foundation.</li>
            <li>Now, several months later l, my face (forehead mostly) is not only very oily but really dry as well.</li>
            <li>I hate going without make-up due to the unevenness in my skin, so this is the perfect go- to BB cream for the gym or even the beach!</li>
            <li>It works really well in the summer when my skin tends to be a little oilier in spots.</li>
            <li>This product is not super expensive, but it&#x27;s also not incredibly cheap, but you get good results for your money!</li>

            <li> If your skin sounds like mine at all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, however I&#x27;m sure it works great for some!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it :)</li>
            <li> Great product! :)</li>
            <li> which is a good 25 min walk</li>
            <li> i LOVED it from day 1.</li>
            <li> Good coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel oily on my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Color isn&#x27;t good for fair complexions.</li>
            <li> It looks like mud on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> But it really is good stuff.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s fair, and it worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> you have fair skin, I&#x27;d go with Holika Holika Petit BB cream.</li>
            <li> , It gives good coverage and good color corrections.</li>
            <li> Not for fair complected skin despite the fair formulation.</li>
            <li> Great coverage for a bb cream with a really nice finish.</li>
            <li> it looked just as good as my Estee&#x27; Lauder foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I am 40 with a family history of melanoma and still struggle with acne, this is a fairly good solution.</li>
            <li> So i have the SPF coverage AND my neck and chest look smooth and flawless too!  </li>
            <li> Great coverage and very smooth</li>
            <li> Blends great and stays on, eliminates most oil (not all-</li>
            <li> This is great for summertime because you won&#x27;t look like The Joker by mid-afternoon :-)  </li>
            <li> It looks great, feels light, and is good for my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looked beautiful, smooth and matte with the cream on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for three weeks now, and I love how my skin looks!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Today I wore this BB cream all day at work, which was hot, &amp; at the end of shift it still looked awesome!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love that this product is a concealer and sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for when its hot out</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed</li>
            <li> otherwise the consistency was great and easy application with beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great for LIGHT coverage.</li>
            <li> coverage is just amazing</li>
            <li> It takes a light dusting of powder without caking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a great price.  </li>
            <li> But it goes on AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> I honestly could have cried.</li>
            <li> but it would have been nice if it lived up to it&#x27;s advertisement.</li>
            <li> Then, I tried to exchange it and here is what Amazon&#x27;s site says when you go to return this:  &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I bought yesterday, but honestly didnÂ´t work,</li>
            <li> Nice medium coverage.</li>
            <li> It still kind of looks orangey</li>
            <li> Gives a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and evens color, but I don&#x27;t look like a clown.  </li>
            <li> This product may be doing more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I feel confident that my skin looks good, also.</li>
            <li> I received a tube of this bb cream from buzz agent in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> The coverage is really nice for a bb cream...</li>
            <li> I plan to make this my \\&quot;warm weather\\&quot; make-up, and I may end up making it my \\&quot;year &#x27;round\\&quot; make up.  </li>
            <li> Goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t make my face look cakey.</li>
            <li> The matte is nice for our humid weather.</li>
            <li> Nice for putting on additional make up, like powder blush or eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Color is perfect and leaves a matte finish, still don&#x27;t know about oil control during the whole day, I&#x27;m testing it</li>
            <li> My skin tone looks nice and even</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have a makeup that helps with my oily face and also helps my skin improve over time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying and does a great job hiding any uneven-ness or redness without doing a full face coverage of foundation.</li>
            <li> Wearing any product on my face is supposed to make it look perfect and normal in any scenario, pictures included.</li>
            <li> Great price, Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I would love more color options to choose from for us that are fair or darker</li>
            <li> It blends very easily and leaves me truly matte all day.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident wearing it, so I will be sticking with this bb cream!</li>
            <li> I love (love!)</li>
            <li> When i started trying BB creams i wasn&#x27;t expecting to have any good results with brands on the cheap side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this was by far the best product I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> This is magic to my face, in seconds my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I love that it has sunblock in it and the coverage is amazing.</li>
            <li> So if you have oily skin, BE SURE that you get the kind that is for oily skin).   </li>
            <li> the coloring wasn&#x27;t a complete perfect, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be&lt;</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY ADDS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF COLOR AND GOES ON JUST LIKE LOTION</li>
            <li> I was initially surprised by how runny this product is, but it blended into my skin perfectly and gave me a nice matte finish that still looks flawless three hours later - a record for me!  </li>
            <li> I loved the original Garnier BB.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many foundations and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> This BB cream is easy and fast to apply and the coverage is perfect for most days.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the creamier garnier BB cream and was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> It also goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> very light like I&#x27;m wearing nothing</li>
            <li> This is a VERY light coverage, which is all I want or need.  </li>
            <li> It blends easily and leaves a nice finish.</li>
            <li> I love this product because It goes on very smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus: the tube is huge!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT AND CHEAPER THEN</li>
            <li> I just love how this product applies on without being streaky or greasy and also not breaking me out.</li>
            <li> I  like to cover  them up (most just tell me they think I&#x27;m having a alergic reaction</li>
            <li> I love this product, I just wish they would make this in a fair/light option.</li>
            <li> to finish with the Pros, it helped my skin to recover from make up caused blackhead, my skin started to look better without make</li>
            <li> It just melted and i need make up that i dont have to retouch many times a day.</li>
            <li> It has lots of not so safe ingredients, i wanted to use a</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to wear it</li>
            <li> Eh it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> If they do create more options</li>
            <li> If they do create more options</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out because I love Garnier Products.</li>
            <li> and I do need to reapply at times, but for the most part, it does its job.</li>
            <li> Running errands or walking the dogs is what I mostly use it for.</li>
            <li> so for those with yellow undertones, this might not be the best match for you.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product, is how it evens skin tone, without looking like caked on make up.</li>
            <li> I feel like it almost makes pimples/bumps more noticeable, because it evens out the rest of your skin so well.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> yes my skin look better than nothing, but now is looks like cracked</li>
            <li> Definitely love it</li>
            <li> The cream used to be more of a lotion consistency and now it&#x27;s runnier - more like a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After not using it for a week, the breakouts are mostly cleared up.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and love the coverage.</li>
            <li> but I am so glad I made the exception.</li>
            <li> i love how it blends on my skin.</li>
            <li> Five stars for this! :)</li>
            <li> and I was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the price and the purchase.</li>
            <li> It works better than what I was using, but it still has some flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> coverage wears after around 4-5 hours, but still leaves an okay coverage</li>
            <li> I LOVE ITTTT</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> watery and more like a foundation than a bb cream.</li>
            <li> I, too, have very oily skin - great for not developing wrinkles, but many make-ups cause break-outs.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even, my skin is moisturized but not greasy, and I feel like I&#x27;m not wearing much more than moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and when i used it, i fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> it does an excellent job of evening out my skintone and controlling my gross, oily skin.</li>
            <li> But this stuff has helped my oily skin and mg pores do look better.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Looks great from a distance, but up close not so much.  </li>
            <li> Also, most foundations give me oily skin as the day progresses, but this stuff helps my skin stay non-oily.  </li>
            <li> It looks GREAT on, kept me pretty much oil free with a beautiful even toned look all day</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> many do.</li>
            <li> More liquid/lotion than cream.</li>
            <li> It is better than the foundation I was already using, but still my face gets all shiny during the day.</li>
            <li> love that is also has SPF 20</li>
            <li> My brither love this, he do makeup business peaples,, and he said all hes costumer love it,,</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, and this has been great for controlling shine.</li>
            <li> Contains octinoxate, a known hormone disrupting chemical used in many sunblocks.</li>
            <li> There are more out there of course; you just have to do some research on the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use moisturizers because most break me out</li>
            <li> love the size of this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the refreshing, cucumber-like scent and the fact that this product contains vitamin C because it works well with my vitamin C serum to brighten my skin.</li>
            <li> Thus, you get more acne medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, this has replaced my foundations for most days (though I use it as a primer under foundation on days</li>

            <li> Thus, you get more acne medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, this has replaced my foundations for most days (though I use it as a primer under foundation on days</li>
            <li> Most days, I skip the concealer and foundation and just apply this and a touch of bronzer.  </li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> Seems to brighten my face with a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a brush or sponge would work better.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this BB cream,first its size is bigger than others,the price is fair and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it every day.</li>
            <li> i like it  :)  </li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> When I looked in the mirror after I got home, I was pleased to see that the BB cream was still in place.</li>
            <li> HG worthy product for sure!</li>
            <li> has pretty good coverage to hide my breakouts</li>
            <li> It goes on well, has pretty good coverage</li>
            <li> I had been using Estee Lauder BB cream and hoped this would be almost as good, but it&#x27;s pretty inferior.  </li>
            <li> So excited to find something that works for me!</li>
            <li> I love garnier products because whatever they claim is true and you can see the results in a week!</li>
            <li> The &#x27;light&#x27; skin color is more for tan people, so I won&#x27;t really be able to use it, as it makes me look orange.</li>
            <li> , the coverage is great and you can build it up, i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have had great success using cleansing oils, and this creme has the right amount of oils to hydrate, give a dewy glow, but not clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Its very light and smooth on skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very light and smooth going on and blends well.</li>
            <li> This offered nice coverage, the tint was good, and I was thrilled that I was getting sunscreen, which I would not normally wear.  </li>
            <li> Garnier OIL FREE bb cream seems to be the magic formula for my skin.</li>
            <li> This will stay in my makeup drawer until I find a better fit.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to look really oily through out the day and this keeps it looking good and lasts a quite a while.</li>
            <li> work good on skin say what it should do and did so thanks.</li>
            <li> However, I really need the \\&quot;fair</li>
            <li> This is a good product, I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I really recommend this one for having good coverage and minimizing oil.</li>
            <li> w/a light(ish) warm complexion, and the Light/Medium shade blends right in.</li>
            <li> How sad is this, because otherwise this is a very good cream, at a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> How sad is this, because otherwise this is a very good cream, at a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this pretty impulsively at Target, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> The oil control bb cream is much more watery compared to the original garnier bb cream.</li>
            <li> It also seems more \\&quot;makeup-y\\&quot; than the original</li>
            <li> Really not bad at all!</li>
            <li> I also have very mild rosacea and some redness on the cheeks because of that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin use to breakout easily, but with this BB cream I haven&#x27;t noticed any undesired reaction.</li>
            <li> With that said, it does come off easily</li>
            <li> and the reason I like BB creams is that they&#x27;re supposed to be foolproof and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It never seem to &#x27;set&#x27; and would just wipe off easily.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this BB cream basically to use as a sunscreen for my face, I figured it would make me oily and shiny and probably cause acne, because most sunscreens made specially for your face still make me break out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and much cheaper on here than it was at Kroger!</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product it was amazing with my oily skin</li>
            <li> The medium dark works best for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get 30 boxes of this cream in a New York Minute, because I loved everything, but the color palette.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get 30 boxes of this cream in a New York Minute, because I loved everything, but the color palette.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes off easily as well with light face washing, don&#x27;t need to scrub it off.</li>
            <li> Like the coverage but instead of minimizing the fine lines it accentuates them.</li>
            <li> this held up wonderfully and because i was lazy after i got home, i didnt wash my face and towards bedtime, my skin still looked smooth and even, as if i was wearing foundation!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for my light-colored skin, but if you&#x27;re truly a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; tone, this might be too pale.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have super oil skin &amp; most BB creams &amp; foundations don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I used to use this as a primer under my foundation (because this works as the best primer I have used in a long time), but now I feel confident just using this and a light amount of concealer because my skin has become that much</li>
            <li> I will continue to wear it as it has great coverage for my hyper pigmentation and does not break me out, but I do wish the necessary changes were made!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you one thing, I  have Smashbox BB cream and their tinted moisturizer, Oil free.</li>
            <li> The texture was silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to the oil free formulation since I&#x27;m prone to acne</li>
            <li> Its just a cheap watery product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t not like it was too runny and too light and too drying</li>
            <li> This is such a great bargain</li>
            <li> It looks like a foundation when youre wearing it, stays matte and shine free all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just use a light liquid foundation-</li>
            <li> but it was too light for me</li>
            <li> Light-medium was too light.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a oil free mate finish BB cream</li>
            <li> Too light in color as well.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price and more.</li>
            <li> I bought light 2</li>
            <li> to light\\&quot; instead of a \\&quot;light to medium\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It provide the light coverage I&#x27;m looking for, and I can tell it has improved my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It gives my face a smooth look.</li>
            <li> I still put my mineral foundation on top of this for complete coverage, but many of you may be able to use this alone.</li>
            <li> But overall the price is good, and it works like a bb cream for the most part.</li>
            <li> And i tried it right away :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I liked how it looked so much that I put it aside to use for special dress up occassions.  </li>
            <li> , bad.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really hoping that in time Garnier will create more options with more colors and better, more natural hues, we don&#x27;t have orange-colored faces.</li>

            <li> I first bought this and tried it because I had heard so much about BB cream and how good they are.  </li>
            <li> I run on my lunch break every day and wanted something quick and easy to apply after my shower.</li>
            <li> The product applies smoothly and feels great - with a little powder on top, my face feels matte and non-greasy for hours (basically a miracle for me).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that oily sheen on my face like the original formula did.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try, it is worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect makeup to throw on when I don&#x27;t feel like doing my usual routine</li>
            <li> Ive tried so many bb cream even the original korean BB cream when it first came out</li>
            <li> I use the original formula Garnier BB cream with SPF15 and ordered this because it has SPF20, but this is nothing like the original formula.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased and surprised.</li>
            <li> Some of the clean brands of BB creams are Juice, Tarte, Philosophy, and Stila.</li>
            <li> I love the new formula--it seems very watery right out of the tube, but has good coverage and after applying it feels silky/powdery.  </li>
            <li> I love everything else about it, but I won&#x27;t be able to wear it unless I get a major tan.</li>
            <li> i might keep a tube and use it for special occasions where i only need to look good for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I have pretty light skin, but this light to medium works well for me.</li>
            <li> I applied it in my bedroom where I thought I had good lighting, but obviously it wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li> I applied it in my bedroom where I thought I had good lighting, but obviously it wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li> Good for covering pimples and red areas after acid peels etc.</li>
            <li> and it is still full.</li>
            <li> In addition, I have experienced some dryness/flakiness along my hairline, along with a few fine bumps, which I have never had before.</li>
            <li> The color match is very close, it goes on great with my elf small stippling brush, and the coverage is nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there are really any skin benefits, but this is the kind of makeup you can put a little bit on your fingers and smear all over your face for the perfect light coverage, and the oily skin version stays relatively matte.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight and easy to put on, it covers most discoloration without looking like i have something on, very natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I slap this on over a toner with a quick brush of blush and mascara</li>
            <li> My skin is super oily and I find that it does not oxidize and get orange-y as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> My skin gets SUPER oily through the day, not just on my T-zone but EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> My skin is super oily</li>
            <li> HG worthy product for sure!bout Neutrogena or Clinique).</li>
            <li> Finally a product for oily skin, this won&#x27;t be just a summer foundation either, I&#x27;ve got huge plans for it all day any day and every season,I just wish I was able to get my hands on it sooner but was never able to find it, If I can&#x27;t good ol amazon will sure have it! .</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me it does exactly what it says and it isn&#x27;t runny at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely impressed with this and am surprised the overall reviews aren&#x27;t much stronger on the plus side than they are.</li>
            <li> and it also provides great coverage for blemishes and dark circles.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take any longer to apply than my normal moisturizer and I love that.  </li>
            <li> It easily fills in large pores without having to scrub it into them.</li>
            <li> The Garnier BB cream for oily/combination does the job of keeping my T Zone matte, while also providing nice, easy to apply/blend coverage, without over drying the dry areas of my face</li>
            <li> I added extra cream on the areas that had blemishes and the covering was pretty good</li>
            <li> and then ai found this one and by far true to what this cream claims and more.</li>
            <li> it is oily, but you have dry skin , it is good for you.</li>
            <li> It is completely non greasy and soaks right into your skin very easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great affordable option if you have relatively decent skin and are looking for something to provide minimal coverage and a nice, natural, truly skin-like finish.</li>
            <li> My favorite BB cream so far!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first since i don&#x27;t usually buy my foundation at the drug store, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write product reviews, but this stuff is too good not to tell everyone!  </li>
            <li> Great texture, the cream it is indeed a little runny (storage it in an upright position, always)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that has an oily T-zone after a few hours, so I thought this would be great.</li>
            <li> and my face is shine free, which is saying something because I really really struggle with oily skin.</li>
            <li> more natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It blends in seconds and feels fresh and light, from all the BB creams I have tried, this texture was the lightest and easier to apply, just a pea-size amount covers my whole face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use foundation anymore for casual days, the color matchs perfect to me, and it keeps me oil free all day.</li>
            <li> but I love this one so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close, but no cigar and that is kind of a big deal for foundation.</li>
            <li> I will keep looking for a better BB cream but in the meantime, this works and I can&#x27;t really complain too much about the cons.</li>
            <li> Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li> The texture was runnier than expected but it dries to a nice smooth matte finish.</li>
            <li> The color is good but the product is thinner than I expected.  </li>
            <li> this one just wasn&#x27;t worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> I feels nice on my skin, and didn&#x27;t look cakey on my face, which is a constant problem with BB creme.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely cover all of my post acne marks, but it does make my face look so much better with it on.</li>
            <li> I usually write good reviews, I&#x27;m pretty easily pleased, but for some reason this just didn&#x27;t catch with me.</li>
            <li> I t does have a more natural look and it feels lighter than foundation</li>
            <li> normally wear Bare Minerals in Golden Fair and</li>
            <li> BB cream is supposed to be thick like the original formula which worked great</li>
            <li> Has more of a tint than other bb creams I&#x27;ve used, which I love.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it as my &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; and it works really well for those that don&#x27;t want to cake on the liquid makeup but want some coverage with a decent SPF.</li>
            <li> And when I washed my face in the evening I found I was right.  </li>
            <li> I put it on right after getting out of the shower and let it set in for 10 min before applying foundation to my T-zone.  </li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m not super impressed.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike most acne makeup, this contains 2% salicylic acid vs. the 0.5% generally found in complexion saving makeup.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike most acne makeup, this contains 2% salicylic acid vs. the 0.5% generally found in complexion saving makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite fair skinned, so when I purchased this, it was too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> I an fair skinned and the light/medium was too dark.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bit too dark for my fair skin, but I prefer it this way (instead of looking like a gost).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a little more tan, so I use a bit more of this into my mix of creams now.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin with pink undertones, red hair and a face full of light freckles...</li>
            <li> I rarely use two coats because one coat is generally enough to cover most of my blemishes, but you can use two without breaking the bank because you basically get 4Xs</li>
            <li> First the colors are extremely light, even going for a shade darker than normal.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised that It made my face seem pore-less a nd smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have very very very oily skin</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very smooth and covers some red areas that I have.</li>
            <li> I like the BB creams, the give little coverage, but add all the good stuff to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now THIS is what i expected when I first started hearing raves about \\&quot;BB Cream.\\&quot;  MUCH better than the original or \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Garnier BB Cream formula.  </li>
            <li> After using the original Garnier BB the new Combination to Oily Skin product is like using water on my face.  </li>
            <li> I been looking for a good BB cream for many many months, until I found this one, I have tried other over the counter brands and all of them had greasy, thick textures with ashy, grayish hues for the color.</li>
            <li> Coverage is pretty good, but wish it was a little thicker.</li>
            <li> At first I had just assumed it was the lighting change that made my skin tone appear darker, but I realize now that it is the product.</li>
            <li> Yea okay after suffering from white heads and skin break outs, just too creamy for me.</li>
            <li> I put some primer on first and powder after and that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> Refill of a product I was currently using; appears authentic vs store bought product.</li>
            <li> my face look really shine!</li>
            <li> So, I got this a while ago at my local drug store and I have been holding onto the receipt and box just to make sure that this would work for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty oily</li>
            <li> I think FTC and FDA will be interested in this as well.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, it broke me out.  </li>
            <li> and it also provides a light and natural coverage.</li>
            <li> The first time I opened it</li>
            <li> so this is pretty much a first impression.</li>
            <li> I dont have to worry  any more about how I look at mid day</li>
            <li> but I wanted a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> This is a first impression as I just got this and needed to try it out.</li>
            <li> The shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li> and my skin instantly looked 100 times better.</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cream.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to see that at the end of the day I didn&#x27;t look like \\&quot;orange\\&quot; (my makeup sometimes looks orange if my skin is extra oily.)  </li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim, and I really like it!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, I think my skin might just be improving overall, now that I&#x27;ve been using this product.  </li>
            <li> Be sure you order the one for oily skin as there is a regular one, also.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wears pretty well, too.</li>
            <li> far as the shade goes, instead of light/medium, I&#x27;d call this LIGHT.</li>
            <li> However, for what I use it for, as a quick alternative to my normal routine, it does the job.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great for most of the year when my face has a touch of color to it, but currently in the dead of winter, I needed something with a little more color.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin with pink under tones, and I bought the Light/Medium shade and it does everything it offers on my skin.</li>
            <li> I rated this item very high because with the right skin tone, this works very well, and doesn&#x27;t create a cakelike appearance</li>
            <li> One tip I have, LESS IS MORE!</li>
            <li> one positive is that I don&#x27;t get too shiny by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply, and then lightly dust my T zone with some bare minerals mineral veil.</li>
            <li> (for the Medium-Deep Oil Free BB Cream), holy smokes, I wanted to cry, I been using it for months and never realized how orange it was until i saw myself under natural light at noon, outside.</li>
            <li> (for the Medium-Deep Oil Free BB Cream), holy smokes, I wanted to cry, I been using it for months and never realized how orange it was until i saw myself under natural light at noon, outside.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and I was worried that this might make me break out, however, I really haven&#x27;t had any problems!</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I put on way too much</li>
            <li> , I have to do some major blending magic to make it look like I don&#x27;t have a super tan face and a white neck/body.  </li>
            <li> and I have not gotten a new blemish since I started using this two weeks ago (which is bizarre because I have tried Neutrogena clear-skin makeup and clinique acne-free makeup with no success and more blemishes).</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed, I took it off, put on less, and now it looks better!</li>
            <li> Regular bb creams leave me even more oily than I normally am.</li>
            <li> So this week I decided to stop using it for a couple days and noticed that my forehead is not as oily or dry any more.</li>
            <li> It covers the red easily plus absorbs oil.  </li>
            <li> I have strong yellow under tones</li>
            <li> I have never used a BB cream that covers blemishes entirely, particularly large blemishes, but I will say that this covers 80-90% of my small black-heads, enlarged pours, light hyper-pigmentation and most of my faded, post-acne marks.</li>
            <li> There is no question that it makes my skin look smoother, hides large pores.</li>
            <li> Once I put on the cream it has an cooling feeling which is nice and keeps my oily skin under control (and I mean super oily).</li>
            <li> The light medium was too light (I&#x27;m a NC30 in Mac), but nothing a little bronzer couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> This is a great cc cream makeup but a little sheer for what I needed.  </li>
            <li> It is very nice and matte finish, which is very hard for me to find in a foundation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also given me back 10 minutes in the morning, which any working woman will know is HUGE.</li>
            <li> Second, the fabulous texture is gone, now it is a runny liquid.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Gives a much better cover than I expected for a bb cream.</li>
            <li> This product contains propylene glycol which is very harmful for the skin, causes breakouts expecially.</li>
            <li> because I was breaking out so much at the beginning.</li>
            <li> and I had to pat my skin with oil absorbing sheets</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This product gave me acne and is very runny.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t really control oil very well.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> I like the color and the coverage is better than expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> and this really helped.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li> I really Like this product</li>
            <li> and it really highlighted my freckles rather than mute them.  </li>
            <li> The cream is very runny -</li>
            <li> I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> very oily skin  </li>
            <li> Only one I will use anymore, light and does not make my face breakout.</li>
            <li> Clogs up in your pores very noticably.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of acne and freckles, and this covers them very well.</li>
            <li> Very forgiving for imperfect skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rather watery formula as opposed to a viscous cream, which I happen to like; the consistency I feel really suits my combination skin.</li>
            <li> i dont always have time to get ready.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like wearing foundation though, so</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> I did really like except</li>
            <li> and they ALL made my skin very oily.</li>
            <li> It just makes you slimy and oilier really.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have hundreds of dollars to spend figuring out which ones don&#x27;t cause my skin to yell at me, but this alone moisturizes my skin as much as it needs to each morning</li>
            <li> I really want to sparkle and shine).</li>
            <li> I really want to sparkle and shine).</li>
            <li> Within 3 hours your face will look really shiny/oily.</li>
            <li> (Not totally acne free</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It works really well in controlling oil and perfecting your skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wash off your hands very well either so you have to use a sponge.</li>
            <li> , let&#x27;s be real, here.</li>
            <li> It covers nicely without being heavy.</li>
            <li> Most concealers I have tried always seem to make my face worse over time, but not BB cream :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I live in a sunny,  hot and humidity weather</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but with this product I had to!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still looking for more coverage and a little higher SPF since I work in the sun.</li>
            <li> Better at oil control than almost any other lotion with a spf that I have tried.</li>
            <li> It has more coverage than I expected (yay!)</li>
            <li> , I expected to be really gross and shiny when I finally looked in a mirror, but I was shine free and sunburn free, and after a week of wearing this, still acne free.</li>
            <li> This one for combination/oily skin offers great coverage, but its still &#x27;thin&#x27; and light enough that I can also put it all over my neck and chest area.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it!</li>
            <li> It is a little too dark for my skin tone right now, so I wish they had a lighter color, but the product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I live in Michigan, and after a long winter with barely any sun, I am truly &amp;#34;light skinned.&amp;#34; If I hit the tanning bed for a few weeks, then this would be a good match, however with my light skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several BB creams that supposedly work for oily skin but they always left me even more shiny than I started out.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m older than you&#x27;d think!)&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> This matches up to my skin tone better than any other foundation because it&#x27;s pretty sheer, but somehow covers up redness really well.  </li>
            <li> Besides this issue and the mess that occurs from the product being squeezed out, I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the very first one that actually matches my skin color.</li>
            <li> If I have a small acne cyst that is red, raised and inflamed, then no, this will not cover it completely, but it greatly reduces the amount of concealer that</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the high ratings for this stuff.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin and really did not expect this to work, but so far, I really love it and haven&#x27;t even used any other make up.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is very prone to breaking out.  </li>
            <li> After washing my face tonight my skin feels softer than normal.</li>
            <li> Not only do I have a TON left, it really doesn&#x27;t take much for my skin to look smooth, even and natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thinner than normal foundation.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is worth your time and money if you&#x27;re in the market for a Bb cream.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin looking fresh with just enough shine to appear a bit dewy (which you can cover with powder if you prefer).</li>
            <li> im not crazy into wearing a lot of makeup, because i actually workout</li>
            <li> (I broke out like crazy at some point, due to a surfeit of stress not the BB Cream) and goes on smooth and really blends beautifully.</li>
            <li> The price point is right on the low end</li>
            <li> I rarely have the time, especially during the busy part of the week, to apply foundation and all!</li>
            <li> This is made fir light people who are extremely oily</li>
            <li> also, i think it&#x27;s important to share my review for the benefit of other women, because we, customers, need unbiased reviews rather than subsidized \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; by magazines and blogs who get advertising money from a lot of the brands they \\&quot;review.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> But I regret spending $50 dollars, when really all I needed to spend was less than 20, that product is a god send, at least for me and my oily skin, definitly my new best friend, I never developed oily spots on my forehead cheeks the creases between my nose</li>
            <li> Looked forward to the new formula for combo and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Will be looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the new Garnier BB Cream combo/oily skin light/med for a week now.</li>
            <li> I am Latina, my skin is eternally tanned, with yellow warm undertones, during summer I tan easily into a golden brown and during winter I get a little pale, but always maintaining some yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> Color match is fine--because this is is such a sheer product (i.e. minimal/light coverage), I believe that each of the 2 available shades would \\&quot;match&#x27; quite a variety of skin tones.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and have not had any problems using this product.</li>
            <li> Instead of the thick, lotion like texture of the other one, this one has a thin, watery texture that sets to a near perfect matte finish that mostly stays put.</li>
            <li> The light medium is too dark for me, I always find myself orange if i wear this product alone.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be the same except for the higher SPF20.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m simultaneously very impressed and disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Well my skin was shinny and oily feeling (more so than usual)</li>
            <li> It stays supple and fresh all day long with caking at all (something I cannot say about Neutrogena or Clinique).</li>
            <li> ive only just got this, so this is just a first impression.  </li>
            <li> Last night I went to a concert with some friends and got rather hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li> The cream really settled into my lines and actually made me look older.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to take this down onto my neck (indication of just how light a coverage to expect).</li>
            <li> While the formulation is thinner (more fluid) and less moisturizing than the original, I find it harder to apply evenly because it&#x27;s too runny.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this one, thanks to Pinterest, but it looked ghastly on me--chalky white,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any new breakouts yet, so I have very high hopes that this might be the product I&#x27;ve waited for my entire life.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this because I thought it would give all the benefits of a BB minus some of the intense moisture, but the extra effort makes it kind of pointless.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t live up to the original Garnier BB which was thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> , this is a little more sheer and natural-looking, if you want your face like a plastic mask, then buy a foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lightweight, doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, hardly need anything else on top.</li>
            <li> This is not concealer or foundation, so do not except complete coverage, this is a little more sheer and natural-looking, if you want your face like a plastic mask, then buy a foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think because it is such a smooth/light/silky formula, it has a hard time covering any kind of bumps.</li>
            <li> so do not except complete coverage</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and my skin broke out after using it.</li>
            <li> so you should test it on your skin before using if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Her skin looks natural, but perfected with it.  </li>
            <li> and it gives my face a natural look and helps to prevent shiny skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have professional make up on</li>
            <li> (*NOTE, I have used the regular version of this product, the one that doesn&#x27;t specifically say for oily skin, and that version leaves your skin very oily.</li>
            <li> Not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Wow - within a week I was covered in breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the color much lighter (medium)</li>
            <li> It provides coverage and moisture and leaves my skin feeling soft and not over caked.</li>
            <li> This is a complete deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> In my opinion though, that means absolutely nothing as everybody&#x27;s skin and body chemistry is so different.</li>
            <li> and it does look really natural.</li>
            <li> The key is to use a foundation brush ( I recommend Real Techniques), it makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> Toting my normal bare minerals foundation around wasn&#x27;t practical</li>
            <li> I took my son to the park, stood in the sun for a couple hours and got completely sweaty</li>
            <li> With or without the extra water, it&#x27;s very streaky and takes a lot of blending to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;  What is with this?&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying more expensive brands because I didn&#x27;t think a drugstore brand would be worth bothering with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and I love the product.</li>
            <li> The first few days or using I broke out mildly, but I think it was because I had just tried something different on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and light/medium was the lightest color available.</li>
            <li> My skin looked moisturized and never tight, greasy or cakey, the texture looked quite natural and beautiful.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> My skin looked moisturized and never tight, greasy or cakey, the texture looked quite natural and beautiful.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the sunscreen in it that did it, but I returned it today back to Walmart, and hope my face returns to normal soon!</li>
            <li> Sounds odd but its true.</li>
            <li> It provides only slightly less coverage than traditional foundations, so if you want a more unison look, then two coats is what you need.</li>
            <li> I had my evening College classes canceled, that being said I had an 2 hours to kill, so I spent it walking on a mildly hot day exerting myself quite a bit by making a trek to the near by mall.</li>
            <li> Finally no more shiny t zone, feels so much better then regular foundation.</li>
            <li> And no, I do not typically break out.</li>
            <li> In the past I have worn a mattifier underneath my foundation, in addition to powder, so I was hoping this all in one product would make my makeup routine more simple for the upcoming summer months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very pale, either.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a bb cream and or foundation to fight my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, whether it&#x27;s for a full makeup application or just a quickie coverage.</li>
            <li> and this stuff offers enough coverage to hide blemishes and lighten freckles giving you a smooth clean complexion without looking fake</li>
            <li> I was actually going makeup-less most of the time, which was hard 1.</li>
            <li> I generally use light/medium cream/foundation, but my face appears darker with this cream--I don&#x27;t usually use the fairest option in makeup, but I wish there were a lighter one available for this.</li>
            <li> I have a very red complexion (not rosacea, just red) plus very oily skin</li>
            <li> I found it dried rather quickly to a satiny finish</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint would be that by the end of the day my forehead does look a little oily, but to be fair, I have a really oily t-zone and summertime doesn&#x27;t help matters.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t believe the shine even on my dry skin!  </li>
            <li> and even being a little on the dry side, this bb cream is still just fine for me, not TOO matte.</li>
            <li> I feel really bad by not giving this a better rating, but after my experience I had to share my thoughts, specially for Latina women out there.</li>
            <li> I am now a daily Pro-Activ user and also steam my face every day and it stays mostly clear.</li>
            <li> I can barely feel it on my face.</li>
            <li> The product goes on fingers very Watery so Be careful.</li>
            <li> and really like it except that the coverage is minimal.  </li>
            <li> The product was really watery which results in slipping and sliding of the cream if no powder is applied.</li>
            <li> However, these things so far are not enough to make me toss the BB cream to the side.  </li>
            <li> It fits my skin very well, not so thick but still covers very well!</li>
            <li> However if not careful this product can get cakey, so applying in thin layers and gradually putting more on is the preferred method.</li>
            <li> Most creams contain chemicals but some are worse than others.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about this product since i hadn&#x27;t done much research (outside of a quick glance at Amazon comparing this and one other while I was standing in Target.)</li>
            <li> Initiallly, I obviously thought it was decent but the 2nd bottle I bought seemed different somehow, like it was reformulated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other BB creams that you just swipe on in 20 seconds and you&#x27;re ready to go-</li>
            <li> Much lighter than other light/medium toned bb creams</li>
            <li> the original bb cream from Garnier seemed way too thick for that.</li>
            <li> The coverage is sheer to begin with, but I had no trouble blending and layering enough product to produce an even, \\&quot;medium\\&quot; coverage.  </li>
            <li> I do have combination to oily skin and this cream does not dry my face out or make it oily</li>
            <li> the product due to the packages large size versus a traditional foundation.</li>
            <li> Now, several months later l, my face (forehead mostly) is not only very oily but really dry as well.</li>
            <li> I hate going without make-up due to the unevenness in my skin, so this is the perfect go- to BB cream for the gym or even the beach!</li>
            <li> It works really well in the summer when my skin tends to be a little oilier in spots.</li>
            <li> This product is not super expensive, but it&#x27;s also not incredibly cheap, but you get good results for your money!</li>
            <li> (No gorgeous olive skin here, closer to sunglass worthy.)</li>
            <li> I actually bought a 2nd one, so I can have plenty.&lt;br /&gt;Havent been using it long enough to experience any break outs, but I wouldnt anticipate any.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a causal relationship, but I&#x27;ll certainly embrace the correlation.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend that much on make up</li>
            <li> Also it is very messy/watery, the cream oozes out of the cap and gets every where!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would work well for anyone who has remotely dry skin, but if you have oily skin, you should definitely try it!</li>
            <li> After only using a few days, I noticed how clear my skin and even my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great base layer for the everyday, I just need a bit of coverage and some bare minerals</li>
            <li> Third, the package is the same price for less product now only 2 ounces.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the same bottle daily for almost a year and there is still about half left.</li>
            <li> ( I have normal to dry skin, with the occasional monthly &#x27;hormonal&#x27; break out, usually around my chin and lower jawline area.)  </li>
            <li> I have had skin cancer in the past and have always had to use sunscreen under my make up and then use a foundation with a decent SPF.</li>
            <li> This definitely gives that, but I find it very dry and</li>
            <li> well the texture is very liquid, recomendation put the container up side down, otherwise you will make a mess after opened.</li>
            <li> After wearing the cream all day, my skin felt softer and any pimples looked dry and flat</li>
            <li> It has medium coverage, but it did cover my rosacea and any little spider veins I had, they did show faintly, but way better than having them so red and notorious.</li>
            <li> I uses this everyday when Im not in the mood of putting a makeup on because this looks natural.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long</li>
            <li> And this also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> with the cap not completely screwed on, so that the foundation managed to leak out and into the box, which was also smashed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this the whole summer, because I wanted something a little lighter that I could wear everyday and not feel like my face was melting off.</li>
            <li> I can reserve my expensive Shiseido foundation for nights out and photographs! :)</li>
            <li> I have young kids at home and little time for a careful makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I left it open for 5 days to get some of the water to evaporate and that helped a little.  </li>
            <li> Another strike against it is that it has a definite orange/tan undertone, whereas my skin has a very pink undertone.</li>
            <li> occasionally dry</li>
            <li> I have dry combination and oily in my t-zone and this does the job.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it has sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin (may dry it out a bit?)</li>
            <li> I have an oily t zone and my cheeks are sometimes dry.</li>
            <li> I have blotchy red skin, and this goes on very evenly, covering the blotchiness with just a thin layer.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I am getting decent coverage without using a thick foundation.  </li>
            <li> I normally wear a \\&quot;high end\\&quot; foundation, but I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on a product I may not like, so I picked up this much less expensive product at my local drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I tried to cover it up with powder in my proper shade but the weird chalkiness shone right through.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is how dark the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is.</li>
            <li> I felt pretty ripped off by how poor the quality was.</li>
            <li> &quot; the BB cream with loose powder, and</li>
            <li> However, it is a little messy because its very liqiudy unlike other thicker BB creams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because the cream looks nice and dries into a matte finish, but the beauty aspect is not worth the damaging properties of the chemicals within the cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically review makeup products since they work differently for everyone, but I thought I would create one for this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time, so I&#x27;m not sure how its claims of skin treatment will work out</li>
            <li> I have tried several BB creams and end up not using them because my T Zone is shiny in a matter of half hour.</li>
            <li> If you need a product containing sunblock, opt for the ones which only contain titanium dioxide and zinc oxide which are much less harmful.</li>
            <li> I use less than a dime size on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> But for the past week, I have totally replaced my regular makeup with this stuff!</li>
            <li> It seems to moisturize and provide a little coverage that is not obvious.</li>
            <li> I still need to do a little blotting by mid day, but I don&#x27;t think that this bb cream contributes to the oil at all.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day, and reapplying powder to cover up the oil, I began to feel little spots on my face that were itchy and turning red.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is super-duper oily like mine, after several hours you&#x27;re going to be a little shiny</li>
            <li> This kept my skin from looking like an oil slick by the end of the day and had enough coverage to hide minor imperfections without looking caked on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different BB creams (including the pricy department store variety) and never saw what all the hype is about.</li>
            <li> but i go over with a wet sponge</li>
            <li> Unlike the MK Foundation that would have my face looking oily after just a few hours, this BB Cream I can wear all day and not have an oily face for almost the entire day!</li>
            <li> I expected it to be creamier.  </li>
            <li> When I take the cap off I have to be careful to hold the tube perpendicular to the floor</li>
            <li> my skin oily after a few hrs even with powder on top&lt;br /&gt;bad lasting power</li>
            <li> I only use a few drops of it every day, so I have a feeling</li>
            <li> so I tried hers before I spent my money.  </li>
            <li> I tried BB creams on a whim and all the other products I tried out seemed to be extremely runny with limited coverage.</li>
            <li> I had tried the original Garnier BB cream when it first came out at the urging of a friend, but it left my oily skin feeling absolutely disgusting within half an hour.</li>
            <li> The product still does what it should do, but is a bit of a disappointment versus the original.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot attest to its other qualities.</li>
            <li> I have been on Tazorac for 6 months and at the beginning my skin was super dry and flaky and it was hard to find a light foundation that didn&#x27;t look horrible with the state my skin as in.</li>
            <li> It did control the extreme oiliness I have, but not all day, after a couple of hours it started looking shiny</li>
            <li> Well I never tried any other bb cream</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is my t-zone it usually oily by midday when I wear this, so I have to re-powder to stay matte.</li>
            <li> (ie, if you hug someone, or brush your face against something) a bit will come off, so be careful!  </li>
            <li> They changed the formula for this product in the recent past.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with other BB creams causing break outs, not this one.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of other choices.  </li>
            <li> This BB cream was extremely cakey and it streaked.</li>
            <li> , I am acne prone, but I don&#x27;t feel the BB cream is making it any worse than normal.)  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin - the tone is uneven from acne scars, my T zone is ALWAYS oily and sometimes my cheeks and chin are so dry</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m very pale, and I&#x27;m finding that the light/medium shade is a bit too dark for me (especially in winter)</li>
            <li> This is honestly one of the worst things I have bought in a long time.  </li>
            <li> The color is just too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I tend to get three zits a week (on average)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is not worth buying; and I&#x27;ll never buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, and I had read some good reviews, but this was terrible for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider him myself a person with a dark skin, its slightly tan &amp; rosey.  </li>
            <li> Covers my uneven skin tone due to acne scarring and covers my imperfections.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount of this product to cover your face.</li>
            <li> I typically purchase this at the store.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this keeps my face even and significantly less oily all day, without being drying.</li>
            <li> I used it for almost half a year.</li>
            <li> Plus the bottle is .5 ounces less.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s a little too dark--</li>
            <li> I had already tried the darker shade and it was way too dark (and a little orange).</li>
            <li> But it did sometimes make my combination skin a little shiney.  </li>
            <li> A little powder or some blotting</li>
            <li> but I need a little coverage for my age speckled skin.  </li>
            <li> i used this for giving my skin a little evening out, before going to the gym,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Out of the tube, it seems strangely thin, so be warned: a little goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> A few of hours after put it on</li>
            <li> And actually was not great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> because I was so used to wearing heavy makeup and 2.</li>
            <li> They have a few kinds, and I like the clearing \\&quot;formula\\&quot; for winter, when I&#x27;m the palest.</li>
            <li> I got this product a few weeks ago, and have been using it every day since.  </li>
            <li> This one is also messy- the tube has a screw-off cap and the cream starts dripping out before you even squeeze the tube.</li>
            <li> My skin does not feel oily nor heavily made up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, having acne-prone skin I felt all day like all my sweat and oils were actually trapped underneath</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a heavy foundation</li>
            <li> a friend of mine recommended Garnier BB cream, so i gave it a try after disastrous experiences with other western brands (i avoid asian brands because of animal testing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I was worried I was too pale for this.  </li>
            <li> The SPF reflects and makes your skin look pale.</li>
            <li> I switched to another brand after using this crap for two days and my skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li> (very small of course due to a genetic disorder that has caused a rash like bumpy layer on my cheeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn; I love how it feels and while it doesn&#x27;t look BAD, I know I would benefit from a lighter/pinker shade, which sadly doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li> I found that it made the problems of combination skin (oily and dry) worse.</li>
            <li> I use very little but still find I need to use a matifying oil control product in addition to this.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is 100% cruelty</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and am usually oily within thirty minutes after applying anything to my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again until they change it to a pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I have an oil slick for a face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few BB creams and this is one of my least favorites.</li>
            <li> , I usually have to end up using a sponge to even it</li>
            <li> i chose the lightest shade bc that is usually what fits me</li>
            <li> If I can&#x27;t take pictures without my face looking white in comparison to the rest of my body, it is useless.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I will say it did control shine well, but it made my skin feel dry and tight (which is crazy since it is usually so oily!)</li>
            <li> but its hard to find</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who struggles with oily, hard to manage skin.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to work with because it&#x27;s so runny.  </li>
            <li> This stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> I broke out horribly from the oil free version.</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a total disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It is really messy, its is thin and leaks into the cap, which then leaks everywhere.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a thick paste on my face.</li>
            <li> Having oily skin and trying other BB and CC creams, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> maybe slightly gray, kinda creepy.</li>
            <li> I have used loreal bb cream and find that the oil on my t zone will cause it to melt off my face, not good.</li>
            <li> not sure what is wrong with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, and, trust me, protect yourself from the sun!</li>
            <li> BIG disappointment!</li>
            <li> I was getting a little desperate when I decided to try Garnier.</li>
            <li> For some reason ordering it here and this bottle is runny, thin and is not great.</li>
            <li> but the consistency is thin and runny.  </li>
            <li> but it just destroyed my complexion and made my skin look worse than before.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was all puffy and broken out underneath the make up.  </li>
            <li> Sad Situation).ot concealer or foundation,</li>
            <li> Sad Situation).</li>
            <li> I have always had oily, acne prone skin and was skeptical that this would work without clogging my pores, but what a difference.  </li>
            <li> It seems to me that the &amp;#34;non-comedogenic/non acnegenic&amp;#34; labels are seriously erroneous.</li>
            <li> I used to use Bobby Brown products but they got too expensive to rebuy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what went wrong with this.  </li>
            <li> I hate the caked on foundation porcelain doll look with heavy pore clogging makeup</li>
            <li> Yes it is runny and yes it smells faintly of alcohol</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Not impressed</li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical about whether or not it would work for my super-oily, pitted, scarred, acne-covered skin.</li>
            <li> I just have to hit the worst red spots.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very thin liquid..thinner than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> stop selling things that you consider dangerous...</li>
            <li> Crazy stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I broke out like crazy for months after using this for a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> Bad, bad</li>
            <li> Bad, bad</li>
            <li> Makes me break out! :(</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars for coverage but the messiness is kinda of annoying</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look bad at all!</li>
            <li> And i hated the perfumy smell.</li>
            <li> The bad: THE COLOR IS ORANGE!!!!!</li>
            <li> The bad: THE COLOR IS ORANGE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Made my skin breakout terribly, it&#x27;s taking forever to recover.</li>
            <li> Evidenced by this garbage, which gave me the worst breakout I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> The coverage was awful and it looked like I painted my face on.</li>

            <li> LOVE IT AND CHEAPER THEN AT THE STORE GREAT BUY ADDS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF COLOR AND GOES ON JUST LIKE LOTION</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different BB creams (including the pricy department store variety) and never saw what all the hype is about. I have combination skin - the tone is uneven from acne scars, my T zone is ALWAYS oily and sometimes my cheeks and chin are so dry, they flake - all this at the same time. Garnier OIL FREE bb cream seems to be the magic formula for my skin. Regular bb creams leave me even more oily than I normally am. I gave this product a shot as a last ditch effort. Now I won&#x27;t leave the house without it on. I have had skin cancer in the past and have always had to use sunscreen under my make up and then use a foundation with a decent SPF. This product has replaced my foundation AND sunscreen AND primer. It&#x27;s also given me back 10 minutes in the morning, which any working woman will know is HUGE. It blends very easily and leaves me truly matte all day. It&#x27;s inexpensive enough that I say try it, what have you got to lose?</li>
            <li> I just love how this product applies on without being streaky or greasy and also not breaking me out. I wear the light/medium and upon application it is a color that matches my skin tone. I just caught this recently, but I think this product oxidizes over time quite a bit and makes my face appear orange??? At first I had just assumed it was the lighting change that made my skin tone appear darker, but I realize now that it is the product. I would come home at the end of the day and wash my face off to find that my skin is lighter underneath after washing as opposed to before makeup removal. Besides this issue and the mess that occurs from the product being squeezed out, I love this BB cream. I will continue to wear it as it has great coverage for my hyper pigmentation and does not break me out, but I do wish the necessary changes were made!</li>
            <li> My favorite BB cream so far!</li>
            <li> No, I didn&#x27;t buy the product here but I picked it up at the drug store, and let me tell you I tested it today. I had my evening College classes canceled, that being said I had an 2 hours to kill, so I spent it walking on a mildly hot day exerting myself quite a bit by making a trek to the near by mall. which is a good 25 min walk Let me tell you one thing, I  have Smashbox BB cream and their tinted moisturizer, Oil free. Yea okay after suffering from white heads and skin break outs, just too creamy for me. I still use it occassionally because I like the coverage and I have lesions on my face (very small of course due to a genetic disorder that has caused a rash like bumpy layer on my cheeks I  like to cover  them up (most just tell me they think I&#x27;m having a alergic reaction BUT this isn&#x27;t what the review is about so moving on) . But I regret spending $50 dollars, when really all I needed to spend was less than 20, that product is a god send, at least for me and my oily skin, definitly my new best friend, I never developed oily spots on my forehead cheeks the creases between my nose I honestly could have cried. Finally a product for oily skin, this won&#x27;t be just a summer foundation either, I&#x27;ve got huge plans for it all day any day and every season,I just wish I was able to get my hands on it sooner but was never able to find it, If I can&#x27;t good ol amazon will sure have it! .</li>
            <li> I loved the original Garnier BB.  The texture was silky smooth.  But it did sometimes make my combination skin a little shiney.  Looked forward to the new formula for combo and oily skin.  This is not the same at all.  The unsecured package has no tamper proof feature so it is often opened before you get it.  Second, the fabulous texture is gone, now it is a runny liquid.  Third, the package is the same price for less product now only 2 ounces.  The product still does what it should do, but is a bit of a disappointment versus the original.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I just wish they would make this in a fair/light option. The light medium is too dark for me, I always find myself orange if i wear this product alone. I mix this with a lighter foundation.</li>
            <li> When i started trying BB creams i wasn&#x27;t expecting to have any good results with brands on the cheap side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really dislike heavy make up and a friend of mine recommended Garnier BB cream, so i gave it a try after disastrous experiences with other western brands (i avoid asian brands because of animal testing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well i LOVED it from day 1. My skin looked beautiful, smooth and matte with the cream on. It&#x27;s very lightweight and easy to put on, it covers most discoloration without looking like i have something on, very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to the oil free formulation since I&#x27;m prone to acne and it&#x27;s even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to finish with the Pros, it helped my skin to recover from make up caused blackhead, my skin started to look better without make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER it&#x27;s not all Pros. I decided to switch brands because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. A few of hours after put it on i had no make up left on  my face. It just melted and i need make up that i dont have to retouch many times a day.But my face it&#x27;s always oily so it might be just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Ingredients. It has lots of not so safe ingredients, i wanted to use a more natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Not sure if it is 100% cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i might keep a tube and use it for special occasions where i only need to look good for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Gives a much better cover than I expected for a bb cream. I put some primer on first and powder after and that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> Refill of a product I was currently using; appears authentic vs store bought product. Good coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel oily on my combination skin.</li>
            <li> This product contains propylene glycol which is very harmful for the skin, causes breakouts expecially. Propylene glycol is an ingredient used in anti freeze coolant for cars. YUCK.</li>
            <li> Color isn&#x27;t good for fair complexions. It looks like mud on my fair skin. I wasn&#x27;t able to wear it so I cannot attest to its other qualities. Bummer they don&#x27;t make a lighter version.</li>
            <li> I love the new formula--it seems very watery right out of the tube, but has good coverage and after applying it feels silky/powdery.  It doesn&#x27;t have that oily sheen on my face like the original formula did.  I dust over some transluscent powder after and I&#x27;m good to go.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s a little too dark--I generally use light/medium cream/foundation, but my face appears darker with this cream--I don&#x27;t usually use the fairest option in makeup, but I wish there were a lighter one available for this.</li>
            <li> Eh it&#x27;s okay, only covers for about an hour. And actually was not great for oily skin. But overall the price is good, and it works like a bb cream for the most part.</li>
            <li> I bought this pretty impulsively at Target, and I&#x27;m glad I did! I have been on Tazorac for 6 months and at the beginning my skin was super dry and flaky and it was hard to find a light foundation that didn&#x27;t look horrible with the state my skin as in. I was actually going makeup-less most of the time, which was hard 1. because I was so used to wearing heavy makeup and 2. because I was breaking out so much at the beginning. I was a little nervous about this product since i hadn&#x27;t done much research (outside of a quick glance at Amazon comparing this and one other while I was standing in Target.) However, this was by far the best product I&#x27;ve found! I spot use it on days I&#x27;m just trying to even out skin tone. I was hesitant at first since i don&#x27;t usually buy my foundation at the drug store, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with it! It&#x27;s not drying and does a great job hiding any uneven-ness or redness without doing a full face coverage of foundation.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but with this product I had to! I rarely have the time, especially during the busy part of the week, to apply foundation and all! This BB is such a simple step with several benefits! I have oily T zone and occasionally dry cheeks- this cream balances it all perfectly! I apply, and then lightly dust my T zone with some bare minerals mineral veil. The first few days or using I broke out mildly, but I think it was because I had just tried something different on my skin. I&#x27;ve been using for three weeks now, and I love how my skin looks! This product is not super expensive, but it&#x27;s also not incredibly cheap, but you get good results for your money! Give it a try, it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Lightweight, doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, hardly need anything else on top.</li>
            <li> It was to my girlfriend, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I feel really bad by not giving this a better rating, but after my experience I had to share my thoughts, specially for Latina women out there. I been looking for a good BB cream for many many months, until I found this one, I have tried other over the counter brands and all of them had greasy, thick textures with ashy, grayish hues for the color. I am Latina, my skin is eternally tanned, with yellow warm undertones, during summer I tan easily into a golden brown and during winter I get a little pale, but always maintaining some yellow undertones. My skin is oily, and my pores can get enlarged on the nose and forehead. I also have very mild rosacea and some redness on the cheeks because of that.&lt;br /&gt;I been using these cream for about a year:&lt;br /&gt;* The good:&lt;br /&gt;- Great texture, the cream it is indeed a little runny (storage it in an upright position, always) but because of that texture it runs perfectly on my skin, no greasy-heavy-cakey feeling at all. It blends in seconds and feels fresh and light, from all the BB creams I have tried, this texture was the lightest and easier to apply, just a pea-size amount covers my whole face. I added extra cream on the areas that had blemishes and the covering was pretty good (it almost makes  the beauty spots disappear, but I prefer to show them). It never felt heavy or looked cakey, I always used very smalls amount and was plenty for all my face.&lt;br /&gt;- It did control the extreme oiliness I have, but not all day, after a couple of hours it started looking shiny and I had to pat my skin with oil absorbing sheets and that gave me one or two extra hours looking good.&lt;br /&gt;- My pores looked smaller immediately.&lt;br /&gt;- After wearing the cream all day, my skin felt softer and any pimples looked dry and flat, it worked like an acne control cream for me.&lt;br /&gt;- It has medium coverage, but it did cover my rosacea and any little spider veins I had, they did show faintly, but way better than having them so red and notorious. This is not concealer or foundation, so do not except complete coverage, this is a little more sheer and natural-looking, if you want your face like a plastic mask, then buy a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;- My skin looked moisturized and never tight, greasy or cakey, the texture looked quite natural and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;* The bad: THE COLOR IS ORANGE!!!!! (for the Medium-Deep Oil Free BB Cream), holy smokes, I wanted to cry, I been using it for months and never realized how orange it was until i saw myself under natural light at noon, outside. My face looked like a pumpkin and all this time I thought I was looking great. I applied it in my bedroom where I thought I had good lighting, but obviously it wasn&#x27;t good enough. How sad is this, because otherwise this is a very good cream, at a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using the Light-Medium color and applying some bronzer to compensate the lighter hue, but it looked unnatural on my face, like a mime with blush. Bad, bad, bad.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really hoping that in time Garnier will create more options with more colors and better, more natural hues, we don&#x27;t have orange-colored faces. If they do create more options I&#x27;ll get 30 boxes of this cream in a New York Minute, because I loved everything, but the color palette.&lt;br /&gt;(Now I have no BB Cream at all, and no idea what to do &#x3D; Sad Situation).ot concealer or foundation, so do not except complete coverage, this is a little more sheer and natural-looking, if you want your face like a plastic mask, then buy a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;- My skin looked moisturized and never tight, greasy or cakey, the texture looked quite natural and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;* The bad: THE COLOR IS ORANGE!!!!!

            <li> Best BB cream EVER! I have very very very oily skin and this bb cream helps TONS with that problem, the coverage is great and you can build it up, i have very sensitive skin so there&#x27;s time where it does look cakey and when it looks flawless but i go over with a wet sponge and it solves that problem. This is the best bb cream i have ever found and i&#x27;ve been using it for a while and will keep using.</li>
            <li> Another terrific find. Just a little bit goes a long way. Blends great and stays on, eliminates most oil (not all- don&#x27;t throw away that compact just yet). But it really is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I just bought this at my Kroger about a week ago and I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve been using a Mary Kay Foundation, but it just wasn&#x27;t working out for me. I decided to try this out because I love Garnier Products. Unlike the MK Foundation that would have my face looking oily after just a few hours, this BB Cream I can wear all day and not have an oily face for almost the entire day! It&#x27;s amazing and much cheaper on here than it was at Kroger!</li>
            <li> my face look really shine!</li>
            <li> Ohhh Yesss! This is magic to my face, in seconds my skin looks amazing. I don&#x27;t have to use foundation anymore for casual days, the color matchs perfect to me, and it keeps me oil free all day. I live in a sunny,  hot and humidity weather so the spf is a plus for me. My skin use to breakout easily, but with this BB cream I haven&#x27;t noticed any undesired reaction.</li>
            <li> Good for covering pimples and red areas after acid peels etc. It seems to moisturize and provide a little coverage that is not obvious.</li>
            <li> I just got this BB cream in the mail yesterday &amp; wore it for the 1st time today. I have super oil skin &amp; most BB creams &amp; foundations don&#x27;t work for me.  Today I wore this BB cream all day at work, which was hot, &amp; at the end of shift it still looked awesome! No oily shiny look,nice &amp; matte. So excited to find something that works for me! After washing my face tonight my skin feels softer than normal. Good stuff! I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It does provide moderate coverage and I do need to reapply at times, but for the most part, it does its job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several BB creams that supposedly work for oily skin but they always left me even more shiny than I started out. This one actually does the job and does it well. I&#x27;m redheaded and have TONS of freckles that I don&#x27;t want to hide. This BB cream does a great job of covering imperfections and evening skin tone without covering my freckles. I will keep buying this.</li>
            <li> Finally no more shiny t zone, feels so much better then regular foundation. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  I just started to use on a daily basis and have already noticed a difference in my skin.  I have always had oily, acne prone skin and was skeptical that this would work without clogging my pores, but what a difference.  After only using a few days, I noticed how clear my skin and even my skin looks.  Would definitely recommend for those who are on the fence.</li>
            <li> best bb cream out there!</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and my skin broke out after using it. so you should test it on your skin before using if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I typically purchase this at the store. It&#x27;s thick and I love the product. For some reason ordering it here and this bottle is runny, thin and is not great. I won&#x27;t order these type of products here again.</li>
            <li> I love garnier products because whatever they claim is true and you can see the results in a week!</li>
            <li> I found that it made the problems of combination skin (oily and dry) worse. Its just a cheap watery product.</li>
            <li> This product gave me acne and is very runny. I didn&#x27;t understand the fuss, not for me. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Well I never tried any other bb cream but I love this one so far. The oil control bb cream is much more watery compared to the original garnier bb cream. Once I put on the cream it has an cooling feeling which is nice and keeps my oily skin under control (and I mean super oily). Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the bottle leaks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite fair skinned, so when I purchased this, it was too dark for me.  I mixed it with another bb cream that&#x27;s fair, and it worked well for me.  I&#x27;ve gotten a little more tan, so I use a bit more of this into my mix of creams now.  I don&#x27;t think I could ever use just this, but it mixes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the tube to my Mom, with the majority of it remaining.  She uses it daily.  Her skin looks natural, but perfected with it.  She gets a lot of complements on her skin.  I rated this item very high because with the right skin tone, this works very well, and doesn&#x27;t create a cakelike appearance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fair skin, I&#x27;d go with Holika Holika Petit BB cream. They have a few kinds, and I like the clearing \\&quot;formula\\&quot; for winter, when I&#x27;m the palest.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s perfect for my skin and it gives my face a natural look and helps to prevent shiny skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write product reviews, but this stuff is too good not to tell everyone!  I have combination skin and am usually oily within thirty minutes after applying anything to my face. I was initially surprised by how runny this product is, but it blended into my skin perfectly and gave me a nice matte finish that still looks flawless three hours later - a record for me!  I am going to buy a case and stock up!</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It doesn&#x27;t have the harmful chemicals (like parabens) and smooths on flawlessly. Couldn&#x27;t be happier and buy only this brand for foundation over and over.</li>
            <li> So, I got this a while ago at my local drug store and I have been holding onto the receipt and box just to make sure that this would work for me. Finally, I threw them away, so this product is a keeper for me. I love that it has sunblock in it and the coverage is amazing. This is the perfect makeup to throw on when I don&#x27;t feel like doing my usual routine or if I am short on time. Running errands or walking the dogs is what I mostly use it for. I slap this on over a toner with a quick brush of blush and mascara and I am out the door. Despite all the positives to this product, there are some negatives as well: The color doesn&#x27;t quite match my skin. It&#x27;s close, but no cigar and that is kind of a big deal for foundation. My Jane Iredale makeup matches perfect so for those with yellow undertones, this might not be the best match for you. Also, it doesn&#x27;t really control oil very well. My skin is pretty oily so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but it would have been nice if it lived up to it&#x27;s advertisement. However, for what I use it for, as a quick alternative to my normal routine, it does the job. I will keep looking for a better BB cream but in the meantime, this works and I can&#x27;t really complain too much about the cons. This will stay in my makeup drawer until I find a better fit.</li>
            <li> Made my skin breakout terribly, it&#x27;s taking forever to recover.</li>
            <li> I like the color and the coverage is better than expected. The only issue I have is my t-zone it usually oily by midday when I wear this, so I have to re-powder to stay matte.</li>
            <li> I got this product a few weeks ago, and have been using it every day since.  My favorite thing about this product, is how it evens skin tone, without looking like caked on make up. I feel like I have professional make up on whenever I wear it. I have blotchy red skin, and this goes on very evenly, covering the blotchiness with just a thin layer.  It also goes on very smooth. I can barely feel it on my face. With that said, it does come off easily (ie, if you hug someone, or brush your face against something) a bit will come off, so be careful!  I have very oily skin, and I was worried that this might make me break out, however, I really haven&#x27;t had any problems! I still need to do a little blotting by mid day, but I don&#x27;t think that this bb cream contributes to the oil at all. (*NOTE, I have used the regular version of this product, the one that doesn&#x27;t specifically say for oily skin, and that version leaves your skin very oily. So if you have oily skin, BE SURE that you get the kind that is for oily skin).   The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is how dark the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is. I live in Michigan, and after a long winter with barely any sun, I am truly &amp;#34;light skinned.&amp;#34; If I hit the tanning bed for a few weeks, then this would be a good match, however with my light skin, I have to do some major blending magic to make it look like I don&#x27;t have a super tan face and a white neck/body.  Also, this isn&#x27;t great for covering pimples/bumps. I think because it is such a smooth/light/silky formula, it has a hard time covering any kind of bumps. I feel like it almost makes pimples/bumps more noticeable, because it evens out the rest of your skin so well.  Overall, great product! I would (and will) definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t not like it was too runny and too light and too drying but it worked for my friends. This is made fir light people who are extremely oily</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have oily skin and this keeps my face even and significantly less oily all day, without being drying. Even if I am sweating, my face is still even and matte. This is such a great bargain too-- I have been using the same bottle daily for almost a year and there is still about half left.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this product. and I put it on the day I received it and it felt like my face was on fire. Then, I tried to exchange it and here is what Amazon&#x27;s site says when you go to return this:  &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;  What is with this?&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t order this product and Amazon stop selling things that you consider dangerous...and if you do  why didn&#x27;t you warn me before I ordered  and you and the vendor made money on it?  Crazy stuff.  I think FTC and FDA will be interested in this as well.</li>
            <li> I bought yesterday, but honestly didnÂ´t work, yes my skin look better than nothing, but now is looks like cracked not sure what is wrong with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well the texture is very liquid, recomendation put the container up side down, otherwise you will make a mess after opened.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great for my oily skin. It blends well and covers imperfections. However, I wish they would change this bottle to a PUMP! It is really messy, its is thin and leaks into the cap, which then leaks everywhere. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again until they change it to a pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, and I had read some good reviews, but this was terrible for me.  It&#x27;s so oily and greasy.  I really couldn&#x27;t believe the shine even on my dry skin!  I felt like I was wearing a mask.  This is honestly one of the worst things I have bought in a long time.  Throughout the day, and reapplying powder to cover up the oil, I began to feel little spots on my face that were itchy and turning red.  Sure enough, it broke me out.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the sunscreen in it that did it, but I returned it today back to Walmart, and hope my face returns to normal soon!</li>
            <li> Ive tried so many bb cream even the original korean BB cream when it first came out thought it was the best ever but its hard to find and then ai found this one and by far true to what this cream claims and more. It looks like a foundation when youre wearing it, stays matte and shine free all day. Covers my uneven skin tone due to acne scarring and covers my imperfections. I uses this everyday when Im not in the mood of putting a makeup on because this looks natural. I highly recommend this! I have dry combination and oily in my t-zone and this does the job.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this really helped. and it also provides a light and natural coverage. Definitely love it</li>
            <li> They changed the formula for this product in the recent past.  The cream used to be more of a lotion consistency and now it&#x27;s runnier - more like a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and have not had any problems using this product.</li>
            <li> I hate going without make-up due to the unevenness in my skin, so this is the perfect go- to BB cream for the gym or even the beach! Not heavy at all. It just evens out my skin tone without looking like I&#x27;m wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this one, thanks to Pinterest, but it looked ghastly on me--chalky white, maybe slightly gray, kinda creepy. I tried to cover it up with powder in my proper shade but the weird chalkiness shone right through. I had already tried the darker shade and it was way too dark (and a little orange). I&#x27;m Asian with light-medium skin with neutral undertones. This might work for you if you&#x27;re very fair. The texture was runnier than expected but it dries to a nice smooth matte finish.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  I was the teenager that never had a breakout.  My skin got oily in my mid-twenties.  I am now a daily Pro-Activ user and also steam my face every day and it stays mostly clear. This offered nice coverage, the tint was good, and I was thrilled that I was getting sunscreen, which I would not normally wear.  Wow - within a week I was covered in breakouts.  After not using it for a week, the breakouts are mostly cleared up.  It seems to me that the &amp;#34;non-comedogenic/non acnegenic&amp;#34; labels are seriously erroneous.</li>
            <li> The color is just too dark for me. I love everything else about it, but I won&#x27;t be able to wear it unless I get a major tan. What a bummer!!</li>
            <li> I really Like this product, It gives good coverage and good color corrections.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and love the coverage. It did  everthing it claimed.  The reason I only gave it a 3 is the color.  I an fair skinned and the light/medium was too dark.  I wrote the company but never received a response from Garnier.  If it came in a lighter tone I would give it a 5.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month. I tried BB creams on a whim and all the other products I tried out seemed to be extremely runny with limited coverage. I was getting a little desperate when I decided to try Garnier. I usually don&#x27;t spend that much on make up but I am so glad I made the exception. Not only do I have a TON left, it really doesn&#x27;t take much for my skin to look smooth, even and natural. Fortunately for me it does exactly what it says and it isn&#x27;t runny at all. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product lives up to the hype on YouTube. I have an oil slick for a face and this is great for me.  Of course I need to blot throughout the day, but the product doesn&#x27;t separate on my t zone and I don&#x27;t ever have cake face. its the perfect summer coverage. The light medium was too light (I&#x27;m a NC30 in Mac), but nothing a little bronzer couldn&#x27;t fix. Next time I&#x27;ll definitely purchase the medium deep.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically review makeup products since they work differently for everyone, but I thought I would create one for this in case anyone is thinking of trying it who may have skin like mine.  I have fair skin with pink undertones, red hair and a face full of light freckles...my skin is oily and prone to acne. I had read that this bb cream works wonders for freckle coverage and oily skin.  However, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I found the color to be very yellow and it really highlighted my freckles rather than mute them.  The cream is very runny - I expected it to be creamier.  I will say it did control shine well, but it made my skin feel dry and tight (which is crazy since it is usually so oily!) The cream really settled into my lines and actually made me look older.  If your skin sounds like mine at all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, however I&#x27;m sure it works great for some!</li>
            <li> This came today. And i tried it right away :) i love how it blends on my skin. Its very light and smooth on skin. Five stars for this! :)</li>
            <li> The color is good but the product is thinner than I expected.  The first time I opened it it practically fell out of the tube without me even squeezing it.  I don&#x27;t remember it being that consistency last time I bought it so it may just be the one tube I got.</li>
            <li> Nice medium coverage. It&#x27;s very similar to a liquid foundation. I like that it&#x27;s oil-free, non-acnegenic, and non-comedogenic. Perfect for my oily, acne-prone skin. The light/medium is perfect for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few BB creams and this is one of my least favorites. Disclaimer- I&#x27;ve always used Asian brand BB creams so I&#x27;m not used to the westernized ones. This is way thinner and watery than the creams I&#x27;m used to. I think it&#x27;s great for LIGHT coverage. I also feel like it makes me a bit oily so I haven&#x27;t been using it in the summer time. I think I&#x27;ll save this for the wintertime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely impressed with this and am surprised the overall reviews aren&#x27;t much stronger on the plus side than they are. There is no question that it makes my skin look smoother, hides large pores. I haven&#x27;t used it long so this is pretty much a first impression. I don&#x27;t know yet if the cumulative effects will be as stated. When it comes to skins, what works for one may not work for another. But I have no hesitancy at all in recommending to anyone to try this and see what you think.</li>
            <li> I had been using the creamier garnier BB cream and was pretty happy with it. I have combination skin that has an oily T-zone after a few hours, so I thought this would be great. While the formulation is thinner (more fluid) and less moisturizing than the original, I find it harder to apply evenly because it&#x27;s too runny. It also seems more \\&quot;makeup-y\\&quot; than the original, I usually have to end up using a sponge to even it out- and the reason I like BB creams is that they&#x27;re supposed to be foolproof and easy to apply. This one is also messy- the tube has a screw-off cap and the cream starts dripping out before you even squeeze the tube. When I take the cap off I have to be careful to hold the tube perpendicular to the floor otherwise it&#x27;ll drip a puddle of makeup onto the sink. I really wanted to like this because I thought it would give all the benefits of a BB minus some of the intense moisture, but the extra effort makes it kind of pointless. If I wanted to deal with a runny formula that needs extra attention I&#x27;d just use a light liquid foundation- I&#x27;ve used other BB creams that you just swipe on in 20 seconds and you&#x27;re ready to go- this one just wasn&#x27;t worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many foundations and this one is by far the best! It looks great, feels light, and is good for my skin. It provides uv protection as well and doesn&#x27;t give me acne.</li>
            <li> i chose the lightest shade bc that is usually what fits me but it was too light for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this the whole summer, because I wanted something a little lighter that I could wear everyday and not feel like my face was melting off. I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;It has great coverage (I broke out like crazy at some point, due to a surfeit of stress not the BB Cream) and goes on smooth and really blends beautifully. My only minor complaint would be that by the end of the day my forehead does look a little oily, but to be fair, I have a really oily t-zone and summertime doesn&#x27;t help matters. A little powder or some blotting and I was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the price and the purchase. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I have avery very oily skin  and this product is just awesome in controling oil and shine  I dont have to worry  any more about how I look at mid day</li>
            <li> The product goes on fingers very Watery so Be careful. Very surprised that It made my face seem pore-less a nd smoothly. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great cc cream makeup but a little sheer for what I needed.  The color matches my skin tone great but I&#x27;m still looking for more coverage and a little higher SPF since I work in the sun.</li>
            <li> Great price, Quick delivery. The best BB...Only one I will use anymore, light and does not make my face breakout.</li>
            <li> I like it. It works better than what I was using, but it still has some flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;â¢ doesn&#x27;t make me oily (I have combination skin).&lt;br /&gt;â¢ very light like I&#x27;m wearing nothing&lt;br /&gt;â¢ has pretty good coverage to hide my breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;â¢ the coloring wasn&#x27;t a complete perfect, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be&lt;br /&gt;â¢ coverage wears after around 4-5 hours, but still leaves an okay coverage</li>
            <li> Best product for the price. I used to use Bobby Brown products but they got too expensive to rebuy so I switched to this and it works just as well. I don&#x27;t consider him myself a person with a dark skin, its slightly tan &amp; rosey.  The medium dark works best for me. Light-medium was too light.</li>
            <li> pros-&lt;br /&gt;good coverage&lt;br /&gt;oxidizes (so color blends in overtime)&lt;br /&gt;alot of product for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons-&lt;br /&gt;makes my skin oily after a few hrs even with powder on top&lt;br /&gt;bad lasting power&lt;br /&gt;very liquidy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and if I don&#x27;t blend this well into my neck I will look like I am wearing a mask!  I would love more color options to choose from for us that are fair or darker then they 2 shades offered.  I also have oily skin and need to use powder with it.  It goes on well, has pretty good coverage and it wears well with the powder.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a oil free mate finish BB cream and this is just what I was looking for. Use as foundation on a daily base when I don&#x27;t need to use make up and it works great. Best BB cream ever! Great price!! I will definitely buy this again!!!</li>
            <li> Clogs up in your pores very noticably.  Too light in color as well.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> is a perfect bbcream!!!! I LOVE ITTTT</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what went wrong with this.  I use the original formula Garnier BB cream with SPF15 and ordered this because it has SPF20, but this is nothing like the original formula.  I thought this would be the same except for the higher SPF20.  Not only is the color much lighter (medium) but the consistency is thin and runny.  It&#x27;s thinner than normal foundation.  BB cream is supposed to be thick like the original formula which worked great but I wanted a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> This is a first impression as I just got this and needed to try it out. The shipping was so fast! I&#x27;ve never had a bb cream, or any makeup for that matter so I am a noob lol. I have pale skin and light/medium was the lightest color available. I was worried I was too pale for this.  When I first put it on, I put on way too much and I looked orange! I was very dissapointed, I took it off, put on less, and now it looks better! It still kind of looks orangey but it&#x27;s barley noticeable. This bb cream smooths your face out and it doesn&#x27;t look cakey. One tip I have, LESS IS MORE!</li>
            <li> Makes me break out! :(</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I hate the caked on foundation porcelain doll look with heavy pore clogging makeup and this stuff offers enough coverage to hide blemishes and lighten freckles giving you a smooth clean complexion without looking fake and it&#x27;s very light and smooth going on and blends well. It does not seem to &amp;#34;last&amp;#34; for all day coverage and tends to need touch ups for extended wear. Comes off easily as well with light face washing, don&#x27;t need to scrub it off.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best BB cream I&#x27;ve used. And for the price, you just cant beat it. It provides coverage and moisture and leaves my skin feeling soft and not over caked. I love it.</li>
            <li> I feels nice on my skin, and didn&#x27;t look cakey on my face, which is a constant problem with BB creme. I have fair skin with pink under tones, and I bought the Light/Medium shade and it does everything it offers on my skin. Well worth the price and more.</li>
            <li> I love this product because It goes on very smoothly and evenly. It makes my skin look basically flawless but without having a cakey looking face. The only problem I have with it is that because there is SPF in it, it flashes white in pictures. This is a complete deal breaker for me. If I can&#x27;t take pictures without my face looking white in comparison to the rest of my body, it is useless. Wearing any product on my face is supposed to make it look perfect and normal in any scenario, pictures included. I returned the product.</li>
            <li> Perfection&lt;br /&gt;They enhanced the formula to be Matt and fits the summer&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is just amazing</li>
            <li> watery and more like a foundation than a bb cream. It fits my skin very well, not so thick but still covers very well! I have a lot of acne and freckles, and this covers them very well.</li>
            <li> In a recent on-line article, this was recommended by a female dermatologist who said it works well on her oily skin.  I, too, have very oily skin - great for not developing wrinkles, but many make-ups cause break-outs.  This is a VERY light coverage, which is all I want or need.  Gives a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and evens color, but I don&#x27;t look like a clown.  It takes a light dusting of powder without caking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a great price.  I picked up a tube at a local pharmacy to try and will stock up from Amazon when it runs out.  Wish I knew the name of that dermatologist so I could thank her!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Very forgiving for imperfect skin</li>
            <li> Like the coverage but instead of minimizing the fine lines it accentuates them. Will be looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have extremely oily skin and this is the only product that seems to keep the oil at bay. It is a little too dark for my skin tone right now, so I wish they had a lighter color, but the product is AMAZING! It makes my skin look like skin, not like a layer of foundation. It blends easily and leaves a nice finish. I absolutely LOVE it. I don&#x27;t think it would work well for anyone who has remotely dry skin, but if you have oily skin, you should definitely try it!</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product it was amazing with my oily skin and it also provides great coverage for blemishes and dark circles. I used it every day under my foundation but after a couple weeks my skin became very oily and shiny a few hours after application. Now, several months later l, my face (forehead mostly) is not only very oily but really dry as well. It looked like it was recovering from a sunburn. Sounds odd but its true. So this week I decided to stop using it for a couple days and noticed that my forehead is not as oily or dry any more. This product may be doing more harm than good. Also it is very messy/watery, the cream oozes out of the cap and gets every where!</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks. I used it for almost half a year. Initiallly, I obviously thought it was decent but the 2nd bottle I bought seemed different somehow, like it was reformulated. It&#x27;s greasy and gloppy and makes your face look spackled with muddy goop.. I switched back to CG BB lotion for the time being and my skin instantly looked 100 times better. Not for fair complected skin despite the fair formulation. And i hated the perfumy smell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the high ratings for this stuff. I broke out horribly from the oil free version. Garnier uses the cheapest ingredients that clog pores, no oil required. It&#x27;s a myth that if it&#x27;s oil-free, it won&#x27;t cause breakouts, and it&#x27;s definitely a myth that all oil WILL break you out. Evidenced by this garbage, which gave me the worst breakout I&#x27;ve had in years. And no, I do not typically break out. I switched to another brand after using this crap for two days and my skin went back to normal. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon, so no comment on the service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BB cream itself is great!  This matches up to my skin tone better than any other foundation because it&#x27;s pretty sheer, but somehow covers up redness really well.  My skin tone is more even, my skin is moisturized but not greasy, and I feel like I&#x27;m not wearing much more than moisturizer.  This is great for summertime because you won&#x27;t look like The Joker by mid-afternoon :-)  I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time, so I&#x27;m not sure how its claims of skin treatment will work out, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: the tube is huge!  I only use a few drops of it every day, so I have a feeling it&#x27;ll last me about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use during the warmer-weather months when I prefer to lighten up (a lot) on my makeup. I have nothing negative to say about it. It&#x27;s a rather watery formula as opposed to a viscous cream, which I happen to like; the consistency I feel really suits my combination skin. Color match is fine--because this is is such a sheer product (i.e. minimal/light coverage), I believe that each of the 2 available shades would \\&quot;match&#x27; quite a variety of skin tones. I have strong yellow under tones w/a light(ish) warm complexion, and the Light/Medium shade blends right in. I don&#x27;t even have to take this down onto my neck (indication of just how light a coverage to expect). I&#x27;ve had zero issues regarding my skin since using this. No breakouts, no redness, no irritation whatsoever. In my opinion though, that means absolutely nothing as everybody&#x27;s skin and body chemistry is so different. But I digress... Overall I would definitely recommend this product. It&#x27;s a great affordable option if you have relatively decent skin and are looking for something to provide minimal coverage and a nice, natural, truly skin-like finish. I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> i recently bought this at my local cvs and when i used it, i fell in love with it. it does an excellent job of evening out my skintone and controlling my gross, oily skin. would totally buy again.</li>
            <li> After watching youtube videos about this i wanted to try since being a mom to toddler twins i dont always have time to get ready. This stuff is great. I have extremely oily skin. Like i could end oil shortages with the oil from my face. But this stuff has helped my oily skin and mg pores do look better. It covers nicely without being heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m simultaneously very impressed and disappointed in this product. I had tried the original Garnier BB cream when it first came out at the urging of a friend, but it left my oily skin feeling absolutely disgusting within half an hour. I don&#x27;t really like wearing foundation though, so when I saw the combination/oily skin formula, I had to try it. The product applies smoothly and feels great - with a little powder on top, my face feels matte and non-greasy for hours (basically a miracle for me). It doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup! However, I&#x27;m very pale, and I&#x27;m finding that the light/medium shade is a bit too dark for me (especially in winter) but it&#x27;s the lightest shade they make. Another strike against it is that it has a definite orange/tan undertone, whereas my skin has a very pink undertone. I&#x27;m torn; I love how it feels and while it doesn&#x27;t look BAD, I know I would benefit from a lighter/pinker shade, which sadly doesn&#x27;t exist. I don&#x27;t want to get rid of it as it was somewhat pricey for a drugstore BB cream, but I doubt I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I don&#x27;t know if there are really any skin benefits, but this is the kind of makeup you can put a little bit on your fingers and smear all over your face for the perfect light coverage, and the oily skin version stays relatively matte. It&#x27;s a great base layer for the everyday, I just need a bit of coverage and some bare minerals and I&#x27;m out the door. Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I was SO scared to try this because it has such mixed reviews. However, I purchased the Medium/Deep shade from Target and I LOVE it. The color match is very close, it goes on great with my elf small stippling brush, and the coverage is nice. I wanted something that would cover my redness without looking like I&#x27;m wearing make up and it does look really natural. My skin tends to look really oily through out the day and this keeps it looking good and lasts a quite a while. Yes it is runny and yes it smells faintly of alcohol but you cant smell it unless you go out of your way.</li>
            <li> Great coverage for a bb cream with a really nice finish. The key is to use a foundation brush ( I recommend Real Techniques), it makes all the difference. My skin is super oily and I find that it does not oxidize and get orange-y as the day goes on. I can reserve my expensive Shiseido foundation for nights out and photographs! :)</li>
            <li> I love it!  My skin does not feel oily nor heavily made up.  I feel confident that my skin looks good, also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Total Effects Tone Correcting Moisturizer (from Amazon) and really like it except that the coverage is minimal.  That&#x27;s great for most of the year when my face has a touch of color to it, but currently in the dead of winter, I needed something with a little more color.  This definitely gives that, but I find it very dry and cake-y looking on my skin.  Looks great from a distance, but up close not so much.  I appreciate that it has sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin (may dry it out a bit?) but overall I&#x27;m not super impressed.</li>
            <li> This Bb cream definitely does its job when it comes to coverage. I have some redness on my cheeks and it took care to it no problem. However if not careful this product can get cakey, so applying in thin layers and gradually putting more on is the preferred method. The product was really watery which results in slipping and sliding of the cream if no powder is applied. Overall this is worth your time and money if you&#x27;re in the market for a Bb cream.</li>
            <li> This is the second tube I have ordered.  I first bought this and tried it because I had heard so much about BB cream and how good they are.  I am always hesitant to use moisturizer or sunscreen because I already have oily prone skin.  This stuff is very thin liquid..thinner than I thought it would be. But it goes on AMAZING.  It is completely non greasy and soaks right into your skin very easily.  It is very nice and matte finish, which is very hard for me to find in a foundation.  I feel like I am getting decent coverage without using a thick foundation.  Also, most foundations give me oily skin as the day progresses, but this stuff helps my skin stay non-oily.  I am very impressed by this product.  And this also lasts a long time. One tube lasted me months</li>
            <li> Out of all the BB creams I&#x27;ve tried, this one is my fave. It works really well in the summer when my skin tends to be a little oilier in spots. I have pretty light skin, but this light to medium works well for me. Coverage is pretty good, but wish it was a little thicker. But not enough to change the 5 star rating. I have had issues with other BB creams causing break outs, not this one. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> work good on skin say what it should do and did so thanks.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  It looks GREAT on, kept me pretty much oil free with a beautiful even toned look all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, having acne-prone skin I felt all day like all my sweat and oils were actually trapped underneath this perfect make up.  And when I washed my face in the evening I found I was right.  Unfortunately, I was all puffy and broken out underneath the make up.  Took a couple days for my face to recover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I liked how it looked so much that I put it aside to use for special dress up occassions.  I went back to my lighter powder foundation for every day.</li>
            <li> I have tried several BB creams and end up not using them because my T Zone is shiny in a matter of half hour. The Garnier BB cream for oily/combination does the job of keeping my T Zone matte, while also providing nice, easy to apply/blend coverage, without over drying the dry areas of my face and it has SPF 20. i think i&#x27;ll stick with this one!  also, i think it&#x27;s important to share my review for the benefit of other women, because we, customers, need unbiased reviews rather than subsidized \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; by magazines and blogs who get advertising money from a lot of the brands they \\&quot;review.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I received a tube of this bb cream from buzz agent in exchange for my honest review. I have an oily t zone and my cheeks are sometimes dry. I have been using this daily for two weeks and I like it. I have used loreal bb cream and find that the oil on my t zone will cause it to melt off my face, not good. This bb cream lasts all day and there is not a hint of shine on my nose. One thing I don&#x27;t like us that it can be drying to my skin, so I have to be vigilant about moisturizing at night. It doesn&#x27;t completely cover all of my post acne marks, but it does make my face look so much better with it on. I feel more confident wearing it, so I will be sticking with this bb cream!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cream for every day use but not for covering acne marks, etc</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cream. I did some searching on youtube before buying for product reviews and everyone was raving so I had to try it. So far I really like it! The coverage is really nice for a bb cream...all I need is a bit of concealer on problem areas and it&#x27;s perfect. Keeps my skin looking fresh with just enough shine to appear a bit dewy (which you can cover with powder if you prefer). It wears well all day as well. I&#x27;m very happy with it :)</li>
            <li> I had read about BB creams in several magazines and wanted to try some of this \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; potion.  I normally wear a \\&quot;high end\\&quot; foundation, but I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on a product I may not like, so I picked up this much less expensive product at my local drugstore.  In the past I have worn a mattifier underneath my foundation, in addition to powder, so I was hoping this all in one product would make my makeup routine more simple for the upcoming summer months.  Once I tried this, I was hooked.  The cream is a light-weight liquid that blends beautifully.  I have an oily \\&quot;T-zone\\&quot; and this BB cream did a great job of controlling the oil on my face.  I was so pleased to see that at the end of the day I didn&#x27;t look like \\&quot;orange\\&quot; (my makeup sometimes looks orange if my skin is extra oily.)  The coverage is sheer to begin with, but I had no trouble blending and layering enough product to produce an even, \\&quot;medium\\&quot; coverage.  If I am going to work, or just staying around the house, I use just enough product to even out my skin tone and provide sheer coverage.  I had a formal event to attend last week and I \\&quot;set\\&quot; the BB cream with loose powder, and it looked just as good as my Estee&#x27; Lauder foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints with this product is that over the course of the day, there is some \\&quot;settling\\&quot; of make-up in the corners of my nose.  In addition, I have experienced some dryness/flakiness along my hairline, along with a few fine bumps, which I have never had before. However, these things so far are not enough to make me toss the BB cream to the side.  I plan to make this my \\&quot;warm weather\\&quot; make-up, and I may end up making it my \\&quot;year &#x27;round\\&quot; make up.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the BB creams, the give little coverage, but add all the good stuff to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the very first one that actually matches my skin color.</li>
            <li> it is oily, but you have dry skin , it is good for you. it covers quite well.</li>
            <li> Love that this product is a concealer and sunscreen! Great product! :)</li>
            <li> I did really like except the color was reallllly orange looking. otherwise the consistency was great and easy application with beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Love it! Leaves skin very smooth and covers some red areas that I have. I bought light 2 and it&#x27;s a bit too dark for my fair skin, but I prefer it this way (instead of looking like a gost).</li>
            <li> I usually write good reviews, I&#x27;m pretty easily pleased, but for some reason this just didn&#x27;t catch with me. The &#x27;light&#x27; skin color is more for tan people, so I won&#x27;t really be able to use it, as it makes me look orange. I&#x27;m not very pale, either. It also came looking like it had been used, with the cap not completely screwed on, so that the foundation managed to leak out and into the box, which was also smashed. I&#x27;m not too happy.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a bb cream and or foundation to fight my oily skin. My skin gets SUPER oily through the day, not just on my T-zone but EVERYWHERE. I have triedâ¦..georgio armani luminous silk foundation, urban decay naked foundation, Missha BB cream, jane iredale foundation, etc. and they ALL made my skin very oily. I would constantly have to pat my face throughout the day to get the oil off. With this BB cream I do not, all I do is wash my face in the morning,&lt;br /&gt;So, I always look up video reviews on products before I buy them and I did for this one as well. The video convinced me to buy it and I&#x27;m so glad I did!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I do in the morning: I put on the garnier gel moisturizer (oil-free), and apply the BB cream afterwards with a buffing brush. I do not pat my face at all anymore and it lasts from 6AM (when I put my makeup on) until 5pm when I get home. Even around 5pm it STILL looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. I may just stock up!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Garnier!!</li>
            <li> Has more of a tint than other bb creams I&#x27;ve used, which I love. Also does not make me break out like many do.</li>
            <li> Excellent gift for my wifw</li>
            <li> I have combination/sensitive skin. I break out at the thought of moisture on my skin. That being said I decided to try this BB cream because I wanted to have a daily SPF. Well my skin was shinny and oily feeling (more so than usual) and I broke out like crazy for months after using this for a week. I wanted to like it but it just destroyed my complexion and made my skin look worse than before.</li>
            <li> Definitely improves the look of my skin. Better at oil control than almost any other lotion with a spf that I have tried. More liquid/lotion than cream. However, I really need the \\&quot;fair to light\\&quot; instead of a \\&quot;light to medium\\&quot;. (No gorgeous olive skin here, closer to sunglass worthy.) They don&#x27;t seem to make that in the oily skin formula. As I am 40 with a family history of melanoma and still struggle with acne, this is a fairly good solution.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, I have very oily skin and I thought this BB cream would help me as a foundation. It is better than the foundation I was already using, but still my face gets all shiny during the day. I t does have a more natural look and it feels lighter than foundation so it is great for summer.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this to me.  I was skeptical so I tried hers before I spent my money.  This stuff is awesome.  I don&#x27;t like a heavy foundation but I need a little coverage for my age speckled skin.  This BB cream is easy and fast to apply and the coverage is perfect for most days.  It doesn&#x27;t take any longer to apply than my normal moisturizer and I love that.  My skin is super oily so I do use oil control wipes during the day, but I have that problem with any product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally wear Bare Minerals in Golden Fair and the light/medium BB cream is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that is also has SPF 20 so I don&#x27;t have to apply sunscreen too.  That saves me time and money.  I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, and, trust me, protect yourself from the sun!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to morning face lotion.  I put it on right after getting out of the shower and let it set in for 10 min before applying foundation to my T-zone.  It provide the light coverage I&#x27;m looking for, and I can tell it has improved my skin tone.  I have combination skin and have had great success using cleansing oils, and this creme has the right amount of oils to hydrate, give a dewy glow, but not clog my pores.</li>
            <li> My brither love this, he do makeup business peaples,, and he said all hes costumer love it,,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying more expensive brands because I didn&#x27;t think a drugstore brand would be worth bothering with. I tried this on a whim, and I really like it! Goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t make my face look cakey. The matte is nice for our humid weather.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, this stuff is supposed to control the sebum. It just makes you slimy and oilier really.  Not impressed but it does have spf.  I use very little but still find I need to use a matifying oil control product in addition to this.  I may or may not purchase this again.  There&#x27;s a lot of other choices.  The price point is right on the low end so that&#x27;s a plus for economics but for performance, I give it 4.5 out of 10.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, and this has been great for controlling shine. Every BB cream I&#x27;ve tried prior to this has left a sheen on my skin that just emphasizes greasiness. I really recommend this one for having good coverage and minimizing oil.</li>
            <li> Contains octinoxate, a known hormone disrupting chemical used in many sunblocks. It&#x27;s too bad because the cream looks nice and dries into a matte finish, but the beauty aspect is not worth the damaging properties of the chemicals within the cream. Most creams contain chemicals but some are worse than others. Anything with sunblock in it should be checked for octinoxate, oxybenzone, and avobenzone. Those three are hormone disrupting and have been shown to cause DNA damage once the body absorbs them. Beware. If you need a product containing sunblock, opt for the ones which only contain titanium dioxide and zinc oxide which are much less harmful. Some of the clean brands of BB creams are Juice, Tarte, Philosophy, and Stila. There are more out there of course; you just have to do some research on the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Here are the cold-hard facts. This is a BB cream, so stop complaining about the lack of cover. I have never used a BB cream that covers blemishes entirely, particularly large blemishes, but I will say that this covers 80-90% of my small black-heads, enlarged pours, light hyper-pigmentation and most of my faded, post-acne marks. If I have a small acne cyst that is red, raised and inflamed, then no, this will not cover it completely, but it greatly reduces the amount of concealer that I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product WORKS. I can&#x27;t use moisturizers because most break me out and I don&#x27;t have hundreds of dollars to spend figuring out which ones don&#x27;t cause my skin to yell at me, but this alone moisturizes my skin as much as it needs to each morning that I use this. Also, it has not caused me to breakout and I have not gotten a new blemish since I started using this two weeks ago (which is bizarre because I have tried Neutrogena clear-skin makeup and clinique acne-free makeup with no success and more blemishes). I tend to get three zits a week (on average) so my complexion has dramatically improved while using this BB cream even after I take the cream off. I used to use this as a primer under my foundation (because this works as the best primer I have used in a long time), but now I feel confident just using this and a light amount of concealer because my skin has become that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the size of this product. It provides only slightly less coverage than traditional foundations, so if you want a more unison look, then two coats is what you need. I rarely use two coats because one coat is generally enough to cover most of my blemishes, but you can use two without breaking the bank because you basically get 4Xs the product due to the packages large size versus a traditional foundation. The product also doesn&#x27;t clump along my laugh-lines or my smile-lines around my eyes. It stays supple and fresh all day long with caking at all (something I cannot say about Neutrogena or Clinique). I LOVE the refreshing, cucumber-like scent and the fact that this product contains vitamin C because it works well with my vitamin C serum to brighten my skin. Also, unlike most acne makeup, this contains 2% salicylic acid vs. the 0.5% generally found in complexion saving makeup. Thus, you get more acne medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this has replaced my foundations for most days (though I use it as a primer under foundation on days I really want to sparkle and shine). It has become a staple in my beauty arsenal and I will definitely repurchase. HG worthy product for sure!bout Neutrogena or Clinique).

            <li> You only need a very small amount of this product to cover your face. But for someone who has skin with the tendency to get oily, I do not recommend this product. Within 3 hours your face will look really shiny/oily.</li>
            <li> I love (love!) this product.  I have sensitive skin that is very prone to breaking out.  This is a great product.  It&#x27;s coverage is perfect.  A little bit goes a long way.  I have young kids at home and little time for a careful makeup application.  This does the trick to even out my skin tone, cover up my blemishes and add some glow.  Most days, I skip the concealer and foundation and just apply this and a touch of bronzer.  What&#x27;s more, I think my skin might just be improving overall, now that I&#x27;ve been using this product.  Not sure if it&#x27;s a causal relationship, but I&#x27;ll certainly embrace the correlation.</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream. I use it everyday, whether it&#x27;s for a full makeup application or just a quickie coverage. It gives my face a smooth look. Seems to brighten my face with a healthy shine. I do have combination to oily skin and this cream does not dry my face out or make it oily, it does it&#x27;s job at controlling what and where need be. A friend of mine uses this cream for coverage on her varicose veins and it does the job. I don&#x27;t know how often she uses hers but I have been using the same tube for about a month and it is still full. I use less than a dime size on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but don&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re going to be in photos. The SPF reflects and makes your skin look pale.</li>
            <li> Having oily skin and trying other BB and CC creams, I was skeptical. I run on my lunch break every day and wanted something quick and easy to apply after my shower. Toting my normal bare minerals foundation around wasn&#x27;t practical so I figured a BB cream would be my best bet. This kept my skin from looking like an oil slick by the end of the day and had enough coverage to hide minor imperfections without looking caked on.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it blended a bit easier, hence 4 stars instead of 5. Perhaps a brush or sponge would work better. For ease of use, I won&#x27;t complain and will buy another tube when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Now THIS is what i expected when I first started hearing raves about \\&quot;BB Cream.\\&quot;  MUCH better than the original or \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Garnier BB Cream formula.  Instead of the thick, lotion like texture of the other one, this one has a thin, watery texture that sets to a near perfect matte finish that mostly stays put. Nice for putting on additional make up, like powder blush or eye shadow. the original bb cream from Garnier seemed way too thick for that. It never seem to &#x27;set&#x27; and would just wipe off easily.  This one for combination/oily skin offers great coverage, but its still &#x27;thin&#x27; and light enough that I can also put it all over my neck and chest area. So i have the SPF coverage AND my neck and chest look smooth and flawless too!  I actually bought a 2nd one, so I can have plenty.&lt;br /&gt;Havent been using it long enough to experience any break outs, but I wouldnt anticipate any. ( I have normal to dry skin, with the occasional monthly &#x27;hormonal&#x27; break out, usually around my chin and lower jawline area.)  and even being a little on the dry side, this bb cream is still just fine for me, not TOO matte. Perfect for when its hot out and you want a matte finish, as opposed to a dewey ( sweaty!) finish.  The ONLY thing, its not waterproof, so if you are outdoors for any length of time or sweating, you would need to reapply if you are using it for the SPF.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have a very red complexion (not rosacea, just red) plus very oily skin and I have tried every product at Macy&#x27;s. None work like this!  It is a watery product, but I prefer it that way so I don&#x27;t have a thick paste on my face. It covers the red easily plus absorbs oil.  Be sure you order the one for oily skin as there is a regular one, also. I still put my mineral foundation on top of this for complete coverage, but many of you may be able to use this alone. I even use it at night! The bottle is big so I am thinking it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this BB cream,first its size is bigger than others,the price is fair and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and very smooth</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it every day. The only problem- ever bottle I&#x27;ve ever had leaks! It&#x27;s crazy. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Much lighter than other light/medium toned bb creams</li>
            <li> After using the original Garnier BB the new Combination to Oily Skin product is like using water on my face.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t live up to the original Garnier BB which was thick and creamy.  Plus the bottle is .5 ounces less.  BIG disappointment!</li>
            <li> ive only just got this, so this is just a first impression.  i like it  :)  i used this for giving my skin a little evening out, before going to the gym, im not crazy into wearing a lot of makeup, because i actually workout and so therefore sweat.  this held up wonderfully and because i was lazy after i got home, i didnt wash my face and towards bedtime, my skin still looked smooth and even, as if i was wearing foundation!  i tried this because of a youtube guru i watch online and i agree with her review!  this stuff is awesome!!  yay!</li>
            <li> Color is perfect and leaves a matte finish, still don&#x27;t know about oil control during the whole day, I&#x27;m testing it</li>
            <li> This BB cream was extremely cakey and it streaked. The coverage was awful and it looked like I painted my face on. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this BB cream basically to use as a sunscreen for my face, I figured it would make me oily and shiny and probably cause acne, because most sunscreens made specially for your face still make me break out. But for the past week, I have totally replaced my regular makeup with this stuff! I took my son to the park, stood in the sun for a couple hours and got completely sweaty, I expected to be really gross and shiny when I finally looked in a mirror, but I was shine free and sunburn free, and after a week of wearing this, still acne free. (Not totally acne free, I am acne prone, but I don&#x27;t feel the BB cream is making it any worse than normal.)  I have sensitive, combination skin and really did not expect this to work, but so far, I really love it and haven&#x27;t even used any other make up. I&#x27;m so happy I gave this a try!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works really well in controlling oil and perfecting your skin. However, it is a little messy because its very liqiudy unlike other thicker BB creams. It doesn&#x27;t wash off your hands very well either so you have to use a sponge. I would give it 5 stars for coverage but the messiness is kinda of annoying</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it as my &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; and it works really well for those that don&#x27;t want to cake on the liquid makeup but want some coverage with a decent SPF.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It does exactly what it advertises. My skin tone looks nice and even and my face is shine free, which is saying something because I really really struggle with oily skin. It&#x27;s so nice to have a makeup that helps with my oily face and also helps my skin improve over time. Most concealers I have tried always seem to make my face worse over time, but not BB cream :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to keep buying this product and I recommend it to anyone who struggles with oily, hard to manage skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using the new Garnier BB Cream combo/oily skin light/med for a week now. I was highly skeptical about whether or not it would work for my super-oily, pitted, scarred, acne-covered skin. I&#x27;m extremely pleased!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Out of the tube, it seems strangely thin, so be warned: a little goes a LONG way! It has more coverage than I expected (yay!), so I don&#x27;t have to touch up every skin flaw with a concealer after applying the BB cream. I just have to hit the worst red spots. It easily fills in large pores without having to scrub it into them. I found it dried rather quickly to a satiny finish so I could proceed with the rest of my make up.&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I have to apply sunscreen then foundation, which does NOT work, but this product does both in one step. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, let&#x27;s be real, here. If your skin is super-duper oily like mine, after several hours you&#x27;re going to be a little shiny no matter what you use. However, it looks different when using this product. Instead of looking as though I dipped my face in olive oil, it looks like I applied a light-reflecting product. Really not bad at all! I&#x27;m pretty impressed so far!&lt;br /&gt;It wears pretty well, too. Last night I went to a concert with some friends and got rather hot and sweaty. When I looked in the mirror after I got home, I was pleased to see that the BB cream was still in place. I didn&#x27;t look bad at all! I haven&#x27;t noticed any new breakouts yet, so I have very high hopes that this might be the product I&#x27;ve waited for my entire life. (I&#x27;m older than you&#x27;d think!)&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shade goes, instead of light/medium, I&#x27;d call this LIGHT. It&#x27;s fine for my light-colored skin, but if you&#x27;re truly a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; tone, this might be too pale.&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Try it. I&#x27;m very pleased and surprised.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a total disappointment.  I had been using Estee Lauder BB cream and hoped this would be almost as good, but it&#x27;s pretty inferior.  First the colors are extremely light, even going for a shade darker than normal.  There is a LOT of water so it&#x27;s hard to work with because it&#x27;s so runny.  I left it open for 5 days to get some of the water to evaporate and that helped a little.  With or without the extra water, it&#x27;s very streaky and takes a lot of blending to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one positive is that I don&#x27;t get too shiny by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is not worth buying; and I&#x27;ll never buy it again.  I felt pretty ripped off by how poor the quality was.</li>
