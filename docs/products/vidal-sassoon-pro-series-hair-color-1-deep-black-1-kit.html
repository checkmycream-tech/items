    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Again, like I mentioned before I was very happy with the results and going on 2 weeks</li>

            <li>So glad I found this!!</li>
            <li>My hair feels great and looks amazing too!  </li>
            <li>So it probably rinsed out all of the wonderful conditioning magic that the treatment was intended for.&lt;br /&gt;After Colour Hair Quality:  </li>
            <li>A bit of a nose-burner during application, but the &#x27;morning after&#x27; smell was pleasant and I wasn&#x27;t worried that people would know</li>
            <li>its been 5 weeks,  and the color is still very strong!  </li>
            <li>Loved this color.</li>
            <li>Hair felt really good afterwards as well.</li>
            <li>Loved this product.</li>
            <li>It is a good tint.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself, but I&#x27;m very glad that I #GotItFree and had the chance to try it out.  </li>
            <li>The color comes out very nice, I have gotten many compliments, now I have darker hair</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>cause it was so very beautiful at first.</li>
            <li>Easy to use/apply and the color is really great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Colour came out nice, since I don&#x27;t bleach my hair at all, and depend on the sun/light to give the purple colour.</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s come the honest review :&lt;</li>
            <li>I received the invite to try Vidal Sassoon London Luxe, I was thrilled to participate.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice colour,</li>
            <li>The color&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t find a colour I really liked.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and did not drip.</li>
            <li>It was beautiful at first</li>
            <li>do recommend the product since the scent wasn&#x27;t invasive and the dye spot on skin were remove fairly easily!</li>
            <li>It looked great when I first dyed my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this hair color.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li>Gotta say I love how my hair turned out.</li>
            <li>With this Deep Velvet Violet, shade I am very happy &amp; pleased at my results.</li>
            <li>Well to be truthful after mixing and removing your finger from the tip of the bottle, you do get a bit of a whiff of chemical</li>
            <li>and I LOVE anything people</li>
            <li>Covered my fees grays and lasted longer than most do.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair twice, most of the colour washed out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I received compliments on how healthy was hair looked..</li>
            <li>Even after many washes, it was still more of a burgundy than a purple.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have been colouring my hair for many many many years, so I&#x27;m no stranger to boxed dyes.  </li>
            <li>(yes, I have one brand that does!)&lt;br /&gt;- includes a yummy post-dye treatment (who doesn&#x27;t love this part?)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li>This product is okay.  </li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s a lovely eggplant purple color now.</li>
            <li>I like the color and ordered more.  </li>
            <li>I get so many</li>
            <li>expect nothing more.</li>
            <li>I can use to get that color, and it has much more even coverage.</li>
            <li>I hoped for more from this product.</li>
            <li>Save your time and money and just get punky color, it&#x27;s does a lot better of a job than this product does.</li>
            <li>All in all this product is great if you want a vibrant change</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color at first but faded after three washes.</li>
            <li>Was very beautiful and vibrant at first, though.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased the first week</li>
            <li>But my daughter was very pleased with the purple tone this gave her hair, so much so that I ordered her more from here.</li>
            <li>The bottom of hair was light brown and the top a darker brown</li>
            <li>This was a beautiful color when I first tried it, I absolutely loved the color, but after a week, my hair was the same color that it was before I dyed it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this produce its color is so rich and easy to use I wash my hair every morning and</li>
            <li>Easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>Whether dyed or virgin, my hair looses permanent and demi-permanent color very quickly.</li>
            <li>Awesome dark purple color, it did fade within 3 weeks though.</li>
            <li>Love how this color came out..rich and true to the shade on the box.</li>
            <li>I use this color on my dark brown hair and it&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
            <li>This purple was perfect, not too over-the top but much brighter outside in the sun.  </li>
            <li>The colour on the box was perfect and despite my dark brown roots, the &amp;#34;simulated&amp;#34; pictures on the box looked like the colour</li>
            <li>That is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make me happy.  </li>
            <li>I got a free sample of the product from the company.</li>
            <li>and it was dyed light brown (with darker roots) when I used this dye.</li>
            <li>Tried this product for free.</li>
            <li>like I said I do have light hair to begin with</li>
            <li>This is the second purple dye I have tried and I&#x27;m really happy with this one.</li>
            <li>so I got this product for free.</li>
            <li>maybe under a lot of light you can see a eggplant color but thats it.</li>
            <li>After about three washes (I use sulfate/paraben free shampoo/conditioner) the color stops bleeding in the shower, or onto the towel.</li>
            <li>That might have something to do with the fact that purple is ammonia free.</li>
            <li>for two days a great purple, two weeks and the color on my roots that stayed left to show some gray.  </li>
            <li>I was given the chance to try this product for free by Vidal Sassoon and by being a member of Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>Great color, better than expected.</li>
            <li>I applied the dye all over but concentrated mostly on the ends because I wanted the color the most vibrant at the ends.</li>
            <li>Great product long lasting color with great technology in the formulation of this line of VS hair color</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the patience to be dying my hair more frequently, so I&#x27;m probably not going to use this color again, although I loved the look at first.</li>
            <li>Love the color, but it fades very fast.</li>
            <li>I did receive this as a Bzz agent review and glad I did because I have found a new favorite..</li>
            <li>After I rinsed out the dye I was excited to check out the results.</li>
            <li>Finally a nice new color..</li>
            <li>I washed it clean both times, but then the color started washing out almost immediately, and kept showing up in shower/bath water for 2 weeks after.</li>
            <li>It was a beautiful rich black, but even in the brightest light, you could not see the purple.</li>
            <li>The only qualm I have with the product is that once it begins to fade, the color begins to turn a bright red/burgundy.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a really dark purple, and I was worried since my hair was so light it wouldn&#x27;t work that well, but I&#x27;m really happy with how it came out.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I really wanted my hair to be purple (my favorite color).  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t catch the true color of the &amp;#34;Deep Violet Violet&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li>(I had to spend a full day at work with streaky hair, then bought two boxes and used them to even out the rest).</li>
            <li>It was beautiful when I first did it, but it only lasted til the first wash.</li>
            <li>Love the different shades and the fact there is not a horrible noxious smell.</li>
            <li>The color does fade out quickly with each wash or rinse.</li>
            <li>I super saturated the ends and held my hair in a shower cap to prevent dripping.</li>
            <li>I dyed over a faded dark burgundy and the color came out great.</li>
            <li>The color was great at first but 3.5 weeks later it&#x27;s fading fast.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this new product..</li>
            <li>Thanks Vidal Sassoon for letting me try this for free.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to try this item for free thanks for Vidal Sassoon and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I got to try this dye for free thanks to Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>But with this said the overall feeling on my hair was nice..</li>
            <li>But so worth it..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was fun while it lasted</li>
            <li>Two days later I washed my hair again with color protectant shampoo and with more of the conditioner provided with the original hair dye kit.</li>
            <li>When my hair dried, the ends showed up exactly as the example shown on the box for the light brown category, it was absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>The violet color stained absolutely everything for many, many washes, and didn&#x27;t cover any grey.</li>
            <li>so I was giving this a try regardless of if it was considered to be the right shade for me...</li>
            <li>Good intense color for about 4 weeks with a slow fade to a more auburn color.</li>
            <li>I take very good care of my hair and this left it feeling very dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>Also I leave it on a few min&#x27;s more than it says to, because it gives me a better look</li>
            <li>The color wasnt as bright as I hoped for and did leave a little staining on the scalp..</li>
            <li>This color was a nice compliment, it gave a warm purple sheen in the sun, a flat plum color under indoor lights and was almost black in dim light.</li>
            <li>It left my hair in better condition than when i Started.</li>
            <li>Pretty disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it was more on the red side which I wasn&#x27;t opposed off, just wasn&#x27;t expecting it.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it with just those couple of suggestions about making the colour last longer and how many boxes you should need for your hair length.</li>
            <li>gave me exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s pretty crazy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I ran out of hot water).  </li>
            <li>I am really upset I was really going for a nice deep violet color</li>
            <li>After a couple washes, it faded to a burgundy-ish shade, more red than purple.</li>
            <li>I have dyed my hear two to four times a year for many years now, and have only had two dyes just not work</li>
            <li>The roots are pretty and if I could have gotten all over coverage it would have gotten 4 stars.</li>
            <li>The colour however had more hints of red than purple.</li>
            <li>The photo attached is from the second week when the colour started fading and the purple started showing more</li>
            <li>/&gt;- has good grey coverage (I&#x27;m showing early signs of silver)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product was very straight forward and easy to use, no nasty harsh chemical smell.</li>
            <li>but when I dyed my hair it was balayage, the top being black/ very dark brown and the bottom being a light ashy blonde/light brown color.</li>
            <li>However, it is a brown with very strong violet highlights - not a straight violet.</li>
            <li>first picture shows up lighter than it did in real life.</li>
            <li>I love the ease to do it, there was alot in the bottle to cover my long hair..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 3 weeks, and I think the color is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this color for about 4 weeks now, and it hasn&#x27;t really faded all the much!</li>
            <li>It did change my hair to a nice dark amethyst color.  </li>
            <li>The result weren&#x27;t as flashy as i&#x27;d love, but it gave me nice shiny purple reflect all over, with a deep black/purple shade under it :)</li>
            <li>I have to be under direct light in order for other people to see it, but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I had gotten my hair professionally done, but the color faded out quickly.</li>
            <li>Mess free, hassle free.</li>
            <li>The color came out beautifully, no foul smell, easy to apply and the conditioner was amazing.</li>
            <li>There is so much in the kit</li>
            <li>Of course, whenever you do something like putting a violet color on your hair you have to be ready for some startled looks and not everyone will be a fan.</li>
            <li>this faded really really fast.</li>
            <li>worked better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li>Faded fast the color started to fade after 2 washes</li>
            <li>After applying to the whole head</li>
            <li>faded soooo fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fade fast.</li>
            <li>Been using this dye for almost a year straight.</li>
            <li>You can really only tell that it&#x27;s purple in the light.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li>Does fade kinda fast though.</li>
            <li>There should be a disclaimer on the box that says you will only achieve the color that&#x27;s on the box if you have light hair even though the examples they use are brown.</li>
            <li>Thanks, BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>really chep, this is sold in market at $13</li>
            <li>time I dye my hair with this color, I will use a little less water pressure overall to see if that takes care of the problem of the brassiness I have experienced with this color :)</li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally find a purple permanent hair color.</li>
            <li>I have used many, many other boxed dyes in many different colors, but this is the least damaging dye I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>more like dark burgundy /:</li>
            <li>Not worth it for a permanent colour, it was more a rinse.</li>
            <li>After the first box, it was completely gone after 2 washes.</li>
            <li>Have a look at the comparison of my hair with the box.&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  Not bad, actually.  </li>
            <li>After following all the appropriate steps, I did not shampoo and only conditioned using the provided conditioner.</li>
            <li>For the price and hype (vibrant color over 48 washes)</li>
            <li>My hair does not usually keep color very well.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I was invited to try the product because I had wanted to colour my hair purple for a really long time</li>
            <li>all, i love it, but the color matching on the back isn&#x27;t quite right for Dark brown hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Needless to say I wasn&#x27;t happy</li>
            <li>Now her hair is growing out where the dark dye was and this really looks fantastic on her.</li>
            <li>and I know a few have tried it they love it too.</li>
            <li>I have dyed my hair for years with many other products, and I have to say this is my least favorite ever.</li>
            <li>Great for medium to dark brown hair to give it a little purple flare while still being professional in appearance.</li>
            <li>I liked the easy to use, minimal mess dye and the minimal smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very very dark and only shows some of the deep plum tint when standing in the bright sun.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this product because I was so excited there was finally a deep purpleish, permanent hair dye.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application: This mixture was thick, creamy (I am used to gel which seems to spread better in my hair) and I used 1.5 bottles to get full coverage in my long hair.  </li>
            <li>This color starts off very dark/almost black, and over about two/three weeks it lightens to a very pretty plum purple.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this colour, which I received free from BzzAgent, and with dark brown hair I questioned whether the colour would show up, but the guide on the box shows that even black hair would gain a purple glow/tint, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I do have fine, light coloured hair and in the past with other attempts at dying my hair/ends purple (fav.color)</li>
            <li>I also found that unlike other colouring products, very little product leaked/fell on the floor since the consistency of the product was good.</li>
            <li>6 weeks later the color is still very vibrant.</li>
            <li>have dark brown hair and used this kind of shade before with other brand.</li>
            <li>My natural hair color is dark brown and this dye gave me a very beautiful dark - almost black - color with a deep purple gleam to it...for about 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>This made my hair very dark, with a hint of purple when the light catches it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a very dark brown color and all it did was put a more red based burgundy color tint to it.</li>
            <li>Instructions were clear.  </li>
            <li>and it still didn&#x27;t run clear.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally medium/dark brown hair</li>
            <li>The second picture shows how much it faded after one week</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally a level 5/6, a medium Brown.</li>
            <li>I had a few really important events to attend, so I held off with the colour in case it didn&#x27;t work out</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>One bottle was enough to colour my whole head.</li>
            <li>The colour also became a lot more uneven after only 3 washes.</li>
            <li>The other thing is as many other reviews stated it drys your hair out.</li>
            <li>I wanted a fun color without having to lighten and fry my dark hair.  </li>
            <li>the colour is pretty much all gone, with only little hints of pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is different now than it was when I first colored, but I still like it and it is still different than traditional reds or violets, even in its faded state.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all brands of boxed dyes in the past but this perhaps was the least effective even though I paid $10.28 which is more than I usually pay for boxed dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was pleasently surprised with the initial outcome.</li>
            <li>The under layer of my hair was barely dyed.</li>
            <li>Some pictures showed tiger striping with the old mousy colour peeking through and comments that there wasn&#x27;t enough product for hair lengths shorter than mine.  </li>
            <li>received my full size product to try as well as several coupons from BzzAgent within a few days of choosing my shade.  </li>
            <li>It  was very dark, very pretty though, maybe I&#x27;ll try it on bleached hair next</li>
            <li>/&gt;THE PRICE of this is less then $9.00 at Walmart amd other online retailers and only $10 at most brick and morter retailers, local grocery stores and drug stores.</li>
            <li>It is still somewhat runny where I was expecting it to be thicker, but no worse then other colouring products.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a deep plum color and the violet mixed with my old burgundy</li>
            <li>After the second, it&#x27;s almost entirely gone after 3 washes, and will probably be completely gone after four.</li>
            <li>After a few washes, however, the colour got brighter and the purple showed a little more (but only in the sunlight).</li>
            <li>It took about five washes before the color was barely even red anymore.</li>
            <li>I chalked that up to having used a box of Color Oops before dying in order to get some of the old color out of my hair, but I used the same color again just over a week ago without the pretreater, and my hair is almost back to the same color again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some other reviews on here that say they have seen colour fading and that it can be due to not being the right shade for them,</li>
            <li>I was really worried that it fried the ends, but the next day&#x27;s regular shampoo/conditioner/mask seemed to settle that down.  </li>
            <li>would come out vibrant enough on my dark hair as well.</li>

            <li> My hair feels great and looks amazing too!  </li>
            <li> So it probably rinsed out all of the wonderful conditioning magic that the treatment was intended for.&lt;br /&gt;After Colour Hair Quality:  </li>
            <li> A bit of a nose-burner during application, but the &#x27;morning after&#x27; smell was pleasant and I wasn&#x27;t worried that people would know</li>
            <li> its been 5 weeks,  and the color is still very strong!  </li>

            <li> Easy to use/apply and the color is really great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Colour came out nice, since I don&#x27;t bleach my hair at all, and depend on the sun/light to give the purple colour.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s come the honest review :&lt;</li>
            <li> I received the invite to try Vidal Sassoon London Luxe, I was thrilled to participate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice colour,</li>
            <li> The color&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t find a colour I really liked.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and did not drip.</li>
            <li> It was beautiful at first</li>
            <li> do recommend the product since the scent wasn&#x27;t invasive and the dye spot on skin were remove fairly easily!</li>
            <li> It looked great when I first dyed my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hair color.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> Gotta say I love how my hair turned out.</li>
            <li> With this Deep Velvet Violet, shade I am very happy &amp; pleased at my results.</li>
            <li> Well to be truthful after mixing and removing your finger from the tip of the bottle, you do get a bit of a whiff of chemical</li>
            <li> and I LOVE anything people</li>
            <li> Covered my fees grays and lasted longer than most do.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair twice, most of the colour washed out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I received compliments on how healthy was hair looked..</li>
            <li> Even after many washes, it was still more of a burgundy than a purple.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been colouring my hair for many many many years, so I&#x27;m no stranger to boxed dyes.  </li>
            <li> (yes, I have one brand that does!)&lt;br /&gt;- includes a yummy post-dye treatment (who doesn&#x27;t love this part?)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li> This product is okay.  </li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s a lovely eggplant purple color now.</li>
            <li> I like the color and ordered more.  </li>
            <li> I get so many</li>
            <li> expect nothing more.</li>
            <li> I can use to get that color, and it has much more even coverage.</li>
            <li> I hoped for more from this product.</li>
            <li> Save your time and money and just get punky color, it&#x27;s does a lot better of a job than this product does.</li>
            <li> All in all this product is great if you want a vibrant change</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color at first but faded after three washes.</li>
            <li> Was very beautiful and vibrant at first, though.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased the first week</li>
            <li> But my daughter was very pleased with the purple tone this gave her hair, so much so that I ordered her more from here.</li>
            <li> The bottom of hair was light brown and the top a darker brown</li>
            <li> This was a beautiful color when I first tried it, I absolutely loved the color, but after a week, my hair was the same color that it was before I dyed it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this produce its color is so rich and easy to use I wash my hair every morning and</li>
            <li> Easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> Whether dyed or virgin, my hair looses permanent and demi-permanent color very quickly.</li>
            <li> Awesome dark purple color, it did fade within 3 weeks though.</li>
            <li> Love how this color came out..rich and true to the shade on the box.</li>
            <li> I use this color on my dark brown hair and it&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
            <li> This purple was perfect, not too over-the top but much brighter outside in the sun.  </li>
            <li> The colour on the box was perfect and despite my dark brown roots, the &amp;#34;simulated&amp;#34; pictures on the box looked like the colour</li>
            <li> That is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make me happy.  </li>
            <li> I got a free sample of the product from the company.</li>
            <li> and it was dyed light brown (with darker roots) when I used this dye.</li>
            <li> Tried this product for free.</li>
            <li> like I said I do have light hair to begin with</li>
            <li> This is the second purple dye I have tried and I&#x27;m really happy with this one.</li>
            <li> so I got this product for free.</li>
            <li> maybe under a lot of light you can see a eggplant color but thats it.</li>
            <li> After about three washes (I use sulfate/paraben free shampoo/conditioner) the color stops bleeding in the shower, or onto the towel.</li>
            <li> That might have something to do with the fact that purple is ammonia free.</li>
            <li> for two days a great purple, two weeks and the color on my roots that stayed left to show some gray.  </li>
            <li> I was given the chance to try this product for free by Vidal Sassoon and by being a member of Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> Great color, better than expected.</li>
            <li> I applied the dye all over but concentrated mostly on the ends because I wanted the color the most vibrant at the ends.</li>
            <li> Great product long lasting color with great technology in the formulation of this line of VS hair color</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the patience to be dying my hair more frequently, so I&#x27;m probably not going to use this color again, although I loved the look at first.</li>
            <li> Love the color, but it fades very fast.</li>
            <li> I did receive this as a Bzz agent review and glad I did because I have found a new favorite..</li>
            <li> After I rinsed out the dye I was excited to check out the results.</li>
            <li> Finally a nice new color..</li>
            <li> I washed it clean both times, but then the color started washing out almost immediately, and kept showing up in shower/bath water for 2 weeks after.</li>
            <li> It was a beautiful rich black, but even in the brightest light, you could not see the purple.</li>
            <li> The only qualm I have with the product is that once it begins to fade, the color begins to turn a bright red/burgundy.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a really dark purple, and I was worried since my hair was so light it wouldn&#x27;t work that well, but I&#x27;m really happy with how it came out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I really wanted my hair to be purple (my favorite color).  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t catch the true color of the &amp;#34;Deep Violet Violet&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li> (I had to spend a full day at work with streaky hair, then bought two boxes and used them to even out the rest).</li>
            <li> It was beautiful when I first did it, but it only lasted til the first wash.</li>
            <li> Love the different shades and the fact there is not a horrible noxious smell.</li>
            <li> The color does fade out quickly with each wash or rinse.</li>
            <li> I super saturated the ends and held my hair in a shower cap to prevent dripping.</li>
            <li> I dyed over a faded dark burgundy and the color came out great.</li>
            <li> The color was great at first but 3.5 weeks later it&#x27;s fading fast.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this new product..</li>
            <li> Thanks Vidal Sassoon for letting me try this for free.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this item for free thanks for Vidal Sassoon and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I got to try this dye for free thanks to Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> But with this said the overall feeling on my hair was nice..</li>
            <li> But so worth it..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was fun while it lasted</li>
            <li> Two days later I washed my hair again with color protectant shampoo and with more of the conditioner provided with the original hair dye kit.</li>
            <li> When my hair dried, the ends showed up exactly as the example shown on the box for the light brown category, it was absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> The violet color stained absolutely everything for many, many washes, and didn&#x27;t cover any grey.</li>
            <li> so I was giving this a try regardless of if it was considered to be the right shade for me...</li>
            <li> Good intense color for about 4 weeks with a slow fade to a more auburn color.</li>
            <li> I take very good care of my hair and this left it feeling very dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Also I leave it on a few min&#x27;s more than it says to, because it gives me a better look</li>
            <li> The color wasnt as bright as I hoped for and did leave a little staining on the scalp..</li>
            <li> This color was a nice compliment, it gave a warm purple sheen in the sun, a flat plum color under indoor lights and was almost black in dim light.</li>
            <li> It left my hair in better condition than when i Started.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it was more on the red side which I wasn&#x27;t opposed off, just wasn&#x27;t expecting it.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it with just those couple of suggestions about making the colour last longer and how many boxes you should need for your hair length.</li>
            <li> gave me exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s pretty crazy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I ran out of hot water).  </li>
            <li> I am really upset I was really going for a nice deep violet color</li>
            <li> After a couple washes, it faded to a burgundy-ish shade, more red than purple.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hear two to four times a year for many years now, and have only had two dyes just not work</li>
            <li> The roots are pretty and if I could have gotten all over coverage it would have gotten 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The colour however had more hints of red than purple.</li>
            <li> The photo attached is from the second week when the colour started fading and the purple started showing more</li>
            <li> /&gt;- has good grey coverage (I&#x27;m showing early signs of silver)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product was very straight forward and easy to use, no nasty harsh chemical smell.</li>
            <li> but when I dyed my hair it was balayage, the top being black/ very dark brown and the bottom being a light ashy blonde/light brown color.</li>
            <li> However, it is a brown with very strong violet highlights - not a straight violet.</li>
            <li> first picture shows up lighter than it did in real life.</li>
            <li> I love the ease to do it, there was alot in the bottle to cover my long hair..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks, and I think the color is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this color for about 4 weeks now, and it hasn&#x27;t really faded all the much!</li>
            <li> It did change my hair to a nice dark amethyst color.  </li>
            <li> The result weren&#x27;t as flashy as i&#x27;d love, but it gave me nice shiny purple reflect all over, with a deep black/purple shade under it :)</li>
            <li> I have to be under direct light in order for other people to see it, but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten my hair professionally done, but the color faded out quickly.</li>
            <li> Mess free, hassle free.</li>
            <li> The color came out beautifully, no foul smell, easy to apply and the conditioner was amazing.</li>
            <li> There is so much in the kit</li>
            <li> Of course, whenever you do something like putting a violet color on your hair you have to be ready for some startled looks and not everyone will be a fan.</li>
            <li> this faded really really fast.</li>
            <li> worked better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Faded fast the color started to fade after 2 washes</li>
            <li> After applying to the whole head</li>
            <li> faded soooo fast.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fade fast.</li>
            <li> Been using this dye for almost a year straight.</li>
            <li> You can really only tell that it&#x27;s purple in the light.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> Does fade kinda fast though.</li>
            <li> There should be a disclaimer on the box that says you will only achieve the color that&#x27;s on the box if you have light hair even though the examples they use are brown.</li>
            <li> Thanks, BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> really chep, this is sold in market at $13</li>
            <li> time I dye my hair with this color, I will use a little less water pressure overall to see if that takes care of the problem of the brassiness I have experienced with this color :)</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally find a purple permanent hair color.</li>
            <li> I have used many, many other boxed dyes in many different colors, but this is the least damaging dye I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> more like dark burgundy /:</li>
            <li> Not worth it for a permanent colour, it was more a rinse.</li>
            <li> After the first box, it was completely gone after 2 washes.</li>
            <li> Have a look at the comparison of my hair with the box.&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  Not bad, actually.  </li>
            <li> After following all the appropriate steps, I did not shampoo and only conditioned using the provided conditioner.</li>
            <li> For the price and hype (vibrant color over 48 washes)</li>
            <li> My hair does not usually keep color very well.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I was invited to try the product because I had wanted to colour my hair purple for a really long time</li>
            <li> all, i love it, but the color matching on the back isn&#x27;t quite right for Dark brown hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say I wasn&#x27;t happy</li>
            <li> Now her hair is growing out where the dark dye was and this really looks fantastic on her.</li>
            <li> and I know a few have tried it they love it too.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair for years with many other products, and I have to say this is my least favorite ever.</li>
            <li> Great for medium to dark brown hair to give it a little purple flare while still being professional in appearance.</li>
            <li> I liked the easy to use, minimal mess dye and the minimal smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very dark and only shows some of the deep plum tint when standing in the bright sun.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this product because I was so excited there was finally a deep purpleish, permanent hair dye.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application: This mixture was thick, creamy (I am used to gel which seems to spread better in my hair) and I used 1.5 bottles to get full coverage in my long hair.  </li>
            <li> This color starts off very dark/almost black, and over about two/three weeks it lightens to a very pretty plum purple.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this colour, which I received free from BzzAgent, and with dark brown hair I questioned whether the colour would show up, but the guide on the box shows that even black hair would gain a purple glow/tint, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I do have fine, light coloured hair and in the past with other attempts at dying my hair/ends purple (fav.color)</li>
            <li> I also found that unlike other colouring products, very little product leaked/fell on the floor since the consistency of the product was good.</li>
            <li> 6 weeks later the color is still very vibrant.</li>
            <li> have dark brown hair and used this kind of shade before with other brand.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is dark brown and this dye gave me a very beautiful dark - almost black - color with a deep purple gleam to it...for about 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> This made my hair very dark, with a hint of purple when the light catches it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a very dark brown color and all it did was put a more red based burgundy color tint to it.</li>
            <li> Instructions were clear.  </li>
            <li> and it still didn&#x27;t run clear.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally medium/dark brown hair</li>
            <li> The second picture shows how much it faded after one week</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a level 5/6, a medium Brown.</li>
            <li> I had a few really important events to attend, so I held off with the colour in case it didn&#x27;t work out</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> One bottle was enough to colour my whole head.</li>
            <li> The colour also became a lot more uneven after only 3 washes.</li>
            <li> The other thing is as many other reviews stated it drys your hair out.</li>
            <li> I wanted a fun color without having to lighten and fry my dark hair.  </li>
            <li> the colour is pretty much all gone, with only little hints of pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is different now than it was when I first colored, but I still like it and it is still different than traditional reds or violets, even in its faded state.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all brands of boxed dyes in the past but this perhaps was the least effective even though I paid $10.28 which is more than I usually pay for boxed dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was pleasently surprised with the initial outcome.</li>
            <li> The under layer of my hair was barely dyed.</li>
            <li> Some pictures showed tiger striping with the old mousy colour peeking through and comments that there wasn&#x27;t enough product for hair lengths shorter than mine.  </li>
            <li> received my full size product to try as well as several coupons from BzzAgent within a few days of choosing my shade.  </li>
            <li> It  was very dark, very pretty though, maybe I&#x27;ll try it on bleached hair next</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE PRICE of this is less then $9.00 at Walmart amd other online retailers and only $10 at most brick and morter retailers, local grocery stores and drug stores.</li>
            <li> It is still somewhat runny where I was expecting it to be thicker, but no worse then other colouring products.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a deep plum color and the violet mixed with my old burgundy</li>
            <li> After the second, it&#x27;s almost entirely gone after 3 washes, and will probably be completely gone after four.</li>
            <li> After a few washes, however, the colour got brighter and the purple showed a little more (but only in the sunlight).</li>
            <li> It took about five washes before the color was barely even red anymore.</li>
            <li> I chalked that up to having used a box of Color Oops before dying in order to get some of the old color out of my hair, but I used the same color again just over a week ago without the pretreater, and my hair is almost back to the same color again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some other reviews on here that say they have seen colour fading and that it can be due to not being the right shade for them,</li>
            <li> I was really worried that it fried the ends, but the next day&#x27;s regular shampoo/conditioner/mask seemed to settle that down.  </li>
            <li> would come out vibrant enough on my dark hair as well.</li>
            <li> Sadly the vibrant color completely washed out leaving my hair a murky brown with purple undertones but only if you look really</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting pics, one is in direct sunlight, where it looks redder, and the other is indirect daylight.</li>
            <li> The colour that I did get though was vibrant and didn&#x27;t make my hair feel dried out or frizzy after using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my share of fails and have grown fond of a few favorite products which were selected over time to meet a specific set of quality criteria:&lt;br /&gt;- a shade that is close to my natural colour</li>
            <li> My hair is also pretty thick.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m guessing, these products are helping to keep the color from washing down the drain completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, unlike every other colouring products I&#x27;ve tried, this one barely smelled like ammonia and instead had a floral scent so that was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colour results shown on the back of the box were for brown hair or black, whereas mine is a red toned brown and my daughter is a blonde.</li>
            <li> The color is different than other similar products I&#x27;ve tried and seems to stand out.  </li>
            <li> I will say if you have anything longer then shoulder length hair and you plan on dying your whole head you will need 2 boxes at least.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I needed two boxes because my hair is long, and I might as well have thrown my money out the car window.  </li>
            <li> you (if that was what I was going for), but definitely not close to what I had expected.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had tried this long before.</li>
            <li> Definitely not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The dying process wasn&#x27;t too difficult, same old same old.</li>
            <li> Same as the other colored I purchased.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the burgundy color, but there are other dyes (John Freida in Deep Cherry Brown)</li>
            <li> My main complaint is the staying power.</li>
            <li> covers all of my hair in one single bottle</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 17, has been dying her hair dark for a very long time, abd anyone who uses dark can tell you how difficult it is to see a difference when using a different color on top of the dark.</li>
            <li> I promise it is a dark, deep purple...</li>
            <li> I have never outside of this product used a dark hair dye that was as drying as this one.</li>
            <li> Initially, after rinsing (no shampoo, as per the instructions) and drying my hair, it looked really dark.</li>
            <li> but then a total let down.</li>
            <li> After two weeks, the color was only a little noticeable at the roots, everything else had disappeared.</li>
            <li> Even using Shea Moisture brand products (no sulfates, parabens, etc) and with minimal washing, it fades after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> But  be careful when rinsing the die out of your hair just like</li>
            <li> I have naturally light/medium brown hair, I wanted to dye my hair a subtle purple without having to bleach it.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally very dark brown hair, that currently is slightly red from a previous dye.</li>
            <li> I found that the color doesn&#x27;t bleed out as much as other brands.</li>
            <li> So disappointed, because this cooler purple color worked better for my skin tone than Feria&#x27;s warmer purple dye</li>
            <li> ( I condition my hair every day and wash it every other day)  </li>
            <li> every other die it will stain if it gets on something</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;m used to when other brands.</li>
            <li> This color was subtle on my dark hair, and completely washed out after one shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Even using the color-stay conditioner and washing in cold water, I barely got 2.5 weeks of decent color.</li>
            <li> The end results is a dull dark red color.</li>
            <li> The violet tone is very minimal in jet black hair.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this colour if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li> When I dyed my hair, it was extremely dark.</li>
            <li> , i have a dark brown hair color and all it did was make it darker.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointing on how quick the color faded..</li>
            <li> is black</li>
            <li> jus jet black</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally black</li>
            <li> It would have taken less effort.</li>
            <li> Like, almost black.</li>
            <li> I wanted the purple with my black hair.</li>
            <li> I found there was less dye</li>
            <li> Lasted less</li>
            <li> but instead it looks all BLACK.</li>
            <li> as directed my hair turned black rather than Purple.</li>
            <li> and I could only see subtle hints of purple.</li>
            <li> My hair had been coloured before so the bottom half of it was a lighter brown, sort of copper.</li>
            <li> but so did my previously discolored hair.</li>
            <li> also be prepared to make a mess everywhere</li>
            <li> Yes, a little bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for a purple color that will stay a little longer than a week or 2.</li>
            <li> hair is about medium length and goes a little lower than my shoulders.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very dark brown</li>
            <li> After my hair air dried, it was a very dark plum purple which I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Given that I&#x27;m now 41 and looking for something crazy and outlandish to shock my friends (because I can&#x27;t afford a Ferrari), I selected 3VR Deep Velvet Violet because it looked like I might walk away with hair the same shade as grape pop.  </li>
            <li> I would, however, purchase this hair color again because it&#x27;s one of the few that I have come across that doesn&#x27;t require me to bleach my hair in order to obtain the color.  </li>
            <li> have purchased a few of the VS products to keep the color longer (shampoo, mask and cream gloss).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> and I could let my hair rest for a few weeks before doing a rescue colour.  </li>
            <li> I will admit, I did peek at a few reviews of the product and got the sense that one bottle wouldn&#x27;t colour all of my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I expected the color to at least show at the bottom</li>
            <li> I bought this in store, in burgundy actually, but this was the worse hair dye I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> No more purple than the burgundy color of other less expensive haircolors (i use revlon dark burgundy)</li>
            <li> and since I already have dark hair, it is subtle.</li>
            <li> very little fade between applications</li>
            <li> I have never dyed my hair with a colour so out of the ordinary</li>
            <li> The colour is not what I&#x27;d hoped for and it would be expensive to have to buy 2 boxes for each application (especially if it isn&#x27;t the colour I wanted).  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t wash out or fade for at least 4 weeks (because I&#x27;m lazy...</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair developed a weird kinky coarse texture and was breaking :(  </li>
            <li> really disappointed considering I used to think highly of Vidal Sassoon products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t recolored in quite some time, at least 3 months.  </li>
            <li> least they do what you expect.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick or hair longer than shoulder length get two boxes.</li>
            <li> It slowly faded until it was a bronze like color.</li>
            <li> I was not really happy with how it treated my hair either.</li>
            <li> then other dyes I&#x27;ve used :(</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, the redness has to be the base color in the product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed that the color didn&#x27;t last longer.</li>
            <li> Not impressed</li>
            <li> It has faded horribly in the last 6 days.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the colour did not take to my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- a product that smells less terrible</li>
            <li> To my disappointment there was no change at all, even in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> Well, my scalp itched like crazy</li>
            <li> it is bad</li>
            <li> I used it as directed and the color wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> but it is a bad product use it as a temporary color but</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this :(</li>
            <li> Horrible shipping method.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looks horrible and splotchy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I purchased this product because I really wanted my hair to be purple (my favorite color).  It did change my hair to a nice dark amethyst color.  I have to be under direct light in order for other people to see it, but that&#x27;s okay.  The only qualm I have with the product is that once it begins to fade, the color begins to turn a bright red/burgundy.  I have dark brown hair, the redness has to be the base color in the product.  That is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make me happy.  I would, however, purchase this hair color again because it&#x27;s one of the few that I have come across that doesn&#x27;t require me to bleach my hair in order to obtain the color.  My hair is loc&#x27;ed and I refuse to bleach it.  Dyeing it is bad enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased a few of the VS products to keep the color longer (shampoo, mask and cream gloss).  So far, I&#x27;m guessing, these products are helping to keep the color from washing down the drain completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I dye my hair with this color, I will use a little less water pressure overall to see if that takes care of the problem of the brassiness I have experienced with this color :)</li>
            <li> Great color, better than expected.</li>
            <li> Beautiful temporary color. Horrible shipping method.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of the product from the company. I used it and have to say its different. There is so much in the kit then there is two steps instead of just one. You mix the color and such and brush on your roots and let sit for a bit then do the rest of you hair so that the color matches correctly, and evenly. I found that the color doesn&#x27;t bleed out as much as other brands. It left my hair in better condition than when i Started. I have told friends abut it and I know a few have tried it they love it too. If you have thick or hair longer than shoulder length get two boxes.</li>
            <li> My hair did not look  purple at all. It was a beautiful rich black, but even in the brightest light, you could not see the purple.</li>
            <li> Great for medium to dark brown hair to give it a little purple flare while still being professional in appearance.</li>
            <li> I love this hair color. Easy to use/apply and the color is really great. It is a beautiful violet over brown. I get a lot of compliments. Of course, whenever you do something like putting a violet color on your hair you have to be ready for some startled looks and not everyone will be a fan. However, it is a brown with very strong violet highlights - not a straight violet.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I have been dying my hair for years, and this dye did not take at ALL. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> more like dark burgundy /:</li>
            <li> **update** this faded really really fast. It took about five washes before the color was barely even red anymore. The purple lasted a wash or two. Pretty disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t washed my hair yet, so I&#x27;ll probably update this when I see how it fades.&lt;br /&gt;This worked better than I expected it to. I have naturally medium/dark brown hair and it was dyed light brown (with darker roots) when I used this dye. I was hoping for a really dark purple, and I was worried since my hair was so light it wouldn&#x27;t work that well, but I&#x27;m really happy with how it came out. I&#x27;m posting pics, one is in direct sunlight, where it looks redder, and the other is indirect daylight.</li>
            <li> Awesome dark purple color, it did fade within 3 weeks though. But it didn&#x27;t stain literally everything like Splat colour does. It  was very dark, very pretty though, maybe I&#x27;ll try it on bleached hair next</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this produce its color is so rich and easy to use I wash my hair every morning and very little fade between applications I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I always buy this color it&#x27;s my favorite but I just finished coloring my hair and my hair is black there&#x27;s no purple in it at all jus jet black I look like I just died</li>
            <li> Tried this product for free. Given to me by Bzzagent. Mess free, hassle free. Colour came out nice, since I don&#x27;t bleach my hair at all, and depend on the sun/light to give the purple colour. Will purchase in future</li>
            <li> Received a sample of this product thru BzzAgent #GotItFree. Will I try it again? Yes, but with a different colour to change it up. Love the different shades and the fact there is not a horrible noxious smell. It is still somewhat runny where I was expecting it to be thicker, but no worse then other colouring products.  The colour results shown on the back of the box were for brown hair or black, whereas mine is a red toned brown and my daughter is a blonde. She picked the colour for a bit of an adventure and we got it. Love it! @Vidal Sassoon London Luxe.</li>
            <li> Gotta say I love how my hair turned out. I do have fine, light coloured hair and in the past with other attempts at dying my hair/ends purple (fav.color), the color never tends to stay. With this Deep Velvet Violet, shade I am very happy &amp; pleased at my results. I get great compliments. The product was very straight forward and easy to use, no nasty harsh chemical smell. Well to be truthful after mixing and removing your finger from the tip of the bottle, you do get a bit of a whiff of chemical but it somehow doesn&#x27;t stay around and give your headache. I&#x27;ve seen some other reviews on here that say they have seen colour fading and that it can be due to not being the right shade for them, like I said I do have light hair to begin with and I LOVE anything people so I was giving this a try regardless of if it was considered to be the right shade for me... Again, like I mentioned before I was very happy with the results and going on 2 weeks, I&#x27;m still happy. Do I see the color washing out when I shower? Yes, a little bit but I do/did expect this.. I&#x27;ve included a pic. of my results but the camera doesn&#x27;t do it justice. I&#x27;ve tried taking indoors/outdoors, different cameras but it doesn&#x27;t catch the true color of the &amp;#34;Deep Violet Violet&amp;#34; shade. I promise it is a dark, deep purple... Thanks Vidal Sassoon for letting me try this for free. #GotItFree #BzzAgent</li>
            <li> Color looked like eggplant.  Several days later the color faded to a redish color.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try this color again.</li>
            <li> Faded fast the color started to fade after 2 washes</li>
            <li> The violet tone is very minimal in jet black hair. Its just a hint not a shade you can say. I have to tell verbally my friends that i dyed my hair. I like the quality of the hair dye. It does not brittle or frizz the hair. My hair moisture level is intact.</li>
            <li> This color gets a lot of compliments.  The color does fade out quickly with each wash or rinse.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color at first but faded after three washes. My hair is naturally black but when I dyed my hair it was balayage, the top being black/ very dark brown and the bottom being a light ashy blonde/light brown color. I applied the dye all over but concentrated mostly on the ends because I wanted the color the most vibrant at the ends. After applying to the whole head I super saturated the ends and held my hair in a shower cap to prevent dripping. After following all the appropriate steps, I did not shampoo and only conditioned using the provided conditioner. After my hair air dried, it was a very dark plum purple which I didn&#x27;t mind. Two days later I washed my hair again with color protectant shampoo and with more of the conditioner provided with the original hair dye kit. When my hair dried, the ends showed up exactly as the example shown on the box for the light brown category, it was absolutely gorgeous. Sadly the vibrant color completely washed out leaving my hair a murky brown with purple undertones but only if you look really hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed considering I used to think highly of Vidal Sassoon products. I&#x27;ve used all brands of boxed dyes in the past but this perhaps was the least effective even though I paid $10.28 which is more than I usually pay for boxed dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first picture shows up lighter than it did in real life. The second picture shows how much it faded after one week</li>
            <li> I have naturally light/medium brown hair, I wanted to dye my hair a subtle purple without having to bleach it.  This made my hair very dark, with a hint of purple when the light catches it.  Instructions were clear.  Easy to follow.  Package arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Love the color, but it fades very fast. Even using Shea Moisture brand products (no sulfates, parabens, etc) and with minimal washing, it fades after a couple of weeks. Even just wetting hair, it would bleed into the water. After two weeks, the color was only a little noticeable at the roots, everything else had disappeared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this product as a part of the Vidal Sasson BZZAgent campaing and all of this for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s come the honest review :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair and used this kind of shade before with other brand. The result weren&#x27;t as flashy as i&#x27;d love, but it gave me nice shiny purple reflect all over, with a deep black/purple shade under it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, i love it, but the color matching on the back isn&#x27;t quite right for Dark brown hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend the product since the scent wasn&#x27;t invasive and the dye spot on skin were remove fairly easily!</li>
            <li> Loved this color. Covered my fees grays and lasted longer than most do. Hair felt really good afterwards as well.</li>
            <li> Same as the other colored I purchased.  It looked great when I first dyed my hair. Then after a few washes, the color faded fast. The end results is a dull dark red color.</li>
            <li> This color was subtle on my dark hair, and completely washed out after one shampoo.  Extremely disappointed.  I needed two boxes because my hair is long, and I might as well have thrown my money out the car window.  It would have taken less effort.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair twice, most of the colour washed out of my hair.  Not worth it for a permanent colour, it was more a rinse.</li>
            <li> Great product as well as price. Thank you.</li>
            <li> faded soooo fast. Not impressed</li>
            <li> Great, great color. Washed out after 2 weeks though.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product because I was so excited there was finally a deep purpleish, permanent hair dye. I used it as directed and the color wasn&#x27;t bad but it definitely was not deep velvet. My hair is a very dark brown color and all it did was put a more red based burgundy color tint to it. I was not really happy with how it treated my hair either. I take very good care of my hair and this left it feeling very dry and unmanageable. I have dyed my hair for years with many other products, and I have to say this is my least favorite ever. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Literally my go-to hair dye. Dyes evenly, not splotchy. Definitely worth the money. Doesn&#x27;t fade fast. Been using this dye for almost a year straight. My hair is naturally a level 5/6, a medium Brown.</li>
            <li> This is the second purple dye I have tried and I&#x27;m really happy with this one. It&#x27;s a permanent color and since I already have dark hair, it is subtle. You can really only tell that it&#x27;s purple in the light. One box was enough for my hair that comes to about the middle of my back. The gloves that come with it are latex and durable enough to not let the dye through to my hands. I really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> Finally a nice new color.. I was very excited to try this new product..I love the ease to do it, there was alot in the bottle to cover my long hair.. The color wasnt as bright as I hoped for and did leave a little staining on the scalp.. But with this said the overall feeling on my hair was nice.. I received compliments on how healthy was hair looked.. Was a little disappointing on how quick the color faded.. But so worth it.. I will definitely use this one again.. I did receive this as a Bzz agent review and glad I did because I have found a new favorite..</li>
            <li> Great color! I love purple and now I can wear it all the time! Does fade kinda fast though.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this item for free thanks for Vidal Sassoon and BzzAgent. The dying process wasn&#x27;t too difficult, same old same old. The colour payoff well, wasn&#x27;t purple, it was more on the red side which I wasn&#x27;t opposed off, just wasn&#x27;t expecting it. For a permanent hair dye, the colour seems to be fading a lot every time I wash my hair where my ombre ends are turning back to brown.</li>
            <li> I got to test this Vidal Sassoon London Luxe Velvet Violet as part of a BzzAgent campaign so I got this product for free. I have never dyed my hair with a colour so out of the ordinary but I was pleasently surprised with the initial outcome. There was no chemical scent with this product while it was applied and it didn&#x27;t drip while being applied either. I will say if you have anything longer then shoulder length hair and you plan on dying your whole head you will need 2 boxes at least. I have medium length hair and it didn&#x27;t not fully saturate all my hair. The under layer of my hair was barely dyed. The colour that I did get though was vibrant and didn&#x27;t make my hair feel dried out or frizzy after using this product. It has been almost 2 weeks now and the colour has started to fade quite a bit. I would suggest using a &amp;#34;colour saving&amp;#34; shampoo and condition to make the colour last longer. All in all this product is great if you want a vibrant change and I would recommend it with just those couple of suggestions about making the colour last longer and how many boxes you should need for your hair length.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length hair and always use 1 box, but this hair color brand required 2. (I had to spend a full day at work with streaky hair, then bought two boxes and used them to even out the rest). I washed it clean both times, but then the color started washing out almost immediately, and kept showing up in shower/bath water for 2 weeks after. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks, and I think the color is pretty much gone. So disappointed, because this cooler purple color worked better for my skin tone than Feria&#x27;s warmer purple dye (though it washed out even faster).</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this colour, which I received free from BzzAgent, and with dark brown hair I questioned whether the colour would show up, but the guide on the box shows that even black hair would gain a purple glow/tint, so I gave it a try. After I rinsed out the dye I was excited to check out the results. To my disappointment there was no change at all, even in the sunlight. I would not recommend this colour if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li> I dyed over a faded dark burgundy and the color came out great. I wanted a deep plum color and the violet mixed with my old burgundy gave me exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> There should be a disclaimer on the box that says you will only achieve the color that&#x27;s on the box if you have light hair even though the examples they use are brown. When I dyed my hair, it was extremely dark. Like, almost black. The only way you could tell it was purple is if I was out in the sun. The color came off in my shower and on my pillow case. Even after many washes, it was still more of a burgundy than a purple. I STILL HAVE stains underneath my fingernails and I dyed it about a week ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this cause I wanted the purple with my black hair. I was so excited to finally find a purple permanent hair color. I was very pleased the first week but after that it faded. I even bought the shampoo by Vidal Sassoon that it recommended on the box. It slowly faded until it was a bronze like color. Needless to say I wasn&#x27;t happy cause I wanted the purple color. It was beautiful at first but then a total let down. I&#x27;m still looking for a purple color that will stay a little longer than a week or 2. Wish this would have worked out cause it was so very beautiful at first. I wish they would improve it cause if they did I would try it again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been colouring my hair for many many many years, so I&#x27;m no stranger to boxed dyes.  I&#x27;ve had my share of fails and have grown fond of a few favorite products which were selected over time to meet a specific set of quality criteria:&lt;br /&gt;- a shade that is close to my natural colour (so that I have a bit of time before the roots give me away)&lt;br /&gt;- a product that smells less terrible (since they all smell terrible)&lt;br /&gt;- covers all of my hair in one single bottle (yes, I have one brand that does!)&lt;br /&gt;- includes a yummy post-dye treatment (who doesn&#x27;t love this part?)&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t wash out or fade for at least 4 weeks (because I&#x27;m lazy... err... busy)&lt;br /&gt;- has good grey coverage (I&#x27;m showing early signs of silver)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the invite to try Vidal Sassoon London Luxe, I was thrilled to participate.  Given that I&#x27;m now 41 and looking for something crazy and outlandish to shock my friends (because I can&#x27;t afford a Ferrari), I selected 3VR Deep Velvet Violet because it looked like I might walk away with hair the same shade as grape pop.  And that&#x27;s pretty crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my full size product to try as well as several coupons from BzzAgent within a few days of choosing my shade.  I had a few really important events to attend, so I held off with the colour in case it didn&#x27;t work out and I could let my hair rest for a few weeks before doing a rescue colour.  I will admit, I did peek at a few reviews of the product and got the sense that one bottle wouldn&#x27;t colour all of my hair.  Some pictures showed tiger striping with the old mousy colour peeking through and comments that there wasn&#x27;t enough product for hair lengths shorter than mine.  THIS COULD BE TECHNIQUE, but not taking a chance, I purchased a second bottle at $13.94 (forgot to use my coupons!!!) and I&#x27;m so glad I did that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: This mixture was thick, creamy (I am used to gel which seems to spread better in my hair) and I used 1.5 bottles to get full coverage in my long hair.  I applied from root to tip and left it on for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Colour Accuracy: Nope.  Not grape pop.  Not even eggplant.  It&#x27;s very very dark and only shows some of the deep plum tint when standing in the bright sun.  It&#x27;s a nice colour, mind you (if that was what I was going for), but definitely not close to what I had expected.  Have a look at the comparison of my hair with the box.&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  Not bad, actually.  A bit of a nose-burner during application, but the &#x27;morning after&#x27; smell was pleasant and I wasn&#x27;t worried that people would know I just dyed it.  Mind you this time, I wanted everyone to know!!  (but not because i stunk)&lt;br /&gt;Conditioning Treatment:  This stuff is amazing.  It smells like a cocktail on a tropical beach and feels simply delicious in your hair.  Problem is, I had to rinse FOREVER and it still didn&#x27;t run clear.  So it probably rinsed out all of the wonderful conditioning magic that the treatment was intended for.&lt;br /&gt;After Colour Hair Quality:  Well, my scalp itched like crazy (maybe because I didn&#x27;t rinse it all out... but I ran out of hot water).  The ends of my hair developed a weird kinky coarse texture and was breaking :(  I was really worried that it fried the ends, but the next day&#x27;s regular shampoo/conditioner/mask seemed to settle that down.  *phew*&lt;br /&gt;Durability:  Too soon to say, but the water was still the colour of Cabernet Sauvignon when I shampooed this morning.  Might not meet my 4 week standards if this continues.&lt;br /&gt;Grey coverage:  I don&#x27;t see any silver, so I think the product does well for this need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This product is okay.  The colour is not what I&#x27;d hoped for and it would be expensive to have to buy 2 boxes for each application (especially if it isn&#x27;t the colour I wanted).  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself, but I&#x27;m very glad that I #GotItFree and had the chance to try it out.  Thanks, BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is dark brown and this dye gave me a very beautiful dark - almost black - color with a deep purple gleam to it...for about 2-3 days. Now, on the fourth day after I dyed it, I&#x27;ve noticed that the color is already fading to a reddish-burgandy color. Very disappointed that the color didn&#x27;t last longer. Was very beautiful and vibrant at first, though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this type personally but I bought one box on clearance at Walgreens- London Lilac. My daughter LOVES it. She&#x27;s 17, has been dying her hair dark for a very long time, abd anyone who uses dark can tell you how difficult it is to see a difference when using a different color on top of the dark. But my daughter was very pleased with the purple tone this gave her hair, so much so that I ordered her more from here. Now her hair is growing out where the dark dye was and this really looks fantastic on her. She&#x27;s very happy.</li>
            <li> Given some of the reviews I was expecting this to suck. To my total shock, it actually worked. My hair&#x27;s a lovely eggplant purple color now. Maybe it&#x27;s because I left it on for an hour instead of the recommended length of time? I wish I had tried this long before.</li>
            <li> 6 weeks later the color is still very vibrant. Used along with their colorfinity shampoo. Very easy to apply and did not drip. This is the best haircolor I have used in a while. Will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> Love how this color came out..rich and true to the shade on the box. Won&#x27;t be spending $100.00 at the salon again.</li>
            <li> I love this color!!  I was worried on how it would turn out!  but I love it!!  its been 5 weeks,  and the color is still very strong!  ( I condition my hair every day and wash it every other day)  But  be careful when rinsing the die out of your hair just like every other die it will stain if it gets on something</li>
            <li> Loved this product. The color came out beautifully, no foul smell, easy to apply and the conditioner was amazing. My hair feels great and looks amazing too!  I received this product as part of a promotion for this brand and would definitely recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> So happy to find this color</li>
            <li> I got to try this dye for free thanks to Vidal Sassoon. I liked the easy to use, minimal mess dye and the minimal smell. I found there was less dye then I&#x27;m used to when other brands. The color was great at first but 3.5 weeks later it&#x27;s fading fast. Lasted less then other dyes I&#x27;ve used :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this :( I am really upset I was really going for a nice deep violet color but instead it looks all BLACK. The bottom of hair was light brown and the top a darker brown so I expected the color to at least show at the bottom but NOTHING...wow I should have never even bothered dying my hair. Keep in my mind I only left it on my hair for 30minutues..</li>
            <li> I like the color and ordered more.  The color is different than other similar products I&#x27;ve tried and seems to stand out.  I haven&#x27;t recolored in quite some time, at least 3 months.  The color is different now than it was when I first colored, but I still like it and it is still different than traditional reds or violets, even in its faded state.</li>
            <li> Well it didnt make my hair purple, i have a dark brown hair color and all it did was make it darker. maybe under a lot of light you can see a eggplant color but thats it. also be prepared to make a mess everywhere</li>
            <li> really chep, this is sold in market at $13</li>
            <li> Not worth your money. I had ombre hair where the bottom was blonde, after applying and waiting 25min as directed my hair turned black rather than Purple. Use manic panic instead.</li>
            <li> I used to use Splat to keep my hair purple, but I will never go back. My hair does not usually keep color very well. Whether dyed or virgin, my hair looses permanent and demi-permanent color very quickly. This color starts off very dark/almost black, and over about two/three weeks it lightens to a very pretty plum purple. After about three washes (I use sulfate/paraben free shampoo/conditioner) the color stops bleeding in the shower, or onto the towel. I have used many, many other boxed dyes in many different colors, but this is the least damaging dye I&#x27;ve used. That might have something to do with the fact that purple is ammonia free.</li>
            <li> I use this color on my dark brown hair and it&#x27;s beautiful! I get so many compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PRICE of this is less then $9.00 at Walmart amd other online retailers and only $10 at most brick and morter retailers, local grocery stores and drug stores. The seller&#x27;s on Amazon selling this for so much more than suggested retail are being completely unrealistic and I am offended of this type of price gouging!</li>
            <li> This was a beautiful color when I first tried it, I absolutely loved the color, but after a week, my hair was the same color that it was before I dyed it. I chalked that up to having used a box of Color Oops before dying in order to get some of the old color out of my hair, but I used the same color again just over a week ago without the pretreater, and my hair is almost back to the same color again. For reference, I wash my hair twice a week. After the first box, it was completely gone after 2 washes. After the second, it&#x27;s almost entirely gone after 3 washes, and will probably be completely gone after four. I definitely will not be trying this brand again.</li>
            <li> two applications in two weeks and the color was gone after three shampoos. for two days a great purple, two weeks and the color on my roots that stayed left to show some gray.  Stick to manic panic or ion -at least they do what you expect.  I tried to make it work but it is a bad product use it as a temporary color but expect nothing more.</li>
            <li> It is a good tint.The color&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Dyed my shoulder length hair this color. Get two boxes! It has faded horribly in the last 6 days. It&#x27;s looks horrible and splotchy. I will be dying it another color asap. It was beautiful when I first did it, but it only lasted til the first wash.</li>
            <li> The violet color stained absolutely everything for many, many washes, and didn&#x27;t cover any grey.</li>
            <li> This was just the color I was looking for!! I had gotten my hair professionally done, but the color faded out quickly. I&#x27;ve had this color for about 4 weeks now, and it hasn&#x27;t really faded all the much! I&#x27;M SOLD!! I will be buying this every time I need touchups! So glad I found this!!</li>
            <li> The color was beautiful... for two or three days. After a couple washes, it faded to a burgundy-ish shade, more red than purple. And eventually the burgundy started to fade out, but not evenly. I didn&#x27;t mind the burgundy color, but there are other dyes (John Freida in Deep Cherry Brown) I can use to get that color, and it has much more even coverage.</li>
            <li> I wanted a fun color without having to lighten and fry my dark hair.  This purple was perfect, not too over-the top but much brighter outside in the sun.  Good intense color for about 4 weeks with a slow fade to a more auburn color.</li>
            <li> Washed out after about 5 washes. For the price and hype (vibrant color over 48 washes) I hoped for more from this product.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very dark brown hair, that currently is slightly red from a previous dye. This color was a nice compliment, it gave a warm purple sheen in the sun, a flat plum color under indoor lights and was almost black in dim light. My main complaint is the staying power. Even using the color-stay conditioner and washing in cold water, I barely got 2.5 weeks of decent color. I don&#x27;t have the patience to be dying my hair more frequently, so I&#x27;m probably not going to use this color again, although I loved the look at first.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hear two to four times a year for many years now, and have only had two dyes just not work and this is one of them. I started with my ends and let it set for about ten minutes before moving on to my roots. Despite this my roots were still the only place to take any color took. The roots are pretty and if I could have gotten all over coverage it would have gotten 4 stars. The other thing is as many other reviews stated it drys your hair out. I have never outside of this product used a dark hair dye that was as drying as this one.</li>
            <li> Great product long lasting color with great technology in the formulation of this line of VS hair color</li>
            <li> The color comes out very nice, I have gotten many compliments, now I have darker hair so this gives me a great purplish tint. Also I leave it on a few min&#x27;s more than it says to, because it gives me a better look</li>
            <li> No more purple than the burgundy color of other less expensive haircolors (i use revlon dark burgundy)</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to try this product for free by Vidal Sassoon and by being a member of Bzz Agent. I was really excited when I was invited to try the product because I had wanted to colour my hair purple for a really long time but I couldn&#x27;t find a colour I really liked. The colour on the box was perfect and despite my dark brown roots, the &amp;#34;simulated&amp;#34; pictures on the box looked like the colour would come out vibrant enough on my dark hair as well. I had read reviews that one box was insufficient and that the dye was runny. I found that the dye was actually perfectly creamy. It was runny enough to get through my hair properly but creamy enough to stay on my hair without leaking everywhere. I also found that unlike other colouring products, very little product leaked/fell on the floor since the consistency of the product was good. Also, unlike every other colouring products I&#x27;ve tried, this one barely smelled like ammonia and instead had a floral scent so that was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is about medium length and goes a little lower than my shoulders. My hair is also pretty thick. One bottle was enough to colour my whole head. After I was done applying colour to every strand, I actually still had leftover product to spread over areas that seemed drier. Initially, after rinsing (no shampoo, as per the instructions) and drying my hair, it looked really dark. My hair is naturally very dark brown but the dye made my hair noticeably darker. I looked in all sorts of different lights and I could only see subtle hints of purple. Definitely not what I expected. After a few washes, however, the colour got brighter and the purple showed a little more (but only in the sunlight). The colour however had more hints of red than purple. The colour also became a lot more uneven after only 3 washes. My hair had been coloured before so the bottom half of it was a lighter brown, sort of copper. Although the dye initially coloured my hair evenly, once the dye started fading the discoloured​ part of my hair showed again. Finally, it&#x27;s been 4 weeks since I coloured my hair and the colour is pretty much all gone, with only little hints of pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was fun while it lasted but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. The photo attached is from the second week when the colour started fading and the purple started showing more but so did my previously discolored hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this in store, in burgundy actually, but this was the worse hair dye I&#x27;ve ever had. It literally did nothing to my hair. I followed the instructions, and none of the color actually stayed on my hair, the only thing it did was make my hair darker. Save your time and money and just get punky color, it&#x27;s does a lot better of a job than this product does.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the colour did not take to my hair at all.  not even in sunlight....</li>
