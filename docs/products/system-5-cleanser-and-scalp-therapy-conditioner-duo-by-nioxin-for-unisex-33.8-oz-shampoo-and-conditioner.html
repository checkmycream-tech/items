            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel, healthy!</li>

            <li>far as the cost goes, this listing is the best value I&#x27;ve found online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Before purchasing this product, make sure you go to nioxin website and use the \\&quot;consultation tool\\&quot; to see with system is suitable for you.</li>
            <li>this bottle lasts me the better part of a year.</li>

            <li>and I am really satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>comments aside, I realize that there are many factors that can influence hair loss.</li>
            <li>Love it for the value.</li>
            <li>and I remember feeling a lot more &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; when I used it.</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a shampoo that was safe for color treated hair that would also take the place of using a dandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance</li>
            <li>I do not believe that this system grows more hair, but it will let you keep the hair that you have.</li>
            <li>my hair just looks great in general.  </li>
            <li>Much smoother and holds curl better!</li>
            <li>My hair feels nice and clean after every use...and the tingling feeling is pretty</li>
            <li>i am huge fan of this company products.</li>
            <li>For months I&#x27;ve had itchy bumps on my scalp that would ooze and scab primarily when I was stressed or after a workout.</li>
            <li>Great price on this item, however when I received it today, it was leaking from the top of one of the bottles slimy and also messy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard Folicure works better, and it&#x27;s much cheaper...</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair full and silky</li>
            <li>I have a full head of hair, I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Well packaged order and arrived quite quickly.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get such a great deal but the first time I used the product ordered through Amazon I could tell it was not the same formula and my hair certainly showed it!!</li>
            <li>I received this very promptly and everything was 100% accurate.</li>
            <li>, this product is helping my hair go in the right direction.</li>
            <li>It really makes your hair look full and stops some of the falling out.</li>
            <li>It relieves a little of the itch, but not as good as H&amp;S.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly I a wanted.</li>
            <li>I bought the Nioxin system 5 duo on Amazon over a year ago and have been using it consistently since then.</li>
            <li>Stuff really works!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind this since my hair looks so much smoother and healthier!</li>
            <li>Product exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This product is usually good but last time I bought it didn&#x27;t smell or felt the same.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time, love it.  </li>
            <li>My hair used to straighten pretty easily and hold that way for most of the day (I have naturally wavy hair), but when I use Nioxin and straighten it, it goes immediately wavy within half an hour.</li>
            <li>I have used Nioxin 2 and Nioxin 3, but this number works better for my hair, probably since mine is a dry scalp issue not a thinning issue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say Nioxin is the cause of this, but it certainly hasn&#x27;t helped.</li>
            <li>I was getting very nervous that the thinning and shortening would continue unabated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much so I have been a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>It really cleans and moist</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much has leaked out</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t look like it was much.....</li>
            <li>This really helps with preventing hair loss with all the medications that I am on</li>
            <li>Shipped very timely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only is this product geared towards both genders but it can also be used daily on your hair if you have a color treatment or perm of any kind without ruining your treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can notice that flakes have significantly been reduced after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>This is not the same product I originally purchased from the salon.</li>
            <li>I went back to the salon and bought the original product.</li>
            <li>I am just finishing off my previous supply and hope the current formula - if changed - is as good as the product in the brown bottles.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>might need to package it for shipping a little better.</li>
            <li>The rest of my order was fine but the cleanser and scalp therapy #5 bottles smelt different to what Ive had before and were not the same colour inside the bottle and didnt make my head tingle like it normally does.</li>
            <li>Everyone encouraged my wife to use this shampoo to fight hair fall and help with new hair growth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible that my hair loss slowed down for other reasons, but I am happy with the way my hair looks and feels while using this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although, I do not have any chemical on my hair, as I do not need it, I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in proper haircare and nutrition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner work well, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the authentic stuff...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think she is willing to try it a third time</li>
            <li>, it is simply falling out at a normal rate, but new hair isn&#x27;t growing in fast enough to meet the length of older hair, so I have had to trim my hair shorter and shorter.  </li>
            <li>I was getting pretty light on the top of my head for the past two years or so, so I figure I need to wait at least two years before my hair is back to normal</li>
            <li>After ditching the &amp;#34;new Nioxin&amp;#34; I tried six other products and found that the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil scalp therapy adequately replaces the old Nioxin.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair soft, but not tangle free....still need to use my leave-in conditioner to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li>It was the old model brown bottle.</li>
            <li>Have only been using a few weeks, but LOVE how my hair looks.</li>
            <li>These products do NOT weigh my hair down; they leave my hair full of body and looking healthy and thick.  </li>
            <li>Normally when buying beauty products online I am weary since the products should only be bought in the salon or they are not backed by the manufacturer (nioxin/wella).</li>
            <li>one thing that I do not care for in general is that retailers including Amazon.com are still offering the older brand of this product, located in brown bottles, that is so totally different from the newer model and/or brand that it is beyond belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We encountered another review on amazon claiming that it worked for a year and the new order was different in odor and result and the difference was that it was made in Mexico.</li>
            <li>The hair loss has really slowed down to a normal level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No full stars yet only because I haven&#x27;t had it long term to give accurate feedback.</li>
            <li>would recommend it to anyone who likes the fresh feeling as opposed to a heavy and very scented feeling of other products.</li>
            <li>no longer have any thin spots and my wavy hair is easy to comb and control.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;It has also been very difficult for me to find this product online recently and would love any feedback from anyone regarding an online reliable retailer that offers this product in the event that I cannot find it again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shampoo really produces lots of suds with only a small amount.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the formula has changed, or if this isn&#x27;t the real product.</li>
            <li> This product does keep the hair looking pretty thick</li>
            <li> Even though my hair was shedding at a natural rate, it is now shedding at half the rate it was before use.  </li>
            <li> ringlet hair, and over the last few years I have lost nearly 1/3 of it.  </li>
            <li> I have long, curly.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and always have to shampoo twice, but not with this product....</li>
            <li> I am going to stick with this system as long as I can.</li>
            <li> It left my hair like that soft, wavy, manageable hair in the tv commercials, something few other shampoos have managed to do.</li>

            <li> I use this along with the scalp treatment and 10,000 mcg of biotin a day and my hair is growing back after a side effect from some medication made it fall out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months now. I have less thinning and my hair appear thicker.</li>
            <li> This is a product with good quality and excellent results for hair loss, good quality, on time very satisfy with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and it seems to be doing what it&#x27;s supposed to. I can notice that flakes have significantly been reduced after only a couple of uses. No full stars yet only because I haven&#x27;t had it long term to give accurate feedback.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my sebarrach (sp?)dermatitis on my scalp. (A dry scalp condition that makes me look like I have dandruff) I do not have thinning hair, so I don&#x27;t use it for that. I have tried T-Gel, but that brand stinks and does not condition. I have used Nioxin 2 and Nioxin 3, but this number works better for my hair, probably since mine is a dry scalp issue not a thinning issue. I have been using this product for years and love it! I especially like that you only need a small amount of shampoo &amp; conditioner, used as directed, so this bottle lasts me the better part of a year. I used to get it from my salon, but it&#x27;s about half price here. I have used it in hard water, and now soft water and it works well in both types.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  Use it religiously everyday.  Even leave it in for at least five minutes.  Hair still looks thin.  Perhaps some of you have had better luck.</li>
            <li> This is not the same product I originally purchased from the salon. I was thrilled to get such a great deal but the first time I used the product ordered through Amazon I could tell it was not the same formula and my hair certainly showed it!! I went back to the salon and bought the original product.</li>
            <li> My hair has been an essential part of my identity throughout my adulthood.  I have long, curly. ringlet hair, and over the last few years I have lost nearly 1/3 of it.  It isn&#x27;t falling out unnaturally, it is simply falling out at a normal rate, but new hair isn&#x27;t growing in fast enough to meet the length of older hair, so I have had to trim my hair shorter and shorter.  I was getting very nervous that the thinning and shortening would continue unabated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after reading product reviews online, I thought I would try Nioxin.  Wow.  Even though my hair was shedding at a natural rate, it is now shedding at half the rate it was before use.  These products do NOT weigh my hair down; they leave my hair full of body and looking healthy and thick.  I noticed the difference within 3-4 weeks of use and the effects have not stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had amazing results with these products.  Again, it didn&#x27;t happen overnight, but I am no longer fearful about losing length and body.  Give this product a try and be a little patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also purchased and used the Nioxin Intensive Therapy Deep Repair Hair Unisex Masque for an extra boost and recommend that as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin products since 1998 when my hairdresser recommended them for my thinning hair. The results have been excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have any thin spots and my wavy hair is easy to comb and control.  I received this very promptly and everything was 100% accurate.</li>
            <li> MADE MY HAIR FALL OUT MORE AND MADE MY HAIR FEEL LIKE STRAW. THIS IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY FOR THE PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo at a friend&#x27;s house, and I knew I had to have it. It left my hair like that soft, wavy, manageable hair in the tv commercials, something few other shampoos have managed to do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and swear by it.  It works so well with my hair and is so cleansing that I refuse to use anything else but this product. It is absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this product geared towards both genders but it can also be used daily on your hair if you have a color treatment or perm of any kind without ruining your treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I do not have any chemical on my hair, as I do not need it, I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in proper haircare and nutrition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I do not care for in general is that retailers including Amazon.com are still offering the older brand of this product, located in brown bottles, that is so totally different from the newer model and/or brand that it is beyond belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has also been very difficult for me to find this product online recently and would love any feedback from anyone regarding an online reliable retailer that offers this product in the event that I cannot find it again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin, you have an everlasting customer in me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually very skeptical of these things but I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and my hair just looks great in general.  So much so I have been a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 months and I am really satisfied with the results. Amazon offers the best price.</li>
            <li> effective product that I already used with a price that cannot be matched by retail&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product if you have thinning hair</li>
            <li> After going through a month of rapid hair loss, I set out in search of something that would help me at least slow or stop my hair loss until I can see my doctor and identify the cause. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week now, and my hair feels like it used to when I had tons of it. The hair loss has really slowed down to a normal level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My comments aside, I realize that there are many factors that can influence hair loss. In my case, I suspect it&#x27;s related to hormone fluctuation. It&#x27;s possible that my hair loss slowed down for other reasons, but I am happy with the way my hair looks and feels while using this product. I plan to keep using it. Everyone&#x27;s experience of the same product can vary, so the only way to know if you&#x27;ll like it is to try it. If you&#x27;re not sure about taking the plunge, order a starter kit with smaller sized bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the cost goes, this listing is the best value I&#x27;ve found online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend. In my case, a friend recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin before. To my surprise System 5, which used to be labeled as &amp;#34;natural hair,&amp;#34; now says &amp;#34;chemically treated.&amp;#34; I had to do some research to find that it seems to apply to both, but am not happy about the inadequate, changed labeling. I am just finishing off my previous supply and hope the current formula - if changed - is as good as the product in the brown bottles.</li>
            <li> I thought it will help the dryness and hair loss, did not help the way I was expecting. I also think it is a good products and I will recommend them.</li>
            <li> Third time purchasing this combo package. Love it for the value. Great product and results</li>
            <li> Loved the a product. It was exactly I a wanted. My hair is definitely healthier. I would recommend this product a100%. For people that are loosing hair.</li>
            <li> Excelent excelent excelent product. I recommend it for colored hair it minimizes the hair lost. It really cleans and moist</li>
            <li> Great price on this item, however when I received it today, it was leaking from the top of one of the bottles slimy and also messy! I don&#x27;t know how much has leaked out doesn&#x27;t look like it was much.....might need to package it for shipping a little better.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my hair stylist and I love it! It helps smooth my frizzy hair and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I am over 50 and have as yet to go through the change and found my hair thinning.  I color it and was concerned about losing it!!  My hair has stopped thinning and is back to it usual self.  Not as thick as it was but I am not looking for miracles here!</li>
            <li> Normally when buying beauty products online I am weary since the products should only be bought in the salon or they are not backed by the manufacturer (nioxin/wella). For the price and for being online the product seems to work just as well as the products bought in the salon.</li>
            <li> Everyone encouraged my wife to use this shampoo to fight hair fall and help with new hair growth. We consulted the online experts from Nixion and they offered Nixion 5 and we ordered it online from this provider. But soon her hair fall increased and no new hair growth was observed. Also dandruff was added to her problems. We encountered another review on amazon claiming that it worked for a year and the new order was different in odor and result and the difference was that it was made in Mexico. We also checked with a friend claiming it worked for her and she said hers is made in USA. So we concluded that we should go for a made in USA product from a store rather than trusting Amazon providers. So don&#x27;t order this product if you like your hair!</li>
            <li> This product is usually good but last time I bought it didn&#x27;t smell or felt the same.</li>
            <li> I do feel like this product is helping my hair grow back. I was getting pretty light on the top of my head for the past two years or so, so I figure I need to wait at least two years before my hair is back to normal, this product is helping my hair go in the right direction.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t work as they claim.</li>
            <li> I bought the Nioxin system 5 duo on Amazon over a year ago and have been using it consistently since then. I have not only noticed zero difference in my hair loss, but it actually seems like my hair has gotten thinner! I&#x27;m not going to say Nioxin is the cause of this, but it certainly hasn&#x27;t helped. Additionally, it makes my hair really dry and hard to style. My hair used to straighten pretty easily and hold that way for most of the day (I have naturally wavy hair), but when I use Nioxin and straighten it, it goes immediately wavy within half an hour. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this unless nothing else has worked for you! I&#x27;ve heard Folicure works better, and it&#x27;s much cheaper...</li>
            <li> It works! Less hair in drain and looking fuller.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair full and silky</li>
            <li> I have been using nioxin for almost 10 years. I had lost hair from a stress related incident. Stuff really works!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner work well, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the authentic stuff...I&#x27;ve used this in the past and I remember feeling a lot more &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; when I used it. I&#x27;ve also used it before and had a lot less tangling that I do with these bottles I ordered. Not sure if the formula has changed, or if this isn&#x27;t the real product. Nevertheless, it worked well and the conditioner smells great :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service by Amazon</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a shampoo that was safe for color treated hair that would also take the place of using a dandruff shampoo.  My scalp gets so irritated in dry weather and head and shoulders takes the itch out.  And I read in several places that this Nioxin formula would do a similar job, but it doesn&#x27;t quite.  It relieves a little of the itch, but not as good as H&amp;S.  I love the fragrance and I will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is great I have recommend this product to friends and family and it does exactly what it says it does and make your hair feel great</li>
            <li> It is good. I have purchased Nioxin 3 System before. and both of them are good. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time, love it.  I love the way it makes my hair feel, healthy!</li>
            <li> After several months I can notice a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Seems great. If my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out, I&#x27;ll know it worked. I&#x27;ll write a second review in 10 years.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping amazing price!!!</li>
            <li> It take a few washed to notice the difference but you do. It really makes your hair look full and stops some of the falling out.</li>
            <li> good quality product to be used for your hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels nice and clean after every use...and the tingling feeling is pretty awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone who likes the fresh feeling as opposed to a heavy and very scented feeling of other products.</li>
            <li> I was noticing plenty of hair in the drain after showering.  I started using this and it hasn&#x27;t been bad since!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as if I paused my receding hairline at awkward!  My only regret is that I would have started using it sooner rather. ;)</li>
            <li> Was NOT happy with it! The color of the shampoo is Not the green mint I think they changed the solution for something VERY weak!  Will NOT buy AGAIN! !!!</li>
            <li> Have only been using a few weeks, but LOVE how my hair looks. Much smoother and holds curl better! Shampoo really produces lots of suds with only a small amount. I have long hair and always have to shampoo twice, but not with this product....once does the trick. The conditioner leaves my hair soft, but not tangle free....still need to use my leave-in conditioner to get the tangles out. I don&#x27;t mind this since my hair looks so much smoother and healthier!</li>
            <li> The actual product that I received is not this white  color bottle. It was the old model brown bottle. I also felt the quality of the cleanser and conditioner is not good. I have been using Nioxin for a while after using this cleanser i have started to loose lots of hair.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product, make sure you go to nioxin website and use the \\&quot;consultation tool\\&quot; to see with system is suitable for you. Nioxin System 5 is for \\&quot;normal thin looking\\&quot; hair, not noticeably thinning and with medium to coarse texture. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 3 years and it has stopped my hair loss. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is probably the 3rd time I am buying this. This really helps with preventing hair loss with all the medications that I am on and I would to say, this has something to do with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this expecting the formulation from years past.  Unfortunately when P&amp;G purchased Nioxin, they changed the formulation and you might just as well use some other cheap ineffective scalp therapy product.  After ditching the &amp;#34;new Nioxin&amp;#34; I tried six other products and found that the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil scalp therapy adequately replaces the old Nioxin.</li>
            <li> Fake product. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> It helps my beautiful locks remain full and non-balding, what&#x27;s not to love? I have a full head of hair, I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and I use it. I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb and say the s&amp;!&amp;$ legit!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product but instead bought it for my sister to try. We bought it since we&#x27;ve used Nioxin before (the medicated shampoo and conditioner) and it left our hair lustrous and thick. This product does keep the hair looking pretty thick but my sister (who does not have a dry scalp at all) has found it extremely drying. Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s winter so she is prone to a possibly drier scalp but this hasn&#x27;t happened with any other shampoo during other winters. I don&#x27;t think she is willing to try it a third time so it&#x27;s on to something else!</li>
            <li> Shipped very timely.  Product exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The rest of my order was fine but the cleanser and scalp therapy #5 bottles smelt different to what Ive had before and were not the same colour inside the bottle and didnt make my head tingle like it normally does. Well packaged order and arrived quite quickly.</li>
            <li> On this order I switched from system 2 to system 5...looking forward to seeing results that I am hoping for.</li>
            <li> I researched online on Nioxin website and bought the correct system for me. i am huge fan of this company products. I am going to stick with this system as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This stuff saves your hair from falling out. What this product does is it deep cleans your scalp so that your hair can grow and continue to stay in your scalp not falling out. The best part of the duo is the conditioner it is a creamy lather, you do not have to use that much of it since it will expand and foam up which will allow you to use less of it while covering your entire head. I do not believe that this system grows more hair, but it will let you keep the hair that you have. I have noticed that there is less hair in my comb than when I was using another shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever purchased! For months I&#x27;ve had itchy bumps on my scalp that would ooze and scab primarily when I was stressed or after a workout. (Research has told me it is a hormonal imbalance) Yhis shampoo was a recommendation on a blog and I took a leap of faith in buying it and it has been wonderful! No more itchy scalp or clogged follicles and my hair is long, holds a curl without hairspray, blowdrys without tangles.. (I use system 5 and did not purchase because of thinning hair)</li>
