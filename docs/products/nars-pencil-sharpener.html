            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars because I think it&#x27;s silly that I have to buy an entirely new sharpener for this line!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my pencils sharpened effortlessly and they look brand new!!!</li>
            <li> I was getting frustrated with the brands of pencils I was buying considering the price for some of them (urban decay, stila, mac...) and finally realized that perhaps I should try out a nicer sharpener.</li>
            <li> No only does it disinfectant your eyeliners when you sharpen them this sharpener doesn&#x27;t break or waste product on my expensive pencils.</li>
            <li> It could have been mailed in a SMALL padded envelope.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe how well this works.</li>
            <li> If you have any hard to sharpen eyeliners this is the sharpener you need.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier to find I no longer have to toss expensive pencils because of chewed up, uneven wood.</li>

            <li> Great sharpener, works great. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This sharpener is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe how well this works. I have struggled for years with lip pencils that are chewed up by sharpeners and only sharpen on one side. I finally googled the problem and found many replies saying that it is not the pencil but the sharpener. Well, sure enough, upon the recommendation of many people, I bought this sharpener and lo and behold! It works! Every pencil now sharpens evenly all the way around. I could not be happier to find I no longer have to toss expensive pencils because of chewed up, uneven wood. It is like a miracle.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Nars pencils, I use them a lot.</li>

            <li> This works. It&#x27;s a higher quality makeup pencil eyeliner sharpener. Works for pencil eyebrow pencils too.</li>
            <li> Best sharpener around. I have Sephora Jumbo Liners and even the Sephora pencil sharpener doesn&#x27;t do a good job...this Nars pencil sharpens jumbo pencils the best and for even regular sized eyeliners, you get a crisp, sharp cut.</li>

            <li> Done ruining my pencils by sharpening them with cheap drugstore quality sharpeners. All they did was break the outer casing and bust the color tips out thus shortening my pencils drastically! I went online looking for the best way to sharpen my pencils and someone mentioned the NARS sharpener. Needless to say, my pencils sharpened effortlessly and they look brand new!!! I tossed out my cheap drugstore sharpeners and will be using this one on all of my eye pencils from now on.</li>

            <li> the lid comes off very easy and gets the shavings all in your makeup bag</li>
