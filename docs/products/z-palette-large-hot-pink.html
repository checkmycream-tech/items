            <li>feel so much more organized now.</li>
            <li>I love having all of my products organized in these sleek cases.</li>
            <li>I have many eye shadow quads</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with magnets for the eyeshadow pans.</li>
            <li>It fits so many eyeshadow and was the answer to my disorganized makeup drawer problem.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love that I can see through.</li>
            <li>I love my Z palette.</li>
            <li>I started converting to palettes because my makeup box was getting too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Love it either way.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a recommended item.</li>
            <li>Cute color too.</li>
            <li>i love having every- eye shadow, blush or bronzer (etc)</li>
            <li>and i love the thank you card and sample eyeshadow  </li>
            <li>This had allowed me to get more organized and have all my shadows in one place.  </li>
            <li>I love Z palettes.  </li>
            <li>so it sort of balances out. :)</li>
            <li>They are to tall and the top doesn&#x27;t close all the way.</li>
            <li>I love my z-palette.</li>
            <li>I depotted a couple urban decay book of shadows palettes and the z-palette has been perfect for keeping everything organized.</li>
            <li>I now use these shadows more than ever.</li>
            <li>Now I have more room and want to use more Z Palettes.  </li>
            <li>Comes with plenty of metal stickers for pans that aren&#x27;t able to stick to the pan.  </li>
            <li>I can always buy more</li>
            <li>Love these Palette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Makeup time is more organized and efficient.</li>
            <li>Love how I can see</li>
            <li>These are great for everyday storage of eyeshadows or blushes and powders, it is also a great travel option for your makeup.</li>
            <li>I wish the stickers came in more sizes, but they&#x27;re free with the palette.  </li>
            <li>I have a busted up pallet, in a bag, in a drawer which I&#x27;m not using nearly as much as I might if it was still in good condition</li>
            <li>This is a dream come true for me!</li>
            <li>Its durable and easy to store.</li>
            <li>Now it is easy to see what I have.  </li>
            <li>Compact works well.  can easily see what you are taking with you when you travel</li>
            <li>Magnet is strong and palette is sturdy.</li>
            <li>and I filled it up quite easily.  </li>
            <li>The magnets are very strong and the palette, itself, is very sturdy!</li>
            <li>I took all the eye shadows from the ulta huge palette and put them in this one.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going to say that&#x27;s a big win for her to choose this customizable palette.</li>
            <li>It would fit tons of eyeshadow pans, without all the dividers to take up space.</li>
            <li>This palettes are fantastic to organize your favorites in makeup.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and I like the design as well as the transparent cover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!!</li>
            <li>I very much like that the top is see though.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the z-palette for creating your own personalized.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I received this and immediately started to put it to use.  </li>
            <li>The different colors are also great too, and makes them look fun.</li>
            <li>I love the palette but it would be nice if it can with enough magnets to file it up.</li>
            <li>Depotting can be a pain, I have a few things I wasn&#x27;t able to successfully de-pot and had to fix.  </li>
            <li>This is a smaller size, good for travel, and compact.  </li>
            <li>It was bought as a present and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li>I love this palette so much.</li>
            <li>Product was delivered fast and I am definitely pleased.</li>
            <li>Super cute z palette, shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Depotted a few of my eyeshadow and pressed my own pigments to put in this amazing pallet.</li>
            <li>The size is good as I don&#x27;t think anything bigger would conveniently fit in a large purse or bag for traveling.</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty..</li>
            <li>For more new stuff.</li>
            <li>it holds a good portion of my single eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll save money not needing to buy compacts in the first place!</li>
            <li>With this, completely fulfilled my wish and its super cute.</li>
            <li>This one DOES fit the most possible of MAC shadows up to 28.</li>
            <li>This is perfect if you have thin eyeshadow pods.  </li>
            <li>all right in front of me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s right up my alley with the color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve depotted all my big palettes (cute packaging UD but a girl cannot reasonably carry something that is thicker than an encyclopedia around!!)</li>
            <li>the Z Palette Large in Hot Pink is a great option for those that want to make the most of their collection of single eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>My hot pink one houses all my really bright and fun eyeshadows, while the other two contain all my neutrals (I have waaay more neutrals than I do anything</li>
            <li>It is far from huge, but fits a lot since there are no plastic dividers in the way.</li>
            <li>gonna order me some Z in the future for my Blush and Lumi&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Love them but starting to fall apart have to re glue them after while</li>
            <li>So much more convenient and a luxury to open each morning when I put my make up on!!</li>
            <li>I think I have 20 or more shadows in it from various palettes.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy another larger one and put even more in it...</li>
            <li>Because most of those things are 95% cardboard/5% actual makeup and who needs that cluttering up their vanity?</li>
            <li>So much counter space saved in the bathroom!</li>
            <li>but looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to see palette but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>I would still consider having another one for home, but don&#x27;t really want to put the money into it again right now.  </li>
            <li>My most used/favorite makeup is now conveniently in one place, making my daily makeup routine that much easier.</li>
            <li>And if you haven&#x27;t reached for a certain color, you know that you can pretty much throw it away.</li>
            <li>The large case holds quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can get 28 MAC shadows in a large Z palette and in the pro size, I can get 11 MAC blushes or 15 sugarpill shadows or 14 MAC pressed pigments or mineralized</li>
            <li>Also, each palette comes with 20 magnets and a large fits 30 shadows...</li>
            <li>Read how to put something you break into a new tin, and make sure you have all the necessary tools before you start.  </li>
            <li>And they are available in various sizes.</li>
            <li>It started coming apart very soon after I started using it.</li>
            <li>Great idea, poor execution .Very flimsy for the price.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand...</li>
            <li>It really consolidates your makeup and frees up space.</li>
            <li>I really like this palette.</li>
            <li>Wife absolutely loves Z pallete, bought 2 for her.  </li>
            <li>that fit my specific needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>i would love the XL size but 28 bucks is a lil too much for an empty case:</li>
            <li>But it does come with quite a few round magnetic pieces and they work perfectly!!</li>
            <li>Most top brands like Mac have single pans you can buy for less then the ones that are in a compact</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also taken my other shadows that are packaged, and have been able to put everything in these.</li>
            <li>Amazing quality for little price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected, but it is a wonderful product to keep eye shadows organized.</li>
            <li>The palette stores a tons of shadows and makes me want to use my single shadows more frequently.  </li>
            <li>I love that it came with metal stickers, and the entire back is magnetic.  </li>
            <li>I recommend either carrying it in your carry on, or not using this particular item for travel where someone else handles your bags.  </li>
            <li>and I can use the older eyeshadows that were put away for months.</li>
            <li>I also put all of my single shadows in there and can take this with me on a trip, and the lid stays secure.</li>
            <li>I own several of the large hot pink and several of the pro zebra.  </li>
            <li>High quality cardboard, it&#x27;ll hold up for awhile</li>
            <li>and I just broke them up and put them into a new tin using the rubbing alcohol to reset them.  </li>
            <li>I have had this product for over a year and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>I find I actually use my other colors more often than I did before this because now I see it</li>
            <li>The only downside is unless you buy the palette ready shadows, you DO have to go through and depot all ur shadows, which if u have a LOT like i did, can be tiring, but fun at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Not only is it easier to access all shadows at once but it cleared so much clutter!</li>
            <li>This palette is made very well, it isn&#x27;t to thin or flimsy and the top clear plastic is also very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Gone are the days of having multiple palettes, and a large overfilled bag reserved just for my makeup!&lt;br /&gt;The magnetic board works pretty well, but some of my shadows that already come magnetized, I&#x27;ll stick on an extra magnet so it holds</li>
            <li>the NYX eyeshadows are a bit hard to depot, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>ZPalettes are fantastic for downsizing makeup space especially if you are a makeup artist and have limited space in your kit!</li>
            <li>Love my little handwritten note on my receipt!!</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that is so simple but makes your life so much easier.</li>
            <li>I wish it was just a tiny bit cheaper, since all it really is is a magnet board in a cardboard box.</li>
            <li>(they are easily available for a few bucks)  </li>
            <li>but I think if you keep it in high humidity like a bathroom, or take it on a lot of trips where someone might be rough with your luggage, I think it won&#x27;t hold up quite as long as it would if it was plastic or some other more durable material.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered the pink one</li>
            <li>I have this in Hot Pink, Raspberry Damask AND pro sized black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was supposed to be Hot pink, but seller gave me the option of receiving it faster if i chose the light pink, which is the same thing minus the color.</li>
            <li>anything about it/makeup in general...</li>
            <li>, make sure you also have a pairing knife or some sort of thin, metal, pointed tool.  </li>
            <li>Of course I only wanted the hot pink one!</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and just what I expected!</li>
            <li>* Update: I clearly saw into the future with the above review.  </li>
            <li>For some brands it was super easy and took no prep, for others it took a lot of work, and again, for some it was impossible</li>
            <li>now travel with my Z Palette (I keep my shadows,blush,contouring powders all in 1 large case), and one little makeup case with my brushes&amp; mascara/powder etc.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really liked Kandee Johnson&#x27;s YouTube Tutorial called &amp;#34;How</li>
            <li> can be a nice tool to loosen glue to make it easier to remove pots</li>
            <li> Loved it, my own palette with the colors I use most.</li>
            <li> The magnet is very strong and the colors dont go flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> pink is very bright and beautiful, as pictured.  </li>
            <li> They allow easy access to all my shadows!</li>
            <li> Love love love my Z palette!</li>
            <li> Love love love the Z palette!</li>
            <li> I love my Z Palette...</li>
            <li> love the price...</li>
            <li> Love the packaging...</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this brand for placing all my eye shadows.</li>
            <li> feel so much more organized now.</li>
            <li> I love having all of my products organized in these sleek cases.</li>
            <li> I have many eye shadow quads</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with magnets for the eyeshadow pans.</li>
            <li> It fits so many eyeshadow and was the answer to my disorganized makeup drawer problem.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love that I can see through.</li>
            <li> I love my Z palette.</li>
            <li> I started converting to palettes because my makeup box was getting too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Love it either way.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a recommended item.</li>
            <li> Cute color too.</li>
            <li> i love having every- eye shadow, blush or bronzer (etc)</li>
            <li> and i love the thank you card and sample eyeshadow  </li>
            <li> This had allowed me to get more organized and have all my shadows in one place.  </li>
            <li> I love Z palettes.  </li>
            <li> so it sort of balances out. :)</li>
            <li> They are to tall and the top doesn&#x27;t close all the way.</li>
            <li> I love my z-palette.</li>
            <li> I depotted a couple urban decay book of shadows palettes and the z-palette has been perfect for keeping everything organized.</li>
            <li> I now use these shadows more than ever.</li>
            <li> Now I have more room and want to use more Z Palettes.  </li>
            <li> Comes with plenty of metal stickers for pans that aren&#x27;t able to stick to the pan.  </li>
            <li> I can always buy more</li>
            <li> Love these Palette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Makeup time is more organized and efficient.</li>
            <li> Love how I can see</li>
            <li> These are great for everyday storage of eyeshadows or blushes and powders, it is also a great travel option for your makeup.</li>
            <li> I wish the stickers came in more sizes, but they&#x27;re free with the palette.  </li>
            <li> I have a busted up pallet, in a bag, in a drawer which I&#x27;m not using nearly as much as I might if it was still in good condition</li>
            <li> This is a dream come true for me!</li>
            <li> Its durable and easy to store.</li>
            <li> Now it is easy to see what I have.  </li>
            <li> Compact works well.  can easily see what you are taking with you when you travel</li>
            <li> Magnet is strong and palette is sturdy.</li>
            <li> and I filled it up quite easily.  </li>
            <li> The magnets are very strong and the palette, itself, is very sturdy!</li>
            <li> I took all the eye shadows from the ulta huge palette and put them in this one.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m going to say that&#x27;s a big win for her to choose this customizable palette.</li>
            <li> It would fit tons of eyeshadow pans, without all the dividers to take up space.</li>
            <li> This palettes are fantastic to organize your favorites in makeup.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and I like the design as well as the transparent cover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!!</li>
            <li> I very much like that the top is see though.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the z-palette for creating your own personalized.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I received this and immediately started to put it to use.  </li>
            <li> The different colors are also great too, and makes them look fun.</li>
            <li> I love the palette but it would be nice if it can with enough magnets to file it up.</li>
            <li> Depotting can be a pain, I have a few things I wasn&#x27;t able to successfully de-pot and had to fix.  </li>
            <li> This is a smaller size, good for travel, and compact.  </li>
            <li> It was bought as a present and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this palette so much.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered fast and I am definitely pleased.</li>
            <li> Super cute z palette, shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> Depotted a few of my eyeshadow and pressed my own pigments to put in this amazing pallet.</li>
            <li> The size is good as I don&#x27;t think anything bigger would conveniently fit in a large purse or bag for traveling.</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty..</li>
            <li> For more new stuff.</li>
            <li> it holds a good portion of my single eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save money not needing to buy compacts in the first place!</li>
            <li> With this, completely fulfilled my wish and its super cute.</li>
            <li> This one DOES fit the most possible of MAC shadows up to 28.</li>
            <li> This is perfect if you have thin eyeshadow pods.  </li>
            <li> all right in front of me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s right up my alley with the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve depotted all my big palettes (cute packaging UD but a girl cannot reasonably carry something that is thicker than an encyclopedia around!!)</li>
            <li> the Z Palette Large in Hot Pink is a great option for those that want to make the most of their collection of single eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> My hot pink one houses all my really bright and fun eyeshadows, while the other two contain all my neutrals (I have waaay more neutrals than I do anything</li>
            <li> It is far from huge, but fits a lot since there are no plastic dividers in the way.</li>
            <li> gonna order me some Z in the future for my Blush and Lumi&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Love them but starting to fall apart have to re glue them after while</li>
            <li> So much more convenient and a luxury to open each morning when I put my make up on!!</li>
            <li> I think I have 20 or more shadows in it from various palettes.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy another larger one and put even more in it...</li>
            <li> Because most of those things are 95% cardboard/5% actual makeup and who needs that cluttering up their vanity?</li>
            <li> So much counter space saved in the bathroom!</li>
            <li> but looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to see palette but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> I would still consider having another one for home, but don&#x27;t really want to put the money into it again right now.  </li>
            <li> My most used/favorite makeup is now conveniently in one place, making my daily makeup routine that much easier.</li>
            <li> And if you haven&#x27;t reached for a certain color, you know that you can pretty much throw it away.</li>
            <li> The large case holds quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can get 28 MAC shadows in a large Z palette and in the pro size, I can get 11 MAC blushes or 15 sugarpill shadows or 14 MAC pressed pigments or mineralized</li>
            <li> Also, each palette comes with 20 magnets and a large fits 30 shadows...</li>
            <li> Read how to put something you break into a new tin, and make sure you have all the necessary tools before you start.  </li>
            <li> And they are available in various sizes.</li>
            <li> It started coming apart very soon after I started using it.</li>
            <li> Great idea, poor execution .Very flimsy for the price.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand...</li>
            <li> It really consolidates your makeup and frees up space.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette.</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely loves Z pallete, bought 2 for her.  </li>
            <li> that fit my specific needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> i would love the XL size but 28 bucks is a lil too much for an empty case:</li>
            <li> But it does come with quite a few round magnetic pieces and they work perfectly!!</li>
            <li> Most top brands like Mac have single pans you can buy for less then the ones that are in a compact</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also taken my other shadows that are packaged, and have been able to put everything in these.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for little price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected, but it is a wonderful product to keep eye shadows organized.</li>
            <li> The palette stores a tons of shadows and makes me want to use my single shadows more frequently.  </li>
            <li> I love that it came with metal stickers, and the entire back is magnetic.  </li>
            <li> I recommend either carrying it in your carry on, or not using this particular item for travel where someone else handles your bags.  </li>
            <li> and I can use the older eyeshadows that were put away for months.</li>
            <li> I also put all of my single shadows in there and can take this with me on a trip, and the lid stays secure.</li>
            <li> I own several of the large hot pink and several of the pro zebra.  </li>
            <li> High quality cardboard, it&#x27;ll hold up for awhile</li>
            <li> and I just broke them up and put them into a new tin using the rubbing alcohol to reset them.  </li>
            <li> I have had this product for over a year and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> I find I actually use my other colors more often than I did before this because now I see it</li>
            <li> The only downside is unless you buy the palette ready shadows, you DO have to go through and depot all ur shadows, which if u have a LOT like i did, can be tiring, but fun at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Not only is it easier to access all shadows at once but it cleared so much clutter!</li>
            <li> This palette is made very well, it isn&#x27;t to thin or flimsy and the top clear plastic is also very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of having multiple palettes, and a large overfilled bag reserved just for my makeup!&lt;br /&gt;The magnetic board works pretty well, but some of my shadows that already come magnetized, I&#x27;ll stick on an extra magnet so it holds</li>
            <li> the NYX eyeshadows are a bit hard to depot, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> ZPalettes are fantastic for downsizing makeup space especially if you are a makeup artist and have limited space in your kit!</li>
            <li> Love my little handwritten note on my receipt!!</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that is so simple but makes your life so much easier.</li>
            <li> I wish it was just a tiny bit cheaper, since all it really is is a magnet board in a cardboard box.</li>
            <li> (they are easily available for a few bucks)  </li>
            <li> but I think if you keep it in high humidity like a bathroom, or take it on a lot of trips where someone might be rough with your luggage, I think it won&#x27;t hold up quite as long as it would if it was plastic or some other more durable material.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered the pink one</li>
            <li> I have this in Hot Pink, Raspberry Damask AND pro sized black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be Hot pink, but seller gave me the option of receiving it faster if i chose the light pink, which is the same thing minus the color.</li>
            <li> anything about it/makeup in general...</li>
            <li> , make sure you also have a pairing knife or some sort of thin, metal, pointed tool.  </li>
            <li> Of course I only wanted the hot pink one!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and just what I expected!</li>
            <li> * Update: I clearly saw into the future with the above review.  </li>
            <li> For some brands it was super easy and took no prep, for others it took a lot of work, and again, for some it was impossible</li>
            <li> now travel with my Z Palette (I keep my shadows,blush,contouring powders all in 1 large case), and one little makeup case with my brushes&amp; mascara/powder etc.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my urban decay single eye shadow pods.</li>
            <li> so much easier than having 10 small eyeshadow palettes or single shadows sitting around wasting space!</li>
            <li> Minor detail</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that when you buy the Mac products in the pan with no compact, the magnets are not strong enough to keep them in place inside the Z palettes, so you have to replace them with the included Z palette magnets.  </li>
            <li> This proved super frustrating because the few pots that didn&#x27;t break and could be salvageable, I don&#x27;t have a case for as they&#x27;d all been tossed into recycling.  </li>
            <li> I now buy my MAC individual shadows/blush etc&amp; save a little $ on packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present and I am not familiar with palettes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of replacing all my palettes with this pink one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a fluke because I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person.</li>
            <li> I used this one to store a palette I bought at Ulta, a big box of shadows and it came with the lipgloss and a few blushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely because it&#x27;s pink.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have any attachments to the palette packaging on all your other ones, then girl, get to depotting and stick &#x27;em into this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge issue, it only takes a few seconds to do it, but it&#x27;s some thing that you need to do if want your products to stay put.  </li>
            <li> To Fix Broken Eyeshadows (in MAC palette form and regular eye shadow compact)&amp;#34;  Also a flat iron w/ parchment or wax paper</li>
            <li> once you buy a Z palette, you will not buy any other type!</li>
            <li> I even bought the small pink one, too!</li>
            <li> plus a few others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of, its cardboard.  </li>
            <li> I even took a small brush that came with a powdered blush, put a metal sticker on the handle and BOOM, one for when I&#x27;m traveling and can&#x27;t be bothered to bring all my brushes.  </li>
            <li> In the past couple of months i have ordered four already.  </li>
            <li> Rough handling during air travel, despite wedging my cosmetics bag between clothing to protect it still resulted in a broken Z Palette (shattered window, misshapen box), broken cosmetics, and cosmetic dust all over the items stored with it.  </li>
            <li> you do not own one of these yet</li>
            <li> And I honestly do not know how I ever lived without this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the opposite of the stupid ones that need a magnet for the pan.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product.</li>
            <li> seriously Why didn&#x27;t I order it until now !!</li>
            <li> The magnets are useless!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even pressed some of my mac pigments to slide on in to this bad boy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> seriously Why didn&#x27;t I order it until now !!&lt;br /&gt;I luv it , it&#x27;s a space saver for traveling I travel a lot and I used to take my fav Single-Eyeshadows with me but with this baby I but then together ( 28 MAC SIZE eyeshadows ) together in one palette and boom her we go!&lt;br /&gt;FANTASTIC gonna order me some Z in the future for my Blush and Lumi&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> I love my Z Palette...love the price...Love the packaging...Love my little handwritten note on my receipt!! I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> ZPalettes are fantastic for downsizing makeup space especially if you are a makeup artist and have limited space in your kit! These palettes fit perfectly in the Zuca bag compartments. And they are available in various sizes. These will save you time, space and Tylenol!! Totally love these! The magnets are very strong and the palette, itself, is very sturdy!</li>
            <li> Just as described. Exactly what I was expecting. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered the pink one and I love it. I&#x27;m thinking of replacing all my palettes with this pink one.</li>
            <li> A wonderful space saver.  I love that it came with metal stickers, and the entire back is magnetic.  If I pull out a metal pot, no sticker needed.  If I pull out a plastic one, I stick a metal thing on the back and I&#x27;m good to go.  I even took a small brush that came with a powdered blush, put a metal sticker on the handle and BOOM, one for when I&#x27;m traveling and can&#x27;t be bothered to bring all my brushes.  Minor detail I&#x27;m not a huge fan of, its cardboard.

            <li> Love this brand for placing all my eye shadows. They seem sturdy and good to travel with!</li>
            <li> Love this! I now buy my MAC individual shadows/blush etc&amp; save a little $ on packaging. I&#x27;ve also taken my other shadows that are packaged, and have been able to put everything in these.

            <li> Z-Palettes are the best, if you like to organize your makeup these are woth it. I have several, neutral shadows in one, purples in another, blushes, arrange them anyway you like. Perfect for travel. They have different sizes of palettes also.&lt;br /&gt;Try one out.</li>
            <li> I love this palette!  I was really excited when I received this and immediately started to put it to use.  I have many eye shadow quads so I had to depot what I could and I filled it up quite easily.  I depotted a lancome blush into it as well.  Now all I have to do is reach for this and I can use the older eyeshadows that were put away for months. This is a great way to consolidate and use your makeup til it hits pan.  And if you haven&#x27;t reached for a certain color, you know that you can pretty much throw it away.</li>
            <li> I got this palette to put my MAC and makeup geek eyeshadows in. It works perfectly. The magnet is very strong and the colors dont go flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> I love the palette but it would be nice if it can with enough magnets to file it up. Over wise, good product.</li>
            <li> its great !!! PERFECT</li>
            <li> Love them but starting to fall apart have to re glue them after while</li>
            <li> It started coming apart very soon after I started using it. Great idea, poor execution .Very flimsy for the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing life changing moment when I put all my shadows in ONE place! So much more convenient and a luxury to open each morning when I put my make up on!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a fluke because I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person. I simply wanted to minimize my makeup clutter and see all my eyeshadow colors without looking in multiple compacts. With this, completely fulfilled my wish and its super cute. Its durable and easy to store. Recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Found THE BEST dupe to this product!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amankkhaira.com/2015/03/z-palette-dupe-mac.html</li>
            <li> I bought this palette for my Makeup Geek and Mac eye shadows. I love that it comes with magnets for the eyeshadow pans. This palette is made very well, it isn&#x27;t to thin or flimsy and the top clear plastic is also very sturdy. This is one of those products that is so simple but makes your life so much easier. These are great for everyday storage of eyeshadows or blushes and powders, it is also a great travel option for your makeup. I plan to buy another one for my Makeup Geek blushes.</li>
            <li> had no problems with mine....a great deal and compact</li>
            <li> This is a great place to put all those eyeshadows that sit around in drawers for years that you forget about.  I also put all of my single shadows in there and can take this with me on a trip, and the lid stays secure. This is a smaller size, good for travel, and compact.  I think I have 20 or more shadows in it from various palettes. Now it is easy to see what I have.  I will probably buy another larger one and put even more in it... so much easier than having 10 small eyeshadow palettes or single shadows sitting around wasting space!</li>
            <li> I loved this! I have had this product for over a year and it still looks brand new. It fits so many eyeshadow and was the answer to my disorganized makeup drawer problem. I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister. She loves it. I don&#x27;t really understand...anything about it/makeup in general...but she uses it often...and for a picky makeup guru like her with a makeup arsenal it seems.....i&#x27;m going to say that&#x27;s a big win for her to choose this customizable palette.</li>
            <li> I have this in Hot Pink, Raspberry Damask AND pro sized black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not own one of these yet and you are a MUA? YOU NEED TO GET YOU ONE!!!! I&#x27;ve depotted all my big palettes (cute packaging UD but a girl cannot reasonably carry something that is thicker than an encyclopedia around!!) And I honestly do not know how I ever lived without this. I&#x27;ve even pressed some of my mac pigments to slide on in to this bad boy. My hot pink one houses all my really bright and fun eyeshadows, while the other two contain all my neutrals (I have waaay more neutrals than I do anything else).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you know? I find I actually use my other colors more often than I did before this because now I see it all right in front of me. It really consolidates your makeup and frees up space. If you don&#x27;t have any attachments to the palette packaging on all your other ones, then girl, get to depotting and stick &#x27;em into this. Stat! Because most of those things are 95% cardboard/5% actual makeup and who needs that cluttering up their vanity?</li>
            <li> This is a dream come true for me! Depotted a few of my eyeshadow and pressed my own pigments to put in this amazing pallet. It fits quite a bit. Love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome as always. Magnet is strong and palette is sturdy. Love that I can see through. Cheaper on amazon and faster shipping too.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette. It is what it says it is -- a magnetic case for your makeup tins. The size is good as I don&#x27;t think anything bigger would conveniently fit in a large purse or bag for traveling. My most used/favorite makeup is now conveniently in one place, making my daily makeup routine that much easier. I&#x27;m happy I bought this product.</li>
            <li> It was bought as a present and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done ... I wish it was just a tiny bit cheaper, since all it really is is a magnet board in a cardboard box.</li>
            <li> Authentic and sturdy great palette</li>
            <li> Loved it, my own palette with the colors I use most.</li>
            <li> The magnets are useless!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could. It&#x27;s the opposite of the stupid ones that need a magnet for the pan. This palette is magnetic and the only time you need the included metal stickers is if you have something plastic to put in it. It would fit tons of eyeshadow pans, without all the dividers to take up space. I also order my foundation in refill pans so this is perfect. It is far from huge, but fits a lot since there are no plastic dividers in the way. Perfect for refills or depotting. You&#x27;ll save money not needing to buy compacts in the first place!</li>
            <li> What a great idea!  So much counter space saved in the bathroom!</li>
            <li> Love these! You can depot what you have or start your own collections! Most top brands like Mac have single pans you can buy for less then the ones that are in a compact</li>
            <li> Compact works well.  can easily see what you are taking with you when you travel and now I don&#x27;t have to open 3 compacts to see what I need.</li>
            <li> the Z Palette Large in Hot Pink is a great option for those that want to make the most of their collection of single eyeshadows. The palette stores a tons of shadows and makes me want to use my single shadows more frequently.  It&#x27;s an efficient use of makeup storage space.</li>
            <li> Love love love my Z palette! I have streamlined my makeup drawer and have room for more!!</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for little price! Come with magnets and works amaing! I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Great palette. Bigger then I thought it would be and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected, but it is a wonderful product to keep eye shadows organized. I love my Z palette.</li>
            <li> I started converting to palettes because my makeup box was getting too overwhelming. This one DOES fit the most possible of MAC shadows up to 28. I ended up using this one for pinks, ironically enough. It was supposed to be Hot pink, but seller gave me the option of receiving it faster if i chose the light pink, which is the same thing minus the color. Love it either way.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a recommended item. The only downside is unless you buy the palette ready shadows, you DO have to go through and depot all ur shadows, which if u have a LOT like i did, can be tiring, but fun at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> This palettes are fantastic to organize your favorites in makeup.  In the past couple of months i have ordered four already.  I used this one to store a palette I bought at Ulta, a big box of shadows and it came with the lipgloss and a few blushes. I took all the eye shadows from the ulta huge palette and put them in this one.  I have a separate one for the blushes and lipgloss.  It will save you a lot of space.. For more new stuff.</li>
            <li> The Z palette the best palette available; better than MAC for sure! You can see through it to see up to 27 eye shadows &amp; the magnetic hold is great! Cute color too. once you buy a Z palette, you will not buy any other type!</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present and I am not familiar with palettes. but looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Super cute z palette, shipping was super fast. Product came with 20 metal stickers to stick depotted shadows in palette. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!! i need more! i would love the XL size but 28 bucks is a lil too much for an empty case:( maybe a bday gift idea! i love having every- eye shadow, blush or bronzer (etc) all in one place. No digging around necessary!</li>
            <li> Everything was up to standards. I would recommend to others! Great shipping time as well and i love the thank you card and sample eyeshadow  i received with my order!</li>
            <li> I bought this solely because it&#x27;s pink. If you&#x27;ve ever used a Z Palette, you know how they work. This one is no different. It works well and it&#x27;s right up my alley with the color. I even bought the small pink one, too!</li>
            <li> The palette has enough space for my eyeshadow. It&#x27;s easy to clean and I like the design as well as the transparent cover. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Love love love the Z palette! Price and color were perfect!</li>
            <li> This had allowed me to get more organized and have all my shadows in one place.  I have depotted all my shadows and now only have my z palette.</li>
            <li> I love Z palettes.  I own several of the large hot pink and several of the pro zebra.  I deported all of my MAC eyeshadows and blushes and I have never looked back.  I can get 28 MAC shadows in a large Z palette and in the pro size, I can get 11 MAC blushes or 15 sugarpill shadows or 14 MAC pressed pigments or mineralized shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I use a bigger variety of products because it&#x27;s all laid out for me to see.  I don&#x27;t have to dig through a ton of compacts to find the colors I&#x27;m looking for. The only draw back is that when you buy the Mac products in the pan with no compact, the magnets are not strong enough to keep them in place inside the Z palettes, so you have to replace them with the included Z palette magnets.  It&#x27;s not a huge issue, it only takes a few seconds to do it, but it&#x27;s some thing that you need to do if want your products to stay put.  Also, each palette comes with 20 magnets and a large fits 30 shadows... So you may need to purchase extras (they are easily available for a few bucks)  If you are intending to buy several palettes to fill with blushes and shadows, you may not need to buy extra magnets.  For example, I only got 11 blushes into one palette, so I had extra to use for shadows so it sort of balances out. :)</li>
            <li> This is perfect if you have thin eyeshadow pods.  My coastal scents work great with this. I bought it for my urban decay single eye shadow pods. They don&#x27;t work with this palette. They are to tall and the top doesn&#x27;t close all the way. I very much like that the top is see though.  They magnet stickers work great.</li>
            <li> I love my z-palette. I depotted a couple urban decay book of shadows palettes and the z-palette has been perfect for keeping everything organized. I now use these shadows more than ever. I highly recommend the z-palette for creating your own personalized.</li>
            <li> I think I need to buy more!  I used this for depoting the my Ulta eyeshadows that came in the treasures case.  They were all in plastic and not making very good use of space.  Now I have more room and want to use more Z Palettes.  Also, if this is your 1st time depoting the palette comes with instructions.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this palette so much. It removes all the clutter that comes with MAC packaging and allows me to actually see my products!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to see palette but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money! When I saw this just kind of price I couldn&#x27;t help but buy it! Of course I only wanted the hot pink one! I love this pallet and use it whenever companies send me samples!</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely loves Z pallete, bought 2 for her.  With the magnetic strips it ensures that products stay where placed.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Very sturdy and just what I expected! Product was delivered fast and I am definitely pleased. I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> This case is great! it holds a good portion of my single eyeshadows. the NYX eyeshadows are a bit hard to depot, but that&#x27;s okay. My Wet-n-Wild eyeshadows fit perfectly!! plus a few others. Some of the eyeshadows do not have a magnetic backing therefore the don&#x27;t stick immediately to the palette. But it does come with quite a few round magnetic pieces and they work perfectly!! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Comes with plenty of metal stickers for pans that aren&#x27;t able to stick to the pan.  I wish the stickers came in more sizes, but they&#x27;re free with the palette.  I can always buy more that fit my specific needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pink is very bright and beautiful, as pictured.  Thinking of buying another in blue.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting this palette for a while and kept debating on whether or not to get it but i finally gave in and i wish i had done it sooner. Not only is it easier to access all shadows at once but it cleared so much clutter!</li>
            <li> Love these Palette&#x27;s. They allow easy access to all my shadows!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product. Genius. I have been wanting something like this for years. Definitely watch the HOW TO videos (how to remove your makeup from the cases) on the company&#x27;s website. Makeup time is more organized and efficient.</li>
            <li> great for placing &#x27;pan&#x27; shadows and blushes.</li>
            <li> Want more!! Love how I can see what is inside is in the palette. The color is very pretty.. Thanks</li>
