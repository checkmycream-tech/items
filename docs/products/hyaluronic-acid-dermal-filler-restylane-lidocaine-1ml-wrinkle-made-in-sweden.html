            <li>Outstanding and would like to order more!</li>
            <li>Waiting for result so far great!</li>
            <li>and if applied correctly yields beautiful results lasting about 6months to greatly reduce bags.</li>
            <li>My doctor uses to inject my face with this filler and it is the best and most natural looking ever</li>
            <li>Now the syringe itself w/ the Restylane is very genuine looking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m continuously checking the page to order more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using 1 inch blunt-tipped cannulas for most injections to minimize bruising.</li>
            <li>product was excellent will definitely order again</li>
            <li>Fantastic results !</li>
            <li>But my face looks so much better.</li>
            <li>If you are daring like me go for applying yourself many doctors will not accept purchased product because that&#x27;s where they make more</li>
            <li>I Agree with comment above best to under fill than overfill.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>when it will be available please</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>Yes it is the original product from Sweden</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal, just make sure</li>
            <li>Mid-West U.S.A. Overall I am VERY pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>They are sealed, sterile, and exactly right.</li>
            <li>[first time doing anything like this].</li>
            <li>The first time I had restylane applied was by a PHD Plastic Surgeon I looked at box very closely</li>
            <li>Inside is a very legit instruction paper in over 20 languages, didn&#x27;t count exactly, but it has the manufacturers bar code and everything.</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than expected, and is most certainly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The real deal....</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Because I was really conservative when I applied it, I will have to re-do it again.</li>
            <li>My skin does not even bleed when injected, syringe is very minute.</li>
            <li>it is 100% real which was my main concern</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and it is cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li>(exact same box) and technique, the product is very malleable</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive at first, but a package came quickly from Poland.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a couple of times and the person in Sweden is very professional, well packaged.</li>
            <li>Upon opening it, it&#x27;s definitely the real deal - I can tell by the printing on the box, very high quality and obviously manufactured in Uppsala Sweden like it says.</li>
            <li>Product was in date and what I was clearly looking for.</li>
            <li>plus this acid is naturally exists in the body so no side effects.</li>
            <li>The much anticipated package came in earlier this evening.</li>
            <li>after applying Lidocaine numbing cream and ensure syringe goes in deep, if small bulked up ball shows after injecting, no problem spreads easily with fingertip to mold/blend in where it needs to go.</li>
            <li>Absolutely, only used one of the three, but so far it exceeds my expectations.  </li>

            <li> Absolutely, only used one of the three, but so far it exceeds my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I recommend first time apply only half syringe on each eye, apply under bone and make sure skin is totally numb, wait about 30 mins.</li>
            <li> Again, be very careful if applying by yourself if overly full it will look worse, like big new bags under eye then you&#x27;ll have to find a Doctor who can remove it.</li>
            <li> It actually was delivered way sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The shipping wasn&#x27;t the fastest, but I&#x27;ve seen far worse.</li>
            <li> I recommend purchasing lidocaine cream to numb skin first (also on amazon)</li>
            <li> It took a little over 2 weeks to get to</li>
            <li> the needle is a 29 gauge and the product is too thick to go through this size needle without popping off and wasting product.</li>
            <li> I thought the possibility of being fake, but based on the product quality and presentation, I don&#x27;t think is fake.</li>
            <li> and I conclude impossible to replicate.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Waiting for result so far great!</li>
            <li> got here faster than thought. Product was in date and what I was clearly looking for.</li>
            <li> Excellent and easy to use</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal, just make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> The real deal.... no gimmicks or scams. It actually was delivered way sooner than expected. I&#x27;m continuously checking the page to order more. I used this to fill under my eye. If you would like some before and after photos, let me know. I&#x27;m in my 20s and I&#x27;ve always has the &amp;#34;sunken in&amp;#34; under eye look. I went for a consultation with a plastic surgeon who said I needed 3 syringes and that it would cost me over $1,500. I bought 2 of these from this seller and basically saved over 1100 dollars since i did it myself [first time doing anything like this]. It was risky but i just watched a couple videos on youtube, prayed and hoped for the best and it came out excellent!</li>
            <li> great product i am a nurse  and it works. when it will be available please</li>
            <li> Great product I would order it again.</li>
            <li> outstanding product!! as an RN I will recommended</li>
            <li> Love this product. Absolutely, only used one of the three, but so far it exceeds my expectations.  When I use the remaining two, and if there is a problem, I will alert you.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected, and is most certainly as advertised.</li>
            <li> this works great! easy to use.</li>
            <li> My doctor uses to inject my face with this filler and it is the best and most natural looking ever plus this acid is naturally exists in the body so no side effects. Highly recommend and it is cheaper on Amazon so buy it and take to the doctor who charges 3 times this amount then HE IS THE ONE TO INJECT IT.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I would give it a 5 except the needle is a 29 gauge and the product is too thick to go through this size needle without popping off and wasting product. I switched the needle and it worked PERFECT. Like the molding ability of the filler. Yes, I will buy again but I will use a 25-27 gauge not the 29 gauge that comes with it. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive at first, but a package came quickly from Poland.  They are sealed, sterile, and exactly right. Two half-inch sterile-capped needles come with each syringe. I would suggest using 1 inch blunt-tipped cannulas for most injections to minimize bruising. Already have used 2 of the syringes!  Ordering more!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> product was excellent will definitely order again it is 100% real which was my main concern</li>
            <li> Amazing ! Love it !  Fantastic results !</li>
            <li> Outstanding and would like to order more!</li>
            <li> The product is really good. Excellent results. Because I was really conservative when I applied it, I will have to re-do it again. But my face looks so much better. I thought the possibility of being fake, but based on the product quality and presentation, I don&#x27;t think is fake.</li>
            <li> Excellent results! Yes it is the original product from Sweden and I have learned to apply it myself for bags under eyes, comes with two syringes. I recommend purchasing lidocaine cream to numb skin first (also on amazon) I&#x27;ve ordered a couple of times and the person in Sweden is very professional, well packaged. Signature is required upon delivery, it ships by USPS does take about 2 weeks to deliver. If you are daring like me go for applying yourself many doctors will not accept purchased product because that&#x27;s where they make more $. Well worth it and if applied correctly yields beautiful results lasting about 6months to greatly reduce bags. My skin does not even bleed when injected, syringe is very minute. The first time I had restylane applied was by a PHD Plastic Surgeon I looked at box very closely (exact same box) and technique, the product is very malleable I recommend first time apply only half syringe on each eye, apply under bone and make sure skin is totally numb, wait about 30 mins. after applying Lidocaine numbing cream and ensure syringe goes in deep, if small bulked up ball shows after injecting, no problem spreads easily with fingertip to mold/blend in where it needs to go. Apply with care and conservatively. I Agree with comment above best to under fill than overfill. Doctor charges approx. $400 per vial. Again, be very careful if applying by yourself if overly full it will look worse, like big new bags under eye then you&#x27;ll have to find a Doctor who can remove it. Good luck!</li>

Now the syringe itself w/ the Restylane is very genuine looking and I conclude impossible to replicate. The shipping wasn&#x27;t the fastest, but I&#x27;ve seen far worse. It took a little over 2 weeks to get to Mid-West U.S.A. Overall I am VERY pleased with this product.</li>
