            <li> No other lotion compares to this product! I consider this product more of a medication than a lotion. This product will cure/repair dry split finger tips within a few applications. Apply heavy just before going to sleep for the night. Wake up healed. No nasty smell. Is not greasy as long as you don&#x27;t over apply. It can even help you get a bit of a grip on your work verses dried out hands. I MUST have this in my shop in order to continue working during the winter months. Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> Best Hand Cream Ever!</li>
            <li> Have ordered multiple tubes of Stokolan and have given away several of them....all love it!  Best stuff for the hands - great for feet...especially during the winter months!</li>
            <li> I HAVE FINALLY RECIEVED THE ADVIL, BUT I HAVE NOT RECIEVED THE SKIN LOTION. I AM STILL WAITING, THE PURCHASE HAS BEEN CHARGED TO MY CARD. THE PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN SENT TO MY BUISNESS YET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
            <li> The perfect solution for those who are hard on their hands. Perfect for the gardener, the mechanic, and those who dry their hands out.  Reminds me much of \\&quot;udder cream\\&quot; and It has Lanolin in it.  Not bad smelling but not pretty smelling.. so if you like fluffy smelly stuff look elsewhere - but if you want a great skin cream that smooths and Soothes and Is NOT Greasy (it soaks in) (lanolin - great stuff for super dried hands)  ~ This is the thing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually found this as samples at a trade show I went to.. so it is designed for the mechanic and hard on the hands :)</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this stuff.</li>
            <li> My daughter got a tube of this for free from the company she works for and was raving about how good it was, so I tried some, and it is great stuff. It was a brutal winter up north where we live ~ the cold weather outside and the dry heat inside was taking an especially bad toll on my hands, and this helped enormously. It&#x27;s thick, &amp;#34;melts in&amp;#34; quickly, and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Good cream for extremely dry hands--I use before bed and my hands feel great by morning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years in the large dispensers where I work, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a tube for myself.  Let me just say this:  No matter how dry, rough, or cracked your skin might be, ONE application of this cream will absolutely fix your skin in a day or two.  It&#x27;s a miracle, quite frankly.  I live in the northeast and the long, dry winters are brutal on my hands.  If I use this cream once a week, my hands never dry out or get rough.  Just buy one tube of this stuff and you&#x27;ll toss every other skin cream you own into the trash.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> Best and only cream ever healing my cracked  finger tips and my driy hand skin.  I very much recommend this product</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a tube of this as it treated her husband&#x27;s eczema. It has not beat my daughter&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s a really awesome lotion. It&#x27;s thick and creamy - just what our dry friends need. I will definitely purchase some when our free tube runs out.</li>
            <li> Beat skin cream out there.....worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best hand cream on the market. I&#x27;m a nurse and I wash my hands all the time. My hands were in horrible shape.  Someone left some of this cream at work and I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it.  It seems to have a protective barrier and since I have been using it regularly my hands have improved 100%.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream for excema!!</li>
            <li> I have no words to fully describe this.  I work on the river in all conditions and in the last couple years have had a bad BAD problem with my left hand cracking and peeling till it bleeds. Several trips to dermatologist and lots of misery and prescription creams then I find this.  This is by far the greatest cream EVER!  I have not had the first problem since I started using it. Highly highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have used this skin care product for years, it works great and I will buy again. The only place I have found it was on-line.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and this cream is the ONLY cream that heals my split, dry heels. I have given a bottle to my dog groomer and she loves it for her sore water exposed hands. It works wonders!</li>
            <li> Could not wait for this product to arrive.  Has already made significant improvement.  Plan to reorder again.</li>
