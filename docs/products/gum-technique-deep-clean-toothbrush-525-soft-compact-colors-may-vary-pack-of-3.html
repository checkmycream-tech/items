            <li>These are great brushes, super soft.</li>
            <li>Bum brand soft tooth brushes have been the best toothbrush for me so far...</li>
            <li>My gums have improved significantly since I started using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>It actually feels good on my gums the way it cleans below the gum line.  </li>
            <li>year, the dentist informed my husband that he had actually &amp;#34;scrubbed&amp;#34; a good portion of his gums away and now required</li>
            <li>I love how gentle they are and</li>
            <li>easy on her gums when she&#x27;s trying to do a good job around her brackets &amp; no complaints about being too rough on her gums.</li>
            <li>Soft enough to be gentle on teeth and gums and designed so that it does an excellent job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>toothbrushes are really good - different in colors than pictured; the seller very responsible; quick delivery</li>
            <li>Those fine soft bristles will clean my teeth without doing any harm.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>My dentist and hygienist have never warned me of possible gum issues or disease.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes may certainly be worth a try but be forewarned, they may clean more thoroughly than you want or are used to.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft and easy on your gums.</li>
            <li>But I figure if I floss first, I&#x27;m covering all bases.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly, we didn&#x27;t quite heed the advice of the dental professional, tossed the &amp;#34;wimpy&amp;#34; free toothbrushes in the drawer and soldiered on with our intense oral hygiene practices.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>Super soft toothbrush that&#x27;s gentle on your gums.</li>

            <li>The phrase, &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; when it comes to brushing your teeth really applies...</li>
            <li>; folks out there like me who like to put your whole heart into whatever you do, let me just caution you about applying that vigor to the way you brush your teeth..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t like he could opt out of having it done since he had scrubbed off so much gum tissue that his teeth were in danger of falling out!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Want to really brush your teeth?</li>
            <li>It cleans very well.</li>
            <li>As much as I&#x27;d like to continue using them, they just cost too much.</li>
            <li>but with much less, uh.enthusiasm!&lt;br /&gt;These deep clean brushes really are AMAZING at gently getting between the teeth without using force.  </li>

            <li>used properly they get under your gums and really clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>Cleans gums and teeth efficiently and with minimal pressure which is why it is suitable for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>On the flip side, though, since it&#x27;s so soft, I&#x27;m not sure it does as good a job as a stiffer brush.</li>
            <li>Super soft tapered bristles make brushing with braces easier for my 7 yr old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a better job of getting my teeth &amp; mouth cleaner &amp; dfresher than any previous brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The bristles get in between teeth &amp; are very soft.  </li>
            <li>finally, a soft toothbrush just like the ones the dentists give out!</li>
            <li>Heavenly soft toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>But, beware, when they say soft they&#x27;re not kidding - it&#x27;s like brushing with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and with these extremely soft bristles brushing is effortless/comfortable.</li>
            <li>Dentist always tells me to get soft bristles and be sure to brush gums as well, but I felt like the &#x27;soft&#x27; brushes I purchased at store where a little rough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for these forever- thus far only my Dentist seemed to have them.</li>
            <li>always figured that, in order to get these choppers clean I needed to get use a firm brush with firm pressure to really get in there a scrub the livin&#x27; daylights out of plaque...</li>

            <li> No, I&#x27;m not saying brush your teeth LESS!  </li>
            <li> A bit painful at first as you get used to cleaning under the gum line, but now I don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li> after a few days of using the brush my gums were sore and newly sensitive to cold temperatures.</li>
            <li> They are entirely too expensive.</li>
            <li> I am a hard core Oral-B user, but I couldn&#x27;t find a compact head, well equipped toothbrush.</li>
            <li> why are they so hard to find in stores???</li>

            <li> Heavenly soft toothbrush.  Wish I would have had these earlier since I tend to brush too hard.  Must have - leaves teeth feeling like you just got done at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product not made in China; GUM is the brand my son&#x27;s dentist gives to his patients.  But, beware, when they say soft they&#x27;re not kidding - it&#x27;s like brushing with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush ever!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice making your gum healthy and maybe you do not need flossing anymore .</li>

            <li> I was VERY skeptical buying this toothbrush! I am a hard core Oral-B user, but I couldn&#x27;t find a compact head, well equipped toothbrush. I went out on a limb and purchased a 3 pack of these. After using it the first time, I had to admit that I am very impressed. The bristles are really soft and easy on your gums. I felt as if my mouth was really cleaned afterwards.</li>
            <li> Nice soft bristles, perfect brush size. This is the one my dentist hands out and tried to find them in the stores, no luck. Leave it to Amazon to have it all!!!</li>
            <li> Super soft tapered bristles make brushing with braces easier for my 7 yr old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy on her gums when she&#x27;s trying to do a good job around her brackets &amp; no complaints about being too rough on her gums.</li>

I think it&#x27;s the ultra fine tapered bristles that do the trick - that and brushing longer.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they don&#x27;t last as long but the alternative is WAY more costly and, for sure, more painful.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this info has helped at least one person who may be headed down the same road with bad brushing habits!, I would have been in the same boat from the rough brushing!&lt;br /&gt;It took awhile to ditch the bad to the bone brushing technique and learn to brush LONGER but with much less, uh.enthusiasm!&lt;br /&gt;These deep clean brushes really are AMAZING at gently getting between the teeth without using force.

            <li> Super soft toothbrush that&#x27;s gentle on your gums. For some reason, I find that I brush my teeth for a longer time than I did when using a stiffer brush. For me, it&#x27;s much more comfortable. On the flip side, though, since it&#x27;s so soft, I&#x27;m not sure it does as good a job as a stiffer brush. But I figure if I floss first, I&#x27;m covering all bases.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I love the way they make my gums feel.  The 4 star rating is because they don&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> Want to really brush your teeth? then use these brushes. used properly they get under your gums and really clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased this toothbrush on vacation when I forgot to pack my toothbrush. I love how gentle they are and your teeth and mouth feels so very clean.</li>
            <li> Great quality and price!</li>
            <li> Seems to be good brushes.  I like having these simple ones as a change from my more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Caution: those fine bristle tips may overpower your gums. When I saw this toothbrush I thought to myself, This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for! Those fine soft bristles will clean my teeth without doing any harm.&lt;br /&gt;But after a few days of using the brush my gums were sore and newly sensitive to cold temperatures. I know what you may be thinking: the guy&#x27;s gums were bad to start with but I floss daily, brush morning &amp; night and have my teeth cleaned twice a year. My dentist and hygienist have never warned me of possible gum issues or disease.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes may certainly be worth a try but be forewarned, they may clean more thoroughly than you want or are used to.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a better job of getting my teeth &amp; mouth cleaner &amp; dfresher than any previous brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> finally, a soft toothbrush just like the ones the dentists give out! why are they so hard to find in stores???</li>
            <li> The best tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  Soft enough to be gentle on teeth and gums and designed so that it does an excellent job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> My dentist gives these out at appointments and I love them.  So soft.</li>
            <li> Bum brand soft tooth brushes have been the best toothbrush for me so far...</li>
            <li> Absolute best toothebrush ever!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and with these extremely soft bristles brushing is effortless/comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Perfect!!! It cleans very well. healthy gum !!!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  Ordered these because I liked the one that a dentist gave out.  The bristles get in between teeth &amp; are very soft.  Dentist always tells me to get soft bristles and be sure to brush gums as well, but I felt like the &#x27;soft&#x27; brushes I purchased at store where a little rough.  This brush cleans teeth and doesn&#x27;t hurt gums.</li>
            <li> The only tooth brushes, my wife will use</li>
            <li> Love the pointed tip! It lets me clean between teet which is invaluable!</li>
            <li> Great product, very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Cleans gums and teeth efficiently and with minimal pressure which is why it is suitable for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these forever- thus far only my Dentist seemed to have them. They are great. A bit painful at first as you get used to cleaning under the gum line, but now I don&#x27;t notice it. Will use these until my dying day.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> These are great brushes, super soft. I bought these because they were the brushes that my dentist formerly gave out. They are entirely too expensive. As much as I&#x27;d like to continue using them, they just cost too much. I change brushes every month. My dentist must&#x27;ve thought so too because he switched to Golgate. I returned to Oral B.</li>
            <li> These are amazing tooth brushes! I love them so much and they work great. I was given them by the dentist every time I would get my teeth cleaned and decided to order them myself because I feel they do a great job!</li>
            <li> toothbrushes are really good - different in colors than pictured; the seller very responsible; quick delivery</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning gum line.  My gums have improved significantly since I started using this toothbrush.</li>
