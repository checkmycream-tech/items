            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I would tell the seller to dump this product and keep their good name</li>
            <li>the scent is pleasant and very appealing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She told me it reminded her of a very favorite perfume that went away years ago...</li>
            <li>great transaction - genuine product</li>
            <li>but this one is really nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shopping, for years, for a nice signature scent to call my own, and haven&#x27;t had any luck at all, until I discovered Bottega Veneta.</li>
            <li>Really liked the scent from the magazine sample.  </li>
            <li>My partner love the parfum.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I have been dreaming of - a very sophisticated, warm, non-floral, scent.</li>
            <li>this one &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Bottega Veneta is my favorite perfume</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>Love, love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love the way my clothes smell after I wear it.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>This perfume is intoxicating.i love it.</li>
            <li>I loved it the first minute I smelled it</li>
            <li>Just one warning, be sure to have a &#x27;light&#x27; hand with this scent....</li>
            <li>This is an extraordinary and elegant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The splash bottle is a bit of a pain, just be careful, it works great for me, love the scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this fragrance is light but stays.</li>
            <li>Though the list of ingredients calls for what would make a sickly sweet &#x27;fume&#x27; this one is everything</li>
            <li>Been searching for this spicy and sweet smell that doesn&#x27;t change scents after one hour or with my chemistry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sexy, sophisticated and different from anything on the market today!</li>
            <li>I love the scent - very rich and for a mature and classic woman.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy it fresh from now on.</li>
            <li>Badass this stuff is worth every bit of what you pay for it.</li>
            <li>I wear it sparingly but worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is elegant, quiet and refined.</li>
            <li>The shipping and packaging is first rate but for $50.00 for 1/4 ounce it is a rip off.</li>
            <li>However the package was first rate  </li>
            <li>Like all perfumes try it first ...</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have much staying power....</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this was a mini</li>
            <li>Ladies I highly recommend this parfum</li>
            <li>Just love it so am ordering large size when small size is gone.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing a larger bottle; It will be worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Very different from the usual &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; out there, soft, gentle, but not powdery.....love  the leathery undertone.....expensive, but worth every dime.</li>
            <li>It is a little expensive but has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>I am very picky and have a hard time finding just the right scent...</li>
            <li>but with a little pump spray which is so much easier to use.</li>

            <li> I bought two of this little bottles.  </li>
            <li> That is why I bought the small size.</li>
            <li> so bought small size.  </li>

            <li> sorry I can&#x27;t remember the name for you.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My partner love the parfum.  It was small enough to take through the airport screening without being tossed.  Great travel fragrance.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance.  However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have much staying power....</li>
            <li> As soon as I received the package I opened it and was so disapointed that it smelled &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;. Perfume passed it prime. I returned it immediately. I&#x27;ll buy it fresh from now on.</li>
            <li> What a great fragrance! I am very picky and have a hard time finding just the right scent... but this one is really nice.</li>
            <li> This is the perfume I&#x27;ve been searching for! I&#x27;ve been shopping, for years, for a nice signature scent to call my own, and haven&#x27;t had any luck at all, until I discovered Bottega Veneta. It is exactly what I have been dreaming of - a very sophisticated, warm, non-floral, scent. I will definitely be purchasing a larger bottle; It will be worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to go out on a limb to buy fragrances I&#x27;ve never sampled before but I took the plunge w/this one &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did. The fragrance is elegant, quiet and refined. Though the list of ingredients calls for what would make a sickly sweet &#x27;fume&#x27; this one is everything but. Upon its 1st spritz on your skin, you&#x27;ll feel it tangy almost orange-y but as it starts warming up, the chypre and plum come to the forefront making it a pleasure to smell and in steps the leather accord to dry it down and avoid it from becoming too cloying or irritating. In my opinion, Bottega Veneta did their name justice by giving the world a fragrance which exemplifies their understated glamor. This is now a &#x27;permanent &#x27; on my list. It&#x27;s versatile enough to wear year round. Just one warning, be sure to have a &#x27;light&#x27; hand with this scent....overapplying can turn it into overkill. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The finest! Been searching for this spicy and sweet smell that doesn&#x27;t change scents after one hour or with my chemistry.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Bottega Veneta is my favorite perfume and I was very happy to receive it in a timely way. I am so excited!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Ladies I highly recommend this parfum</li>
            <li> great transaction - genuine product</li>
            <li> The best fragrance I have ever had!</li>
            <li> Great perfume. I love the scent. I generally get tired of a perfume before I use the whole bottle. That is why I bought the small size.</li>
            <li> I love the scent - very rich and for a mature and classic woman. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle. This little &#x27;mini&#x27; sized bottle doesn&#x27;t have a spray and the top is a plastic stopper that is really difficult to get out. You then have to dab the perfume. I was really hoping this was a mini but with a little pump spray which is so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I should have considered what the other reviewer&#x27;s said. The scent lasts for ten minutes. It&#x27;s lovely. the scent is pleasant and very appealing. it has no staying power. It also does not come with a spray attachment so I had to but that. It</li>
            <li> Badass this stuff is worth every bit of what you pay for it. I loved it the first minute I smelled it</li>
            <li> The shipping and packaging is first rate but for $50.00 for 1/4 ounce it is a rip off. I bought it for my wife for Mothers Day she put some on her arm to test it and within  one hour the scent was gone. I tried it on my arm and got the same result .It should be sold at a drugstore for $4.99. So don&#x27;t believe the magazine ads on this one you will be disappointed. However the package was first rate  I would tell the seller to dump this product and keep their good name</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know if I would like this fragrance so bought small size.  Just love it so am ordering large size when small size is gone.</li>
            <li> Love, love this perfume. It is a little expensive but has a nice clean smell. I love the way my clothes smell after I wear it. I wear it sparingly but worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> I bought two of this little bottles.  the seller was wonderful.  We e-mailed and she helped me order the second botte.&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance is light but stays.</li>
            <li> Expensive smell...well within my budget....very sexy....different and have received quite a few compliments... Like all perfumes try it first ...everything not for everyone</li>
            <li> The splash bottle is a bit of a pain, just be careful, it works great for me, love the scent.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. It&#x27;s sexy, sophisticated and different from anything on the market today! I&#x27;m regularly asked what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> This perfume is intoxicating.i love it.</li>
            <li> The best.....if Heaven has a fragrance, this must be it. Very different from the usual &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; out there, soft, gentle, but not powdery.....love  the leathery undertone.....expensive, but worth every dime. Received days ahead of schedule, bubble wrapped and boxed.....HAPPY customer.</li>
            <li> This is an extraordinary and elegant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She told me it reminded her of a very favorite perfume that went away years ago...sorry I can&#x27;t remember the name for you.</li>
            <li> Really liked the scent from the magazine sample.  So glad I found this miniature bottle to try as I am not so crazy about the scent after all.</li>
