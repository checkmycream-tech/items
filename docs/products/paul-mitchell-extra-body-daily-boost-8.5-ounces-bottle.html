            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many volume products before, but never got good results.</li>
            <li>Love this product-it is a good root</li>
            <li>It is very light, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair all crunchy like hair spray does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regular hair mousse works so much better and is 4 times cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>This product has been a favorite  of mine for years, and then could not find locally--was even told it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>Have tried a bunch of these including the Aveda product and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>AND FEELS MORE THICKER.  </li>
            <li>ON TOP AND SIDES AND STYLE.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THE FULLNESS.</li>
            <li>I spray some of this onto my roots, and it immediately my hair is more manageable.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work on my fine hair at all!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>This has made it so much easier for me to fix my own hair.</li>
            <li>I have a cabinet full of root boosters and mousses that didn&#x27;t work for one reason or another.</li>
            <li>Have fine hair and this Paul Mitchell extra body boost surely helps.  </li>
            <li>But of course, your hair is not dirty, nor can you see that the product is there.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical at first as it was so economical but happily surprised! :)</li>
            <li>This one does exactly what it is supposed to, plus it&#x27;s lightweight on your hair, so your style doesn&#x27;t collapse as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>the best product for long heavy hair.</li>
            <li>Gives a real lift to hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and works very well - hair stays</li>
            <li>It is nice, doesn&#x27;t feel stiff and yet gives it the body I am looking for.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super straight, fine, and limp.</li>
            <li>Definitely my new go to hair product!</li>
            <li>I got my haircut at the Paul Mitchell school and they used this on my hair after I told them my frustration with my super flat hair.</li>
            <li>fine, wavy hair and Paul Mitchell&#x27;s daily boost definitely helps the roots lift up</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, limp hair, and although my hair looks good when I leave the beauty salon, I could never replicate the look myself.</li>
            <li>The only thing is if you use too much around the front portion of your hair, it looks like you have greasy bangs.</li>
            <li>I have really thin hair and this, along with blow drying and a good brush, makes my hair seem full and thick.  </li>
            <li>After applying a lot directly on my roots, I use a diffuser to blow dry my hair (using a heat protectant).</li>

            <li> While it does lift the roots it left my hair very dry.  </li>
            <li> It would either be too greasy, too heavy (adds even more weight to my hair), or make my hair hard and stiff.</li>
            <li> Spray it on after shower, comb through and dry.  </li>
            <li> and it did seem to add a little extra volume.</li>
            <li> Since I usually grow my hair long, the weight of my hair always keeps it flat no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> and a little spritz goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this because, while I have tons of hair, it&#x27;s just slick and flat after washing.</li>
            <li> I still have some Graham Webb Thick Infusion left.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I just dampen my hair with my fingertips, spritz a little on the roots, and blow dry with a round brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where one could go wrong in such a simple procedure.</li>
            <li> My morning routine now is to spray this onto my roots (towel dried hair) and rub it in a bit, and then blow-dry my hair upside down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is strange, that my hair-dresser used the same product and it worked, but all my efforts failed.</li>
            <li> a little bit.</li>
            <li> lifter.--- does not ever fell sticky /highly recommend even for very thick heavy hair such as mine!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I use it every day!!!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Product fake?</li>
            <li> feel frustrated with it and will never buy this water again.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have a loooot of hair! And it&#x27;s super straight, fine, and limp. Since I usually grow my hair long, the weight of my hair always keeps it flat no matter what I do. I&#x27;ve tried many volume products before, but never got good results. It would either be too greasy, too heavy (adds even more weight to my hair), or make my hair hard and stiff. I got my haircut at the Paul Mitchell school and they used this on my hair after I told them my frustration with my super flat hair. It is amazing!! It is very light, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair all crunchy like hair spray does. My morning routine now is to spray this onto my roots (towel dried hair) and rub it in a bit, and then blow-dry my hair upside down. I don&#x27;t have to do anything else, and my hair keeps the perfect amount of volume the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I love this product! With my roots lifted, my hair stays cleaner for longer. After applying a lot directly on my roots, I use a diffuser to blow dry my hair (using a heat protectant).</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair and this, along with blow drying and a good brush, makes my hair seem full and thick.  Definitely my new go to hair product!</li>
            <li> I have a cabinet full of root boosters and mousses that didn&#x27;t work for one reason or another. This one does exactly what it is supposed to, plus it&#x27;s lightweight on your hair, so your style doesn&#x27;t collapse as the day goes on. You get lift, volume, and shine. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> While it does lift the roots it left my hair very dry.  I won&#x27;t be using it again.  I still have some Graham Webb Thick Infusion left. It works great but it&#x27;s been discontinued.  That&#x27;s why I tried Paul Mitchell.  The hunt for a good root lift product continues.</li>
            <li> Have fine hair and this Paul Mitchell extra body boost surely helps.  Spray it on after shower, comb through and dry.  Gives a real lift to hair.</li>
            <li> the best product for long heavy hair. I can&#x27;t find it locally amidst all the other Paul Mitchell products, so when I found it on Amazon, I actually felt relief. So did my bangs.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been experiencing mild hair thinning and this product helps boost and give body to me having a great hair day!</li>
            <li> I like squirting this on my hair when it is half-dry and then shaping.  It is nice, doesn&#x27;t feel stiff and yet gives it the body I am looking for.</li>
            <li> This product has been a favorite  of mine for years, and then could not find locally--was even told it was discontinued. Love this product-it is a good root lifter.--- does not ever fell sticky /highly recommend even for very thick heavy hair such as mine!</li>
            <li> Works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Have tried a bunch of these including the Aveda product and this is my favorite. Inexpensive and works very well - hair stays lifted all day, no surprise flatness in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair and Paul Mitchell&#x27;s daily boost definitely helps the roots lift up so my hair is fuller.  It does not leave any heavy&lt;br /&gt;residue and a little spritz goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and it did seem to add a little extra volume.</li>
            <li> HAIR LOOKS AND FEELS MORE THICKER.  I JUST SPRAY AT ROOTS ON TOP AND SIDES AND STYLE.  LOVE THE FULLNESS.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I use it everyday!!! I was sceptical at first as it was so economical but happily surprised! :)</li>
            <li> I use this because, while I have tons of hair, it&#x27;s just slick and flat after washing. I spray some of this onto my roots, and it immediately my hair is more manageable. It&#x27;s similar to &amp;#34;dirtying your hair up&amp;#34; a little bit. But of course, your hair is not dirty, nor can you see that the product is there.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Gives great texture and lift from roots. The only thing is if you use too much around the front portion of your hair, it looks like you have greasy bangs. Other than that, I use it every day!!!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this, and now I use it everytime I wash my hair.  Adds body to my hair and I like the smell of it!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, limp hair, and although my hair looks good when I leave the beauty salon, I could never replicate the look myself. This has made it so much easier for me to fix my own hair. In the morning, I just dampen my hair with my fingertips, spritz a little on the roots, and blow dry with a round brush. Easy-peasy.
