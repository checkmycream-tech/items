            <li>What I love about this conditioner is the conditioning affect can be felt the minute you put it in your hair as the strands of your hair becomes smoother and easier to manage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the search for the perfect brand that actually repairs my hair.</li>

            <li>The scent is refreshing and smells like a tropical fruit.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get any better -  </li>
            <li>I started to get a lot more breakage and split ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li>although nongreasy, the shine was also more noticeable after one wash.</li>
            <li>my hair after styling looked fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use and love, three One-n-Only Argan Oil brand products.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is lovely and none of the products create build-up and helps to keep color treated hair from fading.  </li>
            <li>This product has wonderful moisturizing properties and leaves hair clean and silky soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells fantastic and it&#x27;s mostly organic.  </li>
            <li>I used a sample of this product to begin with and loved it so much that I searched and searched to find it.</li>
            <li>I found it is much more affordable than most products I have used in the past and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It gets frizzy easy but it also on the wispy side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent and the texture were nice but didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything wonderful for my hair which is thick and wavy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was an okay conditioner but nothing special.</li>
            <li>and/or B)I used a light curl leave in product after use.</li>
            <li>I have tried the MoroccanOil brand and didn&#x27;t find MorroccanOil to be all that great as it still left my hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I love this so much can&#x27;t want to buy more.</li>
            <li>I had loved how nice my hair felt while I was in the shower with my hair wet.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil has been the best find for my hair - really helps condition it without turning it into flat, overconditioned hair</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular but just decent.</li>
            <li>They also stay clean for longer time.</li>
            <li>My hair did not feel clean and was still frizzy.  </li>
            <li>This product helps make it feel soft and adds shine -  Love it!  </li>
            <li>Gave my hair a healthy look, even though it was very damaged because of years of abuse.</li>
            <li>My first impression is that the products are pretty much okay for not stripping the hair and adding moisture.  </li>
            <li>Also leaves hair healthy, soft and free for split ends.</li>
            <li>soft, shiny and frizz free and a great bonus is I do not have to use an extra leave in to</li>
            <li>Looks more a live.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this works for some people, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me except make my hair smell good but look dry and break off.</li>
            <li>Plus if you pay $5 for a beauty card at sallys you can buy this for 7.99 which is worth the price.</li>
            <li>and i feel worth trying.will</li>
            <li>I was really excited to buy this product because I love the regular Moroccan (Argan) oil and also the styling cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super smooth and makes hair nice and soft, especially hair that has been damaged!</li>
            <li>Right now in my show I have 6 kinds of shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my hair soft and not dry, it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong, but nice  </li>
            <li>After a couple of uses, I noticed that my normally healthy hair felt very straw-like instead of soft and slippery after I rinsed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Conditioner.   </li>
            <li>Before I found this wonderful conditioner I would have to used a leave in such as Fekkai Glossing Cream in order to add manageability and to control but no more.   </li>
            <li>I used this on my hair consistently for about a week, and realized that it was overkill for my hair and made it sort of greasy, even if I rinsed REALLY WELL.</li>
            <li>I usually use Paul Mitchell and Matrix products and was excited to use a new and cheaper brand as if I liked it, I could save some money.  </li>
            <li>My hair is dry and I need a deep good conditioner that controls the frizz, this is not it.</li>
            <li>So my hair is curly,wavy and straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to really scrub my scalp and wash my hair very well and just put the conditioner on the ends</li>
            <li>The shampoo for this brand I cannot use as it is way too gentle and does not remove hairspray.</li>
            <li>Very displeased with this product.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to use Sulfate Free and ONLY argan oil products.</li>
            <li>me try something else that&#x27;s Sulfate Free and has argan oil.&amp;#34; Came across One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil products</li>
            <li>The conditioner combined with the leave-in oil is a terrific combo for smooth, non-frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really a lot to help my hair.</li>
            <li>Argan oil is very beneficial in adding moisture to skin an hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased the matching shampoo at my local HEB when I ran out of EnJoy Luxury, so I decided to buy this on a lark.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve only used this once and so far</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is I don&#x27;t know if it is because I use the hair spray on top of the other products but my hair gets greasier more quickly</li>
            <li>Decent conditioner to use for softer and easier hair.</li>
            <li>When used with a good shampoo, it leaves my thick (type 4) hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Found a product in New Zealand that was made from the argan</li>
            <li>(Be sure to get regular trims to be rid of that old, dry stuff too.)</li>
            <li>I lovd the way this conditioner repaired my hair after even the first wash,it left my hair with moisture</li>
            <li>The deep conditioner and the normal conditioner don&#x27;t make my hair instantly smooth and silky like other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well and I usually shampoo my hair twice just because it doesn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>the towel dried hair is still extremely soft, and tangle free.   </li>
            <li>It leave the hair soft and not heavy like some conditioners.</li>
            <li>Did not leave my hair soft as it promised it fact</li>
            <li>It soft edge my hair and gave it shine along with the treatment oil .</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t get a ton of slip, it left my hair hydrated, very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Made my hair dull and even more dry than what it it.</li>
            <li>What I really don&#x27;t like is the extreme perfume smell of the product.  </li>
            <li>I decided to keep using it, just in case the odd texture was due to the shift from EnJoy.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, my normal routine is to wash and condition every other day and to just condition on the days that I don&#x27;t wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> the towel dried hair is still extremely soft, and tangle free.   </li>
            <li> It leave the hair soft and not heavy like some conditioners.</li>
            <li> Did not leave my hair soft as it promised it fact</li>
            <li> It soft edge my hair and gave it shine along with the treatment oil .</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t get a ton of slip, it left my hair hydrated, very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dull and even more dry than what it it.</li>
            <li> What I really don&#x27;t like is the extreme perfume smell of the product.  </li>
            <li> I decided to keep using it, just in case the odd texture was due to the shift from EnJoy.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, my normal routine is to wash and condition every other day and to just condition on the days that I don&#x27;t wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll go through this bottle rather quickly if you have thick hair or long hair.  </li>
            <li> I was very questionable about trying this product but it did wonders for my hair and couldn&#x27;t ask for more for the price!</li>
            <li> Definitely 5 stars on this product, esp recommended to those with dry coarse curls.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, dry, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> In fact my hair feels dry some times after using the deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have Natural Black 4a hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been oily and needs washing every day, as I&#x27;ve gotten into my mid-50&#x27;s, all of the sudden my hair is getting dry and frizzled.</li>
            <li> I have color treated, coarse, curly hair that tends to be on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I see a big difference and will never go back to other brands</li>
            <li> My hair type in case anyone wants to compare is usually semi coarse , thick, with a natural wave and once prone to frizzing.  </li>
            <li> But when it is dried it feels soft again.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and thick</li>
            <li> One and Only needs to definitely tone down the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason for four stars instead of five is that is not pure argan oil but having said that I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not finding my hair much different than the other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have used several other kinds of moroccan hair care products before I found this one.</li>
            <li> hadn&#x27;t used the product in quite some time, but I used it the other night and the next day</li>
            <li> The conditioning affect does not wash out, once you finish washing your hair and dry it</li>
            <li> As an Amazon Vine reviewer I&#x27;ve once did a review for Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Dry To Moisturized Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have frizzy, dry, unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> Even when the product is rinsed and the hair dry</li>
            <li> My dry hair behaves so well with this product.</li>
            <li> The Pantene conditioner did just this as long as my hair was wet</li>
            <li> I noticed my curls were slightly loose, but that may be bc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black and I&#x27;m a Caucasion mix Asian heritage.</li>
            <li> but the intensity of it is crazy strong.  </li>
            <li> my hair was very dry after using it.....</li>
            <li> I use to go 3 days with out washing my hair now its every other day or use dry</li>
            <li> I dye my hair once a month and they look less dry since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> So I am always in a search of products that will give my hair some softness, shine and keep it less dry.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was really surprised to notice that it was very thin - unlike the shampoo which is so thick</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredient list found that this quality if due to the ingredient Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone  and found  Dimethicone is a type of silicone used in conditioners to make hair shiny and slippery.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any other chemicals in my hair; shampoo, conditioner and argan oil, and I was out the door.</li>
            <li> While I love Moroccan conditioners but hate the frizz factor they often leave me with, this one didn&#x27;t turn me into a poodle-</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel as moisturizing as other conditioners I have used in the past,  </li>
            <li> As for a daily conditioning, I have very thick curly hair, and once a week does the trick for me (which is a bonus because the product lasts a LOT longer).</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, chemically dyed-</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged and dry from being ill and taking medications.</li>
            <li> Coated my hair, made it appear dull and&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> so at least it&#x27;s got one thing going for it - no heat damage.  </li>
            <li> Conditioner feels thick when coming out of bottle; you need a lot of it for one wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll not buy no more!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not as good as the products I use.</li>
            <li> everytime I showered with this and the shampoo no more!!</li>
            <li> I am so tired of all the drugstore shampoo smells.</li>
            <li> dogs, looked worse on him.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> I think it is a mediocre conditioner!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad product, but I don&#x27;t think I will be in a mood to use it again.</li>
            <li> The smell itself isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> It made my hair fall out like crazy!</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> very bad product..love the mascara but shampoo and conditioner is a wais of money and time.....</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this product along with the oil as a sample gift from my hair dresser. Not only does it make my hair soft and not dry, it smells wonderful! Wish I could find this in the store!</li>
            <li> I have coarse, dry, curly hair.  This product helps make it feel soft and adds shine -  Love it!  (smells great too!)</li>
            <li> I love this so much can&#x27;t want to buy more. Great for the skin and has a great scent. Wish I just of ordered more.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It is one of the BEST Moroccan oil conditioners out there, at a fraction of the price. TO be completely honest, I like it a lot more than the others. While I don&#x27;t get a ton of slip, it left my hair hydrated, very soft and shiny. While I love Moroccan conditioners but hate the frizz factor they often leave me with, this one didn&#x27;t turn me into a poodle- perhaps that is because A)its not a deep conditioner and/or B)I used a light curl leave in product after use. I noticed my curls were slightly loose, but that may be bc I also washed my hair in conjunction, which I don&#x27;t often do. I am betting (from experience) that for those who like me, do not wash daily but do condition, this stuff works wonders- I can&#x27;t wait to use on a day when I haven&#x27;t washed to see how nicely my hair reacts to this product. Definitely 5 stars on this product, esp recommended to those with dry coarse curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Conditioner.   What I love about this conditioner is the conditioning affect can be felt the minute you put it in your hair as the strands of your hair becomes smoother and easier to manage.  The conditioning affect does not wash out, once you finish washing your hair and dry it the towel dried hair is still extremely soft, and tangle free.   Before I found this wonderful conditioner I would have to used a leave in such as Fekkai Glossing Cream in order to add manageability and to control but no more.   This conditioner has the best of two worlds for me and if they ever discontinue it I&#x27;m stocking up.     As an Amazon Vine reviewer I&#x27;ve once did a review for Pantene Pro-v Curly Hair Series Dry To Moisturized Conditioner.  I had loved how nice my hair felt while I was in the shower with my hair wet.  After reading the ingredient list found that this quality if due to the ingredient Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone  and found  Dimethicone is a type of silicone used in conditioners to make hair shiny and slippery.  The Pantene conditioner did just this as long as my hair was wet but the minute I stepped out of the shower the silicone caused the strands of my hair to catch and tangle.        One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Conditioner not only contains Dimethicone but also Aragan Oil (Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil ) so the silicon (Dimethicone) remains lubricated which prevents it from snagging once water isn&#x27;t providing that lubricant.     I have tried the MoroccanOil brand and didn&#x27;t find MorroccanOil to be all that great as it still left my hair frizzy.  The One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Conditioner leaves my hair soft, shiny and frizz free and a great bonus is I do not have to use an extra leave in to once I step out of the shower.     My hair type in case anyone wants to compare is usually semi coarse , thick, with a natural wave and once prone to frizzing.  It&#x27;s black and I&#x27;m a Caucasion mix Asian heritage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a serial hair product user. Right now in my show I have 6 kinds of shampoos and conditioners. Dove, Tress-me to Alba. I&#x27;m on the search for the perfect brand that actually repairs my hair. This stuff I bought because of the glowing reviews on sallys website. I bought the hair spray, shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m irish/english mutt. Like to call myself Western European mix. So my hair is curly,wavy and straight. It gets frizzy easy but it also on the wispy side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reviews for the conditioner is mixed. I like it and I have noticed a difference in my hair. My hair does seem healthier and my hair color has lasted longer since using it. (I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now) My hair feels lighter and people around me have noticed my hair has changed. Looks more a live. The deep conditioner and the normal conditioner don&#x27;t make my hair instantly smooth and silky like other products I&#x27;ve used. In fact my hair feels dry some times after using the deep conditioner. But when it is dried it feels soft again. It also smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well and I usually shampoo my hair twice just because it doesn&#x27;t feel clean. My hair still is frizzy. My biggest complaint is I don&#x27;t know if it is because I use the hair spray on top of the other products but my hair gets greasier more quickly then it did before I started using this product. I&#x27;ve tried to really scrub my scalp and wash my hair very well and just put the conditioner on the ends but it still just gets greasy the next day after I wash it. I use to go 3 days with out washing my hair now its every other day or use dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product and I will keep using it until I find something else. Plus if you pay $5 for a beauty card at sallys you can buy this for 7.99 which is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; conditioner.  Nothing spectacular but just decent. This is better than the shampoo though. I like Paul Mitchell products much better!</li>
            <li> One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Conditioner helps in controlling frizz.  It leave the hair soft and not heavy like some conditioners.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner as the reviews stated it was great.  I usually use Paul Mitchell and Matrix products and was excited to use a new and cheaper brand as if I liked it, I could save some money.  Unfortunately it is not as good as the products I use. It isn&#x27;t a bad product, but I don&#x27;t think I will be in a mood to use it again. My hair is dry and I need a deep good conditioner that controls the frizz, this is not it. The shampoo for this brand I cannot use as it is way too gentle and does not remove hairspray. The treatment spray for this brand however is awesome and does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, leaves hair soft &amp; shiny.  Gave my hair a healthy look, even though it was very damaged because of years of abuse.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong, but nice  This doesn&#x27;t feel as moisturizing as other conditioners I have used in the past,  feels like you put nothing in your hair.  I finished the bottle, but won&#x27;t be buying anymore of this.  I have Natural Black 4a hair.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil has been the best find for my hair - really helps condition it without turning it into flat, overconditioned hair - I use both the conditioner and shampoo, the serum, and the &amp;#34;One n Only&amp;#34; Argan Oil hair dye - all of them are excellent products and I have every intention of continuing to use them!</li>
            <li> It made my hair fall out like crazy! Don&#x27;t buy this ! It came out in handfuls! Omg I wish I never did this! I&#x27;ll not buy no more!</li>
            <li> I was very questionable about trying this product but it did wonders for my hair and couldn&#x27;t ask for more for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! The shampoo and conditioner smell so great I would buy them again just for that alone. I am so tired of all the drugstore shampoo smells. My hair feels wonderful after using it. And it looks so shiny. My hair is damaged and dry from being ill and taking medications. This product has been a godsend. I am thinking of purchasing more products from their line when I have more $$$. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> great smell very moisturizing and it gives me the results i want. My hair is very curly and thick so i love this for it</li>
            <li> My hair was always getting fuzzy curls. I’ve been using this stuff with the shampoo and the oil and it almost never gets fuzzy anymore.</li>
            <li> I was visiting my sister and she had this product in her shower,.  I used it, borrowed some, and then immediately bought some for myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay I do not like the fact that it has mineral oil, as one of the ingredients.  I think it is a mediocre conditioner!</li>
            <li> Very displeased with this product.  Coated my hair, made it appear dull and&lt;br /&gt;lifeless.  Would not recommend this product to anyone.  Tried using it on one of&lt;br /&gt;my dogs, looked worse on him.</li>
            <li> I hate this product. Never again would I buy it. Made my hair dull and even more dry than what it it. I have frizzy, dry, unmanageable hair. So I ended up doing the Keratin Treatment. My hair was great. So I decided to use Sulfate Free and ONLY argan oil products. I used Agadir products for 2 months straight after my Keratin Treatment, and my hair was the best. I didn&#x27;t use any other chemicals in my hair; shampoo, conditioner and argan oil, and I was out the door. Then I decieded &amp;#34;Let me try something else that&#x27;s Sulfate Free and has argan oil.&amp;#34; Came across One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil products and I decieded to buy the shampoo, conditioner, and the argan oil. WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. I used it 3X and now it&#x27;s just sitting in my shower. Going back to my Agadir products.</li>
            <li> Did not leave my hair soft as it promised it fact my hair was very dry after using it.....go figure</li>
            <li> )            I found this after I saw my sister using it I&#x27;ve had problems with my hair coming out everytime I showered with this and the shampoo no more!! It leaves the hair smelling good too I see a big difference and will never go back to other brands</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. When used with a good shampoo, it leaves my thick (type 4) hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair once a month and they look less dry since I started using this product. They also stay clean for longer time.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been oily and needs washing every day, as I&#x27;ve gotten into my mid-50&#x27;s, all of the sudden my hair is getting dry and frizzled. This conditioner seems to be a good balance of leaving the hair nice, but not too slimed out, like some conditioners do.</li>
            <li> I have color treated, coarse, curly hair that tends to be on the dry side.  So I am always in a search of products that will give my hair some softness, shine and keep it less dry.  I don&#x27;t use a dryer on my hair so at least it&#x27;s got one thing going for it - no heat damage.  Anyway, my normal routine is to wash and condition every other day and to just condition on the days that I don&#x27;t wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this conditioner based on the reviews on this site.  I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner along with the same type shampoo for this week.  My first impression is that the products are pretty much okay for not stripping the hair and adding moisture.  I&#x27;m not finding my hair much different than the other products I have used.  What I really don&#x27;t like is the extreme perfume smell of the product.  The smell itself isn&#x27;t that bad but the intensity of it is crazy strong.  Even when the product is rinsed and the hair dry - I find if I touch my hair with my hand, my hand will take on the smell as well.  One and Only needs to definitely tone down the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and will report back if over a longer use, I have a different opinion.  Initial impression is just \\&quot;meh\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, chemically dyed- and therefore brittle- hair. At times it can feel downright crunchy. Oh how I loooove this product line!&lt;br /&gt;And with each part of the line I add, the better my hair feels. The conditioner combined with the leave-in oil is a terrific combo for smooth, non-frizzy hair. (Be sure to get regular trims to be rid of that old, dry stuff too.)</li>
            <li> This product is a must to keep my course, curly hair healthy and manageable. The only reason for four stars instead of five is that is not pure argan oil but having said that I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Decent conditioner to use for softer and easier hair. It helps with detangling as well but don&#x27;t see an improvements to hair besides the initial use. I wish I could rave about it but it didn&#x27;t really a lot to help my hair.</li>
            <li> Conditioner feels thick when coming out of bottle; you need a lot of it for one wash so you&#x27;ll go through this bottle rather quickly if you have thick hair or long hair.  Didn&#x27;t lather well, but that may be because it doesn&#x27;t have all those extra additives some conditioners have.  Didn&#x27;t care for the smell either.  My hair did not feel clean and was still frizzy.  Not happy with this product.  Instead, try Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion conditioner.  Costs around $5 or $6 at WalMart and works quite well.  My hair felt soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Does what is says but not what I was looking for. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> i like it.i bought it after reading review on the amazon. and i feel worth trying.will try again.smell is great.</li>
            <li> It was OK, but won&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li> I have used several other kinds of moroccan hair care products before I found this one. I used a sample of this product to begin with and loved it so much that I searched and searched to find it. I found it is much more affordable than most products I have used in the past and works wonderfully. It rinses out well, does&#x27;t leave a residue, and smells great without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to buy this product because I love the regular Moroccan (Argan) oil and also the styling cream. The reviews on this conditioner were great so I was looking forward to it. It was an okay conditioner but nothing special. The scent and the texture were nice but didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything wonderful for my hair which is thick and wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So although I didn&#x27;t dislike it and used up the bottle, I&#x27;m just not inspired to buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product has wonderful moisturizing properties and leaves hair clean and silky soft. The scent is refreshing and smells like a tropical fruit. Argan oil is very beneficial in adding moisture to skin an hair. For th price this product has great value.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve only used this once and so far so good.  Found a product in New Zealand that was made from the argan so wanted to keep using it.  However that product is not sold in the states so bought this one instead.  Seems okay but will take further use I think.</li>
            <li> not as good as I thought</li>
            <li> I purchased the matching shampoo at my local HEB when I ran out of EnJoy Luxury, so I decided to buy this on a lark.  The first time I used it, I was really surprised to notice that it was very thin - unlike the shampoo which is so thick it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle.  After a couple of uses, I noticed that my normally healthy hair felt very straw-like instead of soft and slippery after I rinsed.  I decided to keep using it, just in case the odd texture was due to the shift from EnJoy.  It didn&#x27;t get any better -  I started to get a lot more breakage and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this works for some people, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me except make my hair smell good but look dry and break off.</li>
            <li> I lovd the way this conditioner repaired my hair after even the first wash,it left my hair with moisture although nongreasy, the shine was also more noticeable after one wash.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells DIVINE! It&#x27;s also super smooth and makes hair nice and soft, especially hair that has been damaged! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t call it Moroccan Oil because that&#x27;s a trademark infraction.  But it&#x27;s the same tree and it&#x27;s in a great cream.  My dry hair behaves so well with this product.</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair consistently for about a week, and realized that it was overkill for my hair and made it sort of greasy, even if I rinsed REALLY WELL. That said, I took my usage back to about once a week and continued with my regular hair care, and the results held up the entire week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t used the product in quite some time, but I used it the other night and the next day my hair after styling looked fabulous! I was reminded how great my hair looks with additional moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product for anyone, regardless of hair type. You just have to find your own preference for regularity of use. As for a daily conditioning, I have very thick curly hair, and once a week does the trick for me (which is a bonus because the product lasts a LOT longer).</li>
            <li> as the shampoo this conditioner is like nothing..very bad product..love the mascara but shampoo and conditioner is a wais of money and time.....</li>
            <li> Use this conditioner along with the shampoo , and you will get a nice result . It soft edge my hair and gave it shine along with the treatment oil . It was a good buy</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fantastic and it&#x27;s mostly organic.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> not so good for my hair type i guess. hispanic. mixed hair.</li>
            <li> I use and love, three One-n-Only Argan Oil brand products.  The conditioner, shampoo, and hair cream.  The fragrance is lovely and none of the products create build-up and helps to keep color treated hair from fading.  Also leaves hair healthy, soft and free for split ends.</li>
