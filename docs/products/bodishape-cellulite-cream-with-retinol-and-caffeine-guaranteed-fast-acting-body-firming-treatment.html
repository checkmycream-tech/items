            <li>Love this amazing body cream!!  </li>
            <li>We need your feedback when we launch a new product to ensure we are delivering the best products that you want with excellent service.</li>
            <li>..keep up the good work</li>
            <li>I had read online that drinking a good amount of water and exfoliating the problem area in addition to the cream would improve the results.</li>
            <li>and he loved the way my skin looked and felt.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;write a good review&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good skin improvement product.</li>
            <li>and so I was delighted when one of my friends put a package together from Bodishape for my birthday.</li>
            <li>I had to find a good product for myself.</li>
            <li>I found Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, and I am very happy with the fabulous results.</li>
            <li>the packaging is good.  </li>
            <li>and I was looking for a good product.</li>
            <li>Still on the hunt for a good product.</li>
            <li>WORKING GOOD.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to research, I read the reviews, and chose Bodishape because it got some good reviews and the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells good, and it feels like it&#x27;s doing &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; - but spendy stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>And worked good on my butt and thighs.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been good use</li>
            <li>and it is in good packaging condition.</li>
            <li>I waited for over a month to do this review, so that it would be a fair review.</li>
            <li>It looks really good.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>Good.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as reviews states...</li>
            <li>I have always loved swimming.</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is good</li>
            <li>Stick with it, and with patience there is a good chance you will begin to see results.</li>
            <li>Also, anytime you massage your legs it is good for cellulite, circulation and exfoliation</li>
            <li>I did not find this was a good product.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t smell good either.</li>
            <li>I Had good results and placed another order.</li>
            <li>Cellulite creme did not do me any good .</li>
            <li>I had many years trying to find good cellulite reduction cream for my body, after using BODY SHAPE cellulite reduction cream now I can judge it helps me to get slim appearance again!</li>
            <li>If I could excericse, I am sure the combo would be perfect and I would be cellulite free!</li>
            <li>It had a nice smell and went on the skin very easily without feeling greasy!</li>
            <li>This is a great product if it worked for me it sure will work for every person who uses it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with how this cream works.</li>
            <li>They are a great company and their customer service was outstanding.</li>
            <li>girlfriend looks great and we both love it.</li>
            <li>Really love this product works great</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any kind of change..</li>
            <li>The scent reminds me of rose petals or something floral.  </li>
            <li>When I used it I got some nice results.</li>
            <li>so I wasn’t worried about it not being effective.</li>
            <li>Effective and priced competitively.  </li>
            <li>While the massager on it&#x27;s own is heavenly, adding this cream to it</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used sooooo many creams and this one by far is the best one!</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY cellulite products and this by far is the greatest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar and I see some great results.  </li>
            <li>When you are confident enough that you look good, you feel good and you are sure to mark a good impression.</li>
            <li>And maintaining a healthy diet and a god work out is very important.</li>
            <li>Tried because of all the great reviews - how can so many people give it a positive review - it must work...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Mostly using it on my arms and have seen a difference already.</li>
            <li>It helps to firmed up my arms by more than 1 inch after a weeks I using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got the opportunity to receive this product in exchange for my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love this product. ...</li>
            <li>You must use the product continuously and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it takes time</li>
            <li>There appears to be better products out there at a better price according to the reviews.</li>
            <li>I started exercising more, but it didn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>I had to disregard my favorite beach wear, but not anymore.</li>
            <li>more than anything.</li>
            <li>By the way the company called me and offered a 50% discount if I wrote a review which I thought it was ok since they did not say</li>
            <li>With that said I will be trying another bottle and hope that this time I see better results.</li>
            <li>I admit most of us desire to look our best for various reasons.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now when I&#x27;ve conquered my problem, I feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>I just love this product for what it does.</li>
            <li>my skin looks much better than before.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not so sure about</li>
            <li>I had many cellulite patches and these were growing day by day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>if I used it twice a day it might work better.</li>
            <li>Her cellulite patches are looking better and she said she will be buy another jar because she is convinced that it&#x27;s going to keep on improving with more application.</li>
            <li>i love that part...</li>
            <li>I know there are many skeptics out there</li>
            <li>but the best part is that it comes with a 100% money back guarantee, so</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this product from BodiShape.</li>
            <li>I began to exercise more, and eating healthier, but it would not go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product will buy again</li>
            <li>I have been considering liposuction because I have tried many creams over the years</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 43) but thought I&#x27;d give it one more</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this great product.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I look and feel so much better than I could have imagined</li>
            <li>Truly a lovely product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great cellulite cream that I love to pamper myself</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I exercise and eat somewhat healthy and that helps.</li>
            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>Has to order some more.</li>
            <li>meet my expectations and more would buy again</li>
            <li>I love this product and the way it is working.</li>
            <li>It works ok, but I lost about 15 lbs.</li>
            <li>and that helped better than any cellulite cream I have ever used.....</li>
            <li>Planning on buying one more jar to see if I get any more improvements.</li>
            <li>With the help of Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, I&#x27;ve been able to reduce those cellulite patches.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s more cost-effective and perhaps safer than plastic surgery.</li>
            <li>Now, I wear shorts and am much more confident.     </li>
            <li>I tried many things.</li>
            <li>and I was able to see the difference.</li>
            <li>Another product like many of the others out there.</li>
            <li>not so sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this product from BodiShape.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be glad</li>
            <li>u will love it</li>
            <li>and  that makes me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for better skin.</li>
            <li>I already do most of the things that are recommended in the literature that came with the cream (drink lots of water with lemon, avoid processed foods, try to keep your body pH alkaline, restrict salt, exfoliate in the shower)</li>
            <li>I limit my sodium, and I have been so diligent in making sure</li>
            <li>I was a bit overweight for many years.</li>
            <li>Product worked as described, wife have brought more then one unit without any problems.</li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>I have already noticed were my love handles</li>
            <li>Now, I am much more confident about myself.</li>
            <li>I just love this product for what it does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can feel the Retinol working more and more as it dries which gives a tightening sensation.</li>
            <li>just became even more motivated from there.</li>
            <li>drinking water combined with eating fruits and vegetables that contain more water (ex: melons, celery, leafy greens...</li>
            <li>Aside from one pesky dimple that just won&#x27;t quit, most of the cellulite has diminished dramatically and my skin continues to improve.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my thighs but have started to use it on my tummy as well as I have noticed a difference on my thighs and have faith that it will work on my tummy as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the cream for about a month,my skin looks firmer and the cellulite aspect it&#x27;s reduced:)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see more results.</li>
            <li>Unlike many firming agents I have tried, this cream smells lovely and rubs into your skin.</li>
            <li>and I feel much more confident wearing shorts and dresses.</li>
            <li>I follow all the instructions, i.e, drink lots of water, try to eat healthy, use twice a day, etc  </li>
            <li>I am on my 4th jar and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I did combine healthy eating, exercises and the cream.</li>
            <li>Better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s temporary, but hey if it makes you feel more confident, why not?  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I can get rid most of my cellulite in 2 bottles and my skin is tighther.</li>
            <li>I reordered and I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>It is a daily commitment for best results.</li>
            <li>My skin is def looking better already.  </li>
            <li>There are much much better products in the market.</li>
            <li>This cream promises to \\&quot;get rid of cellulite\\&quot; in the title of this product page, but does not promise anything more than firming and reducing the appearance of cellulite on the jar itself.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Bioderm slimming/cellulite products work better.</li>
            <li>Now I am glad to be able to wear my swimsuits again.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I&#x27;ve many cellulite patches on my thighs and abdomen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an interesting thing to think about, a cream being able to reduce cellulite</li>
            <li>It makes me feel more</li>
            <li>the more I use it the better it getting....</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see any noticeable differences after using this product for more than two weeks</li>
            <li>Love it and will buy again</li>
            <li>I bought the cellulite brush as well to hopefully get better results &amp; nothing.  </li>
            <li>must say I am 65 and have not had my weight vary more than 12 pounds since I was in my twenties</li>
            <li>Also it smells ok for a body shaping cream, Also</li>
            <li>this is the best for cellulite, but of course needs to be reapplied daily.</li>
            <li>It is working better than those over the counter anti-cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>The very next day I was changing clothes and remembered I had tried the cream and ran to the bathroom with the good lightning and TA DA!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>but thats ok because this cream is not for stretch marks</li>
            <li>Nuelle Cellulite Cream is much better.</li>
            <li>I try many products for review on my blog.</li>
            <li>It is a very nicely textured cream and rubs in very well.</li>
            <li>First time buying with seller!!!</li>
            <li>Feels nice on skin but did not see any significant results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s becoming better and better day by day.</li>
            <li>This cream is light and very easy to use, there is no offensive scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Her results were pretty good.  </li>
            <li>But I do have cellulite, and a pretty fair amount of it.</li>
            <li>I have done these things with and without this cream, and there is a significant improvement when I use the cream!</li>
            <li>like the cream itself - it goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The cream rubs in nicely and absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t mind paying more for a good product, however in that case I really feel like I lost my money</li>
            <li>It also smells great and makes the skin feel soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>and although it&#x27;s not gone completely I&#x27;m happy with my results so far.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my wife who has reached her middle ages incredibly gracefully, but is struggling with keeping her legs toned no matter what she does.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get this free through a promo, but I will be recommending this cream to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>I have to say it works great so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using this incredible cream nightly for the last three weeks and my cellulite is disappearing.</li>
            <li>My skin became more supple and smooth</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a complimentary sample of BodiShape Cellulite Reduction cream in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Now, I can look in the mirror and feel as good as I look thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>Works great and easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps skin soft and smells very nice.</li>
            <li>The instructions for usage were not the best, but I used it the way other&#x27;s on the reviews said they used it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am now using Nerium and have noticed a difference that is much more significant.</li>
            <li>The jar arrived, the shrink wrap was easy to tear off</li>
            <li>After much of a tussle I found this product which turned out to be the best skin firming product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I recommend this cream easily and plan to continue to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the smell is not offensive.</li>
            <li>It has a really strong smell.  </li>
            <li>My skin is now becoming smooth and even.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the cream on its own, I started to notice a difference within the first 7 days which was a bit unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>of luck on your own journey ; )&lt;br /&gt;-Andy</li>
            <li>Plus I really liked the way it smelled, it smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Goes on very easily and smoothly, and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best one I have purchased thus far!!  </li>
            <li>It just worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>I liked this cream I feel like it had some positive smoothing effects.</li>
            <li>I could be imagining it, but it seems to really make my legs look better!</li>
            <li>It really works if you are exercising, and eating healthy!</li>
            <li>I really must say, this is magic in a jar!  </li>
            <li>so much, to the magic man/woman who made this stuff!</li>
            <li>The massagers are easy to clean and are easy to hold on to when you are using them.  </li>
            <li>certainly would not expect to buy a cream and slap it on my legs and think it&#x27;ll work on its own on stubborn cellulite.</li>
            <li>The cellulite is still there, but reduced to the point of feeling confident about my legs for the first time in forever! ....</li>
            <li>Have seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>At the 6 week mark it was a huge difference to</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This cream made me break out in a huge rash</li>
            <li>it took a huge toll on my skin.</li>
            <li>Received this free for a review, I have been using this for about a week and unless my eyes are deceiving me this is working.  </li>
            <li>It is also lightly scented which I prefer as I do not like creams or lotions that try to compete with my perfume.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to a cellulite free summer body.</li>
            <li>I feel great about this product and would recommend to everyone who needs such a product for their skin.</li>
            <li>If it works for me it must do a great job for younger persons.</li>
            <li>In around 1 month I&#x27;ve found a flawless and firm skin.</li>
            <li>My skin became smooth and brighter in no time.</li>
            <li>so if you enjoy that then you will like it.</li>
            <li>FEEL MY SKIN SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS  FREE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li>I wanted a smooth and shiny skin</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and feels luxurious.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to be nice smelling and very creamy when I put it on.</li>
            <li>It not only works but the smell is great.</li>
            <li>The smooth cream blends into the skin well, with Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the light minty scent.</li>
            <li>texture of the cream itself is smooth.</li>
            <li>&quot; The body brush works to smooth out the fat cells.</li>
            <li>on smooth, not sticky at all&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve achieved even and smooth legs.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve smooth and glowing skin.</li>
            <li>wrote a review about another cellulite cream in which I also referred to the cream that is no longer available (Shessentials).  </li>
            <li>doesnt dissolve my blubber however does smooth ripples, dimples etc</li>
            <li>Maybe with advanced cellulite you have to use it longer to get results</li>
            <li>Great - stuff actually works</li>
            <li>I have battled this problem with exercise to no avail, so I am happy that Bodishape is finally helping!</li>
            <li>Bodishape helped to smooth out the cellulite in my thighs.</li>
            <li>But so far so good.</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and in good shape for my age.</li>
            <li>have so far had great success with the cream, and have seen a difference.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this awesome product is that it smells terrific and very high end - herbal and fresh, kind of like an Aveda product.</li>
            <li>It leaves you feeling firmer right after which I love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a right away confidence boost :-)</li>
            <li>Okay, moving right along.</li>
            <li>BUT if your patient and consistent you WILL see results!!</li>
            <li>so cellulite has appeared goes on very nicely if you follow the instructions and rub it in the way the directions explain you can actually feel it working.  </li>
            <li>scent of this cream is fantastic and the texture rich.  </li>
            <li>cream has a unique composition of ingredients and the reason it works is because those ingredients are very powerful by themselves and when put together, are even stronger.</li>
            <li>and she sent me another cream FREE right away!</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that I enjoy and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I just tried this product for the first time and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it four stars since the seller stayed true to the promise so we can try it risk free like advertised and</li>
            <li>product DOES NOT work by itself as I originally thought, oh well......</li>
            <li>Im excited to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>Results work better if you continue to hydrate your skin and do not take hot showers.</li>
            <li>so I was quite excited to try it.</li>
            <li>give this product three stars instead of one because it is a good moisturizer and general skin conditioner.</li>
            <li>(I love that the first ingredient is \\&quot;aqua (deionized water).\\</li>
            <li>give this product three stars instead of one because it is a good moisturizer and general skin conditioner.</li>
            <li>(I love that the first ingredient is \\&quot;aqua (deionized water).\\</li>
            <li>did not see a significant result as reviewers stated.</li>
            <li>try it promise you each on of you going to love it ;)</li>
            <li>I saw the reviews of this product are very good, then I decided to try last time, and this time, I really did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to try this cream please do some kind of aerobic exercise and eat properly, and if you don&#x27;t see results maybe you will need to use more than one jar to see results like me.</li>
            <li>so that is what I&#x27;m doing (no wonder there is so many, but as I said they not asking for a positive review I guess they just want to sort of survey results</li>
            <li>After reading all the overwhelming positive reviews on Bodishape&#x27;s Cellulite Cream I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>and my legs looked nice and toned and the cellulite was completely gone!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the full results after another month.</li>
            <li>I received the product very quickly and began using it right away morning and night.</li>
            <li>This cream is good for refreshing other than that didn&#x27;t do anything I bought two</li>
            <li>pleasant light scent, takes a while to absorb but it really surprised me how much it helps.  </li>
            <li>I am not claiming that it is a “miracle cream,” but it has most certainly done the trick for me.  </li>
            <li>Used it before and while going to the beach with a special massage brush.  </li>
            <li>my body has changed in the appearance the most thing that I ve seen over the last 4 weeks is the fine patches on my legs start to improve and my skin is more silky to the touch.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect treatment after a hard work out at the gym and one that makes me feel</li>
            <li>and they were great with getting back to me and stated that this was a first.  </li>
            <li>A cool smoothness once areas are massaged</li>
            <li>I am very well pleased with both the massage kit and the cream.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t not see a different  the same.not good</li>
            <li>Gives a soothing cool sense</li>
            <li>And true, I tried it and it did wonders.</li>
            <li>And I honestly was so surprised.</li>
            <li>i love this cream!....shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Ok ladies and gents this cream really works.  </li>
            <li>However, I began to realize that I needed a bit more help to really get the results I desired.</li>
            <li>Bodishape has been that “bit more help” that I have needed to really shape this area.</li>
            <li>so hopefully my legs will be shorts ready for the summer :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suprisingly, I received an unexpected e-mail from Bodishape asking me how I liked the product.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;to be true.</li>
            <li>Have used for about a month, just ordered another bottle so I can try for a full 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaging appears safe.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to order more of this product.</li>
            <li>It smells like medicine, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>but since I am fortunate enough to be trying this product for free and am seeing results within 1 week, the smell is nothing!!</li>
            <li>On the other hand, smells great</li>
            <li>I honestly did not notice any results but the cream does have a smoothing effect that makes your skin look and feel nice and firm</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries well &amp; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>oh the cream runs out quickly...</li>
            <li>Everyone wants firm, flawless and glowing skin.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found a brand that will be able to help me with my cellulite in the future.</li>
            <li>It definitely isn&#x27;t a quick miracle cream, but combined with exercise and changes to my diet</li>
            <li>I make this a part of my daily routine to feel and look better, and to make sure I take care of myself in a way I deserve.  </li>
            <li>and it is super sticky.</li>
            <li>Runs out quickly.  </li>
            <li>I definitely feel more confident wearing shorts and swimsuits than I have in years!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It have reduce my cellulite tremendously..</li>
            <li>Another product i enjoyed using from JDT International , I have tried a couple item from them and really enjoyed them all</li>
            <li>and I like the mild fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My guess is that it works for people with mild cellulite issues</li>
            <li>you have a mild cellulite problem, I would suggest that you give this a try, but if you have a lot of cellulite</li>
            <li>I searched on net and found Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Creamwhich is very popular and comes in reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The first is that I thought it could replace a cream that is no longer available through</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a fresh sent not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good as long as you follow instructions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to save my money for a new pair of running shoes:)</li>
            <li>My new favorite beauty treatment.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the company seems like they are genuinely interested in you being satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and work for me very well.</li>
            <li>The company is also very professional and concerned that you enjoyed and saw results.</li>
            <li>Recieved these for free in return for a positive feedback.  </li>
            <li>I wore a bathing suit WITHOUT a wrap for the first time in years!  </li>
            <li>Rubs in really well too!!</li>
            <li>This product really does work!!</li>
            <li>I have seen a difference and have been pleased with the product so far!</li>
            <li>Great product, I have seen results in as little as one week.  </li>
            <li>Amazing results after a short time!</li>
            <li>I say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I explored when I faced cellulite dimples and found this product worth.</li>
            <li>I have even used it on my stomach although with not as much success on my thighs.</li>
            <li>I am no longer young and &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34;, but I wasn&#x27;t sure quite what to expect from this product.  </li>
            <li>I cannot swear that the cellulite has improved, but my skin is much more supple and soft.  </li>
            <li>This is worth using.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not only the warm weather season when this issue bother us all...</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It is creamy and fragrant and absorbed immediately.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how they did it, and I&#x27;m big on researching ingredients</li>
            <li>This product is really worth.</li>
            <li>Worth every $</li>
            <li>I asked my dermatologist if any anti-cellulite creams were worth investing in.</li>
            <li>, this is a nice extra bit of improvement.</li>
            <li>&amp; it keeps it fresh longer.  </li>
            <li>absorbed.  </li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>This went on for almost a year when I finally got some nice results after using Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s absolutely worth it for the results you can get.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it if it does what it</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I saw a reduction in cellulite especially in my stomach-</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it for many days yet, but so far, it seems to have some effect.</li>
            <li>As with many cellulite reduction creams, this one contains caffeine, but also vitamin A, vitamin E, and a bunch of other ingredients, many from plants.</li>
            <li>As with many cellulite reduction creams, this one contains caffeine, but also vitamin A, vitamin E, and a bunch of other ingredients, many from plants.</li>
            <li>Ran out of it pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I have to admit that it&#x27;s really  good at warming things up because I really feel extra hot on the areas I put it on during my work out.</li>
            <li>customer&lt;br /&gt;service was really helpful and friendly.</li>
            <li>Is it in the right amounts?...</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>it was right on time for my trip to Vegas.</li>
            <li>I intentionally did not touch my right side with the cream (or any creams or lotions, for that matter)</li>
            <li>Let’s just get that out of the way right away.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews comes from the company paying off people to help sell this stuff!   </li>
            <li>I personally thought it was kind of pretty and sleek compared to the eye sore squeeze bottles, so that was a bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When before it did not really bother me, I feel I have a new perspective in life where I want to try to keep my body as great as it can be.</li>
            <li>I really had to wait awhile for it to dry good.  </li>
            <li>The cream leaves my skin feeling silk like and absorbs nice and quickly unlike other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>Free Pre-release New Products to Trial and Review</li>
            <li>The cream is absorbed completely in the skin and makes it smooth.</li>
            <li>and I would prefer a pump instead because I used way too much too quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waited until I used this cream for several months to write a product review so that I could really give it time to see if it lived up to the hype and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>I can feel the areas more firm and better looking.</li>
            <li>It also made my skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The texture of the product goes on smoothly and use as direct and it will work!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product twice because it seems to evaporate in the jar very fast.</li>
            <li>I like this very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast Delivery”</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, the results: My left side doesn&#x27;t look any better than my right side, although the skin on the left is decidedly softer and more supple.</li>
            <li>The product does have a scent that is on the strong side, so I don&#x27;t think putting it on right before bed every night is terribly appealing, I tend to put it on a few hours before</li>
            <li>The dimpling isn&#x27;t gone, but it really has improved!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky at all, it absorbed really well into my skin.</li>
            <li>It seems more noticeable when I put on an extra pound or two.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream and although I was sceptical at first, it really did the trick!</li>
            <li>A couple more days later</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>She was aware that I am trying to deal with cellulite patches but not found a solution yet.</li>
            <li>It was the first thing I noticed when I opened</li>
            <li>I put it on every night before going to sleep, making sure it was all over the upper thighs and bum, then shower in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I could really use some short-shorts weather now!</li>
            <li>I love to be in shape and have a younger skin.</li>
            <li>Thankfully my friend made me aware about Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream.</li>
            <li>and I will stick to the regime applying it daily after the shower with hopes of even better results.</li>
            <li>especially that I had the chance to use cheaper creams that were more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I workout regularly and it was getting better with the exercise but wanted to try this, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li>Absorbs completely with light scent.</li>
            <li>A big plus is that it is Paraben Free!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been interested ever since.</li>
            <li>Sure, Dr. Oz recommends the ingredients (not this product) but does this actually have any of the ingredients?</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any product to try to get rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li>only diet and exersize solve this problem, I should know better.  </li>
            <li>Says a money back guarantee but more of a hassle to return it than to keep it.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>The fat in the area was starting to disappear, I was so glad that my friend recommended me this.</li>
            <li>Well, let me be the first to say that THIS has helped my cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I have for sure noticed a difference,  in the belly area, the skin is definitely tighter and the cellulite has faded a bit, I would purchase again</li>
            <li>During a sport meet, one of my friends made me aware about my thigh dimples which I was ignoring otherwise.</li>
            <li>I was willing to give this cream a try because I&#x27;ve never tried a cellulite cream before.</li>
            <li>were my first impressions...</li>
            <li>like I did after the first two weeks, you should still see results.</li>
            <li>This product also comes with a 100% Money Back Guarantee if you aren’t satisfied.</li>
            <li>Just paid $20 for this and now it&#x27;s more than double the price.</li>
            <li>I used it for a month and followed the instructions exactly without any results at all.</li>
            <li>I used it all over my body at first.</li>
            <li>This definitely helps even more.</li>
            <li>Product actually works better than I thought.</li>
            <li>Within the first 7 days, I began to see results.</li>
            <li>No only does it have the cellulite reducing properties, but I love the skin firming effect it has for those areas that didn&#x27;t rebound as well after pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t convinced and my supply ran out.  </li>
            <li>We are on to trying something else now with higher hopes.  </li>
            <li>me first say this-</li>
            <li>you have to be willing to put in some effort.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Did absolutely NOTHING after a months worth of use.</li>
            <li>but since after 30 days I didn&#x27;t see a difference in cellulite, I wasn&#x27;t willing to continue to invest in the product.</li>
            <li>First I did the leg brushing, and then applied.</li>
            <li>First, this is not a miracle cream.</li>
            <li>i contacted the seller and said the product I got looked like it was missing a good inch from when I opened</li>
            <li>energetic, vibrant and even a little more sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another positive, my skin actually feels better after using this product.  </li>
            <li>My cellulite isn&#x27;t completely gone, but I do love what I see so far!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t possibly drink that much water, but I&#x27;ve definitely been more mindful and am drinking more water than I ever have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products by Bodishape and they&#x27;ve all been amazing</li>
            <li>Maybe my only problem was the poor circulation associated with Cellulite, but was super impressed..</li>
            <li>Naturally everyone is different and you have to be your own judge.</li>
            <li>I am finally booty-licious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been so dedicated to my Gym workout - keeping a healthy organic, whole foods diet.  </li>
            <li>I am very hopeful with second jar to see even more results.</li>
            <li>Naturally everyone is different and you have to be your own judge.</li>
            <li>Ive been using it for a week with the special MIT, so far I haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li>set off to try the cream earnestly, but I have to say, that my sensitive skin rebelled pretty quickly with this cream.</li>
            <li>but I wish I had because I do think I saw positive results.</li>
            <li>I did notice some positive changes while using the product.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try something to tighten up those saggy areas on my legs and under arms and decided to try this because of all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who is looking to positively impact their cellulite.</li>
            <li>I used to love my shorts and they used to suit my long legs too.</li>
            <li>The smell of it could be a little better, it&#x27;s not horrible, but could be a little better</li>
            <li>If the jar would of lasted a month I would be able to see the long term effect.</li>
            <li>but it made such a big difference that she is confident it will be completely smooth by the time the jar runs out.</li>
            <li>I also am an avid athlete and eat very well.</li>
            <li>&quot; It has a light, barely detectable scent.</li>
            <li>&quot; It has a light, barely detectable scent.</li>
            <li>Not sure where the good ratings are coming from.  </li>
            <li>after using a full jar of this cream, which wasn&#x27;t even completely full...I saw ZERO results.</li>
            <li>I only wish it had a lighter smell, but that could easily be my sensitivity.</li>
            <li>first thing that I noticed about the cream is that it has a wonderfully light scent; big shocker that I picked up on the scent!</li>
            <li>Even though, I missed a large number of workouts, I made it a priority to take my Cellulite supplement.</li>
            <li>I will not say that this cream will give you baby like skin again, let us face it, pass a certain age and that thought is history.</li>
            <li>Even though I have skin sensitivities to certain beauty products, I had no adverse reactions.</li>
            <li>I certainly saw a difference in my thighs</li>
            <li>I will not say that this cream will give you baby like skin again, let us face it, pass a certain age and that thought is history.</li>
            <li>In no time at all I could really see and feel the positive results of this product.</li>
            <li>They kind of look like a stocking filled with dried beans and I refuse to wear sleeves during a hot southern summer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been always very conscious about my inner health and outer appearance and I&#x27;ve always preferred healthy foods.</li>
            <li>A brand in a supermarket would probably work better, cost less, last longer, and get better results.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a runner and in pretty decent shape.</li>
            <li>Didnt really see any results..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any difference..</li>
            <li>It has helped but not as much as I hoped</li>
            <li>This worked very well</li>
            <li>I ordered this and coming really fast.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and after you  apply it you feel a cooling sensation that makes you think its really working.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work, but it did not.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>After much of a struggle I found this product which gave me satisfactory results.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, my sheets and clothing weren’t stained at all.  </li>
            <li>Appearance of those patches is much reduced now and my skin looks toned up.</li>
            <li>Seeing these marks, I was very worried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great cream, comes in a very convenient size.</li>
            <li>I used the product three weeks straight and did not notice any difference at all.</li>
            <li>THE BODISHAPE CELLULITE CREAM REALLY WORKING FOR ME.  </li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>hope the discount is offered real</li>
            <li>I would like to think that things are smoothing out, but it&#x27;s too soon to really tell.  </li>
            <li>made it that much</li>
            <li>Being very skinny and a distance runner, I could never understand why I still had cellulite on my legs.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to get results from this product</li>
            <li>I do not have much cellulite , but wanted to just  work on what I have.</li>
            <li>Really silky lotion</li>
            <li>It was very upsetting when I realized I was developing cellulite patches.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much body fat per se.</li>
            <li>Would like to have additional information regarding how much to use with each application</li>
            <li>Cellulite Creme provided for free by JDT International.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not seen any results and I&#x27;m very discouraged by this.</li>
            <li>and it really helped me have tighter skin.</li>
            <li>Results are immediate, soft, fresh minty scent.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely did nothing for my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see much of a change.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much change in my cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really worked.</li>
            <li>I used the whole thing as directed and didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li>the heat from the shower hydrates your skin which assists it in absorbing the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have a 100% satisfaction policy so you really have noting to lose, but theres a lot to gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really seems to work</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I also transferred the cream into an airless pump bottle (that I purchased at Sephora in a set), so I can control how much I apply (2 pumps each leg)</li>
            <li>No visible difference and very sticky, can&#x27;t wear anything for hours after putting it on.</li>
            <li>Real wasting of money.</li>
            <li>It really boosts up my confidence when I wear clothes which I really want.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work like I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you try!</li>
            <li>Bottle goes fast.</li>
            <li>Was very hopeful, but didn&#x27;t seem to work.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And my skin is much smoother than before.  </li>
            <li>I really feel grateful for this product</li>
            <li>I had 3 weeks to get ready for a vacation-</li>
            <li>And much easier than adding another run to my week that may not even make a difference</li>
            <li>This company really should be ashamed of themselves for ripping off their customers.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to decrease cellulite and have firmer skin in problem areas.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>but cellulite is still very visible.</li>
            <li>I might as well go get a procedure since it goes so fast.</li>
            <li>It really works....</li>
            <li>Was really hoping this would work.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t real faithful about putting it on twice a day (I just forgot some days).  </li>
            <li>One thing I did not like too much about it, though, is that it feels sticky on the skin.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I used the whole container and saw no difference what so ever.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even try it before the shower, which is really supposed to help.</li>
            <li>Used the whole jar and saw no noticeable difference</li>
            <li>I did not expect the cream to work fast or even at all, I was a hopeful skeptic.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>Hmmm … I don’t really want catwalk legs … too skinny for me.</li>
            <li>, what you really want to know is have I noticed a change to my cellulite?</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering from you all some more in the near future.</li>
            <li>After having 2 kids, I wanted to reduce the appearance of my stretch marks as much as possible, and this product was the only product that proved effective in minimizing them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try a different cream that is more natural that Dr Oz recommended.</li>
            <li>seller is also great they really stands behind their product.</li>
            <li>Okay so the product was not so easy to rub in, its a thick gel like but looks like a normal cream.  </li>
            <li>Here are the tips if anyone purchases Bodishape, so you can implement them right away:  1) use a natural body brush to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; the cellulite.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered this product based on other reviews of noticing good results.</li>
            <li>Had a decent fragrance, went on smoothly, but I saw no difference, even after using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li>pure white color, cool scent.</li>
            <li>This is a fact that most of us, at some time or the other face body changes.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t any better than other products you can find for $29.95.</li>
            <li>I still have the same amount of cellulite on my thighs and butt that I originally had before I started using this cream.</li>
            <li>I am active, exercising most days by either walking, doing a treadmill workout, or playing tennis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried, different creams and lotions with few successful results.</li>
            <li>Was greatly overpriced for the size and for what it pretty much failed to do.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone who wants to get rid of their cellulite.</li>
            <li>&quot; For a very short time you have the opportunity to test and review our new Bodishape branded products for FREE in pre market release.</li>
            <li>$40 is pretty steep for soft skin that a $3 bottle of lotion could do.</li>
            <li>I felt embarrassed but as a true friend she also suggested a possible solution.</li>
            <li>My legs and thighs are tight and it absolutely feels better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than the other stuff, where you&#x27;re supposed to use saran wrap and a heating pad (WHAT?!?).</li>
            <li>The jar is solid so it does not let light through, and it has a double lid to keep the air tight seal when you close it, which are both important for a product containing Retinol (avoid light exposure and minimize oxidation).</li>
            <li>It came in a great packaging and actually showed up earlier than expected!</li>
            <li>Eat less processed foods and more alkaline produce too&lt;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but It can be a bit sticky, so less works better.  </li>
            <li>After applying the cream at morning and at night every day for an entire month, the appearance of cellulite lines have weakened tremendously.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work as well as it claims, the jar should come in auch larger container to give consumer more time to use for possible results</li>
            <li>and I will order some more prior to my next show.</li>
            <li>I also did not see any results, but to be fair, I did only use it a few days...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for almost a month now, and have decent results.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the cream.</li>
            <li>I have seen why it is so highly valued</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream, it works.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My diet is high in lean protein and vegetables.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a magic cream that will completely get rid of cellulite put your wallet away now, don&#x27;t buy this or any other product.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin is a little more perky after using this on my cellulite areas.</li>
            <li>I used as directed and sometimes a little more to see if that would help, but I got nothing.</li>
            <li>I felt I have a little sagging  skin on my belly, after loosing 15 pounds, now it got better.</li>
            <li>Other creams have a strong odor, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The ONLY benefit from this cream is that it makes your skin super soft, that it all!  </li>
            <li>So as soon as I saw it on my door step Sunday afternoon, I showered and that evening I tried a little bit (not measured teaspon but eyeballed teaspoon) and rubbed up and down vigorously lol.  </li>
            <li>but I was truly surprised to see results and results that fast.  </li>
            <li>After only about a week of applications as the container states, I did notice my cellulite was pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>There has been no negative side effects as of yet.</li>
            <li>I need to used it a few more times before giving it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels more firm.</li>
            <li>As days went by without applying I noticed my skin was not as firm and more dimply.  </li>
            <li>I started feeling my skin tightening and looking better within a few days of use</li>
            <li>I seriously cannot rave about this product any more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, my profile: I have a normal BMI, right in the middle of the range for my height.</li>
            <li>As many people said, it does not last very long.</li>
            <li>It comes on smoothly yet it takes a while to dry completely.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s, and started seeing the first signs of cellulite on my upper thighs despite being physically active and eating relatively healthy.  </li>
            <li>picture is before (on the left) and after (on the right).  </li>
            <li>It does have a strange smell but that disappears quickly so it isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The patches are gone and new patches are also not formulated as my skin remains hydrated and toned up.</li>
            <li>Every time I leave the house, a new compliment comes my way.</li>
            <li>In couple of weeks I found a new me.</li>
            <li>The cream had an odd smell but that was easy to get over. .</li>
            <li>I am not heavy set but have put on some weight as I have gotten older</li>
            <li>I have a small bit of cellulite on the backs of my thighs, and no amount of healthy eating, maintaining a normal weight, or exercising seems to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>wish this had worked for me, because you are a great company that obviously stands behind your products.&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li>It also made my skin very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>it worked very fast, i dont have a big cellulite problem though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very sensitive to products so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not creasy, makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mildly scented as compared to those other \\&quot;promising\\&quot; creams which are heavily perfumed and ends up giving you a headache more than anything else.</li>
            <li>So far I have lost 70lbs, and I intend to keep going!</li>
            <li>After my first child birth, I discovered these cellulite on my upper leg.</li>
            <li>Well around the 4 week mark I saw a difference - even my daughter said WOW it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I always take a hot shower and apricot scrub the areas I plan on applying this cream too, to help open the pores.</li>
            <li>Is the first product that has ever work for me I totally recomended.</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews</li>
            <li>I work out consistently doing cardio and resistance training and my problem area is the back of my thighs..</li>
            <li>At first no results.. then i kept using it wanting to give it a chance,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it for about two weeks</li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t work, the seller gave me a full refund as promised (without return shipping the empty jar).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thin and in great shape, but of &amp;#34;that certain age&amp;#34; where my upper arms under sides and arm pit area (front and back) have cellulite.</li>
            <li>There are no positive changes due to my own actions.  </li>
            <li>Even when I was a skinny teenager and young adult, I had cellulite on my thighs and buttocks, and it&#x27;s only gotten more unsightly as I&#x27;ve aged.</li>
            <li>For couple of months, due to extra work pressure in my assignments I overlooked these habits and noticed that I&#x27;ve developed many cellulite patches on my body.</li>
            <li>Received the product and it came half filled.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive two jars as a gift from my sister and two that I had previously purchased.  </li>
            <li>After the cream settled for the night I was pissed the next day that there was only like 1/2 a jar full, and that&#x27;s probably too generous.  </li>
            <li>Potent is right, because this cream helped my wife get rid of the slight cellulite on her legs in less than a month.</li>
            <li>I certainly look forward to the 25% Discount which will definitely be an incentive to reorder;so,</li>
            <li>I am just a 50- year old career mother of two young adult daughters wanting to take care of what was given to me.</li>
            <li>I am very self conscious of my body and when I saw that I had cellulites on the upper bottom part of my thighs, I rushed to a computer to figure out how to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>The effects go away when you stop the cream--which is clear when you read the body shape product description</li>
            <li>oh and the advertisement clearly states it contains Retinol but</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t really care for is the scent.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>and I must say that the bottle is really tiny and finishes really fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you so far I am liking this product.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;(IF you are highly sensitive to scents as I am, then use this cream on your legs/torso/arms but not on your face).&lt;br /&gt;Had the scent been just a wee bit softer</li>
            <li>With time, I developed cellulite patches on my thighs.</li>
            <li>Now I enjoy a much firm and even looking skin.</li>
            <li>I feel young.</li>
            <li>When I used Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, I got even, smooth and firm skin.</li>
            <li>I have had cellulite on my thighs and buttocks since I was 12 years old.  </li>
            <li>If you are using it on your legs it does not go far.  </li>
            <li>Plus I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Smells good...made my skin soft</li>
            <li>I chose to give this porduct a 5 star rating because I had a considerable amount of cellulite and was training for a show in which I would wear a bikini on stage.  </li>
            <li>I am not a skin professional, doctor or Bodishape employee.</li>
            <li>I bought a pedicure brush that has the natural bristles.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it nearly every day, and I do see a difference in the appearance of dimples on my outer thigh area.</li>
            <li>While she definitely thinks that she&#x27;s noticing some loss of the fat around her legs, it&#x27;s probably too soon to really tell</li>
            <li>The semi-liquid cream has a light chemical odor which dissipates after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Saw far it seems to work.</li>
            <li>It’s a common desire to have healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Stretch mark nearly visible.</li>
            <li>Just started using this product to early to tell if it is working yet.</li>
            <li>Remember, no product out there can remove cellulite completely, but this product comes as close to it as you can get.</li>
            <li>Now I can go to the beach without feeling so self conscious.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Still early in the process.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s completely gone just yet</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to any woman who wants to get rid of their cellulite</li>
            <li>I apply the cream on &amp; rub vigorously + the massaging &amp; heat action.</li>
            <li>I used some skin improvement products but it was almost a year when I was struggling with that adamant problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>coenzyme A is decided to target the light fatty areas.</li>
            <li>, I noticed my skin felt incredibly soft and well moisturized.</li>
            <li>I give this product 2 stars because of how soft it makes my skin...</li>
            <li>This cream really works, my second jar is on the way!</li>
            <li>Just received it, but so far like it.</li>
            <li>but it makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I bought this cream hoping to help the excess skin I have on lower belly after giving birth to my 18mo old.  </li>
            <li>Almost 2 jars used thus far, and I can say that the product seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t work out, and at &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; 50 years old</li>
            <li>I feel the cream, thanks to the ingredients, have provided beneficial in not only tightening my cellulite but also moisturizing my skin and what 30 something doesn’t wish for both of these things?!?!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see full results.</li>
            <li>At my aqua-aerobics class, younger women are asking how my legs are so firm and smooth!</li>
            <li>It is slowly but surely firming, smoothing, and tightening up in those areas on my body.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way which I love.</li>
            <li>I have used other brands with some success, but this is a winner</li>
            <li>saw a slight improvement but the smell is really potent, not a terrible smell just weird</li>
            <li>After the first application (and the second and third)</li>
            <li>started doing some research on different cellulite reduction methods including ingredients to look for in creams, application methods and potential lifestyle changes I would have to make in order to get the results I wanted... heres my journey ;)</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s pretty much just a sham.  </li>
            <li>but after only three weeks of using it twice a day, once in the morning and again at night, my husband was the first to notice the reduced appearance of my stretch marks and this is after having my second child.</li>
            <li>Even in broad daylight.&lt;br /&gt;For once I&#x27;m Happily surprised with a product</li>
            <li>I was using one of the other ones right before I started this one in which it took about 1-2weeks to notice results where as this was immediate I guess because of the tightening effect.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but this product fell short of my expectations.  </li>
            <li>After spending several years cultivating and over indulging my rotund belly, I received an invitation to my High school reunion.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this, but after a few days of using it, I broke out in little bumps.</li>
            <li>Results aren&#x27;t apparent thus far.</li>
            <li>I just recently received this product, and haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give it a full review.</li>
            <li>I carefully read the instructions and followed them exactly.</li>
            <li>like I need to take a shower I had to wash my hands right after applying it because they felt gross and it seemed to dry my hands out.</li>
            <li>The cream left my legs feeling a little sticky, but went on smoothly and was not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and Matrixyl 3000 Super Peptide Complex]]and</li>
            <li>I, like many other mothers, have a little lower belly pooch.</li>
            <li>But I guess I need to resist to use it to see the major effect.</li>
            <li>My thighs are firmer (not as much jiggle) and maybe a little less appearance of the cellulite after 3 weeks, but I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my belly.  </li>
            <li>First, I dry brushed in an up-and-down motion, and then put the lotion on in an up-and-down motion.  </li>
            <li>Jar was only half full.</li>
            <li>I used it generously, and it left a white layer that I had to massage into the skin for several minutes before it was absorbed enough for me to get dressed.</li>
            <li>A clever little product really and</li>
            <li>I did notice a bit of firming in the skin in certain areas but not much reduction in cellulite.</li>
            <li>stuff really does work well as long as you are willing to put in a little effort.</li>
            <li>One weekend she had purchased some Bodishape, and it had a great effect on her thighs and hips, but they weren’t as bad as the fat on my bottom.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this cream to anyone looking to smooth AND firm skin!</li>
            <li>Some time back I developed cellulite patches around my thighs which were the cause of my worries.</li>
            <li>Being young, I didn&#x27;t think I would have cellulite, however I recently have noticed the cellulite in my thighs.</li>
            <li>formula apparently changed.  </li>
            <li>After watching the Dr. Oz episode that aired earlier this year about getting rid of cellulite, I came onto here to find a cream with caffeine and retinol in it.</li>
            <li>Of course my plan is to continue the process until the jar is empty, but really.  </li>
            <li>my 9 year old made it a point to tell me daily that it wasn&#x27;t working!  </li>
            <li>Not only has my cellulite disappeared - my rear looks like it&#x27;s 21 years old again.  </li>
            <li>I’ve never really given too much thought about what cellulite is or where it comes from, but my girlfriend had remarked plenty of times about some stripes on my butt.</li>
            <li>Bodishape is worth using for even and firm skin.</li>
            <li>I also consume caffeine in the first half of the day and drink plenty of water during the day.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free and was a bit skeptical at first but after only using it for a week</li>
            <li>so it was okay that I had not seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li>and I can still see and feel that the skin on my tummy (four babies later) is more firm and visibly there is less &amp;#34;wrinkled&amp;#34; or cellulite look.  </li>
            <li>The second thing that I noticed is that the cream is thick but smooth.</li>
            <li>I did feel a little bit effect when I first use it.</li>
            <li>The cream itself actually has a faint pleasant smell and not a stinging odour like the other creams that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this twice now and will update my review in a few weeks - but I can already tell my skin is softer and something is definitely going on in the right direction with this product.</li>
            <li>The before picture is a little red because I decided to take the picture after my first session doing this.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for the past 9 days, about a tablespoon-ish twice a day, morning and right before bedtime.</li>
            <li>Use this product religiously for three weeks, I&#x27;m average weight with cellulite issues, I&#x27;m not overly at all, it did absolutely nothing to take even 10% away.</li>
            <li>When I used Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, in a few days, my skin started becoming even and firm.</li>
            <li>I have been using BodiShape for a few months now and see positive results.  </li>
            <li>Unlike earlier, I see myself much in shape when I dress myself in skin tight clothes.</li>
            <li>I basically wasted $20, because it certainly didn&#x27;t show any results after two weeks of usage.</li>
            <li>BUT when you work hard to tone and build your muscles, I do believe this cream can help to firm the skin and let the muscles shine through. :)</li>

            <li> ..keep up the good work</li>
            <li> I had read online that drinking a good amount of water and exfoliating the problem area in addition to the cream would improve the results.</li>
            <li> and he loved the way my skin looked and felt.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;write a good review&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good skin improvement product.</li>
            <li> and so I was delighted when one of my friends put a package together from Bodishape for my birthday.</li>
            <li> I had to find a good product for myself.</li>
            <li> I found Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, and I am very happy with the fabulous results.</li>
            <li> the packaging is good.  </li>
            <li> and I was looking for a good product.</li>
            <li> Still on the hunt for a good product.</li>
            <li> WORKING GOOD.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to research, I read the reviews, and chose Bodishape because it got some good reviews and the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells good, and it feels like it&#x27;s doing &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; - but spendy stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> And worked good on my butt and thighs.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been good use</li>
            <li> and it is in good packaging condition.</li>
            <li> I waited for over a month to do this review, so that it would be a fair review.</li>
            <li> It looks really good.</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> Good.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as reviews states...</li>
            <li> I have always loved swimming.</li>
            <li> The texture of the cream is good</li>
            <li> Stick with it, and with patience there is a good chance you will begin to see results.</li>
            <li> Also, anytime you massage your legs it is good for cellulite, circulation and exfoliation</li>
            <li> I did not find this was a good product.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t smell good either.</li>
            <li> I Had good results and placed another order.</li>
            <li> Cellulite creme did not do me any good .</li>
            <li> I had many years trying to find good cellulite reduction cream for my body, after using BODY SHAPE cellulite reduction cream now I can judge it helps me to get slim appearance again!</li>
            <li> If I could excericse, I am sure the combo would be perfect and I would be cellulite free!</li>
            <li> It had a nice smell and went on the skin very easily without feeling greasy!</li>
            <li> This is a great product if it worked for me it sure will work for every person who uses it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with how this cream works.</li>
            <li> They are a great company and their customer service was outstanding.</li>

            <li> When I used it I got some nice results.</li>
            <li> so I wasn’t worried about it not being effective.</li>
            <li> Effective and priced competitively.  </li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Mostly using it on my arms and have seen a difference already.</li>

            <li> You must use the product continuously and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it takes time</li>
            <li> There appears to be better products out there at a better price according to the reviews.</li>
            <li> I started exercising more, but it didn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I had to disregard my favorite beach wear, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> more than anything.</li>
            <li> By the way the company called me and offered a 50% discount if I wrote a review which I thought it was ok since they did not say</li>
            <li> With that said I will be trying another bottle and hope that this time I see better results.</li>
            <li> I admit most of us desire to look our best for various reasons.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now when I&#x27;ve conquered my problem, I feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> I just love this product for what it does.</li>
            <li> my skin looks much better than before.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not so sure about</li>
            <li> I had many cellulite patches and these were growing day by day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> if I used it twice a day it might work better.</li>
            <li> Her cellulite patches are looking better and she said she will be buy another jar because she is convinced that it&#x27;s going to keep on improving with more application.</li>
            <li> i love that part...</li>
            <li> I know there are many skeptics out there</li>
            <li> but the best part is that it comes with a 100% money back guarantee, so</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this product from BodiShape.</li>
            <li> I began to exercise more, and eating healthier, but it would not go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product will buy again</li>
            <li> I have been considering liposuction because I have tried many creams over the years</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 43) but thought I&#x27;d give it one more</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this great product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I look and feel so much better than I could have imagined</li>
            <li> Truly a lovely product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great cellulite cream that I love to pamper myself</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I exercise and eat somewhat healthy and that helps.</li>
            <li> I love this cream</li>
            <li> Has to order some more.</li>
            <li> meet my expectations and more would buy again</li>
            <li> I love this product and the way it is working.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but I lost about 15 lbs.</li>
            <li> and that helped better than any cellulite cream I have ever used.....</li>
            <li> Planning on buying one more jar to see if I get any more improvements.</li>
            <li> With the help of Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, I&#x27;ve been able to reduce those cellulite patches.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s more cost-effective and perhaps safer than plastic surgery.</li>
            <li> Now, I wear shorts and am much more confident.     </li>
            <li> I tried many things.</li>
            <li> and I was able to see the difference.</li>
            <li> Another product like many of the others out there.</li>
            <li> not so sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this product from BodiShape.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be glad</li>
            <li> u will love it</li>
            <li> and  that makes me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for better skin.</li>
            <li> I already do most of the things that are recommended in the literature that came with the cream (drink lots of water with lemon, avoid processed foods, try to keep your body pH alkaline, restrict salt, exfoliate in the shower)</li>
            <li> I limit my sodium, and I have been so diligent in making sure</li>
            <li> I was a bit overweight for many years.</li>
            <li> Product worked as described, wife have brought more then one unit without any problems.</li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>
            <li> I have already noticed were my love handles</li>
            <li> Now, I am much more confident about myself.</li>
            <li> I just love this product for what it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can feel the Retinol working more and more as it dries which gives a tightening sensation.</li>
            <li> just became even more motivated from there.</li>
            <li> drinking water combined with eating fruits and vegetables that contain more water (ex: melons, celery, leafy greens...</li>
            <li> Aside from one pesky dimple that just won&#x27;t quit, most of the cellulite has diminished dramatically and my skin continues to improve.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my thighs but have started to use it on my tummy as well as I have noticed a difference on my thighs and have faith that it will work on my tummy as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cream for about a month,my skin looks firmer and the cellulite aspect it&#x27;s reduced:)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see more results.</li>
            <li> Unlike many firming agents I have tried, this cream smells lovely and rubs into your skin.</li>
            <li> and I feel much more confident wearing shorts and dresses.</li>
            <li> I follow all the instructions, i.e, drink lots of water, try to eat healthy, use twice a day, etc  </li>
            <li> I am on my 4th jar and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I did combine healthy eating, exercises and the cream.</li>
            <li> Better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s temporary, but hey if it makes you feel more confident, why not?  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I can get rid most of my cellulite in 2 bottles and my skin is tighther.</li>
            <li> I reordered and I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> It is a daily commitment for best results.</li>
            <li> My skin is def looking better already.  </li>
            <li> There are much much better products in the market.</li>
            <li> This cream promises to \\&quot;get rid of cellulite\\&quot; in the title of this product page, but does not promise anything more than firming and reducing the appearance of cellulite on the jar itself.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Bioderm slimming/cellulite products work better.</li>
            <li> Now I am glad to be able to wear my swimsuits again.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I&#x27;ve many cellulite patches on my thighs and abdomen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an interesting thing to think about, a cream being able to reduce cellulite</li>
            <li> It makes me feel more</li>
            <li> the more I use it the better it getting....</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see any noticeable differences after using this product for more than two weeks</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy again</li>
            <li> I bought the cellulite brush as well to hopefully get better results &amp; nothing.  </li>
            <li> must say I am 65 and have not had my weight vary more than 12 pounds since I was in my twenties</li>
            <li> Also it smells ok for a body shaping cream, Also</li>
            <li> this is the best for cellulite, but of course needs to be reapplied daily.</li>
            <li> It is working better than those over the counter anti-cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> The very next day I was changing clothes and remembered I had tried the cream and ran to the bathroom with the good lightning and TA DA!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> but thats ok because this cream is not for stretch marks</li>
            <li> Nuelle Cellulite Cream is much better.</li>
            <li> I try many products for review on my blog.</li>
            <li> It is a very nicely textured cream and rubs in very well.</li>
            <li> First time buying with seller!!!</li>
            <li> Feels nice on skin but did not see any significant results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s becoming better and better day by day.</li>
            <li> This cream is light and very easy to use, there is no offensive scent.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Her results were pretty good.  </li>
            <li> But I do have cellulite, and a pretty fair amount of it.</li>
            <li> I have done these things with and without this cream, and there is a significant improvement when I use the cream!</li>
            <li> like the cream itself - it goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The cream rubs in nicely and absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind paying more for a good product, however in that case I really feel like I lost my money</li>
            <li> It also smells great and makes the skin feel soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> and although it&#x27;s not gone completely I&#x27;m happy with my results so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife who has reached her middle ages incredibly gracefully, but is struggling with keeping her legs toned no matter what she does.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get this free through a promo, but I will be recommending this cream to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I have to say it works great so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using this incredible cream nightly for the last three weeks and my cellulite is disappearing.</li>
            <li> My skin became more supple and smooth</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a complimentary sample of BodiShape Cellulite Reduction cream in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Now, I can look in the mirror and feel as good as I look thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps skin soft and smells very nice.</li>
            <li> The instructions for usage were not the best, but I used it the way other&#x27;s on the reviews said they used it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am now using Nerium and have noticed a difference that is much more significant.</li>
            <li> The jar arrived, the shrink wrap was easy to tear off</li>
            <li> After much of a tussle I found this product which turned out to be the best skin firming product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I recommend this cream easily and plan to continue to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the smell is not offensive.</li>
            <li> It has a really strong smell.  </li>
            <li> My skin is now becoming smooth and even.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the cream on its own, I started to notice a difference within the first 7 days which was a bit unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> of luck on your own journey ; )&lt;br /&gt;-Andy</li>
            <li> Plus I really liked the way it smelled, it smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Goes on very easily and smoothly, and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best one I have purchased thus far!!  </li>
            <li> It just worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> I liked this cream I feel like it had some positive smoothing effects.</li>
            <li> I could be imagining it, but it seems to really make my legs look better!</li>
            <li> It really works if you are exercising, and eating healthy!</li>
            <li> I really must say, this is magic in a jar!  </li>
            <li> so much, to the magic man/woman who made this stuff!</li>
            <li> The massagers are easy to clean and are easy to hold on to when you are using them.  </li>
            <li> certainly would not expect to buy a cream and slap it on my legs and think it&#x27;ll work on its own on stubborn cellulite.</li>
            <li> The cellulite is still there, but reduced to the point of feeling confident about my legs for the first time in forever! ....</li>
            <li> Have seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> At the 6 week mark it was a huge difference to</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This cream made me break out in a huge rash</li>
            <li> it took a huge toll on my skin.</li>
            <li> Received this free for a review, I have been using this for about a week and unless my eyes are deceiving me this is working.  </li>
            <li> It is also lightly scented which I prefer as I do not like creams or lotions that try to compete with my perfume.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to a cellulite free summer body.</li>
            <li> I feel great about this product and would recommend to everyone who needs such a product for their skin.</li>
            <li> If it works for me it must do a great job for younger persons.</li>
            <li> In around 1 month I&#x27;ve found a flawless and firm skin.</li>
            <li> My skin became smooth and brighter in no time.</li>
            <li> so if you enjoy that then you will like it.</li>
            <li> FEEL MY SKIN SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS  FREE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I wanted a smooth and shiny skin</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and feels luxurious.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be nice smelling and very creamy when I put it on.</li>
            <li> It not only works but the smell is great.</li>
            <li> The smooth cream blends into the skin well, with Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the light minty scent.</li>
            <li> texture of the cream itself is smooth.</li>
            <li> &quot; The body brush works to smooth out the fat cells.</li>
            <li> on smooth, not sticky at all&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve achieved even and smooth legs.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve smooth and glowing skin.</li>
            <li> wrote a review about another cellulite cream in which I also referred to the cream that is no longer available (Shessentials).  </li>
            <li> doesnt dissolve my blubber however does smooth ripples, dimples etc</li>
            <li> Maybe with advanced cellulite you have to use it longer to get results</li>
            <li> Great - stuff actually works</li>
            <li> I have battled this problem with exercise to no avail, so I am happy that Bodishape is finally helping!</li>
            <li> Bodishape helped to smooth out the cellulite in my thighs.</li>
            <li> But so far so good.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and in good shape for my age.</li>
            <li> have so far had great success with the cream, and have seen a difference.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this awesome product is that it smells terrific and very high end - herbal and fresh, kind of like an Aveda product.</li>
            <li> It leaves you feeling firmer right after which I love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a right away confidence boost :-)</li>
            <li> Okay, moving right along.</li>
            <li> BUT if your patient and consistent you WILL see results!!</li>
            <li> so cellulite has appeared goes on very nicely if you follow the instructions and rub it in the way the directions explain you can actually feel it working.  </li>
            <li> scent of this cream is fantastic and the texture rich.  </li>
            <li> cream has a unique composition of ingredients and the reason it works is because those ingredients are very powerful by themselves and when put together, are even stronger.</li>
            <li> and she sent me another cream FREE right away!</li>
            <li> It has a light scent that I enjoy and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I just tried this product for the first time and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it four stars since the seller stayed true to the promise so we can try it risk free like advertised and</li>
            <li> product DOES NOT work by itself as I originally thought, oh well......</li>
            <li> Im excited to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Results work better if you continue to hydrate your skin and do not take hot showers.</li>
            <li> so I was quite excited to try it.</li>
            <li> give this product three stars instead of one because it is a good moisturizer and general skin conditioner.</li>
            <li> (I love that the first ingredient is \\&quot;aqua (deionized water).\\</li>
            <li> give this product three stars instead of one because it is a good moisturizer and general skin conditioner.</li>
            <li> (I love that the first ingredient is \\&quot;aqua (deionized water).\\</li>
            <li> did not see a significant result as reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> try it promise you each on of you going to love it ;)</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews of this product are very good, then I decided to try last time, and this time, I really did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want to try this cream please do some kind of aerobic exercise and eat properly, and if you don&#x27;t see results maybe you will need to use more than one jar to see results like me.</li>
            <li> so that is what I&#x27;m doing (no wonder there is so many, but as I said they not asking for a positive review I guess they just want to sort of survey results</li>
            <li> After reading all the overwhelming positive reviews on Bodishape&#x27;s Cellulite Cream I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> and my legs looked nice and toned and the cellulite was completely gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the full results after another month.</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly and began using it right away morning and night.</li>
            <li> This cream is good for refreshing other than that didn&#x27;t do anything I bought two</li>
            <li> pleasant light scent, takes a while to absorb but it really surprised me how much it helps.  </li>
            <li> I am not claiming that it is a “miracle cream,” but it has most certainly done the trick for me.  </li>
            <li> Used it before and while going to the beach with a special massage brush.  </li>
            <li> my body has changed in the appearance the most thing that I ve seen over the last 4 weeks is the fine patches on my legs start to improve and my skin is more silky to the touch.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect treatment after a hard work out at the gym and one that makes me feel</li>
            <li> and they were great with getting back to me and stated that this was a first.  </li>
            <li> A cool smoothness once areas are massaged</li>
            <li> I am very well pleased with both the massage kit and the cream.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t not see a different  the same.not good</li>
            <li> Gives a soothing cool sense</li>
            <li> And true, I tried it and it did wonders.</li>
            <li> And I honestly was so surprised.</li>
            <li> i love this cream!....shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Ok ladies and gents this cream really works.  </li>
            <li> However, I began to realize that I needed a bit more help to really get the results I desired.</li>
            <li> Bodishape has been that “bit more help” that I have needed to really shape this area.</li>
            <li> so hopefully my legs will be shorts ready for the summer :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suprisingly, I received an unexpected e-mail from Bodishape asking me how I liked the product.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;to be true.</li>
            <li> Have used for about a month, just ordered another bottle so I can try for a full 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaging appears safe.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to order more of this product.</li>
            <li> It smells like medicine, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> but since I am fortunate enough to be trying this product for free and am seeing results within 1 week, the smell is nothing!!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, smells great</li>
            <li> I honestly did not notice any results but the cream does have a smoothing effect that makes your skin look and feel nice and firm</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries well &amp; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> oh the cream runs out quickly...</li>
            <li> Everyone wants firm, flawless and glowing skin.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found a brand that will be able to help me with my cellulite in the future.</li>
            <li> It definitely isn&#x27;t a quick miracle cream, but combined with exercise and changes to my diet</li>
            <li> I make this a part of my daily routine to feel and look better, and to make sure I take care of myself in a way I deserve.  </li>
            <li> and it is super sticky.</li>
            <li> Runs out quickly.  </li>
            <li> I definitely feel more confident wearing shorts and swimsuits than I have in years!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It have reduce my cellulite tremendously..</li>
            <li> Another product i enjoyed using from JDT International , I have tried a couple item from them and really enjoyed them all</li>
            <li> and I like the mild fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My guess is that it works for people with mild cellulite issues</li>
            <li> you have a mild cellulite problem, I would suggest that you give this a try, but if you have a lot of cellulite</li>
            <li> I searched on net and found Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Creamwhich is very popular and comes in reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The first is that I thought it could replace a cream that is no longer available through</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a fresh sent not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good as long as you follow instructions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to save my money for a new pair of running shoes:)</li>
            <li> My new favorite beauty treatment.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the company seems like they are genuinely interested in you being satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use and work for me very well.</li>
            <li> The company is also very professional and concerned that you enjoyed and saw results.</li>
            <li> Recieved these for free in return for a positive feedback.  </li>
            <li> I wore a bathing suit WITHOUT a wrap for the first time in years!  </li>
            <li> Rubs in really well too!!</li>
            <li> This product really does work!!</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference and have been pleased with the product so far!</li>
            <li> Great product, I have seen results in as little as one week.  </li>
            <li> Amazing results after a short time!</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I explored when I faced cellulite dimples and found this product worth.</li>
            <li> I have even used it on my stomach although with not as much success on my thighs.</li>
            <li> I am no longer young and &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34;, but I wasn&#x27;t sure quite what to expect from this product.  </li>
            <li> I cannot swear that the cellulite has improved, but my skin is much more supple and soft.  </li>
            <li> This is worth using.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not only the warm weather season when this issue bother us all...</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It is creamy and fragrant and absorbed immediately.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how they did it, and I&#x27;m big on researching ingredients</li>
            <li> This product is really worth.</li>
            <li> Worth every $</li>
            <li> I asked my dermatologist if any anti-cellulite creams were worth investing in.</li>
            <li> , this is a nice extra bit of improvement.</li>
            <li> &amp; it keeps it fresh longer.  </li>
            <li> absorbed.  </li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> This went on for almost a year when I finally got some nice results after using Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s absolutely worth it for the results you can get.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it if it does what it</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I saw a reduction in cellulite especially in my stomach-</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it for many days yet, but so far, it seems to have some effect.</li>
            <li> As with many cellulite reduction creams, this one contains caffeine, but also vitamin A, vitamin E, and a bunch of other ingredients, many from plants.</li>
            <li> As with many cellulite reduction creams, this one contains caffeine, but also vitamin A, vitamin E, and a bunch of other ingredients, many from plants.</li>
            <li> Ran out of it pretty quickly</li>
            <li> I have to admit that it&#x27;s really  good at warming things up because I really feel extra hot on the areas I put it on during my work out.</li>
            <li> customer&lt;br /&gt;service was really helpful and friendly.</li>
            <li> Is it in the right amounts?...</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> it was right on time for my trip to Vegas.</li>
            <li> I intentionally did not touch my right side with the cream (or any creams or lotions, for that matter)</li>
            <li> Let’s just get that out of the way right away.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews comes from the company paying off people to help sell this stuff!   </li>
            <li> I personally thought it was kind of pretty and sleek compared to the eye sore squeeze bottles, so that was a bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When before it did not really bother me, I feel I have a new perspective in life where I want to try to keep my body as great as it can be.</li>
            <li> I really had to wait awhile for it to dry good.  </li>
            <li> The cream leaves my skin feeling silk like and absorbs nice and quickly unlike other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> Free Pre-release New Products to Trial and Review</li>
            <li> The cream is absorbed completely in the skin and makes it smooth.</li>
            <li> and I would prefer a pump instead because I used way too much too quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited until I used this cream for several months to write a product review so that I could really give it time to see if it lived up to the hype and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> I can feel the areas more firm and better looking.</li>
            <li> It also made my skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The texture of the product goes on smoothly and use as direct and it will work!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product twice because it seems to evaporate in the jar very fast.</li>
            <li> I like this very much.</li>
            <li> Very fast Delivery”</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, the results: My left side doesn&#x27;t look any better than my right side, although the skin on the left is decidedly softer and more supple.</li>
            <li> The product does have a scent that is on the strong side, so I don&#x27;t think putting it on right before bed every night is terribly appealing, I tend to put it on a few hours before</li>
            <li> The dimpling isn&#x27;t gone, but it really has improved!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky at all, it absorbed really well into my skin.</li>
            <li> It seems more noticeable when I put on an extra pound or two.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream and although I was sceptical at first, it really did the trick!</li>
            <li> A couple more days later</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> She was aware that I am trying to deal with cellulite patches but not found a solution yet.</li>
            <li> It was the first thing I noticed when I opened</li>
            <li> I put it on every night before going to sleep, making sure it was all over the upper thighs and bum, then shower in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I could really use some short-shorts weather now!</li>
            <li> I love to be in shape and have a younger skin.</li>
            <li> Thankfully my friend made me aware about Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream.</li>
            <li> and I will stick to the regime applying it daily after the shower with hopes of even better results.</li>
            <li> especially that I had the chance to use cheaper creams that were more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I workout regularly and it was getting better with the exercise but wanted to try this, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> Absorbs completely with light scent.</li>
            <li> A big plus is that it is Paraben Free!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been interested ever since.</li>
            <li> Sure, Dr. Oz recommends the ingredients (not this product) but does this actually have any of the ingredients?</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any product to try to get rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li> only diet and exersize solve this problem, I should know better.  </li>
            <li> Says a money back guarantee but more of a hassle to return it than to keep it.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> The fat in the area was starting to disappear, I was so glad that my friend recommended me this.</li>
            <li> Well, let me be the first to say that THIS has helped my cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I have for sure noticed a difference,  in the belly area, the skin is definitely tighter and the cellulite has faded a bit, I would purchase again</li>
            <li> During a sport meet, one of my friends made me aware about my thigh dimples which I was ignoring otherwise.</li>
            <li> I was willing to give this cream a try because I&#x27;ve never tried a cellulite cream before.</li>
            <li> were my first impressions...</li>
            <li> like I did after the first two weeks, you should still see results.</li>
            <li> This product also comes with a 100% Money Back Guarantee if you aren’t satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just paid $20 for this and now it&#x27;s more than double the price.</li>
            <li> I used it for a month and followed the instructions exactly without any results at all.</li>
            <li> I used it all over my body at first.</li>
            <li> This definitely helps even more.</li>
            <li> Product actually works better than I thought.</li>
            <li> Within the first 7 days, I began to see results.</li>
            <li> No only does it have the cellulite reducing properties, but I love the skin firming effect it has for those areas that didn&#x27;t rebound as well after pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t convinced and my supply ran out.  </li>
            <li> We are on to trying something else now with higher hopes.  </li>
            <li> me first say this-</li>
            <li> you have to be willing to put in some effort.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Did absolutely NOTHING after a months worth of use.</li>
            <li> but since after 30 days I didn&#x27;t see a difference in cellulite, I wasn&#x27;t willing to continue to invest in the product.</li>
            <li> First I did the leg brushing, and then applied.</li>
            <li> First, this is not a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> i contacted the seller and said the product I got looked like it was missing a good inch from when I opened</li>
            <li> energetic, vibrant and even a little more sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another positive, my skin actually feels better after using this product.  </li>
            <li> My cellulite isn&#x27;t completely gone, but I do love what I see so far!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t possibly drink that much water, but I&#x27;ve definitely been more mindful and am drinking more water than I ever have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products by Bodishape and they&#x27;ve all been amazing</li>
            <li> Maybe my only problem was the poor circulation associated with Cellulite, but was super impressed..</li>
            <li> Naturally everyone is different and you have to be your own judge.</li>
            <li> I am finally booty-licious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been so dedicated to my Gym workout - keeping a healthy organic, whole foods diet.  </li>
            <li> I am very hopeful with second jar to see even more results.</li>
            <li> Naturally everyone is different and you have to be your own judge.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for a week with the special MIT, so far I haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> set off to try the cream earnestly, but I have to say, that my sensitive skin rebelled pretty quickly with this cream.</li>
            <li> but I wish I had because I do think I saw positive results.</li>
            <li> I did notice some positive changes while using the product.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try something to tighten up those saggy areas on my legs and under arms and decided to try this because of all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone who is looking to positively impact their cellulite.</li>
            <li> I used to love my shorts and they used to suit my long legs too.</li>
            <li> The smell of it could be a little better, it&#x27;s not horrible, but could be a little better</li>
            <li> If the jar would of lasted a month I would be able to see the long term effect.</li>
            <li> but it made such a big difference that she is confident it will be completely smooth by the time the jar runs out.</li>
            <li> I also am an avid athlete and eat very well.</li>
            <li> &quot; It has a light, barely detectable scent.</li>
            <li> &quot; It has a light, barely detectable scent.</li>
            <li> Not sure where the good ratings are coming from.  </li>
            <li> after using a full jar of this cream, which wasn&#x27;t even completely full...I saw ZERO results.</li>
            <li> I only wish it had a lighter smell, but that could easily be my sensitivity.</li>
            <li> first thing that I noticed about the cream is that it has a wonderfully light scent; big shocker that I picked up on the scent!</li>
            <li> Even though, I missed a large number of workouts, I made it a priority to take my Cellulite supplement.</li>
            <li> I will not say that this cream will give you baby like skin again, let us face it, pass a certain age and that thought is history.</li>
            <li> Even though I have skin sensitivities to certain beauty products, I had no adverse reactions.</li>
            <li> I certainly saw a difference in my thighs</li>
            <li> I will not say that this cream will give you baby like skin again, let us face it, pass a certain age and that thought is history.</li>
            <li> In no time at all I could really see and feel the positive results of this product.</li>
            <li> They kind of look like a stocking filled with dried beans and I refuse to wear sleeves during a hot southern summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been always very conscious about my inner health and outer appearance and I&#x27;ve always preferred healthy foods.</li>
            <li> A brand in a supermarket would probably work better, cost less, last longer, and get better results.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a runner and in pretty decent shape.</li>
            <li> Didnt really see any results..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference..</li>
            <li> It has helped but not as much as I hoped</li>
            <li> This worked very well</li>
            <li> I ordered this and coming really fast.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and after you  apply it you feel a cooling sensation that makes you think its really working.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work, but it did not.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> After much of a struggle I found this product which gave me satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, my sheets and clothing weren’t stained at all.  </li>
            <li> Appearance of those patches is much reduced now and my skin looks toned up.</li>
            <li> Seeing these marks, I was very worried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great cream, comes in a very convenient size.</li>
            <li> I used the product three weeks straight and did not notice any difference at all.</li>
            <li> THE BODISHAPE CELLULITE CREAM REALLY WORKING FOR ME.  </li>
            <li> THANKS.</li>
            <li> hope the discount is offered real</li>
            <li> I would like to think that things are smoothing out, but it&#x27;s too soon to really tell.  </li>
            <li> made it that much</li>
            <li> Being very skinny and a distance runner, I could never understand why I still had cellulite on my legs.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to get results from this product</li>
            <li> I do not have much cellulite , but wanted to just  work on what I have.</li>
            <li> Really silky lotion</li>
            <li> It was very upsetting when I realized I was developing cellulite patches.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much body fat per se.</li>
            <li> Would like to have additional information regarding how much to use with each application</li>
            <li> Cellulite Creme provided for free by JDT International.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not seen any results and I&#x27;m very discouraged by this.</li>
            <li> and it really helped me have tighter skin.</li>
            <li> Results are immediate, soft, fresh minty scent.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely did nothing for my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much of a change.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much change in my cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really worked.</li>
            <li> I used the whole thing as directed and didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> the heat from the shower hydrates your skin which assists it in absorbing the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have a 100% satisfaction policy so you really have noting to lose, but theres a lot to gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really seems to work</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> I also transferred the cream into an airless pump bottle (that I purchased at Sephora in a set), so I can control how much I apply (2 pumps each leg)</li>
            <li> No visible difference and very sticky, can&#x27;t wear anything for hours after putting it on.</li>
            <li> Real wasting of money.</li>
            <li> It really boosts up my confidence when I wear clothes which I really want.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you try!</li>
            <li> Bottle goes fast.</li>
            <li> Was very hopeful, but didn&#x27;t seem to work.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And my skin is much smoother than before.  </li>
            <li> I really feel grateful for this product</li>
            <li> I had 3 weeks to get ready for a vacation-</li>
            <li> And much easier than adding another run to my week that may not even make a difference</li>
            <li> This company really should be ashamed of themselves for ripping off their customers.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to decrease cellulite and have firmer skin in problem areas.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> but cellulite is still very visible.</li>
            <li> I might as well go get a procedure since it goes so fast.</li>
            <li> It really works....</li>
            <li> Was really hoping this would work.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t real faithful about putting it on twice a day (I just forgot some days).  </li>
            <li> One thing I did not like too much about it, though, is that it feels sticky on the skin.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I used the whole container and saw no difference what so ever.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even try it before the shower, which is really supposed to help.</li>
            <li> Used the whole jar and saw no noticeable difference</li>
            <li> I did not expect the cream to work fast or even at all, I was a hopeful skeptic.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> Hmmm … I don’t really want catwalk legs … too skinny for me.</li>
            <li> , what you really want to know is have I noticed a change to my cellulite?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering from you all some more in the near future.</li>
            <li> After having 2 kids, I wanted to reduce the appearance of my stretch marks as much as possible, and this product was the only product that proved effective in minimizing them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try a different cream that is more natural that Dr Oz recommended.</li>
            <li> seller is also great they really stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> Okay so the product was not so easy to rub in, its a thick gel like but looks like a normal cream.  </li>
            <li> Here are the tips if anyone purchases Bodishape, so you can implement them right away:  1) use a natural body brush to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; the cellulite.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product based on other reviews of noticing good results.</li>
            <li> Had a decent fragrance, went on smoothly, but I saw no difference, even after using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> pure white color, cool scent.</li>
            <li> This is a fact that most of us, at some time or the other face body changes.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t any better than other products you can find for $29.95.</li>
            <li> I still have the same amount of cellulite on my thighs and butt that I originally had before I started using this cream.</li>
            <li> I am active, exercising most days by either walking, doing a treadmill workout, or playing tennis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried, different creams and lotions with few successful results.</li>
            <li> Was greatly overpriced for the size and for what it pretty much failed to do.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone who wants to get rid of their cellulite.</li>
            <li> &quot; For a very short time you have the opportunity to test and review our new Bodishape branded products for FREE in pre market release.</li>
            <li> $40 is pretty steep for soft skin that a $3 bottle of lotion could do.</li>
            <li> I felt embarrassed but as a true friend she also suggested a possible solution.</li>
            <li> My legs and thighs are tight and it absolutely feels better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better than the other stuff, where you&#x27;re supposed to use saran wrap and a heating pad (WHAT?!?).</li>
            <li> The jar is solid so it does not let light through, and it has a double lid to keep the air tight seal when you close it, which are both important for a product containing Retinol (avoid light exposure and minimize oxidation).</li>
            <li> It came in a great packaging and actually showed up earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Eat less processed foods and more alkaline produce too&lt;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but It can be a bit sticky, so less works better.  </li>
            <li> After applying the cream at morning and at night every day for an entire month, the appearance of cellulite lines have weakened tremendously.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as it claims, the jar should come in auch larger container to give consumer more time to use for possible results</li>
            <li> and I will order some more prior to my next show.</li>
            <li> I also did not see any results, but to be fair, I did only use it a few days...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for almost a month now, and have decent results.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the cream.</li>
            <li> I have seen why it is so highly valued</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream, it works.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My diet is high in lean protein and vegetables.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a magic cream that will completely get rid of cellulite put your wallet away now, don&#x27;t buy this or any other product.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin is a little more perky after using this on my cellulite areas.</li>
            <li> I used as directed and sometimes a little more to see if that would help, but I got nothing.</li>
            <li> I felt I have a little sagging  skin on my belly, after loosing 15 pounds, now it got better.</li>
            <li> Other creams have a strong odor, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The ONLY benefit from this cream is that it makes your skin super soft, that it all!  </li>
            <li> So as soon as I saw it on my door step Sunday afternoon, I showered and that evening I tried a little bit (not measured teaspon but eyeballed teaspoon) and rubbed up and down vigorously lol.  </li>
            <li> but I was truly surprised to see results and results that fast.  </li>
            <li> After only about a week of applications as the container states, I did notice my cellulite was pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> There has been no negative side effects as of yet.</li>
            <li> I need to used it a few more times before giving it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels more firm.</li>
            <li> As days went by without applying I noticed my skin was not as firm and more dimply.  </li>
            <li> I started feeling my skin tightening and looking better within a few days of use</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot rave about this product any more!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, my profile: I have a normal BMI, right in the middle of the range for my height.</li>
            <li> As many people said, it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> It comes on smoothly yet it takes a while to dry completely.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s, and started seeing the first signs of cellulite on my upper thighs despite being physically active and eating relatively healthy.  </li>
            <li> picture is before (on the left) and after (on the right).  </li>
            <li> It does have a strange smell but that disappears quickly so it isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The patches are gone and new patches are also not formulated as my skin remains hydrated and toned up.</li>
            <li> Every time I leave the house, a new compliment comes my way.</li>
            <li> In couple of weeks I found a new me.</li>
            <li> The cream had an odd smell but that was easy to get over. .</li>
            <li> I am not heavy set but have put on some weight as I have gotten older</li>
            <li> I have a small bit of cellulite on the backs of my thighs, and no amount of healthy eating, maintaining a normal weight, or exercising seems to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> wish this had worked for me, because you are a great company that obviously stands behind your products.&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li> It also made my skin very soft and supple.</li>
            <li> it worked very fast, i dont have a big cellulite problem though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very sensitive to products so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not creasy, makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mildly scented as compared to those other \\&quot;promising\\&quot; creams which are heavily perfumed and ends up giving you a headache more than anything else.</li>
            <li> So far I have lost 70lbs, and I intend to keep going!</li>
            <li> After my first child birth, I discovered these cellulite on my upper leg.</li>
            <li> Well around the 4 week mark I saw a difference - even my daughter said WOW it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I always take a hot shower and apricot scrub the areas I plan on applying this cream too, to help open the pores.</li>
            <li> Is the first product that has ever work for me I totally recomended.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews</li>
            <li> I work out consistently doing cardio and resistance training and my problem area is the back of my thighs..</li>
            <li> At first no results.. then i kept using it wanting to give it a chance,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it for about two weeks</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t work, the seller gave me a full refund as promised (without return shipping the empty jar).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thin and in great shape, but of &amp;#34;that certain age&amp;#34; where my upper arms under sides and arm pit area (front and back) have cellulite.</li>
            <li> There are no positive changes due to my own actions.  </li>
            <li> Even when I was a skinny teenager and young adult, I had cellulite on my thighs and buttocks, and it&#x27;s only gotten more unsightly as I&#x27;ve aged.</li>
            <li> For couple of months, due to extra work pressure in my assignments I overlooked these habits and noticed that I&#x27;ve developed many cellulite patches on my body.</li>
            <li> Received the product and it came half filled.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive two jars as a gift from my sister and two that I had previously purchased.  </li>
            <li> After the cream settled for the night I was pissed the next day that there was only like 1/2 a jar full, and that&#x27;s probably too generous.  </li>
            <li> Potent is right, because this cream helped my wife get rid of the slight cellulite on her legs in less than a month.</li>
            <li> I certainly look forward to the 25% Discount which will definitely be an incentive to reorder;so,</li>
            <li> I am just a 50- year old career mother of two young adult daughters wanting to take care of what was given to me.</li>
            <li> I am very self conscious of my body and when I saw that I had cellulites on the upper bottom part of my thighs, I rushed to a computer to figure out how to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> The effects go away when you stop the cream--which is clear when you read the body shape product description</li>
            <li> oh and the advertisement clearly states it contains Retinol but</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t really care for is the scent.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised.</li>
            <li> and I must say that the bottle is really tiny and finishes really fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you so far I am liking this product.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;(IF you are highly sensitive to scents as I am, then use this cream on your legs/torso/arms but not on your face).&lt;br /&gt;Had the scent been just a wee bit softer</li>
            <li> With time, I developed cellulite patches on my thighs.</li>
            <li> Now I enjoy a much firm and even looking skin.</li>
            <li> I feel young.</li>
            <li> When I used Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, I got even, smooth and firm skin.</li>
            <li> I have had cellulite on my thighs and buttocks since I was 12 years old.  </li>
            <li> If you are using it on your legs it does not go far.  </li>
            <li> Plus I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Smells good...made my skin soft</li>
            <li> I chose to give this porduct a 5 star rating because I had a considerable amount of cellulite and was training for a show in which I would wear a bikini on stage.  </li>
            <li> I am not a skin professional, doctor or Bodishape employee.</li>
            <li> I bought a pedicure brush that has the natural bristles.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it nearly every day, and I do see a difference in the appearance of dimples on my outer thigh area.</li>
            <li> While she definitely thinks that she&#x27;s noticing some loss of the fat around her legs, it&#x27;s probably too soon to really tell</li>
            <li> The semi-liquid cream has a light chemical odor which dissipates after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Saw far it seems to work.</li>
            <li> It’s a common desire to have healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Stretch mark nearly visible.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product to early to tell if it is working yet.</li>
            <li> Remember, no product out there can remove cellulite completely, but this product comes as close to it as you can get.</li>
            <li> Now I can go to the beach without feeling so self conscious.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Still early in the process.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s completely gone just yet</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to any woman who wants to get rid of their cellulite</li>
            <li> I apply the cream on &amp; rub vigorously + the massaging &amp; heat action.</li>
            <li> I used some skin improvement products but it was almost a year when I was struggling with that adamant problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> coenzyme A is decided to target the light fatty areas.</li>
            <li> , I noticed my skin felt incredibly soft and well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I give this product 2 stars because of how soft it makes my skin...</li>
            <li> This cream really works, my second jar is on the way!</li>
            <li> Just received it, but so far like it.</li>
            <li> but it makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cream hoping to help the excess skin I have on lower belly after giving birth to my 18mo old.  </li>
            <li> Almost 2 jars used thus far, and I can say that the product seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t work out, and at &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; 50 years old</li>
            <li> I feel the cream, thanks to the ingredients, have provided beneficial in not only tightening my cellulite but also moisturizing my skin and what 30 something doesn’t wish for both of these things?!?!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see full results.</li>
            <li> At my aqua-aerobics class, younger women are asking how my legs are so firm and smooth!</li>
            <li> It is slowly but surely firming, smoothing, and tightening up in those areas on my body.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way which I love.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands with some success, but this is a winner</li>
            <li> saw a slight improvement but the smell is really potent, not a terrible smell just weird</li>
            <li> After the first application (and the second and third)</li>
            <li> started doing some research on different cellulite reduction methods including ingredients to look for in creams, application methods and potential lifestyle changes I would have to make in order to get the results I wanted... heres my journey ;)</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s pretty much just a sham.  </li>
            <li> but after only three weeks of using it twice a day, once in the morning and again at night, my husband was the first to notice the reduced appearance of my stretch marks and this is after having my second child.</li>
            <li> Even in broad daylight.&lt;br /&gt;For once I&#x27;m Happily surprised with a product</li>
            <li> I was using one of the other ones right before I started this one in which it took about 1-2weeks to notice results where as this was immediate I guess because of the tightening effect.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but this product fell short of my expectations.  </li>
            <li> After spending several years cultivating and over indulging my rotund belly, I received an invitation to my High school reunion.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, but after a few days of using it, I broke out in little bumps.</li>
            <li> Results aren&#x27;t apparent thus far.</li>
            <li> I just recently received this product, and haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give it a full review.</li>
            <li> I carefully read the instructions and followed them exactly.</li>
            <li> like I need to take a shower I had to wash my hands right after applying it because they felt gross and it seemed to dry my hands out.</li>
            <li> The cream left my legs feeling a little sticky, but went on smoothly and was not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and Matrixyl 3000 Super Peptide Complex]]and</li>
            <li> I, like many other mothers, have a little lower belly pooch.</li>
            <li> But I guess I need to resist to use it to see the major effect.</li>
            <li> My thighs are firmer (not as much jiggle) and maybe a little less appearance of the cellulite after 3 weeks, but I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my belly.  </li>
            <li> First, I dry brushed in an up-and-down motion, and then put the lotion on in an up-and-down motion.  </li>
            <li> Jar was only half full.</li>
            <li> I used it generously, and it left a white layer that I had to massage into the skin for several minutes before it was absorbed enough for me to get dressed.</li>
            <li> A clever little product really and</li>
            <li> I did notice a bit of firming in the skin in certain areas but not much reduction in cellulite.</li>
            <li> stuff really does work well as long as you are willing to put in a little effort.</li>
            <li> One weekend she had purchased some Bodishape, and it had a great effect on her thighs and hips, but they weren’t as bad as the fat on my bottom.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this cream to anyone looking to smooth AND firm skin!</li>
            <li> Some time back I developed cellulite patches around my thighs which were the cause of my worries.</li>
            <li> Being young, I didn&#x27;t think I would have cellulite, however I recently have noticed the cellulite in my thighs.</li>
            <li> formula apparently changed.  </li>
            <li> After watching the Dr. Oz episode that aired earlier this year about getting rid of cellulite, I came onto here to find a cream with caffeine and retinol in it.</li>
            <li> Of course my plan is to continue the process until the jar is empty, but really.  </li>
            <li> my 9 year old made it a point to tell me daily that it wasn&#x27;t working!  </li>
            <li> Not only has my cellulite disappeared - my rear looks like it&#x27;s 21 years old again.  </li>
            <li> I’ve never really given too much thought about what cellulite is or where it comes from, but my girlfriend had remarked plenty of times about some stripes on my butt.</li>
            <li> Bodishape is worth using for even and firm skin.</li>
            <li> I also consume caffeine in the first half of the day and drink plenty of water during the day.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free and was a bit skeptical at first but after only using it for a week</li>
            <li> so it was okay that I had not seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li> and I can still see and feel that the skin on my tummy (four babies later) is more firm and visibly there is less &amp;#34;wrinkled&amp;#34; or cellulite look.  </li>
            <li> The second thing that I noticed is that the cream is thick but smooth.</li>
            <li> I did feel a little bit effect when I first use it.</li>
            <li> The cream itself actually has a faint pleasant smell and not a stinging odour like the other creams that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice now and will update my review in a few weeks - but I can already tell my skin is softer and something is definitely going on in the right direction with this product.</li>
            <li> The before picture is a little red because I decided to take the picture after my first session doing this.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for the past 9 days, about a tablespoon-ish twice a day, morning and right before bedtime.</li>
            <li> Use this product religiously for three weeks, I&#x27;m average weight with cellulite issues, I&#x27;m not overly at all, it did absolutely nothing to take even 10% away.</li>
            <li> When I used Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, in a few days, my skin started becoming even and firm.</li>
            <li> I have been using BodiShape for a few months now and see positive results.  </li>
            <li> Unlike earlier, I see myself much in shape when I dress myself in skin tight clothes.</li>
            <li> I basically wasted $20, because it certainly didn&#x27;t show any results after two weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> BUT when you work hard to tone and build your muscles, I do believe this cream can help to firm the skin and let the muscles shine through. :)</li>
            <li> The cream goes a long way – it does not have an over-powering scent and is actually quite light, I found it to be not too oily, and the cream is fairly thick and will go a long way.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why so many positive reviews:(</li>
            <li> The cellulite patches are much reduced now and in very less time, just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and moisturized, and possibly I see a slight reduction in cellulite.</li>
            <li> I know how refreshing it is when cold stream of water touches your bare skin.</li>
            <li> The best cream base for cellulite, it really works but you must make sure you use with a cellulite mitt, because if you don&#x27;t you won&#x27;t see results within the life of your product, unfortunately its a bit expensive for me, I will reorder soon.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but thought it was  worth a try (anything to make a slight cellulite difference right)</li>
            <li> Im not sure if I used too much</li>
            <li> not used it long enough yet</li>
            <li> She made my day when she presented me with this as a possible solution of my long problem.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this producer long enough to see any change</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference and the cream doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> For how long it should be applied daily to see results?</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cellulite cream for such a long time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results, but I will update everyone with that ASAP!</li>
            <li> ,approximately how long should the jar last and on average how long it takes to see results, If I knew this information ahead of time I may have purchased more than one jars at the discounted price.</li>
            <li> used the dry brush on the affected skin and applied the cream twice a day and have only used it for a couple weeks but boy what a difference!</li>
            <li> I use this cream twice daily and also dry brush as well.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and firm just after a week on daily use.</li>
            <li> I used one in and a half jar within the time period mentioned above and absolutely seen big improvements on my legs, stomach and hips which are now firm and contoured.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but still not as much as some other creams, and to me</li>
            <li> After using the cream my skin felt soft and tight.</li>
            <li> After a few week I could see small changes in the way the cellulite looked under my skin, becoming slightly flatter.</li>
            <li> Not a long lasting product and diffence doesn&#x27;t last a few days.</li>
            <li> Some just give up and start hiding it, and some explore what could really help us to get rid of the problem or at least minimize its results.</li>
            <li> Its not a miracle worker and you are not free and clear of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Also, this product goes a LONG way and spreads well</li>
            <li> I have minimal cellulite on my upper thighs.  </li>
            <li> Bottle was smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> This is the year that I have dreaded for so long.</li>
            <li> so a jar can go a long way.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money</li>
            <li> Received cream and it had a a strange texture, almost liquid.</li>
            <li> My cellulite is getting smoother not completely gone, but I can see some improvement.</li>
            <li> This made me to keep my shorts locked up in closets for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can imagine that the cream might work as a temporary aid for someone younger or with darker/tanned skin -- someone, that is, who has a minimal problem with visible cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Debbie Lee Wesselmannmporary aid for someone younger or with darker/tanned skin -- someone, that is, who has a minimal problem with visible cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that long-</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for as long as the Shessentials cream, but the results aren&#x27;t even close.  </li>
            <li> so a jar can go a long way.</li>
            <li> The reviews here must be written by bodishape manufacturer, friends, family or paid for because this was a complete waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously and I saw absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> but I guess the only down side I would say is that it doesnt last</li>
            <li> used the entire jar as directed and did not see any difference - found other products that worked.....</li>
            <li> If you need a little extra boost in confidence, I definitely recommend you add this to your beauty regimen!</li>
            <li> I think my extreme optimism is about the only thing that seems to be working!</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it works well and is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Stays tacky on the skin for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the tips of dry brushing and using a rebounder to stimulate the lymphatic system.</li>
            <li> After using the dry brush method mentioned in the show and then showering, I then used the cream.</li>
            <li> It helps to rub it in vigorously and let dry before putting on clothes or they will stick to you</li>
            <li> Every morning I started dry brushing before my shower and then put this lotion on after.  </li>
            <li> Have to wait to get dressed or stand in front of a fan to dry before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> I use a dry brush (you can buy them on amazon) and massage the cream in well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry well</li>
            <li> I use once a day along with dry brushing.</li>
            <li> tested this product by applying it to my left thigh and left buttocks twice a day for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My cellulite is barely noticeable now, while just doing the dry brushing alone only made a small difference.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Average moisturizing cream that did nothing for my cellulite despite application following directions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m average weight, work out regularly, and eat well.</li>
            <li> But then I used it in my loose skin areas.</li>
            <li> it looks less than the last time I used it,</li>
            <li> I even used a dry brush before use as well as exercising ,but saw absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> had ordered other anti-cellulite skin firming gels from other companies, my friends had borrowed the last bottle &amp; hadn&#x27;t returned it yet lol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My diet and workout routine is the same, but now the cellulite is less noticeable and I credit it all to Bodishape.  </li>
            <li> Which is why my 2nd bottle is half done.</li>
            <li> The plastic wrap was still around it but was it was a big goop mess in the box.  </li>
            <li> I am currently half way through this container and will definitely be replacing it once its empty.</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews I&#x27;m hopefull and with 100% money back guarantee, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend it for those who want to tighten up the belly skin or just firm up loose skin.  </li>
            <li> I believe the cream was exposed to extreme heat and caused it to break down, possibly during shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my last child when I was 34, I&#x27;ve had a little sagging in my belly.</li>
            <li> I use this on my bum and thighs when I go to the gym to give me a little extra sweat.</li>
            <li> I had this old DrScholl&#x27;s body massager that has a heat setting, that I hardly use.</li>
            <li> I had never really tried a cellulite cream before and had my doubts that it would work.  </li>
            <li> After only a few days of applying the cream my legs already looked and felt tighter.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of mine</li>
            <li> and I find it easier to apply with wet hands.</li>
            <li> I have no weight problems, I am careful with what I eat, I workout indoor and outdoor but still, my thighs have some cellulite.</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t firm your tummy</li>
            <li> Even after minimal use I&#x27;ve seen a difference- a reduction of that &amp;#34;orange peel&amp;#34; look and my skin looks smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li> so be careful on the amount you use.</li>
            <li> This cream did not give me the result for what i expected.</li>
            <li> I rubbed the massager in a circular motion for roughly 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> She walks every day, and is on her feet so much that it makes me tired just watching.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While she&#x27;s only been using this product for a few days, she immediately noticed how it reduced the appearance of her stretch marks</li>
            <li> Have not really noticed a difference, but I&#x27;ll keep using it longer and update my review</li>
            <li> I have had the signs of cellulite on the back of my thighs and butt for a few years.</li>
            <li> I will continue using mine until the jar is empty because of the moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> I will continue using mine until the jar is empty because of the moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> Therfore this product does two things: it helps reduce the appearance of cellulite while at the same time helping firm up and rejuvenate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product did not really do anything for me, and I was not trashing it, I just don&#x27;t think all products work on all people.  </li>
            <li> so I was curious how well it would work on me and to my surprise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to notice a change in the appearance of the back top part of my thighs where the cellulite is the worst, I only use it in the morning and it took a week to see a difference , I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works just as expected</li>
            <li> did not see the results I expected</li>
            <li> While her cellulite is not completely gone, her condition has improved to the point where she is not nearly as self-conscious as she was just a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge difference, yet, but there is totally a difference.</li>
            <li> Only negative is it takes long to dry before you can get dressed</li>
            <li> I applied really small amounts everyday but some reason every time I go back the next time</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> sort of like it evaporates ( I mean I do close the cap) but long story short</li>
            <li> and if you really want to get serious then try out raw vegetable juicing at home&lt;</li>
            <li> Sorry was really hoping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick and creamy, it&#x27;s on the thin lotion side.</li>
            <li> but I after I ran out i started using the other anti cellulite brand that was recommended.</li>
            <li> The cream arrived today and had leaked all over the other items in the box.  </li>
            <li> Other benefits to be added based on your feedback</li>
            <li> I would not purchase again due to the cost and smell.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this cream because i didn&#x27;t seem to see results after a week</li>
            <li> I will def continue ordering this product once my other one runs out</li>
            <li> I have been noticing the past two days that my quads don&#x27;t look as lumpy (and I was outside)!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen before with other products.  </li>
            <li> And this is coming from a person that was totally skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> articles recommended layering one cream over the other.</li>
            <li> soon bc of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical at first,</li>
            <li> I only dipped finger in and applied small amounts to my thighs because I wanted to see how it would absorb on my skin.</li>
            <li> On my 2nd jar and I am seeing small results.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money spent on the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to try an other one.</li>
            <li> With its regular use over few weeks I&#x27;ve got even, tight and toned up skin around my waist and legs.</li>
            <li> My skin became very rough and patchy.</li>
            <li> and I am glad that a horrible thing did not trouble me any longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 50, active but don&#x27;t workout.</li>
            <li> I have begun to actively work out and thrown a lot of cardio into the thigh/butt area of my body.</li>
            <li> After using this product in a few trouble spots of mine, I have noticed a definite decrease in the amount of cellulite I can see.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that the same day I left my feedback which I said was not great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only into my 3rd day of using it &amp; already I&#x27;m not happy with the medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> I think just like all other &amp;#34;GET RID&amp;#34; products not worth the money or time.</li>
            <li> so hopefully you don&#x27;t have a large area or this could get really expensive</li>
            <li> There’s a definite improvement in the firmness of my skin – it feels tighter – and my legs are beginning to show off the results of my hard work so well that for once I can’t wait for swimsuit season.</li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> until i walked past a floor-to-ceiling mirror and saw the uneven spots on the back of my thighs.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see at least a 50% reduction in cellulite in these areas.</li>
            <li> My only complaint?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I go up and down, about 1 to 2 minutes per leg.</li>
            <li> The jar says circular motion and the email said up and down.</li>
            <li> Use twice a day and rub onto skin vigorously in an up and down motion not circular motion</li>
            <li> I apply the cream and massage up and down a stated on the container.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey for such a small amount!</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve used in the past were actually a gel which was really freaking cold.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using several products but got not much of the satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> There is less than a three weeks to go before the company holiday party.</li>
            <li> less visible - cream worked well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for less than thirty days.</li>
            <li> but I did notice a slight change in my cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost quite an amount of weight over the past few years, but still struggle with dimples and minor lose skin.</li>
            <li> seeing some slightly.</li>
            <li> I had less wrinkles (when I tensed my butt)</li>
            <li> but I do see a slight difference.</li>
            <li> just less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> she has smoother skin and less cellulite.</li>
            <li> Iv noticed stretch marks faded noticeably, and the dimpling is less, And my skin just looks and feels tighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> I had a baby less then a year ago</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but WOW!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I need to use it longer but didn&#x27;t see the results expected.</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE</li>
            <li> But rather its a slow and long process.</li>
            <li> It feels tight while it&#x27;s drying on the skin.</li>
            <li> During the year of April 25th, 2010 me and my sister decided to go to a personal trainer to lose weight because doctors told us that we would not live past 30 if we continued our unhealthy eating habits that grew from when we were kids.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I will NOT buy this cream again and waste money spending $39.99 for half a jar.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic about this cream</li>
            <li> now I had a little cellulite on my legs</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to that, and to me it matters little.  </li>
            <li> I can take a little itch.</li>
            <li> started to apply the cream after I showered when my skin was still a little damp.</li>
            <li> Not a significant difference</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> and i see some but little improvement</li>
            <li> I got a little of it after my son was born.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 jars of this for my wife and after using both, she has seen little or no results.  </li>
            <li> My skin seems a little firmer</li>
            <li> so this might be a little bit of a plus.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cream a little over a week ago and I am noticing some results.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d never reach my goal of firm, tight, youthful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> My cellulite is there, but it&#x27;s not crazy bad....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy No change waste of money</li>
            <li> I was quite depressed with my uneven skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also I saw no change after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks I got rid of my cellulite patches which were not going away for months.</li>
            <li> It is much firm and the patches are dramatically reduced.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks I got rid of my cellulite patches.</li>
            <li> I was having uneven and dimpled skin around my abdomen.</li>
            <li> I cant wait what I will do in a few months.</li>
            <li> I used Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream and in a few weeks I&#x27;ve got visible improvement.</li>
            <li> It was shipped within a few days.</li>
            <li> My skin on my legs feels strengthened and firm.</li>
            <li> that I have wasted on snake oil products in spite of purported &amp;#34;5 star&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks, my legs have smoothed out.</li>
            <li> I saw results after a few time of use.</li>
            <li> So if anyone is having trouble with cellulites, I would recommend this cream without a doubt.</li>
            <li> I ordered my Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream and within a couple of weeks of application, I&#x27;ve got a firm and even skin.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks I saw improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> but I plan to continue to use it as it does firm and plump the dimpled skin</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks of application, I&#x27;ve got a firm and even skin.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money to me</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used as often as I should, but the few times I have used it, I notice the results around my wait and legs.</li>
            <li> There has been few times where I have put the cream when I work out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> After a few uses I started to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Was worried because I never know how my skin is going to take to products and this isn&#x27;t harsh at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> It can actually make it worse.</li>
            <li> It exceeded my expectation when within a couple of days those patches are reduced and my skin looks firm.</li>
            <li> but I have dealt with refund drama before and just didn&#x27;t waste my time.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend to anyone.... unless you have money to waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks on and off</li>
            <li> I have to say I have been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> Every time I put this product on dead skin would come off my body.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase this product again as I feel it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I think it is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I wasted $40 for nothing.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have a few area on my stomach that need firming.</li>
            <li> I used to hate going to the beach, I avoided wearing dresses, shorts, and essentially anything cut above the knee because I hated the way my legs looked more like a map where the roads were made entirely of cellulite lines.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream, and have noticed that my skin looks tighter and there are less signs of cellulite!  </li>
            <li> If you have embarrassing cellulite from a past unhealthy lifestyle or just from a few extra years on your body, give this cream a try!</li>
            <li> I like the feeling on no more fluffy arms.</li>
            <li> Really expensive with barely any results.</li>
            <li> Even after just a few days I have gotten results on parts of my body that even a $200 cream (which I purchased in the past) didn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Though, I am skeptical of any product that says it tones skin or removes cellulite, I have tried several with little results.</li>
            <li> You cannot go anywhere or be anround anyone for at least half andhour till the smell goes away.  </li>
            <li> There is also very little product for the price.</li>
            <li> Saw very little  improvement after 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Very little cream in this jar.</li>
            <li> I had dull, uneven and dimpled skin around my waist and legs.</li>
            <li> I work out every morning and putting this cream and it not right product as it leaves not good smell and irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I went through the entire jar and I am skeptical to buy anymore as I think in one month there would at least be a little progress made.</li>
            <li> I am not overweight but have a small amount of cellulite on my thighs and have noticed no difference after 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is working yet.&lt;br /&gt;Have  </li>
            <li> but these jars are really small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic but it does work as it should.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend noticed an increase in cellulite on her legs over the past year or so.</li>
            <li> This is a small jar in my opinion for 30.00.  </li>
            <li> Not a magic bullet,  </li>
            <li> Not sure this worked.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;d buy again because of the price,</li>
            <li> As you know, cellulite is most noticeable in the sunlight, I hated seeing my legs in shorts!</li>
            <li> May be it was expired I am not sure</li>
            <li> It SEEMS like it works for the month I&#x27;ve been using it, but since small container, i will purchase another one to see if it truly works or not.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to seeing results, as indicated but being skeptical of such products, we shall see!</li>
            <li> I applied and it left a weird granular residue.</li>
            <li> Even after using it for a while, I can see it tightening the small pockets of cellulite on my thighs, giving them a slimmer and leaner look.</li>
            <li> I bought this product feeling somewhat skeptical because I never thought a cream would actually yield results in my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bee using this product for past 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Just got this a few days ago and the tube is almost gone!</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone else had this happened to them.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re not satisfied; what did I have to lose?</li>
            <li> I have no more celluite because of this product.</li>
            <li> I just started to notice a small amount of pucked skin</li>
            <li> I was not really sure what to expect from it, as there are not a lot of studies that show that cellulite can be removed with a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I placed a small amount on my arm and waited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a normally skinny girl 5&#x27;4, 115 lbs but have ALWAYS had really bad cellulite on the backs of my thighs and butt.  </li>
            <li> I used to shy away from beach wear due to my uneven skin.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I can&#x27;t tell if this is its natural state or if it is defective, but very disappointed given the previous high ratings/reviews</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would work at the very least, a little bit.</li>
            <li> After loosing 20 pounds I could not help and notice my dimpling skin on my tights and butt cheeks still remaining no matter how hard I work out.</li>
            <li> However, one negative side effect of all that weight loss is an increase in cellulite.</li>
            <li> I never liked marks on my body parts, be it my face or any covered portion of my body.</li>
            <li> I think it is too late to return.</li>
            <li> I figured I just had to accept it and at least the rest of me looks good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You would need at least 50 bottles of this stuff to get rid of your cellulite and</li>
            <li> OH, I exercise at least 3x per week, walking, aerobics and pilates, yet I still have cellulite in my thighs.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even last a month which was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> the product and its application: The white cream has a consistency somewhere between a lotion and a thick cold cream.</li>
            <li> Cellulite build up is a common problem these days for women.</li>
            <li> I am afraid of a stronger reaction the next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her skin is tighter and cellulite is disappearing slowly.</li>
            <li> 2) put the cream on vigorously, not in circles and not like a slow massage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks slowly improving</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone having trouble with celluite!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> A very small amount</li>
            <li> very  past delivery..</li>
            <li> A very small amount</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small bottle</li>
            <li> I was very anxious to try this cream for my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I was seriously considering liposuction, so I thought I&#x27;d give bodishape a try.</li>
            <li> While we both have been exercising and trying some weight loss supplements, she&#x27;s been flat out frustrated with how hard it has been to keep her thighs</li>
            <li> With broken heart I had to change my dressing style to hide these patches.</li>
            <li> I have been secretly using my friend’s stash of the product for close to a month</li>
            <li> Based on product information it may take up to 4-6 weeks for results of decreased cellulite.</li>
            <li> but my hands get tired massaging the product on, so</li>
            <li> In two days I was confused</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s hooked on the product, since after having her baby she had quite a bit of cellulite on her stomach and thighs, but after using this product there&#x27;s a dramatic difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for beauty products, but I will not subject myself to smelling this horrible just for beauty.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> if you are skeptical I would recommend this cream for everyone.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I used it for 30 days and unfortunately did not realize any results.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> This may have worked if i used it regularly but it SMELLSS HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> Expensive product that does nothing after using it for a month.  </li>
            <li> I was sad to notice some patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work at all.  </li>
            <li> So i was skeptical about this cream..</li>
            <li> sorry looks like doesn&#x27;t work for me..</li>
            <li> NO MORE SQUISHED CAPRI SUN POUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I cannot continue the trial based on these results.</li>
            <li> It broke my heart to see her afraid to go to the beach or wear shorts.</li>
            <li> It also stinks.</li>
            <li> cream stinks and didn&#x27;t seem to do a thing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was just unfortunate that I started using this when it got cold out!  </li>
            <li> Sorry!  </li>
            <li> It smells awful (like an old lady after a gallon of gin) and it feels disgusting on your skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant  smell or feel.  </li>
            <li> The cream is way to thick and sticky and horrible to rub on.</li>
            <li> I have what I consider bad cellulite on my thighs.</li>
            <li> So I just started feeling bad about me after I entered my 40ies.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will buy another one and forget about this bad experience.</li>
            <li> cream is sticky and smells bad</li>
            <li> Nothing too bad though.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work for my cellulite - which is bad.</li>
            <li> Bad odor&lt;</li>
            <li> To my surprise I got rid of those ugly patches.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to believe me though - my husband and friends are shocked by the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fat deposition over my thighs which looks quite ugly.</li>
            <li> Did nothing and had a sickly orange smell.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I did see some improvement with this cream, but cellulite is not gone:(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I put some on and Hate the way it makes my skin feel..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it would and was shocked with the results!</li>
            <li> but I really really really hated the way my belly looked like a squeezed capri sun pouch.  </li>
            <li> I got very bad rash on my legs after using this cream..</li>
            <li> it costs &amp; isn&#x27;t priced crazy hight either!!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> Did not see any results from using this product very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The smell was horrible.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t terrible to start with, but I always wished I could just cut out that one inch of sag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t the worst</li>
            <li> But WORST of all for me, is the stickiness!</li>
            <li> It smells awful too.</li>

            <li> I used the product as directed. I am not overweight but have a small amount of cellulite on my thighs and have noticed no difference after 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic about this cream but I have to say it DOES work! I have used it for about 3 weeks and the cellulite reduction is visible skin is smoother and I feel better about myself! if you are skeptical I would recommend this cream for everyone. The texture is  thicker and absorbs instantly . I love it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I have what I consider bad cellulite on my thighs. Since using this cream I&#x27;ve noticed my thighs are a lot smoother then before. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a month now and although it&#x27;s not gone completely I&#x27;m happy with my results so far. I like the smell, it&#x27;s a fresh sent not bad. And I&#x27;m following the instructions I apply the cream twice a day in the morning and at night.  I hope this helps anyone wanting to try it. I say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have been using BodiShape for a few months now and see positive results.  I apply morning and night and find that my skin is firmer once applied.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Do no recommend. I&#x27;ve had good results with drug store Q10 lotion, but this Bodishape lotion didn&#x27;t do anything at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 weeks..No improvement at all! weeks.  This is another scam!  They are all scams!  No cream will help with cellulite!  The positive reviews comes from the company paying off people to help sell this stuff!   The ONLY benefit from this cream is that it makes your skin super soft, that it all!  Also the cream is very sticky until it is dried. Don&#x27;t get ripped off like I did!</li>
            <li> Didnt really see any results.. Sorry was really hoping!</li>
            <li> excellent results..i give 10 to this amazing product..keep up the good work</li>
            <li> I have used other brands with some success, but this is a winner</li>
            <li> It works good! My skin feels soft and firm just after a week on daily use. I apply after shower in the mornings!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of cellulite reduction creams, and I truly do believe that this one made a difference!!  The dimpling isn&#x27;t gone, but it really has improved!  I&#x27;m on my 2nd jar and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I liked this cream I feel like it had some positive smoothing effects. Plus I really liked the way it smelled, it smells clean and fresh. It also made my skin very soft and supple. I didn&#x27;t take before and after pictures after using a couple jars of this cream but I wish I had because I do think I saw positive results. I used the cream in addition to a body scrub. I had read online that drinking a good amount of water and exfoliating the problem area in addition to the cream would improve the results.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is working yet.&lt;br /&gt;Have  not used it long enough yet</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference..</li>
            <li> It has helped but not as much as I hoped</li>
            <li> This worked very well and I noticed results after 2 weeks of once/ daily use after my shower. I have also tried another comparable cream with a pump, that did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in a week.</li>
            <li> This product works, try it for a week in the morning and before bed time.</li>
            <li> I just tried this product for the first time and I am pleased with the results. Mostly using it on my arms and have seen a difference already.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference after using this for a number of weeks</li>
            <li> Thee best Cellulite cream I ever used! Have seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It helps to firmed up my arms by more than 1 inch after a weeks I using it. I like the feeling on no more fluffy arms.</li>
            <li> This def. did not make any difference for my cellulite. For the price this product is def. not worth it.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this awesome product is that it smells terrific and very high end - herbal and fresh, kind of like an Aveda product. Also, this product goes a LONG way and spreads well so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to cover an area. The texture is somewhere between a gel and a lotion. It&#x27;s not thick and creamy, it&#x27;s on the thin lotion side. It&#x27;s not sticky at all, it absorbed really well into my skin. I noticed that my skin is a little more perky after using this on my cellulite areas. I would be happy even without the without any cellulite benefits because it smells SO GOOD! I&#x27;m so glad I got the opportunity to receive this product in exchange for my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is the best cellulite cream ever.  I love this product. ...</li>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t work at all.. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything it claimed to do.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  I used it before my husband came home and he loved the way my skin looked and felt.  I&#x27;m 5’5 and 135, I don&#x27;t have a ton of cellulites but I do see a difference.</li>
            <li> This is very good product! I ordered this and coming really fast. Nice product and great vendor!</li>
            <li> I have minimal cellulite on my upper thighs.  It seems more noticeable when I put on an extra pound or two.  I had never really tried a cellulite cream before and had my doubts that it would work.  After only about a week of applications as the container states, I did notice my cellulite was pretty much gone. I could feel a cooling sensation when applied and for about 2 or 3 minutes after application. The only thing I didn&#x27;t really care for is the scent.  It had sort of a minty citrus scent and it was very strong.  I could do without the scent</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy No change waste of money</li>
            <li> This product did arrive on time...I did notice some positive changes while using the product.  However, laziness took over and now I periodically use it.  There are no positive changes due to my own actions.  You must use the product continuously and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I did notice a nice look to my skin since using this cream.  I was surprised.</li>
            <li> I am posting a comment because one of the staff members asked me to, not only through email but also called me last night to give me a 50% off coupon to do so, which I haven&#x27;t seem yet. Anyway, I have ordered 2 of these. I honestly don&#x27;t see a difference. I&#x27;m sure it takes time but these jars are really small and it&#x27;s expensive. There appears to be better products out there at a better price according to the reviews. I will not be buying this product again. I will be trying others.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even notice a difference. And it didn&#x27;t soak into my skin that well, it created a film over my skin everytime I put it on too.</li>
            <li> I see a bit of an improvement on my legs. I like to use this on days I am going to the beach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been always very conscious about my inner health and outer appearance and I&#x27;ve always preferred healthy foods. For couple of months, due to extra work pressure in my assignments I overlooked these habits and noticed that I&#x27;ve developed many cellulite patches on my body. I started exercising more, but it didn&#x27;t go away. Then I came to know about this product through a friend. I used it and I got the desired results in couple of weeks. This indeed gave me results what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was quite depressed with my uneven skin. I had to disregard my favorite beach wear, but not anymore. Even since I&#x27;ve started using Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, I&#x27;ve found smoother and glowing skin. It&#x27;s becoming better and better day by day. It softens my skin, allows it to grow and maintain its firmness. I love the way it works and will continue to use this great product!</li>
            <li> I was exited about this cream since I&#x27;m on a body transformation journey. After loosing 20 pounds I could not help and notice my dimpling skin on my tights and butt cheeks still remaining no matter how hard I work out. Anyway I got the cream and I must say that the bottle is really tiny and finishes really fast. I applied really small amounts everyday but some reason every time I go back the next time it looks less than the last time I used it, sort of like it evaporates ( I mean I do close the cap) but long story short I honestly did not notice any results but the cream does have a smoothing effect that makes your skin look and feel nice and firm but to me is just that a &amp;#34;temporary effect&amp;#34; more than anything. I like the smell and after you  apply it you feel a cooling sensation that makes you think its really working. By the way the company called me and offered a 50% discount if I wrote a review which I thought it was ok since they did not say &amp;#34;write a good review&amp;#34; they just say write one so that is what I&#x27;m doing (no wonder there is so many, but as I said they not asking for a positive review I guess they just want to sort of survey results I don&#x27;t know whatever!!)  . With that said I will be trying another bottle and hope that this time I see better results. I just wish the bottle was bigger for the price. Wish me luck !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to get rid of my cellulite but after what seemed like a lifetime of exercise and family remedies, nothing worked. I decided to try Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream and although I was sceptical at first, it really did the trick! The cream itself actually has a faint pleasant smell and not a stinging odour like the other creams that I&#x27;ve tried. After only a few days of applying the cream my legs already looked and felt tighter. A couple more days later and my legs looked nice and toned and the cellulite was completely gone! I finally found the solution to my cellulite problem and I am sticking with it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product twice because it seems to evaporate in the jar very fast. I even used a dry brush before use as well as exercising ,but saw absolutely no results. I really wanted it to work, but it did not.</li>
            <li> For years I’ve been trying one thing after another – creams, gels, firming clothing – and none of those have ever given me results like those I’ve had with Bodishape. I used to hate going to the beach, I avoided wearing dresses, shorts, and essentially anything cut above the knee because I hated the way my legs looked more like a map where the roads were made entirely of cellulite lines. Despite a drastic overhaul of my eating-habits and the addition of a cardio and muscle-based training, nothing could get rid of the patches and lines. I decided to try Bodishape as sort of my last shot. The cream goes a long way – it does not have an over-powering scent and is actually quite light, I found it to be not too oily, and the cream is fairly thick and will go a long way. I wish I found it sooner. After applying the cream at morning and at night every day for an entire month, the appearance of cellulite lines have weakened tremendously. There’s a definite improvement in the firmness of my skin – it feels tighter – and my legs are beginning to show off the results of my hard work so well that for once I can’t wait for swimsuit season.</li>
            <li> Even if I used it, I still looking for a miracle</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I got the jitters from the caffeine in the product. Also I saw no change after using it for a few weeks. Wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> Received this free for a review, I have been using this for about a week and unless my eyes are deceiving me this is working.  I have been using on my thighs and have seen a reduction in cellulite. I am not heavy set but have put on some weight as I have gotten older so cellulite has appeared goes on very nicely if you follow the instructions and rub it in the way the directions explain you can actually feel it working.  I will continue to use this product and add to this as I go along. Thank you so far I am liking this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product only once. The smell was horrible. I had to get a shower to wash it off. Even then the smell still lingered. I&#x27;m all for beauty products, but I will not subject myself to smelling this horrible just for beauty.</li>
            <li> Well, it happened...it was a 90+ degree weekend, everyone wore shorts during the annual festival-fair.&lt;br /&gt;I wore shorts too...until i walked past a floor-to-ceiling mirror and saw the uneven spots on the back of my thighs. OMG.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yea, i changed in to capri pants ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;WHO would want ripple-y patches of cellulite to show? I admit most of us desire to look our best for various reasons.&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered other anti-cellulite skin firming gels from other companies, my friends had borrowed the last bottle &amp; hadn&#x27;t returned it yet lol.&lt;br /&gt;So i surfed and found this slimming contour cream for firmer skin and cellulite reduction from Bodishape.&lt;br /&gt;They have the sweetest sales people on their staff. The jar arrived, the shrink wrap was easy to tear off i didn&#x27;t have to fight it.&lt;br /&gt;A pure white color, cool scent. I dip 3 finger tips into the cream and massage the cream in to the areas on legs which need help.&lt;br /&gt;As my weight comes off it didn&#x27;t come off evenly everywhere so this cream helps as an addition to yoga/walking after work for toning.&lt;br /&gt;It dries well &amp; absorbs quickly. No greasy feeling. A cool smoothness once areas are massaged dry.&lt;br /&gt;(IF you are highly sensitive to scents as I am, then use this cream on your legs/torso/arms but not on your face).&lt;br /&gt;Had the scent been just a wee bit softer i would&#x27;ve given this cream 4 or 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I bought this thinking it would work at the very least, a little bit. But after 4 weeks - I don&#x27;t see even one ounce of change in my cellulite, despite using it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go somewhere  else with your money. This was a total waste of mine</li>
            <li> this did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This is a fact that most of us, at some time or the other face body changes. Some just give up and start hiding it, and some explore what could really help us to get rid of the problem or at least minimize its results. I explored when I faced cellulite dimples and found this product worth. It is best quality product in this price range. Now when I&#x27;ve conquered my problem, I feel better about myself. I just love this product for what it does.</li>
            <li> Really expensive with barely any results.</li>
            <li> I liked. It i felt it helped with some of my shedding weight including breastfeeding and waist training but I after I ran out i started using the other anti cellulite brand that was recommended. May have to try this product again though.</li>
            <li> So I just started feeling bad about me after I entered my 40ies.&lt;br /&gt;I got some cellulite patches on my face. My husband bought me this product and it has worked as a charm for me.&lt;br /&gt;Now my skin feels tighter and my patches are also gone.&lt;br /&gt;Hail Bodishape and its makers.</li>
            <li> After much of a tussle I found this product which turned out to be the best skin firming product I&#x27;ve used so far. It really works. Within a few weeks I got rid of my cellulite patches which were not going away for months. It&#x27;s a good skin improvement product.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t personally used it, but a friend of mine has.  Her results were pretty good.  She&#x27;s hooked on the product, since after having her baby she had quite a bit of cellulite on her stomach and thighs, but after using this product there&#x27;s a dramatic difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking of ordering one for myself as well.  After reading the positive reviews I&#x27;m hopefull and with 100% money back guarantee, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> So far I have lost 70lbs, and I intend to keep going! However, one negative side effect of all that weight loss is an increase in cellulite.  I bought this product on recommendation of a friend and absolutely love it! I have seen a decrease in the dips on my thighs. I have even used it on my stomach although with not as much success on my thighs. This product has become a must have in my fitness regime.</li>
            <li> My fiance has been using it for 3 weeks and she told me she has been seeing results. Her skin is tighter and cellulite is disappearing slowly. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I noticed dimples in my thighs around March of 2013. I looked for reviews on the internet of different body shaper creams. I noticed great reviews on Bodishape, and decided to buy it. I have been using it for six months, and it has gotten rid of the celluite (dimples)!!! I recommend this product to anyone having trouble with celluite!!</li>
            <li> I have always been a big believer in body firming creams and so I was delighted when one of my friends put a package together from Bodishape for my birthday. The cream leaves my skin feeling silk like and absorbs nice and quickly unlike other creams I have tried. It is also lightly scented which I prefer as I do not like creams or lotions that try to compete with my perfume. I am looking forward to a cellulite free summer body. So far so good!!</li>
            <li> I got this wonderful product as a gift from my dear sister. She was aware that I am trying to deal with cellulite patches but not found a solution yet. She made my day when she presented me with this as a possible solution of my long problem. I started using it regularly and within a month my skin looks much better than before. It is much firm and the patches are dramatically reduced. I feel great about this product and would recommend to everyone who needs such a product for their skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any kind of change..nothing</li>
            <li> I am no longer young and &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34;, but I wasn&#x27;t sure quite what to expect from this product.  I purchased a cellulite body roller, and decided to purchase a cellulite cream as well to work with this.  I have only used this product and the cream for about two weeks - but in that time I can tell a difference.  I cannot swear that the cellulite has improved, but my skin is much more supple and soft.  I am very well pleased with both the massage kit and the cream.  I believe using the combination has indeed made a difference.  Another positive, my skin actually feels better after using this product.  The massagers are easy to clean and are easy to hold on to when you are using them.  I used both on my lower extremities and arms.  I recommend this cream easily and plan to continue to use. I only wish it had a lighter smell, but that could easily be my sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Needs to be returned ASAP. Did nothing and had a sickly orange smell. Yuck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this worked but I only used one bottle and it was sporadically.  I think it is guaranteed but I didn&#x27;t followup with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 2days and I&#x27;m not so sure about is function and effect. But so far so good.</li>
            <li> After much of a struggle I found this product which gave me satisfactory results. It really works. Within a few weeks I got rid of my cellulite patches. Now I feel great about it.</li>
            <li> I had many cellulite patches and these were growing day by day. I was tired of using several products but got not much of the satisfactory results.This problem seemed to be never ending but with Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, I conquered it within weeks. The patches are gone and new patches are also not formulated as my skin remains hydrated and toned up. This is wonderful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.  if I used it twice a day it might work better.</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of rose petals or something floral.  It was the first thing I noticed when I opened the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a sample of the product to test and review.  After the first application (and the second and third) I experienced sneezing and itchiness in my sinuses which I attribute to the scents used.  After three attempts, I decided not to continue with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company and they were great with getting back to me and stated that this was a first.  Just sharing my experiences.</li>
            <li> My skin became very rough and patchy. I had to find a good product for myself. I found Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, and I am very happy with the fabulous results. My skin has become smooth and the patches are decreased. I thank Bodishape, it saved me.</li>
            <li> I used to love my shorts and they used to suit my long legs too. Some time back I developed cellulite patches around my thighs which were the cause of my worries. I searched on web and found Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream. It started showing results in days and the patches are reduced to a great extent. My legs looks toned up and I just enjoy the freedom to wear my beloved shorts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to purchase my second jar...my belly is getting tighter but with any of these products you have to exercise and change your life style...I use it on my arms and inner thighs those results are slower than my belly...oh the cream runs out quickly...but it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my mom, and these are the comments she gave me after using this for 3 weeks. It&#x27;s not magic but it does work as it should. Her cellulite patches are looking better and she said she will be buy another jar because she is convinced that it&#x27;s going to keep on improving with more application.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I am quite the skeptic when it comes to firming creams.  Whether it is for the face or the body, nothing seems to tighten or tone… Until this.  I am not claiming that it is a “miracle cream,” but it has most certainly done the trick for me.  I put it on every night before going to sleep, making sure it was all over the upper thighs and bum, then shower in the morning.  Much to my surprise, my sheets and clothing weren’t stained at all.  It’s lightweight consistency made it perfect to use at night.  I wouldn’t have even had to shower in the morning for the sole reason of washing off the cream.  After only a couple of applications I started to see a difference.  The dimples in my thighs were fading and everything just seemed a lot tighter, especially my bum.  It was just unfortunate that I started using this when it got cold out!  I could really use some short-shorts weather now!</li>
            <li> With time, I developed cellulite patches on my thighs. I tried several products but in vain. With broken heart I had to change my dressing style to hide these patches. One day I took this product to just give it a try. To my surprise I got rid of those ugly patches. I thank Bodishape. Now I am wearing my favourite dresses which I had to ignore over couple of years. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I did not like the fact that I was developing thigh dimples. A friend suggested me Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, and I thought I would give it a try. It just worked fine for me. Now I enjoy a much firm and even looking skin. I feel young.</li>
            <li> I had dull, uneven and dimpled skin around my waist and legs. When I used Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, I got even, smooth and firm skin. Unlike earlier, I see myself much in shape when I dress myself in skin tight clothes. I love to be in shape and have a younger skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it at all. Don&#x27;t not see a different  the same.not good</li>
            <li> Even after just a few days I have gotten results on parts of my body that even a $200 cream (which I purchased in the past) didn&#x27;t do. I am amazed. The cream has a pleasant and discrete smell, it is not greasy and does the job it advertise doing. I am 72 years old and in good shape for my age. The skin however is the biggest problem of aging. If it works for me it must do a great job for younger persons. I highly recommend the cream.</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t work, the seller gave me a full refund as promised (without return shipping the empty jar).  I&#x27;m giving it four stars since the seller stayed true to the promise so we can try it risk free like advertised and the packaging is good.  The jar is solid so it does not let light through, and it has a double lid to keep the air tight seal when you close it, which are both important for a product containing Retinol (avoid light exposure and minimize oxidation).</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and haven&#x27;t saw any change yet but I can say the feeling an smell of it is amazing... Gives a soothing cool sense i love that part...</li>
            <li> I am in sales and in business you need to look your best.. When you are confident enough that you look good, you feel good and you are sure to mark a good impression. I noticed some rising patches on my skin. Thankfully my friend made me aware about Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream. When I used it I got some nice results. Appearance of those patches is much reduced now and my skin looks toned up. It raised my confidence level.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants firm, flawless and glowing skin. I was having some patches over my skin and I was looking for a good product. I found Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream. In around 1 month I&#x27;ve found a flawless and firm skin. The cream is absorbed completely in the skin and makes it smooth. I apply it daily. This is worth using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like our prayers have been answered ladies! Finally something that works without being too greasy or leaving stains on your clothes. It&#x27;s mildly scented as compared to those other \\&quot;promising\\&quot; creams which are heavily perfumed and ends up giving you a headache more than anything else. Works like a charm and bends into the skin well. Your skin will feel tighter and smoother! I know there are many skeptics out there but the best part is that it comes with a 100% money back guarantee, so it&#x27;s a win-win for all.</li>
            <li> There is less than a three weeks to go before the company holiday party. I have been secretly using my friend’s stash of the product for close to a month and I can tell you that this works. Every time I leave the house, a new compliment comes my way. This year will be the best Christmas ever, because I will receive the greatest gift ever, confidence! Thank you Cellulite!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend noticed an increase in cellulite on her legs over the past year or so. It broke my heart to see her afraid to go to the beach or wear shorts. I came across Bodishape and bought it for her hoping that it would help her increase her confidence. She’s been using it about two weeks now, and we can both definitely tell a difference. While her cellulite is not completely gone, her condition has improved to the point where she is not nearly as self-conscious as she was just a few weeks ago. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> After my first child birth, I discovered these cellulite on my upper leg. During pregnancy, I took great care for my body but could not understand how these appeared on my leg. I never liked marks on my body parts, be it my face or any covered portion of my body. Seeing these marks, I was very worried. One of my friends had tried this product and recommended it; she said that it worked great on cellulite reduction. And true, I tried it and it did wonders. This cream reduces the appearance of cellulites by acting on the fat cells. My skin became smooth and brighter in no time. Use it yourself to know the difference.</li>
            <li> This is not quite the bikini season however anyone who is concerned with cellulite will agree with me it&#x27;s not only the warm weather season when this issue bother us all... The cream has smoothed my skin and the dimples on my thighs became less visible - cream worked well, I used it on my thighs and buttock and my skin now feels firmer and I will stick to the regime applying it daily after the shower with hopes of even better results.</li>
            <li> Helping Cellulite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great cream, comes in a very convenient size. It has helped a lot since purchase and would recommend it to others who deal with cellulite. It has a money back guarantee so I wasn’t worried about it not being effective. I have seen why it is so highly valued and that is because it works. There has been no negative side effects as of yet. Great buy.</li>
            <li> it worked very fast, i dont have a big cellulite problem though</li>
            <li> I was not looking for a miracle but looking for an item to help minimize the appearance of my cellulite on my things. I used the product three weeks straight and did not notice any difference at all. I was hoping for a product that would even temporarily reduce the look but it did nothing. There is also very little product for the price. It smells like a tanning lotion you would use in a tanning bed so if you enjoy that then you will like it. I however, did not think it smelled pleasant at all. Still on the hunt for a good product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this product from BodiShape. All their products work beautifully and that is the important thing. I have only started using this product a couple of days ago but I just had to write a review on how my skin is already tightening up and I can already tell a difference in the appearance of cellulite. You have a customer for life.</li>
            <li> WORKING GOOD. FEEL MY SKIN SMOOTH. THE BODISHAPE CELLULITE CREAM REALLY WORKING FOR ME.  THANKS. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS  FREE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Being young, I didn&#x27;t think I would have cellulite, however I recently have noticed the cellulite in my thighs. I began to exercise more, and eating healthier, but it would not go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to research, I read the reviews, and chose Bodishape because it got some good reviews and the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;I have so far had great success with the cream, and have seen a difference. I do recommend Bodishape. I am glad I found a brand that will be able to help me with my cellulite in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this product will buy again</li>
            <li> I see no results with this product although used consistant for 30 days. I think just like all other &amp;#34;GET RID&amp;#34; products not worth the money or time.</li>
            <li> It got away those bumps that running couldn&#x27;t! Didn&#x27;t think it would and was shocked with the results! Worth the money</li>
            <li> The cream arrived today and had leaked all over the other items in the box.  The plastic wrap was still around it but was it was a big goop mess in the box.  Hoping to return it,  still would like to try the cream though.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for 4 weeks and do like the cream which has produced some smoothing and I will be purchasing again and have entered the the Exclusive Bodishape VIP Review Club! and I am looking forward to notification as to when it starts which will be when they reach 500 entries..

            <li> Bottle was smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as it claims, the jar should come in auch larger container to give consumer more time to use for possible results</li>
            <li> I am giving this product a two star because it did soften my skin, however I didn&#x27;t buy it for softer skin, I bought it treat my cellulite, which it did not do, surprise... Cellulite is still there. I will not purchase it again. $40 is pretty steep for soft skin that a $3 bottle of lotion could do.</li>
            <li> I figuerd I&#x27;d try it based on the Amazon reviews, but I didn&#x27;t thi nk this stuff did anything at all.  My cellulite is there, but it&#x27;s not crazy bad....I dunno.  Wish it did something but didnt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for less than thirty days. I don&#x27;t see any changes yet. It&#x27;s a bit sticky and I find it easier to apply with wet hands. I&#x27;ve also tried the tips of dry brushing and using a rebounder to stimulate the lymphatic system. I suspect I will have to reorder before I see any results.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Great product,it did work.&lt;br /&gt;I  recommend that others give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sheryl Hebert Wise&lt;br /&gt;,,</li>
            <li> My use of the product did not yield any results.  I followed the instructions, but the cellulite remained!  I had high hopes, but this product fell short of my expectations.  The Scent was about the best part.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this producer long enough to see any change but I will update my review if I do! On the other hand, smells great and it&#x27;s a great lotion.</li>
            <li> I have had cellulite on my thighs and buttocks since I was 12 years old.  I&#x27;m 4&#x27;11&amp;#34; and weigh 105 pounds and still have cellulite. I have been considering liposuction because I have tried many creams over the years (I&#x27;m 43) but thought I&#x27;d give it one more try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my last child when I was 34, I&#x27;ve had a little sagging in my belly. Thought, what the heck I&#x27;ll try it on my belly too.  My thighs are firmer (not as much jiggle) and maybe a little less appearance of the cellulite after 3 weeks, but I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my belly.  The sag is GONE!!  It wasn&#x27;t terrible to start with, but I always wished I could just cut out that one inch of sag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it for those who want to tighten up the belly skin or just firm up loose skin.  Not a miracle for cellulite, but if you&#x27;re not overweight you might notice a difference. I&#x27;m planning on buying another jar.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Wish I found out about this cream earlier. I will be ordering from you all some more in the near future.</li>
            <li> This is a small jar in my opinion for 30.00.  It has a really strong smell.  You cannot go anywhere or be anround anyone for at least half andhour till the smell goes away.  If you are using it on your legs it does not go far.  I would not purchase again due to the cost and smell.  May work for you if you can handle those two things.  I personally cant stand the smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted a smooth and shiny skin but I was having cellulite patches and with time these were increasing. I didn&#x27;t lose hope and searched on net. I got this product and used it religiously each day. Within 2 months I am getting wonderful results. My skin is now becoming smooth and even. I like this very much.</li>
            <li> I was having uneven and dimpled skin around my abdomen. When I used Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, in a few days, my skin started becoming even and firm. It has also improved the overall shape of my legs. I like this change in me; it&#x27;s a perfect solution for my skin problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the inside of my arms and thighs. It&#x27;s been about 1 month of use now and if seems like my arms are getting smoother. I cant wait what I will do in a few months. Thank you so much for this great product. Roberta Z.</li>
            <li> I have no weight problems, I am careful with what I eat, I workout indoor and outdoor but still, my thighs have some cellulite. I&#x27;ve been using Bodishape Cream for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve to say that I&#x27;ve see NO results. It softens my skin but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a good product, however in that case I really feel like I lost my money especially that I had the chance to use cheaper creams that were more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry. I will buy another one and forget about this bad experience.</li>
            <li> I love this!  It definitely isn&#x27;t a quick miracle cream, but combined with exercise and changes to my diet it has worked wonders.  I am a normally skinny girl 5&#x27;4, 115 lbs but have ALWAYS had really bad cellulite on the backs of my thighs and butt.  I ordered this cream and started using it immediately.  I love it.  It has a light scent that I enjoy and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I use this on my bum and thighs when I go to the gym to give me a little extra sweat. I have to admit that it&#x27;s really  good at warming things up because I really feel extra hot on the areas I put it on during my work out. I love it.</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t firm your tummy but I did notice a slight change in my cellulite.  Ive been using it for a month now I had a little cellulite on my legs, I workout regularly and it was getting better with the exercise but wanted to try this, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try. It comes on smoothly yet it takes a while to dry completely.  I dont think it does miracles but it probably helps a bit.</li>
            <li> This cream has a good fragrance and does make my skin feel smooth.  I would like to think that things are smoothing out, but it&#x27;s too soon to really tell.  However, I am going to continue using it.</li>
            <li> This is the year that I have dreaded for so long. After spending several years cultivating and over indulging my rotund belly, I received an invitation to my High school reunion. Cellulite was recommended along with a rigorous workout routine. Even though, I missed a large number of workouts, I made it a priority to take my Cellulite supplement. I look and feel so much better than I could have imagined and I owe it all to Cellulite.</li>
            <li> One of my fellow peers has recommended me this product and I am delighted! Bodishape Cellulite Reduction cream is superb because it tightened, firmed, and toned the appearance of my skin. The cream spreads like butter, but it is not greasy at all, it absorbs quickly and beautifully, and has a nice scent to it. After using the product for some time now, I noticed a smoother, firmer complexion on my thighs. A great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost quite an amount of weight over the past few years, but still struggle with dimples and minor lose skin. Though, I am skeptical of any product that says it tones skin or removes cellulite, I have tried several with little results. HOWEVER, after using one tube of this, it does indeed seem that my skin is tighter and smoother (used on arms and upper legs). I&#x27;ve purchased again, and hopefully will continue to see results. No cream is a miracle cream. BUT when you work hard to tone and build your muscles, I do believe this cream can help to firm the skin and let the muscles shine through. :)</li>
            <li> It was $34.95 but they&#x27;re milking the Dr. Oz thing for all it&#x27;s worth. This product isn&#x27;t any better than other products you can find for $29.95. Same key ingredients-caffeine and retinol.</li>
            <li> A week now &amp; I think I can see an improvement! Absorbs completely with light scent. I&#x27;ve been using on my thighs &amp; think this will last several weeks to a month (4ounce container). A big plus is that it is Paraben Free!</li>
            <li> I could be imagining it, but it seems to really make my legs look better!</li>
            <li> Effective and priced competitively.  It is creamy and fragrant and absorbed immediately. Truly a lovely product.</li>
            <li> cream works wonders in firming and tightening! seller was super nice too and followed up! still using to determine results in cellulite reduction. seeing some slightly. will deff recommend!👍</li>
            <li> I bought this product together with BodiSure Cellulite Massager (also sold on Amazon) and have been incredibly impressed with the effectiveness of these 2 products.  While the massager on it&#x27;s own is heavenly, adding this cream to it made it that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this cream is fantastic and the texture rich.  It goes on smoothly and feels luxurious.  Does it make my cellulite disappear?  I can&#x27;t attest to that, and to me it matters little.  I make this a part of my daily routine to feel and look better, and to make sure I take care of myself in a way I deserve.  It is a perfect treatment after a hard work out at the gym and one that makes me feel energetic, vibrant and even a little more sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great cellulite cream that I love to pamper myself with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE : Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products by Bodishape and they&#x27;ve all been amazing so I thought I would give their cellulite cream a try. I&#x27;m so glad that I tried it! I caught the Dr Oz show that reviewed the benefits of using a cream like this and I&#x27;ve been interested ever since. This version by Bodishape has been great. Even after minimal use I&#x27;ve seen a difference- a reduction of that &amp;#34;orange peel&amp;#34; look and my skin looks smoother and firmer. Plus I have sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had any skin reactions from it. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how my skin looks after extended use. Thanks for a great product again Bodishape!</li>
            <li> Being very skinny and a distance runner, I could never understand why I still had cellulite on my legs. This cream has worked wonders. The cellulite is still there, but reduced to the point of feeling confident about my legs for the first time in forever! .... And I honestly was so surprised. This company is awesome, they emailed me about the shipping and if I had received my package as well as tips on how to use it. Definitely will be repurchasing !</li>
            <li> It smells good, and it feels like it&#x27;s doing &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; - but spendy stuff. Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost. It&#x27;s definitely better than the other stuff, where you&#x27;re supposed to use saran wrap and a heating pad (WHAT?!?).</li>
            <li> Saw very little  improvement after 4 weeks.  Used all the guidelines recommended by the company. Not a magic bullet,  but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Smells good...made my skin soft but it didn&#x27;t feel tingly. My stomach does look firmer though. I exercise and eat somewhat healthy and that helps. Ran out of it pretty quickly and I ordered something else that supposedly has heat instead.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this cream because i didn&#x27;t seem to see results after a week BUT if your patient and consistent you WILL see results!! I never had cellulite before and now that i&#x27;m almost 30 it&#x27;s all starting to fall apart ufff LOL i contacted the seller and said the product I got looked like it was missing a good inch from when I opened and she sent me another cream FREE right away! I will def continue ordering this product once my other one runs out and I am hoping they will start a membership program so I can get points and use them towards it LOL I also NEVER write reviews but felt that since this seller took such great care of me I should return the favor :) thank you julie!!</li>
            <li> I chose to give this porduct a 5 star rating because I had a considerable amount of cellulite and was training for a show in which I would wear a bikini on stage.  This product along with proper nutrition and exercise worked wonders for me.  Not an ounce of cellulite and I will order some more prior to my next show.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference and the cream doesn&#x27;t last long. Maybe if I had purchased another two or three I might notice a change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely dealt with the cellulite issue since I was a teen and this product did show improvement after about 10 days. I would recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> awesome product. a bit stinky but i dont mind cause it works!</li>
            <li> Great product! I already see results.</li>
            <li> Not sure this worked.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, but after a few days of using it, I broke out in little bumps. I think it is too late to return. I also did not see any results, but to be fair, I did only use it a few days...</li>
            <li> I got this hoping it worked, but expecting it not to, but I&#x27;d try anyways. Sure, Dr. Oz recommends the ingredients (not this product) but does this actually have any of the ingredients? Is it in the right amounts?... Well, this stuff actually works!! I&#x27;m thin and in great shape, but of &amp;#34;that certain age&amp;#34; where my upper arms under sides and arm pit area (front and back) have cellulite. They kind of look like a stocking filled with dried beans and I refuse to wear sleeves during a hot southern summer. I figured I just had to accept it and at least the rest of me looks good.&lt;br /&gt;I used the dry brush on the affected skin and applied the cream twice a day and have only used it for a couple weeks but boy what a difference! Even in broad daylight.&lt;br /&gt;For once I&#x27;m Happily surprised with a product and I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
            <li> This cream is good for refreshing other than that didn&#x27;t do anything I bought two I finishes both with no results I do work out and drink plenty water but didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these now, my boyfriend can tell a difference but I can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve also been exercising regularly, have a cellulite brush/massager and coffee ground bar soap.</li>
            <li> It had a nice smell and went on the skin very easily without feeling greasy! Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey for such a small amount!</li>
            <li> I got very bad rash on my legs after using this cream..</li>
            <li> I love this cream I definitely see a difference. Has to order some more.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  I used it for 30 days and unfortunately did not realize any results. The cream had an odd smell but that was easy to get over. . I really wanted to get results from this product however I did not notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It really works if you are exercising, and eating healthy!</li>
            <li> meet my expectations and more would buy again</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I have had a problem with cellulite for years. I found this product to be nice smelling and very creamy when I put it on. I have started to notice some results already. I love this product and the way it is working. Would highly recommend this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but I lost about 15 lbs. and that helped better than any cellulite cream I have ever used.....</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Average moisturizing cream that did nothing for my cellulite despite application following directions; smell is almost intolerable. Hope to get a refund.</li>
            <li> I used 1 bottle in 1 week and got no results. I brought another bottle hoping for results and still no change. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Use this product religiously for three weeks, I&#x27;m average weight with cellulite issues, I&#x27;m not overly at all, it did absolutely nothing to take even 10% away. Wish I could get my refund but I Went through the jar. I&#x27;m going to stop buying cellulite creams for now Stick to the essential oils instead</li>
            <li> The best cream base for cellulite, it really works but you must make sure you use with a cellulite mitt, because if you don&#x27;t you won&#x27;t see results within the life of your product, unfortunately its a bit expensive for me, I will reorder soon.</li>
            <li> saw a slight improvement but the smell is really potent, not a terrible smell just weird</li>
            <li> Seams to be working as it should. Has a pleasant smell, and does not leave a greasy after-feel. I have begun to notice that my skin is smoothing and tightening up.</li>
            <li> This may have worked if i used it regularly but it SMELLSS HORRIBLE and it is super sticky. I couldnt deal</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t  use it until now but i hope it help my body slim</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference on my skin. I do not have much cellulite , but wanted to just  work on what I have. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.........formula apparently changed.  Would leave zero stars if that was an option.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work,&lt;br /&gt;I thought that this would work for me but, it didn&#x27;t and it does not have enough for two weeks, it just almost enough for one week. It did have no result with me...</li>
            <li> You would need at least 50 bottles of this stuff to get rid of your cellulite and&lt;br /&gt;even then I don&#x27;t think it would get rid of it, maybe diminish it, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;The only way to get rid of cellulite is with laser treatment in a professional&lt;br /&gt;medical office.</li>
            <li> It did not do what it said it would do.  I am very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any product to try to get rid of cellulite. After watching the Dr. Oz episode that aired earlier this year about getting rid of cellulite, I came onto here to find a cream with caffeine and retinol in it. After using the dry brush method mentioned in the show and then showering, I then used the cream. After a few week I could see small changes in the way the cellulite looked under my skin, becoming slightly flatter. After using the cream my skin felt soft and tight. Planning on buying one more jar to see if I get any more improvements.</li>
            <li> Runs out quickly.  Saw no results.  Would have preferred a pump instead of dipping my hand and scooping it out.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> pleasant light scent, takes a while to absorb but it really surprised me how much it helps.  I&#x27;m also very sensitive to products so was thrilled this was good for me.&lt;br /&gt;DE&lt;br /&gt;New Hampshire</li>
            <li> Why do we do this to ourselves? only diet and exersize solve this problem, I should know better.  it&#x27;s a nice lotion but thats not why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Expensive product that does nothing after using it for a month.  Received the product and it came half filled. Not sure where the good ratings are coming from.  I feel deceived.</li>
            <li> Smells good. And worked good on my butt and thighs. I had less wrinkles (when I tensed my butt) which was nice. Really silky lotion so be careful on the amount you use. A little goes a long way. Not sure if I&#x27;d buy again because of the price, but it&#x27;s been good use.. Maybe I would buybagain someday, lol.</li>
            <li> I observed cellulite dimples in my arms and thighs which were not going away even after exhaustive exercise. A friend suggested me this product and I thought I would give it a try. With the help of Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, I&#x27;ve been able to reduce those cellulite patches. This product is simply best in Quality at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Save your money. Says a money back guarantee but more of a hassle to return it than to keep it.  Didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
            <li> Feels nice on skin but did not see any significant results.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I like the way it smells and it seems to work.</li>
            <li> I have looking for a Celluite cream for a while but I didn&#x27;t know which one and then I saw the reviews for this one and I can tell you I LOVE it! It not only works but the smell is great. The texture of the product goes on smoothly and use as direct and it will work! Also the shipping was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to ordering again.</li>
            <li> It was very upsetting when I realized I was developing cellulite patches. My skin was losing up its firmness.I used Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream and in a few weeks I&#x27;ve got visible improvement.My skin is much even and firm now and I am glad that a horrible thing did not trouble me any longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks now and this is the first cellulite product that has ever worked for me and i&#x27;ve tried a lot!!!! It was shipped within a few days. It is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or sticky. My skin on my legs feels strengthened and firm. I can&#x27;t wait for summer to start showing off my legs again.</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon and it&#x27;s just what I wanted to use for my skin. The smooth cream blends into the skin well, with Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream my body has changed in the appearance the most thing that I ve seen over the last 4 weeks is the fine patches on my legs start to improve and my skin is more silky to the touch. I would tell my friends to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Review: I had many years trying to find good cellulite reduction cream for my body, after using BODY SHAPE cellulite reduction cream now I can judge it helps me to get slim appearance again!</li>
            <li> Cannot say that it made all that difference.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have seen results in as little as one week.  It also smells great, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> can not wait to see if i get results</li>
            <li> I am not prone to endorsing any health &amp; beauty aid product, but this is an exception. I&#x27;m almost 50, active but don&#x27;t workout. I eat in moderation with the occasional splurge of bread and/or cheese. I saw a similar product on yes, Dr. Oz recently. I have been using this cream for the past 9 days, about a tablespoon-ish twice a day, morning and right before bedtime. I am using it in my tummy and thigh areas. I can definitely see at least a 50% reduction in cellulite in these areas. . .and it&#x27;s only been 9 days! I can&#x27;t begin to total up the money in just the last 5 years alone that I have wasted on snake oil products in spite of purported &amp;#34;5 star&amp;#34; reviews. I am not a skin professional, doctor or Bodishape employee. I am just a 50- year old career mother of two young adult daughters wanting to take care of what was given to me. And of all the hundreds of beauty products I&#x27;ve tried and in some cases, still use, this is by far, the best product with the most visible results. My only complaint? In 9 days, I had to re-order already. $4 a day? I guess it&#x27;s more cost-effective and perhaps safer than plastic surgery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe in miracle creams but this stuff works. I don&#x27;t have much body fat per se. However, I did have the the dreaded lumps on the topr of my legs. After using this for a few weeks, my legs have smoothed out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar and I see some great results.  As you know, cellulite is most noticeable in the sunlight, I hated seeing my legs in shorts! I have been noticing the past two days that my quads don&#x27;t look as lumpy (and I was outside)!  Prior to buying bodishape, I was doing two leg workouts a week, running 15 miles a week, and watching my calorie intake, all to no avail. I was seriously considering liposuction, so I thought I&#x27;d give bodishape a try. I am petite (under 5&#x27;, weigh 112 lbs) and in my mid 40&#x27;s.  My diet and workout routine is the same, but now the cellulite is less noticeable and I credit it all to Bodishape.  Now, I wear shorts and am much more confident.     I didn&#x27;t receive the tips from bodishape until two weeks later. Here are the tips if anyone purchases Bodishape, so you can implement them right away:  1) use a natural body brush to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; the cellulite. I go up and down, about 1 to 2 minutes per leg. I bought a pedicure brush that has the natural bristles.  2) put the cream on vigorously, not in circles and not like a slow massage.  3) drink 64 oz. of water, add citrus juice. I use DoTerra essential oils (slim &amp; sassy or lemon)  4) use it twice a day.    This is a great cream for women who have tried  everything else.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> For how long it should be applied daily to see results?</li>
            <li> Almost every woman has them and of those, all of you want them gone. I will not say that this cream will give you baby like skin again, let us face it, pass a certain age and that thought is history. But, we can still have beautiful skin by how we take care of ourselves. I will say that I have seen a difference by using Bodi Shape. A smoother looking skin in areas that I have applied it. Naturally everyone is different and you have to be your own judge. But, it doesn’t hurt to give it a try. A very small amount so a jar can go a long way.</li>
            <li> You must use quite a bit of the product to actually get any coverage so for the cost it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream has been by far the best product for cellulite reduction. I saw results after a few time of use. This is a great product if it worked for me it sure will work for every person who uses it.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing.I am very self conscious of my body and when I saw that I had cellulites on the upper bottom part of my thighs, I rushed to a computer to figure out how to get rid of it. I tried many things. I tried local creams and also tried to increase the muscle in the area by working out; didn&#x27;t seem to work. My friend recommended me this cream, but by this time I gave up on trying creams. Since nothing was working, I decided to give it  try. It was the best thing I could have tried, this cream showed improvements on my skin and I was able to see the difference. The fat in the area was starting to disappear, I was so glad that my friend recommended me this. So if anyone is having trouble with cellulites, I would recommend this cream without a doubt.</li>
            <li> At this point I have not seen results</li>
            <li> Great Product! will order again</li>
            <li> This cream did not give me the result for what i expected.</li>
            <li> I looove it! ..the best cellulite cream ever!</li>
            <li> Another product like many of the others out there. Tried because of all the great reviews - how can so many people give it a positive review - it must work... right? Nope - there is nothing that works and 80% of woman have cellulite. I&#x27;m going to save my money for a new pair of running shoes:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product once a day for 3 weeks, on my thighs, massaging, for over 15 minutes and sometimes brushing thighs after application.  I have yet to see any results.  I have 1/3 of the jar left.  Of course my plan is to continue the process until the jar is empty, but really.  I was under the impression results would be seen by now.  OH, I exercise at least 3x per week, walking, aerobics and pilates, yet I still have cellulite in my thighs.</li>
            <li> I didt feel like this worked and I would prefer a pump instead because I used way too much too quickly</li>
            <li> Did not see any results from using this product very disappointed. would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Happy Happy Happy Happy! I&#x27;ve always heard that there is nothing you can do for cellulite short of lipo.  Well, let me be the first to say that THIS has helped my cellulite.  I used this on my outer thighs daily and I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 weeks now and I SEE RESULTS.  I took before and after picture just so I could see a side by side comparison for myself and I definitely see a BIG difference.  I wore a bathing suit WITHOUT a wrap for the first time in years!  I am so ecstatic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said I used this daily, I used the BodiSure Cellulite Massager in the shower to prepare for the cream.  I rubbed the massager in a circular motion for roughly 2-3 minutes. After drying off I rubbed this cream into my skin in a circular motion as well.  And that&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I didn&#x27;t see results, as a matter of fact my 9 year old made it a point to tell me daily that it wasn&#x27;t working!  Well around the 4 week mark I saw a difference - even my daughter said WOW it&#x27;s working! At the 6 week mark it was a huge difference to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture is before (on the left) and after (on the right).  The before picture is a little red because I decided to take the picture after my first session doing this.  I honestly don&#x27;t know how they did it, and I&#x27;m big on researching ingredients and I see there are tons of ingredients in this that are known to help with cellulite. My cellulite isn&#x27;t completely gone, but I do love what I see so far!  I definitely feel more confident wearing shorts and swimsuits than I have in years!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the link for the BodiSure Cellulite Massager:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/BodiSure-Cellulite-Massager-Circulation-Abrasions/dp/B00P8P0KVQ/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_194_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1WFC238FYAPM3JJHTSV0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only fear is I don&#x27;t know if the cellulite will come back if I stop using it!  Hopefully the results are permanent, but I plan on keeping this up!</li>
            <li> Buy it! I&#x27;ve used sooooo many creams and this one by far is the best one! A little goes a long way which I love. I also enjoy the light minty scent. Other creams have a strong odor, but this one doesn&#x27;t. Rubs in really well too!! As for how well it works I&#x27;ve noticed a difference already and I&#x27;ve been using it about two weeks. It leaves you feeling firmer right after which I love. It&#x27;s a right away confidence boost :-)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at me at all. I work out every morning and putting this cream and it not right product as it leaves not good smell and irritates my skin. May be it was expired I am not sure</li>
            <li> not so sure it&#x27;s working. 2nd bottle, massaging and exercising is essential to get the maximum result</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it doing anything for me as others claimed.</li>
            <li> Did not do want it claimed</li>
            <li> “It is tingly and has a minty fragrance. I have been using it nearly every day, and I do see a difference in the appearance of dimples on my outer thigh area. If I could excericse, I am sure the combo would be perfect and I would be cellulite free! Very fast Delivery”</li>
            <li> The direction on the jar contradicted the followup 6 step directions via the email a week later A pamphlet would have been helpful to accompany the jar. The jar says circular motion and the email said up and down. Would like to have additional information regarding how much to use with each application,approximately how long should the jar last and on average how long it takes to see results, If I knew this information ahead of time I may have purchased more than one jars at the discounted price.</li>
            <li> Not a lot in the bottle but I do see a slight difference. I would recommend but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have for sure noticed a difference,  in the belly area, the skin is definitely tighter and the cellulite has faded a bit, I would purchase again</li>
            <li> used the entire jar as directed and did not see any difference - found other products that worked.....this did not.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Complete waste of money</li>
            <li> It SEEMS like it works for the month I&#x27;ve been using it, but since small container, i will purchase another one to see if it truly works or not.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife who has reached her middle ages incredibly gracefully, but is struggling with keeping her legs toned no matter what she does.  She walks every day, and is on her feet so much that it makes me tired just watching.  While we both have been exercising and trying some weight loss supplements, she&#x27;s been flat out frustrated with how hard it has been to keep her thighs toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she&#x27;s only been using this product for a few days, she immediately noticed how it reduced the appearance of her stretch marks and I, too, could also tell quite a bit of difference.  While she definitely thinks that she&#x27;s noticing some loss of the fat around her legs, it&#x27;s probably too soon to really tell so we&#x27;ll try and update this review as her use continues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, we are both very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this product from BodiShape. All their products work beautifully and that is the important thing. I have only started using this product a couple of days ago but I just had to write a review on how my skin is already tightening up and I can already tell a difference in the appearance of cellulite. You have a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I am in my teens. During a sport meet, one of my friends made me aware about my thigh dimples which I was ignoring otherwise. I felt embarrassed but as a true friend she also suggested a possible solution. I ordered my Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream and within a couple of weeks of application, I&#x27;ve got a firm and even skin. It&#x27;s really a nice experience.</li>
            <li> I was horrified to see my thigh dimples. I searched on net and found Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Creamwhich is very popular and comes in reasonable price. Within a few weeks I saw improvement in my skin. I feel great about it.</li>
            <li> I just recently received this product, and haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give it a full review.</li>
            <li> I really must say, this is magic in a jar!  After 3 weeks, I can TRULY, HONESTLY, tell a difference in the firmness, and tightness of my legs.  The difference is truly amazing!  This cream is light and very easy to use, there is no offensive scent.  It is just easy to use, with amazing results!  Go ahead, try it....you&#x27;ll be glad you did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bodishape Cellulite Creme provided for free by JDT International.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks now. Have not really noticed a difference, but I&#x27;ll keep using it longer and update my review</li>
            <li> Seeing some improvement. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see full results.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something to tighten up those saggy areas on my legs and under arms and decided to try this because of all of the positive reviews. Boy am I glad I did! In no time at all I could really see and feel the positive results of this product. I just applied it as directed and avoid salty foods and I am very happy with what I am seeing and will continue to use Bodishape. Oh, and it smells so wonderful too!</li>
            <li> After 1 week of doing this twice a day I can totally see a difference. It&#x27;s not a huge difference, yet, but there is totally a difference. The smell of it could be a little better, it&#x27;s not horrible, but could be a little better but since I am fortunate enough to be trying this product for free and am seeing results within 1 week, the smell is nothing!! I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> it looks like my skin appearances were improved. Maybe cellulite was reduced.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to buy it again.</li>
            <li> i love this cream!....shipping was fast and I&#x27;ve seen results within a week!....try it....trust me u will love it</li>
            <li> I used it on vacation and liked the way It smoothed the concerned areas. I need to used it a few more times before giving it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product to others.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product based on other reviews of noticing good results. I have been applying it twice daily under both arms and tricep areas, for about 10 days and not yet seen an improvement for myself. Based on product information it may take up to 4-6 weeks for results of decreased cellulite.The semi-liquid cream has a light chemical odor which dissipates after a few minutes. I am looking forward to seeing results, as indicated but being skeptical of such products, we shall see!</li>
            <li> I have used 2 jars of BodiShape Cellulite cream and I saw and felt a softness and tightness I haven&#x27;t seen before with other products.  It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant  smell or feel.  It helps to rub it in vigorously and let dry before putting on clothes or they will stick to you but I plan to continue to use it as it does firm and plump the dimpled skin and  that makes me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> I like the way the product feels like it is doing something when I apply it even though, I still have the cellulite. I guess I would have seen results by now if I would have known these following six tips I should have been doing along with using the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Eat less processed foods and more alkaline produce too&lt;br /&gt;2. Ensure you keep hydrated and flush your system with filtered water with lemon juices and if you really want to get serious then try out raw vegetable juicing at home&lt;br /&gt;3. Restrict your salt intake and only use seasalt where possible&lt;br /&gt;4. Use a skin brush in the shower on target areas&lt;br /&gt;5. Use twice a day and rub onto skin vigorously in an up and down motion not circular motion&lt;br /&gt;6. Find a weekly exercise regime that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product DOES NOT work by itself as I originally thought, oh well......</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying two jars, and I may even purchase a third. I found that it did reduce the amount if cellulite and firmed the skin but the cellulite is not gone.</li>
            <li> Saw far it seems to work.</li>
            <li> First time buying with seller!!! Everything on time and as described!”</li>
            <li> Works great!! Saw results in just one day!!!</li>
            <li> I received my order May 13th and used the recommended amount on my upper thigh only.  Seems to be working but m already out.  It didn&#x27;t even last a month which was disappointing.  If the jar would of lasted a month I would be able to see the long term effect. Five stars for product 3 stars for the quantity.</li>
            <li> I started to use this product as soon as i recvd it.  I have let my roommate try it as well and we are in awe. Its not a miracle worker and you are not free and clear of cellulite. But you will notice the difference once you start using it. Im excited to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I used to shy away from beach wear due to my uneven skin. When I ordered my 1st box of Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, I had a mixed feeling. I wondered whether it will work or not. Within a couple of weeks of application, I&#x27;ve got a firm and even skin. I recommend this for better skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not seen any results and I&#x27;m very discouraged by this. The cream is way to thick and sticky and horrible to rub on.</li>
            <li> It’s a common desire to have healthy skin. When I noticed some cellulite patches growing over my skin I started looking for the cause and cure. I found Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream. The cellulite patches are much reduced now and in very less time, just 2 weeks. Bodishape is worth using for even and firm skin.</li>
            <li> When I read about Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream, I wanted to use it. I’ve got my order today. I’ve got timely delivery and it is in good packaging condition. I am starting it today and I am very enthusiastic to use it. Let’s see how it works out for me.</li>
            <li> I have a small bit of cellulite on the backs of my thighs, and no amount of healthy eating, maintaining a normal weight, or exercising seems to get rid of it. I was willing to give this cream a try because I&#x27;ve never tried a cellulite cream before. I already do most of the things that are recommended in the literature that came with the cream (drink lots of water with lemon, avoid processed foods, try to keep your body pH alkaline, restrict salt, exfoliate in the shower) although I haven&#x27;t ever done a colonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for almost a month now, and have decent results. My skin is very soft and moisturized, and possibly I see a slight reduction in cellulite. I believe my skin surface is firmer, and being plumped by the cream has reduced the visibility of the cellulite. Has it gotten rid of my cellulite? No, it&#x27;s still there, just less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the cream itself - it goes on nicely and absorbs quickly. It doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable scent once it&#x27;s applied. It also doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing or cause me to perspire. I&#x27;ll continue using it until it&#x27;s gone, but probably for the amount of difference it&#x27;s made in my cellulite I won&#x27;t replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a complimentary sample of BodiShape Cellulite Reduction cream in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I am finally booty-licious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been so dedicated to my Gym workout - keeping a healthy organic, whole foods diet.  I limit my sodium, and I have been so diligent in making sure I get all the necessary vitamins and minerals daily.  When I got to my goal weight, I was saddened to still see cellulite on my upper thighs and legs.  I felt like I&#x27;d have to do squats for the rest of my life before I&#x27;d see any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever made this Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream - must be a Wizard!  This is a perfect formula.  Not only has my cellulite disappeared - my rear looks like it&#x27;s 21 years old again.  You don&#x27;t have to believe me though - my husband and friends are shocked by the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy - I thought I&#x27;d never reach my goal of firm, tight, youthful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much, to the magic man/woman who made this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was a bit overweight for many years. During the year of April 25th, 2010 me and my sister decided to go to a personal trainer to lose weight because doctors told us that we would not live past 30 if we continued our unhealthy eating habits that grew from when we were kids. I am now in shape and feeling healthier than ever and my sister the same.&lt;br /&gt;During the weight loss period though, I had quite a bit of cellulite and would use the Bodishape Cellulite Reduction cream as I was losing the weight and it really helped me have tighter skin. Now, I can look in the mirror and feel as good as I look thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I have not seen or notice anything</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any results</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good as long as you follow instructions. Excercise helps too.</li>
            <li> Did not see any changes</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! Results are immediate, soft, fresh minty scent. Will continue using.</li>
            <li> I waited for over a month to do this review, so that it would be a fair review. This product absolutely did nothing for my cellulite. I still have the same amount of cellulite on my thighs and butt that I originally had before I started using this cream. This Bodishape cream may have worked for others, but nothing at all for me. I used as directed and sometimes a little more to see if that would help, but I got nothing. I did feel the tingling feeling that others talked about but no results that I could visually see. Bodishape is not for me and I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> After using this product, I&#x27;m seeing my belly firmer, I&#x27;m planning buying a 2nd jar.  I felt I have a little sagging  skin on my belly, after loosing 15 pounds, now it got better.</li>
            <li> Received cream and it had a a strange texture, almost liquid. I applied and it left a weird granular residue. I believe the cream was exposed to extreme heat and caused it to break down, possibly during shipping. Needless to say I can&#x27;t tell if this is its natural state or if it is defective, but very disappointed given the previous high ratings/reviews</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all.. after I used it for 3 weeks, and doing exercises, I didn&#x27;t see any results .. Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Product worked as described, wife have brought more then one unit without any problems. Stretch mark nearly visible. I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Best cellulite cream I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> Just started using this product to early to tell if it is working yet. Will order more.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much of a change.  Every morning I started dry brushing before my shower and then put this lotion on after.  The lotion was a bit sticky so putting on my jeans was a challenge. I really had to wait awhile for it to dry good.  Overall I didn&#x27;t see much change in my cellulite.  Maybe it takes longer than a month.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I need to use it longer but didn&#x27;t see the results expected. I understand it will not get rid of cellulite but definitely wanted to see some results.</li>
            <li> Works so well!! Remember to rub vigorously back and forth. NOT in circular motions. Also. WORK OUT! Squats and deadlifts and your best friend. No product is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> after using a full jar of this cream, which wasn&#x27;t even completely full...I saw ZERO results. And that was with a change in diet and exercise. It was a waste of money to me and I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Ok ladies and gents this cream really works.  It doesn&#x27;t happen over night but after two months you definitely notice results.  I was fortunate to receive two jars as a gift from my sister and two that I had previously purchased.  I used one in and a half jar within the time period mentioned above and absolutely seen big improvements on my legs, stomach and hips which are now firm and contoured.  I give this cream a 10 rating in my book. And this is coming from a person that was totally skeptical at first.  I highly recommend this cream, it works.</li>
            <li> burned me and did nothing</li>
            <li> I used two times， I felt it had the some feeling with Clarins‘ cream， and from now I did not see any change....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best cellulite product that I have purchase</li>
            <li> Not a long lasting product and diffence doesn&#x27;t last a few days.</li>
            <li> great supplier and great product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really worked. I used the whole thing as directed and didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells great, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I had this item since the  September 16,2014. I have already noticed were my love handles were it&#x27;s tightened up. It looks really good. I&#x27;m still working on the front belly but it&#x27;s only been 3 days. It will make you itch you have to fight the urge to scratch yourself. I&#x27;m really happy with the cream so I may keep purchasing it. I can take a little itch.</li>
            <li> I explored web when I was fed up of cellulite dimples. This product is really worth. With its regular use over few weeks I&#x27;ve got even, tight and toned up skin around my waist and legs. Now, I am much more confident about myself. I just love this product for what it does.</li>
            <li> I have had the signs of cellulite on the back of my thighs and butt for a few years. When before it did not really bother me, I feel I have a new perspective in life where I want to try to keep my body as great as it can be. I have begun to actively work out and thrown a lot of cardio into the thigh/butt area of my body. However, I began to realize that I needed a bit more help to really get the results I desired. Bodishape has been that “bit more help” that I have needed to really shape this area. Even after using it for a while, I can see it tightening the small pockets of cellulite on my thighs, giving them a slimmer and leaner look.</li>
            <li> A month ago, I was on a mission to rid myself of cellulite once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;I started doing some research on different cellulite reduction methods including ingredients to look for in creams, application methods and potential lifestyle changes I would have to make in order to get the results I wanted... heres my journey ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From everything I read, caffeine creams and retinol creams are both proven methods to reduce cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;Many articles recommended layering one cream over the other. The BodiShape cream included both Retinol AND Caffeine which was great because I could skip layering two creams and just stick to one, so I decided to order it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here were my first impressions... The packaging is identical to the product photos seen on the product page. I personally thought it was kind of pretty and sleek compared to the eye sore squeeze bottles, so that was a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a minty scent which is probably from the peppermint oil that was listed in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the cream itself is smooth. Some \\&quot;creams\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used in the past were actually a gel which was really freaking cold. This wasn&#x27;t a gel and I didn&#x27;t feel like i was literally freezing my butt off so that was another bonus for me personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to apply the cream after I showered when my skin was still a little damp. For optimal absorption, its best to apply creams after showering. the heat from the shower hydrates your skin which assists it in absorbing the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the Retinol working more and more as it dries which gives a tightening sensation. Retinol boosts collagen production and strengthens collagen fibers which firms the area. The caffeine works to stimulate the area and increases circulation which shrinks fat cells.&lt;br /&gt;The two ingredients combined help to strengthen and flatten out the area which gets rid of the cellulite \\&quot;lumps and bumps.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the cream on its own, I started to notice a difference within the first 7 days which was a bit unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;I just became even more motivated from there. I added body brushing in an upward motion before showering to my \\&quot;get rid of cellulite regimen.\\&quot; The body brush works to smooth out the fat cells. I also increased my water intake (supposedly 8-10 glasses a day is best.) I can&#x27;t possibly drink that much water, but I&#x27;ve definitely been more mindful and am drinking more water than I ever have. drinking water combined with eating fruits and vegetables that contain more water (ex: melons, celery, leafy greens...etc) keep you hydrated and provide nutrients that assist the creams in strengthening and rebuilding the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been around 20 days and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference. Aside from one pesky dimple that just won&#x27;t quit, most of the cellulite has diminished dramatically and my skin continues to improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BodiShape cream on its own made a visible difference, so even if you&#x27;re not looking to go the crazy extra mile like I did after the first two weeks, you should still see results. They have a 100% satisfaction policy so you really have noting to lose, but theres a lot to gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck on your own journey ; )&lt;br /&gt;-Andy</li>
            <li> I did not see any results . Save your money</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvements</li>
            <li> Works great and easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I seen some improvement.  You must use it daily.  Results work better if you continue to hydrate your skin and do not take hot showers.</li>
            <li> Yes it works!!!! Yea!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this product three weeks ago and after using it every day I have noticed a difference in my thighs! The cream smells great and I look forward to putting it on my skin every day. I use it mostly on my thighs but have started to use it on my tummy as well as I have noticed a difference on my thighs and have faith that it will work on my tummy as well. I have recommended this product to all of my girlfriends. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but WOW!! This product really does work!! I recommend it 110%!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> It may have helped a lot, but not enough to spend $80/month.  The jar only lasted two weeks.  Used it before and while going to the beach with a special massage brush.  Not a significant difference</li>
            <li> This product worked well at reducing the appearance of my stretch marks. After having 2 kids, I wanted to reduce the appearance of my stretch marks as much as possible, and this product was the only product that proved effective in minimizing them. It also made my skin feel very soft and smooth. This product also comes with a 100% Money Back Guarantee if you aren’t satisfied. Remember, no product out there can remove cellulite completely, but this product comes as close to it as you can get.</li>
            <li> I bought this product feeling somewhat skeptical because I never thought a cream would actually yield results in my cellulite. Not only have I seen visible change in cellulite, but my legs feel smoother and my tummy feels flatter! I have been using this product every day for almost a month and it has now become an essential to my beauty routine. If you need a little extra boost in confidence, I definitely recommend you add this to your beauty regimen!</li>
            <li> This cream made me break out in a huge rash and I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin. It also stinks. I&#x27;m going to try a different cream that is more natural that Dr Oz recommended.</li>
            <li> Just paid $20 for this and now it&#x27;s more than double the price. What gives? I basically wasted $20, because it certainly didn&#x27;t show any results after two weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> Not what it all cracked up to be! Would not recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the second type of cellulite cream I have tried. I do not like this product! Stays tacky on the skin for a very long time. Have to wait to get dressed or stand in front of a fan to dry before getting dressed. I will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot rave about this product any more! I started seeing a noticeable difference in my cellulite after ONE use! Anyone who&#x27;s been battling cellulite knows that that is amazing in itself.  I&#x27;m never going to use anything else to treat cellulite and I&#x27;ve recommending it to everyone I can think of</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month now, twice a day, morning and night and I have yet to see a change... I will keep using it until it is all gone and hope there is some change by then</li>
            <li> This product got many good reviews so I was quite excited to try it. I used it for a month and followed the instructions exactly without any results at all. I went through the entire jar and I am skeptical to buy anymore as I think in one month there would at least be a little progress made. Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> This really seems to work</li>
            <li> After using this product in a few trouble spots of mine, I have noticed a definite decrease in the amount of cellulite I can see. Wish I would have known about this sooner! Now I can go to the beach without feeling so self conscious. I was able to get this free through a promo, but I will be recommending this cream to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Love this amazing body cream!!  It is by far the best one I have purchased thus far!!  Worth every $ it costs &amp; isn&#x27;t priced crazy hight either!!</li>
            <li> cream is sticky and smells bad</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with how this cream works. I asked my dermatologist if any anti-cellulite creams were worth investing in. He said that the ones with retinol and caffeine can improve the superficial appearance of the skin when used regularly. The effects go away when you stop the cream--which is clear when you read the body shape product description, I don&#x27;t think they are trying to scam anyone. I haven&#x27;t been quite as regular using it as I should and I can still see and feel that the skin on my tummy (four babies later) is more firm and visibly there is less &amp;#34;wrinkled&amp;#34; or cellulite look.  I already exercise and eat well, this is a nice extra bit of improvement. The product does have a scent that is on the strong side, so I don&#x27;t think putting it on right before bed every night is terribly appealing, I tend to put it on a few hours before so I don&#x27;t smell like medicated cream. I would recommend this product, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Great cream....seems to have made a difference.  Still early in the process.</li>
            <li> I honestly have seen a difference. I just purchased my second jar. I use this cream twice daily and also dry brush as well. I am very hopeful with second jar to see even more results. I like that it doesnt burn or tingle. It keeps skin soft and smells very nice. The company is also very professional and concerned that you enjoyed and saw results. They are a great company and their customer service was outstanding. I finally feel like a company cares about their customer with them. Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it. Continued use is key and also try drinking lots of water to keep skin well hydrated and plump!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cream for about a month,my skin looks firmer and the cellulite aspect it&#x27;s reduced:)</li>
            <li> Potent is right, because this cream helped my wife get rid of the slight cellulite on her legs in less than a month. She applies it every night and morning and it shows great results! I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s completely gone just yet but it made such a big difference that she is confident it will be completely smooth by the time the jar runs out. I would definitely recommend this to any woman who wants to get rid of their cellulite</li>
            <li> Great cream for cellulite and dimples. Goes on very easily and smoothly, and is quickly absorbed. The back of my thighs have appeared firmed, smoother, and overall not as blemished as they were before. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and it has worked wonders for my cellulite dimples.</li>
            <li> Ordered this twice. Both times I ordered two bottles so I could use both day and evening for over 2 months!  Did absolutely nothing.  What a waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> I used it all over my body at first. But then I used it in my loose skin areas.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used as often as I should, but the few times I have used it, I notice the results around my wait and legs. I haven&#x27;t measured myself, but I can tell with the my pants; they are a bit looser. There has been few times where I have put the cream when I work out. This definitely helps even more. Can&#x27;t wait to see more results.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cream to all of my friends.and family</li>
            <li> Product actually works better than I thought.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. I  noticed immediate results and trust me it was right on time for my trip to Vegas. I was using one of the other ones right before I started this one in which it took about 1-2weeks to notice results where as this was immediate I guess because of the tightening effect. Pricey however and you only get 4 oz so hopefully you don&#x27;t have a large area or this could get really expensive</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results with this product.  I feel it&#x27;s pretty much just a sham.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Works good. Not a miracle creme</li>
            <li> Because I’m 100% satisfied with the results! I’ve tried creams that were quadruple the price of BodiShape with no results. Who would have thought that the answer to eliminating unattractive cellulite would be so affordable! I purchased this cream about four weeks ago and began using it immediately. Unlike many firming agents I have tried, this cream smells lovely and rubs into your skin. It doesn’t leave you oily either. Within the first 7 days, I began to see results. My thighs appear smoother instead of dimply. I haven’t felt so confident in my swimming suit in years! At my aqua-aerobics class, younger women are asking how my legs are so firm and smooth! If you have embarrassing cellulite from a past unhealthy lifestyle or just from a few extra years on your body, give this cream a try! It’s worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream on my legs for a couple of weeks now and I’ve been seeing great results! It definitely reduced the cellulite on my thighs and legs and I feel much more confident wearing shorts and dresses. My legs and thighs are tight and it absolutely feels better. The cream is very easy to use. Pleasant smell so it won’t bother you when you use it. I highly recommend this product to everyone who wants to get rid of their cellulite.</li>
            <li> My cellulite is getting smoother not completely gone, but I can see some improvement. I&#x27;m big on massages but my hands get tired massaging the product on, so I had this old DrScholl&#x27;s body massager that has a heat setting, that I hardly use. So I figure why not use it with the cream. And it&#x27;s working great! I apply the cream on &amp; rub vigorously + the massaging &amp; heat action. I also transferred the cream into an airless pump bottle (that I purchased at Sephora in a set), so I can control how much I apply (2 pumps each leg) &amp; it keeps it fresh longer.  I apply AM &amp; PM so hopefully my legs will be shorts ready for the summer :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is also great they really stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do nothing to my cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money...</li>
            <li> This cream is great! No only does it have the cellulite reducing properties, but I love the skin firming effect it has for those areas that didn&#x27;t rebound as well after pregnancy. I definitely recommend this cream to anyone looking to smooth AND firm skin!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! My skin looks and feels more firm. I use on my thighs, butt, stomach and arms. I follow all the instructions, i.e, drink lots of water, try to eat healthy, use twice a day, etc  I am on my 4th jar and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> After a few uses I started to see a difference. I hope to see even more results soon!</li>
            <li> No visible difference and very sticky, can&#x27;t wear anything for hours after putting it on.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife, she says it works and I notice it too. she has smoother skin and less cellulite.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it! It came in a great packaging and actually showed up earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Still waiting on my results, it hasn&#x27;t been 30 days yet.</li>
            <li> I did combine healthy eating, exercises and the cream. Works perfect to me!</li>
            <li> Iv been using this product for close to 4 weeks now, I use it with a cellulite brush. It&#x27;s done great things! Which is why my 2nd bottle is half done. Iv noticed stretch marks faded noticeably, and the dimpling is less, And my skin just looks and feels tighter and smoother. I always take a hot shower and apricot scrub the areas I plan on applying this cream too, to help open the pores. And it&#x27;s definitely tingly when you put it on. But hey I know it&#x27;s working! Thanks for this product! And your customer service is amazing! 5stars just for that!</li>
            <li> I have been using Cellulite Cream for a while, along with a cellulite brush on various parts of my body. I have noticed a difference on my stomach.  It&#x27;s easy to use and the smell is not offensive.</li>
            <li> I have only tried it for two weeks and i see some but little improvement</li>
            <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;Went on smooth, not sticky at all&lt;br /&gt;Well absorbed.  Nice smell.  I just need a bigger jar of it!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using it for a month every day, sometimes twice a day. No result at all. Real wasting of money. Don&#x27;t understand why so many positive reviews:(</li>
            <li> Save your money, I did not see any improvement</li>
            <li> Very good product!!! I have tried MANY cellulite products and this by far is the greatest. In just 2 weeks I was already seeing results in my thighs. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product!  I come home from the gym and take a bath.  I scrub my skin in the area I  which I plan to apply the cream. I apply the cream and massage up and down a stated on the container.  I also use a skin brush to stimulate the blood flow in the area I apply the cream. I love this product and it helps to have a great diet and eat clean while using the product.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 jars of this cream. It did not help my cellulite. Also, I used the cream 2 times a day and I ran out of the cream within 2 weeks. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used ONCE, and saw an immediate difference. Maybe my only problem was the poor circulation associated with Cellulite, but was super impressed..</li>
            <li> Better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. Works enough to notice. It&#x27;s temporary, but hey if it makes you feel more confident, why not?  Update: packaging has changed. No inner lid means this stuff gets everywhere when you use it. Subtracting a star.</li>
            <li> This is the best producție That I have ever used for cellulite</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!!!  I have ordered this product numerous times.. It have reduce my cellulite tremendously..I got a little of it after my son was born.</li>
            <li> o.k, shipping time great</li>
            <li> I actually believe that this cream has made a difference!  It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but It can be a bit sticky, so less works better.  The shipping was fast and the company seems like they are genuinely interested in you being satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and I love it. Is the first product that has ever work for me I totally recomended.</li>
            <li> I can get rid most of my cellulite in 2 bottles and my skin is tighther. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream and I do feel it tightens my skin and helps with my cellulite.  At first I wasn&#x27;t convinced and my supply ran out.  As days went by without applying I noticed my skin was not as firm and more dimply.  I reordered and I was pleased with the results.  It is a daily commitment for best results.</li>
            <li> I, like many other mothers, have a little lower belly pooch. I also am an avid athlete and eat very well. I was hoping to find something that would help me out in this area but this didn&#x27;t do anything for me. No tightening, no firming, nada. And for the price…I regret making this purchase.</li>
            <li> very  past delivery..i like  that</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it works great, makes my legs look more toned. Now just imagine if I worked out..</li>
            <li> Good.  Gives temporary result as manufacturer states.</li>
            <li> Loving this. Was worried because I never know how my skin is going to take to products and this isn&#x27;t harsh at all.  My skin is def looking better already.  Recieved to review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bee using this product for past 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen no result. I&#x27;m not an overweight person and I&#x27;ve been using cellulite cream foe quite sometimes. There are much much better products in the market.</li>
            <li> Works well on upper arms.</li>
            <li> Over time, I realised that despite of regular exercise I&#x27;ve fat deposition over my thighs which looks quite ugly. This made me to keep my shorts locked up in closets for a long time. I&#x27;ve used several products but couldn&#x27;t get satisfaction. This one is different. It does what it claims. In couple of weeks I found a new me. It really boosts up my confidence when I wear clothes which I really want.</li>
            <li> Even when I was a skinny teenager and young adult, I had cellulite on my thighs and buttocks, and it&#x27;s only gotten more unsightly as I&#x27;ve aged. This cream promises to \\&quot;get rid of cellulite\\&quot; in the title of this product page, but does not promise anything more than firming and reducing the appearance of cellulite on the jar itself. This is because only plastic surgery can accomplish that. I knew this going in, so my expectations were lower than perhaps others landing on this page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product by applying it to my left thigh and left buttocks twice a day for a few weeks. I intentionally did not touch my right side with the cream (or any creams or lotions, for that matter) so that I could judge the effectiveness of the product. Since diet, water intake, activity, caffeine consumption, and fat percentage can also affect the appearance of cellulite, I wanted a control side for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, my profile: I have a normal BMI, right in the middle of the range for my height. I am active, exercising most days by either walking, doing a treadmill workout, or playing tennis. I also consume caffeine in the first half of the day and drink plenty of water during the day. My diet is high in lean protein and vegetables. All of these things should result in cellulite reduction, yet I have it, as do all the women in my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the product and its application: The white cream has a consistency somewhere between a lotion and a thick cold cream. I used it generously, and it left a white layer that I had to massage into the skin for several minutes before it was absorbed enough for me to get dressed. Even though I have skin sensitivities to certain beauty products, I had no adverse reactions. I also didn&#x27;t feel any tingling or tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, the results: My left side doesn&#x27;t look any better than my right side, although the skin on the left is decidedly softer and more supple. I can imagine that the cream might work as a temporary aid for someone younger or with darker/tanned skin -- someone, that is, who has a minimal problem with visible cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product three stars instead of one because it is a good moisturizer and general skin conditioner. As with many cellulite reduction creams, this one contains caffeine, but also vitamin A, vitamin E, and a bunch of other ingredients, many from plants. (I love that the first ingredient is \\&quot;aqua (deionized water).\\&quot; It has a light, barely detectable scent. The company does offer a 100% money back guarantee which suggests to me that it must work for some people, just not me. I will continue using mine until the jar is empty because of the moisturizing properties. If I ever notice a difference in cellulite, I&#x27;ll update my review. (Note: I received a sample for review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmannmporary aid for someone younger or with darker/tanned skin -- someone, that is, who has a minimal problem with visible cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product three stars instead of one because it is a good moisturizer and general skin conditioner.

            <li> cream stinks and didn&#x27;t seem to do a thing.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 months and I didn&#x27;t see any deference, doesn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Amazing results after a short time! Highly recommend you try!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why is so popular</li>
            <li> It smells like medicine, but it&#x27;s not bad. I did feel a little bit effect when I first use it. But I guess I need to resist to use it to see the major effect. Over all, it is a great product, worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. I am hopeful I&#x27;ll see a change soon bc of the other reviews. PS for the women saying they were considering lipo for cellulite reduction....lipo does not reduce cellulite. It can actually make it worse. Lipo is for body contouring.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improve at all.</li>
            <li> I carefully read the instructions and followed them exactly. I used the product for 4 weeks and saw no change. It smells awful (like an old lady after a gallon of gin) and it feels disgusting on your skin.</li>
            <li> Works okay. Bottle goes fast. Bioderm slimming/cellulite products work better.</li>
            <li> I was sad to notice some patches on my skin. My mom bought Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream for me. It exceeded my expectation when within a couple of days those patches are reduced and my skin looks firm. It definitely helped me to lift up my self-confidence.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 jars of this for my wife and after using both, she has seen little or no results.  Was very hopeful, but didn&#x27;t seem to work.  We are on to trying something else now with higher hopes.  Just to note, my wife isn&#x27;t over weight and works out.  Just can&#x27;t seem to get rid of the stubborn cellulite.</li>
            <li> Not as good as reviews states...did not see a significant result as reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> I have always loved swimming. I know how refreshing it is when cold stream of water touches your bare skin. I had to cover up my skin as I was developing some patches around my thighs. This went on for almost a year when I finally got some nice results after using Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming Cream.I&#x27;ve achieved even and smooth legs. Now I am glad to be able to wear my swimsuits again.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I&#x27;ve many cellulite patches on my thighs and abdomen. I used some skin improvement products but it was almost a year when I was struggling with that adamant problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came to know about Bodishape Cellulite Reduction &amp; Body Firming CreamI was suspicious about its capability, but I thought to try it. I can&#x27;t explain it in words; I am highly delighted with brilliant results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks just perfect, those patches are much reduced and I&#x27;ve smooth and glowing skin.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for me. And the seller is excellent which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an interesting thing to think about, a cream being able to reduce cellulite and I was skeptical at first, but after a few months of using it, my girlfriend is really seeing results and I&#x27;m really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a unique composition of ingredients and the reason it works is because those ingredients are very powerful by themselves and when put together, are even stronger. I have personal experience with using retinol, which this product contains. Retinol is an ingredient that penetrates deep into your skin and helps work to restore your cells from the inside. It stimulates their activity and rejuvenates them. In this case, this stimulation helps reduce cellulite. A clever little product really and coenzyme A is decided to target the light fatty areas. Therfore this product does two things: it helps reduce the appearance of cellulite while at the same time helping firm up and rejuvenate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend looks great and we both love it.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of ways to lose weight, but none of them is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was going to give up myself, I found this product on Amazon by accident. I saw the reviews of this product are very good, then I decided to try last time, and this time, I really did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and work for me very well. I used it thoroughly on my thigh and waist and it has reduced my thigh dimples to a great extent, I can wear some slim and fashionable pants which I cannot wear before. And my skin is much smoother than before.  It makes me feel more confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really feel grateful for this product and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Love this product! And believe me I&#x27;ve tried a lot of cellulite creams. I&#x27;ve waited until I used this cream for several months to write a product review so that I could really give it time to see if it lived up to the hype and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Let me first say this- if you are looking for a magic cream that will completely get rid of cellulite put your wallet away now, don&#x27;t buy this or any other product. It won&#x27;t happen. That doesn&#x27;t exist. Now if you want something that will reduce the appearance of cellulite than you&#x27;ve hit the jackpot with this one!! BUT (there&#x27;s always a but isn&#x27;t there?) you have to be willing to put in some effort.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not overweight, I&#x27;m a runner and in pretty decent shape. But I do have cellulite, and a pretty fair amount of it. It&#x27;s ugly.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly would not expect to buy a cream and slap it on my legs and think it&#x27;ll work on its own on stubborn cellulite. I use a dry brush (you can buy them on amazon) and massage the cream in well. I do this twice a day. I drink plenty of water and exercise. I have done these things with and without this cream, and there is a significant improvement when I use the cream! My cellulite is barely noticeable now, while just doing the dry brushing alone only made a small difference.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really does work well as long as you are willing to put in a little effort. I think it&#x27;s absolutely worth it for the results you can get. It is a little pricey but still not as much as some other creams, and to me it&#x27;s worth it if it does what it promises!&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes it feels a bit tacky on my skin. Nothing too bad though.</li>
            <li> I had 3 weeks to get ready for a vacation- I used this cream 2-3 times a day. I also worked out a lot and watched my eating- I can honestly say that I saw a reduction in cellulite especially in my stomach- Im not sure if I used too much but I guess the only down side I would say is that it doesnt last that long- mine was gone in about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> This product did not really do anything for me, and I was not trashing it, I just don&#x27;t think all products work on all people.  Now I had said just that I did not even ask the company to give me a refund, even though it says 100% or refund guaranteed but I have dealt with refund drama before and just didn&#x27;t waste my time.  I was amazed that the same day I left my feedback which I said was not great but just said it didn&#x27;t work for me that the company who sells this sent me an email and said they were refunding my money!!  Now that is GREAT SERVICE....&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;I wish this had worked for me, because you are a great company that obviously stands behind your products.&lt;br /&gt;Lisa S</li>
            <li> I’ve never really given too much thought about what cellulite is or where it comes from, but my girlfriend had remarked plenty of times about some stripes on my butt. One weekend she had purchased some Bodishape, and it had a great effect on her thighs and hips, but they weren’t as bad as the fat on my bottom. So I figured I’d try some too, been using it for about a week now. It is a very nicely textured cream and rubs in very well. Not the prettiest smelling, but it seems to be working very nicely. And much easier than adding another run to my week that may not even make a difference</li>
            <li> I actually believe the cream worked. I certainly saw a difference in my thighs and I even wore shorts again.... and, out of the house! HOWEVER, I will NOT buy this cream again and waste money spending $39.99 for half a jar.  Yep, you heard me, 1/2 a jar if that.  After the cream settled for the night I was pissed the next day that there was only like 1/2 a jar full, and that&#x27;s probably too generous.  For those that think I lathered myself in it when I got it...nope.  I only dipped finger in and applied small amounts to my thighs because I wanted to see how it would absorb on my skin. This company really should be ashamed of themselves for ripping off their customers. They got me once, but they won&#x27;t get another dime from me.  I would not recommend to anyone.... unless you have money to waste.</li>
            <li> Very little cream in this jar. It cost a lot of money and after using daily I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. It doesn&#x27;t dry well and I think it absorbs into my clothes. A brand in a supermarket would probably work better, cost less, last longer, and get better results. I am 5&#x27;6, weigh 135lbs and use this product on my upper thighs only.</li>
            <li> I saw this cream on the Dr.Oz show so I was curious how well it would work on me and to my surprise it&#x27;s been great! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks on and off and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how my skin looks. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to decrease cellulite and have firmer skin in problem areas. It&#x27;s not creasy, makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice now and will update my review in a few weeks - but I can already tell my skin is softer and something is definitely going on in the right direction with this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but thought it was  worth a try (anything to make a slight cellulite difference right) and I have to say in 5 days I have noticed a difference in appearance and am really happy with this product !</li>
            <li> The reviews and yes, I got drawn into the fact that Dr. Oz recommended it, are the second reasons I purchased this cream.  The first is that I thought it could replace a cream that is no longer available through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote a review about another cellulite cream in which I also referred to the cream that is no longer available (Shessentials).  Both those creams worked for me.  I purchased this one because it seemed quite similar to the Shessentials.  I have been using this cream for as long as the Shessentials cream, but the results aren&#x27;t even close.  Will continue to use only because I paid for it, but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Another product i enjoyed using from JDT International , I have tried a couple item from them and really enjoyed them all and they are so nice to work with as well. I had a baby less then a year ago and i needed something to help me. it took a huge toll on my skin. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things to try to lighten them up or to make them go away. This lovely cream and It absorbs nicely into my skin and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling after application. It went on well and i didn&#x27;t have any issues with it.I have to say I have been using this product for a few days, I noticed my skin felt incredibly soft and well moisturized.I will continue using it. I did received this item in exchange for my honest review. I have to say it works great so far.</li>
            <li> Almost every woman has them and of those, all of you want them gone. I will not say that this cream will give you baby like skin again, let us face it, pass a certain age and that thought is history. But, we can still have beautiful skin by how we take care of ourselves. I will say that I have seen a difference by using Bodi Shape. I have also been using this amazing eye serum that has helped the lines and wrinkles around my eyes disappear[[ASIN:B00VSBDR78 Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and Matrixyl 3000 Super Peptide Complex]]and for once I am finally happy with my skin.  Naturally everyone is different and you have to be your own judge. But, it doesn’t hurt to give it a try. A very small amount so a jar can go a long way.</li>
            <li> hoping it works, seems like it</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing.  I workout i.e. walk two miles a day and I have a weight regimen with my legs and all this did was moisturize my thighs.</li>
            <li> Cellulite build up is a common problem these days for women. And maintaining a healthy diet and a god work out is very important. But to fight cellulite you also need to concentrate on specific areas by massaging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a cellulite massager along with this cream. It has shown a vast difference in my body. I can feel the areas more firm and better looking. The cream does not stick to the body but rather absorbs well. The texture of the cream is good and I like the mild fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using these products does not give results in days. But rather its a slow and long process. Give it 2-3 weeks to actually start seeing the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
            <li> does work ladies however is pricey! doesnt dissolve my blubber however does smooth ripples, dimples etc so works....pleasant medicinal-like fragrance and blends in well, you feel its working based on how feels going on and thereafter. BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> Did not see a result...</li>
            <li> Just got this a few days ago and the tube is almost gone! My skin seems a little firmer but cellulite is still very visible. For the price of continuing to use this product I might as well go get a procedure since it goes so fast. Every time I put this product on dead skin would come off my body. Not sure if anyone else had this happened to them. I tan often, maybe that&#x27;s why??</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
            <li> I started feeling my skin tightening and looking better within a few days of use</li>
            <li> Just Ordered the product and Got it in the mail today. I put some on and Hate the way it makes my skin feel..makes it feel sticky...like I need to take a shower I had to wash my hands right after applying it because they felt gross and it seemed to dry my hands out. it smells nice and I&#x27;m hoping to see results in the next 5 days. I will write another review in 5 days. oh and the advertisement clearly states it contains Retinol but Retinol is nowhere on the ingredient label. it says caffeine but no Retinol.</li>
            <li> I did see some improvement with this cream, but cellulite is not gone:(</li>
            <li> Used the entire jar. Saw no improvement at all.</li>
            <li> doesnt do anything, as well as all others.lol</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my arms. To supplement it I do body pump (weights. ) and melt (foam roller). It&#x27;s been 3 weeks slowly improving</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews but I want to descibe my experience with Bodishape. I was looking for a cellulite cream for such a long time. After reading all the overwhelming positive reviews on Bodishape&#x27;s Cellulite Cream I decided to try it. I figured they offer a money back guarantee if you&#x27;re not satisfied; what did I have to lose? I received the product very quickly and began using it right away morning and night. The cream left my legs feeling a little sticky, but went on smoothly and was not at all greasy. The smell was either here nor there in my opinion. The instructions for usage were not the best, but I used it the way other&#x27;s on the reviews said they used it.&lt;br /&gt;Suprisingly, I received an unexpected e-mail from Bodishape asking me how I liked the product. I has only used it for a week so it was okay that I had not seen dramatic results. I received another e-mail in about two weeks with around six (6) tips to follow when applying the cream. I replied that still not seen the results that I has read in reviews but would continue to use the cream. In two days I was confused becuase I received a refund from Bodishape for my purchase. I guess they thought I was dissatisfied with the product, even thought I had not stated that, because I stated that I had not finished the jar yet. By the time I was finished the jar I actually can say that I was starting to see improvement. I must say that along with using the cream I have been watching what I eat and doing about four miles on the treadmill four days a week. I would like to continue using this cream because it seems to be reducing the amount of cellulite I have on my outer thighs and hip area. If you want to try this cream please do some kind of aerobic exercise and eat properly, and if you don&#x27;t see results maybe you will need to use more than one jar to see results like me. Also use the cream as directed. Stick with it, and with patience there is a good chance you will begin to see results.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. It did nothing for me and I used it twice a day. Waisted my money.</li>
            <li> The reviews here must be written by bodishape manufacturer, friends, family or paid for because this was a complete waste of my time and money. After two jars of this overpriced cream, I noticed NOTHING!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!  It really works.... I been using it 4 about 3months and I saw results after about 2 weeks n the more I use it the better it getting....</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for a week with the special MIT, so far I haven&#x27;t seen any results. It feels tight while it&#x27;s drying on the skin. Hopefully it will do what it claims...</li>
            <li> I have been using this incredible cream nightly for the last three weeks and my cellulite is disappearing. I recommend it for anyone who is looking to positively impact their cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 1 month now...I do see results. I have only been using it once a day.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously and I saw absolutely no results. Nice smell however.</li>
            <li> it works but needs consistency</li>
            <li> I give this product 2 stars because of how soft it makes my skin... The smell isn&#x27;t the worst but I don&#x27;t see any noticeable differences after using this product for more than two weeks.. I work out consistently doing cardio and resistance training and my problem area is the back of my thighs.. I exfoliate every night with a cellulite massager before drying and applying this, I apply it in the morning as well...</li>
            <li> I have no more celluite because of this product. Love it and will buy again</li>
            <li> Save your money!  Unfortunately this product did not work at all.  I only have cellulite on the back of my thighs so that&#x27;s the only place I applied it &amp; didn&#x27;t notice any reduction of visibility.  I bought the cellulite brush as well to hopefully get better results &amp; nothing.  It&#x27;s a very small bottle &amp; it&#x27;s just about gone.  I will not purchase this product again as I feel it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> On my 2nd jar and I am seeing small results.</li>
            <li> Was really hoping this would work. I&#x27;m average weight, work out regularly, and eat well. I have heritary celulite. Did absolutely NOTHING after a months worth of use.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Starting to see a difference!!!</li>
            <li> I was very anxious to try this cream for my cellulite. I&#x27;m only into my 3rd day of using it &amp; already I&#x27;m not happy with the medicinal smell. But WORST of all for me, is the stickiness! It stays sticky on my skin until I wash it off. I&#x27;m going to continue using it  &amp; I&#x27;m hoping to see some results by the end of the jar to make up for the inconvenience.</li>
            <li> This cream really works, my second jar is on the way! Perfect when paired with exercise, lots of water &amp; diet!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the reviews about how wonderful it worked. As many people said, it does not last very long. Using it on my entire legs, it lasted about 2 weeks. I did notice a bit of firming in the skin in certain areas but not much reduction in cellulite. I purchased another jar to get 30 days of use. My guess is that it works for people with mild cellulite issues but it didn&#x27;t work for my cellulite - which is bad. Also, anytime you massage your legs it is good for cellulite, circulation and exfoliation so some of the results noticed may be simply from people actually paying attention to and massaging their cellulite. Maybe with advanced cellulite you have to use it longer to get results but since after 30 days I didn&#x27;t see a difference in cellulite, I wasn&#x27;t willing to continue to invest in the product. I am now using Nerium and have noticed a difference that is much more significant. It does have a strange smell but that disappears quickly so it isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a mild cellulite problem, I would suggest that you give this a try, but if you have a lot of cellulite I think it is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I just started to notice a small amount of pucked skin so I decided to try to get rid of it before it became worse.&lt;br /&gt;  Starting using  as soon ad I received product. I noticed the skin on my back legs was smoother. I started to use a brush every day so I hope this will help results along faster. I am now trying it on my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;I must say I am 65 and have not had my weight vary more than 12 pounds since I was in my twenties so this might be a little bit of a plus. Would recommend to anyone. Only negative is it takes long to dry before you can get dressed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to notice a change in the appearance of the back top part of my thighs where the cellulite is the worst, I only use it in the morning and it took a week to see a difference , I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> CAME CRACKED REFUND PLEASE PRODUCT ALL OVER UNUSABLE HAD TO THROW OUT</li>
            <li> Just received it, but so far like it.</li>
            <li> You can feel it working!! I have only used it for about a week, which means I havent seen drastic results, however I have noticed firming feeling skin on the days I use the product and on the days I have forgotten to apply.</li>
            <li> So i was skeptical about this cream.. only because i thought it was too good&lt;br /&gt;to be true. At first no results.. then i kept using it wanting to give it a chance,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it for about two weeks I&#x27;m starting to see a difference. I use it on&lt;br /&gt;my thighs and arms. Also it smells ok for a body shaping cream, Also customer&lt;br /&gt;service was really helpful and friendly.</li>
            <li> just 3 weeks using and i see a great difference in my legs cellulite it reducing greatly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and I&#x27;m on my second purchase now. Results aren&#x27;t apparent thus far. I think my extreme optimism is about the only thing that seems to be working!</li>
            <li> this is the best for cellulite, but of course needs to be reapplied daily.</li>
            <li> It is working better than those over the counter anti-cellulite cream. I will use it again</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance! Some tightening.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cream a little over a week ago and I am noticing some results.  I anticipate this product will be part of my daily regime. If the product continues to work I will be updating with 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Have used for about a month, just ordered another bottle so I can try for a full 8 weeks. I use once a day along with dry brushing. I believe I have seen some improvement. I also walk 4 miles a day and have cut back on caffeine. My thighs definitely appear smoother under snug workout clothes. I&#x27;m excited to see the full results after another month. Shipping was fast and packaging appears safe.</li>
            <li> I began using this cream about a month ago.  I wasn&#x27;t real faithful about putting it on twice a day (I just forgot some days).  I still noticed the difference!  First, I dry brushed in an up-and-down motion, and then put the lotion on in an up-and-down motion.  I already have another one on my wish list and I still have some left.  It is expensive, but it works well and is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free and was a bit skeptical at first but after only using it for a week I am already seeing a difference!! Love it! I am hooked!</li>
            <li> Over rated! No visible results after 3 jars!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it for many days yet, but so far, it seems to have some effect. One thing I did not like too much about it, though, is that it feels sticky on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best product i ever got .&lt;br /&gt;WORKS, WORKS , WORKS&lt;br /&gt;Every woman should have one ...............&lt;br /&gt;After using this for 1 week I saw the change already.&lt;br /&gt;I even ordered one more for my best friend as a gift .&lt;br /&gt;Just try it promise you each on of you going to love it ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 2 wks ago, and I have to say it&#x27;s the best. It really works. I recommend this to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great</li>
            <li> Recieved these for free in return for a positive feedback.  I do not notice any difference in my cellulite but it makes my skin soft.  It has been a month but I will update of anything changes.</li>
            <li> I did not find this was a good product. It says money back guarantee. NOT TRUE</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to this and it didn&#x27;t smell good either. Keep trying to find something to replace Cellutherm.</li>
            <li> I used the whole container and saw no difference what so ever. Not worth the money spent on the product.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a month,It just did not work for me. my cellulites did not go any where. I wasted $40 for nothing.</li>
            <li> Did not see any results. Used one bottle</li>
            <li> Same as the capsules, Not enough time .</li>
            <li> I used one jar only, but did not see any results.</li>
            <li> Jury is still out on this cream.  I&#x27;ll have to come back for a follow up review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with cellulite for years. I&#x27;ve tried, different creams and lotions with few successful results.The dimples on my thighs,legs and stomach have deffinitely improved. The ingredients in this formula are definitely working! It is slowly but surely firming, smoothing, and tightening up in those areas on my body.</li>
            <li> This cream smells and feels wonderful. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results, but I will update everyone with that ASAP!</li>
            <li> Bad odor&lt;br /&gt;Produced me allergy</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 days and feel that it is showing signs of firming up my cellulite on my thighs. Getting ready to order more of this product. I do wish it came in larger size!</li>
            <li> Did not work .I only used it for 2 weeks I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s why but in those 2 weeks my skin was the same .I stopped</li>
            <li> My new favorite beauty treatment.</li>
            <li> sorry looks like doesn&#x27;t work for me..</li>
            <li> Great - stuff actually works</li>
            <li> I was just fooling around last night and tried the product. First I did the leg brushing, and then applied. This morning my jaw dropped. It really works. I didn&#x27;t even try it before the shower, which is really supposed to help. Very impressed!</li>
            <li> Used the whole jar and saw no noticeable difference</li>
            <li> I Had good results and placed another order.</li>
            <li> Sorry!  This  cream did not work.</li>
            <li> Very good product and arrived on time. Will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream hoping to help the excess skin I have on lower belly after giving birth to my 18mo old.  I have strecth marks but I really really really hated the way my belly looked like a squeezed capri sun pouch.  I did not expect the cream to work fast or even at all, I was a hopeful skeptic.  IT WORKED THE VERY NEXT DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So as soon as I saw it on my door step Sunday afternoon, I showered and that evening I tried a little bit (not measured teaspon but eyeballed teaspoon) and rubbed up and down vigorously lol.  I waited to see if my skin would burn off, it didnt, waited for hives, nope, waited for tightening sensation, not un.  So  I forgot all about it and went on with mom duties.  The very next day I was changing clothes and remembered I had tried the cream and ran to the bathroom with the good lightning and TA DA!!!!!!!!!!! NO MORE SQUISHED CAPRI SUN POUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wanted to cry.  This was absolutely best case scenario for me and I hope it will be for others who try it too.  Okay so the product was not so easy to rub in, its a thick gel like but looks like a normal cream.  It also left my belly sticky and my hands...so dont wear your fancy clothes or wait until it fully absorps into your skin before getting your work clothes and wash your hands afterwards.  It has like a citrus herb medicinal smell- basically it doesnt stink. It has only been 3 days so I dont know if Im jumping the gun but I was truly surprised to see results and results that fast.  It has been a great booster to the ego, OH I still have stretch marks but thats ok because this cream is not for stretch marks so dont confuse the two.  I have not tried it on my legs or arms, I may but I ran track for years so thats not my area of concern.  So if youre a mom with a &amp;#34;brain belly&amp;#34; splurge on this and get it!!! I AM ONE HAPPY MOM</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything. Had a decent fragrance, went on smoothly, but I saw no difference, even after using it for several weeks. Was greatly overpriced for the size and for what it pretty much failed to do. Nuelle Cellulite Cream is much better.</li>
            <li> Cellulite creme did not do me any good . I used one bottle I look the same. I don&#x27;t want to try an other one.</li>
            <li> Almost 2 jars used thus far, and I can say that the product seems to be working.  I don&#x27;t work out, and at &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; 50 years old I thought it was time to try anything to get rid of the stubborn cellulite on my legs.  Although it isn&#x27;t an overnight miracle, I do believe it is helping.  I have battled this problem with exercise to no avail, so I am happy that Bodishape is finally helping!</li>
            <li> Working great!!! Happy with this cellulite cream</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference and have been pleased with the product so far!</li>
            <li> I too have used this product and of course no product is a miracle worker and will make the cellulite just disappear but after only three weeks of using it twice a day, once in the morning and again at night, my husband was the first to notice the reduced appearance of my stretch marks and this is after having my second child. I am currently half way through this container and will definitely be replacing it once its empty.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference.</li>
            <li> First, this is not a miracle cream. Let’s just get that out of the way right away. I did not rub the cream on one night, go to bed, and wake up with catwalk legs. Hmmm … I don’t really want catwalk legs … too skinny for me. I want like shapely female soccer player legs!! Okay, moving right along. The point that I am trying get across is that this is NOT a miracle cream. Now that we have covered that, let’s move on … shall we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed about the cream is that it has a wonderfully light scent; big shocker that I picked up on the scent! The second thing that I noticed is that the cream is thick but smooth. I was worried that the thickness would result in a greasy finish or perhaps a film; however, that was not the case. The cream rubs in nicely and absorbs rather quickly. After using the product for close to a month, I have noticed that my skin feels softer; the cream has hydrated and moisturized my skin. I have also found myself using the cream twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what you really want to know is have I noticed a change to my cellulite? I have noticed some tightening but the results have not been mind-blowing. That being said, I did not expect them to be. I know that this is going to be a process that will take time, like anything else. I also believe it should be combined with diet and exercise for optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to know if I would recommend this product, the answer is yes. I feel the cream, thanks to the ingredients, have provided beneficial in not only tightening my cellulite but also moisturizing my skin and what 30 something doesn’t wish for both of these things?!?!</li>
            <li> I love this cream, is really awesome) My skin became more supple and smooth</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over two weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference on my cellulite on my legs. I would not recommend this product! It smells awful too.</li>
            <li> Cellulite is a never ending condition. Have to keep on fighting it. That being said, Bodishape worked as claimed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s, and started seeing the first signs of cellulite on my upper thighs despite being physically active and eating relatively healthy.  I have been using this cream, and have noticed that my skin looks tighter and there are less signs of cellulite!  I recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality cream.  It also smells great and makes the skin feel soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Did not work. Jar was only half full. Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice. Difference.</li>
            <li> I try many products for review on my blog. I was offered a sample of this product to try. I was not really sure what to expect from it, as there are not a lot of studies that show that cellulite can be removed with a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set off to try the cream earnestly, but I have to say, that my sensitive skin rebelled pretty quickly with this cream. I placed a small amount on my arm and waited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was itching and red within about 10 minutes. Unfortunately, I cannot continue the trial based on these results. I am afraid of a stronger reaction the next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the sample though!</li>
            <li> did not see the results I expected</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a minute now. I have a few area on my stomach that need firming.</li>
            <li> Bodishape helped to smooth out the cellulite in my thighs. I&#x27;m preparing for for my third figure competiton and this cream has made a world of difference in my legs!</li>
            <li> Saw an improvement on the cellulite  on the back of my thighs</li>
