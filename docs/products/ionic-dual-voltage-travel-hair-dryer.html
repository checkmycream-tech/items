            <li>The Ionic Dual-Voltage Travel Hair Dryer is really great.</li>
            <li>The fact that it folds together is very handy when storing.  </li>
            <li>It was good to find this unit via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So good, in fact, that we bought this on our return</li>
            <li>Loved it until I took it to Europe and tried out the dual voltage feature.  </li>
            <li>and I just loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good size.  </li>
            <li>However it seems to have good power here in the US.  </li>
            <li>Powerful and the size is also perfect to travel.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>I just love it !</li>
            <li>Great for people with arthritis as it is just so light.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift - recipient loved it says it is the lightest weight and most efficent blow dryer she has used.</li>
            <li>It fits nicely into my carryon luggage, fits in my hand, &amp; has the drying power I need.</li>
            <li>I have tried many travel hairdryers.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>again for sure.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use correctly.  </li>
            <li>I love the look, quality and performance.</li>
            <li>Wanted to love it, but it didn&#x27;t work and I returned it over a month ago and haven&#x27;t heard a word form Brookstone.  </li>
            <li>I too experienced this hair dryer catching on fire while plugged into a European outlet.</li>
            <li>Love it  Very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Also - it&#x27;s so easy on the arm since it&#x27;s so lightweight.  </li>
            <li>It is fine for travel and has dual voltage, which if you use correctly (push selector switch all the way in the direction of the voltage you select) should operate with no problem.</li>
            <li>I would have never considered using a travel hair dryer as my primary, but my mum had one when I went to visit her</li>
            <li>Comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This one works great and is quiet...</li>
            <li>Oh - the warranty is great - they just last longer than the coverage, so</li>
            <li>This dryer was light weight and very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, it is very powerful</li>
            <li>I searched for the lightweight hair dryer because I have a weak right arm and after much searching experienced this wonderful travel dryer as well as using it at home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money as it makes frizzy hair look smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Brookstone issued me a full refund, though.</li>
            <li>Most are very damaging to your hearing.  </li>
            <li>My Mom ordered this and she has decided that it is so good that she will use it as her regular dryer in addition to travel.</li>
            <li>Because it folds, to a very small profile, Perfect for travel!</li>
            <li>I think the issues experienced by those noting \\&quot;fire\\&quot;, \\&quot;tripping power\\&quot; are due to user errors.  </li>
            <li>Brookstone just lost a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>and I am convinced it is the best dryer even though the price is a little high.</li>
            <li>WELL worth the price.  </li>
            <li>so the price is right.</li>
            <li>Strong motor and not too loud</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is light weight due to wrist arthritis.  </li>
            <li>It is truly powerful and it really does work in two modes in both voltages.</li>
            <li>I am obsessed with this hair dryer, it is the best!</li>
            <li>this way you do not have to rely on converters but for her in the US love this dryer and use it daily</li>
            <li>I have owned several of these for many years.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I love it yet because I haven&#x27;t used it for an international trip.  </li>
            <li>length hair, is loud, but all dryers are, does not frizz hair, folds up nicely for travel, does not work in Europe even with attachments, but have never found one that does, easier to just buy a european one or use theirs when traveling and</li>
            <li>I love that it is small, easy to travel with, drys hair somewhat fast.  </li>
            <li>so it dries your hair FAST.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>As for the price it&#x27;s fine as long as it does the job.  </li>
            <li>I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>The dryer last 1-2 years to me well worth the money</li>
            <li>Most other dryers are just too powerful for my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>My friend shared her dryer with me on a trip to New York</li>
            <li>time for a new one when that happens.</li>
            <li>We first bought this hairdryer on a trip to Europe when our &amp;#34;global&amp;#34; dryer turned out to be very local.</li>
            <li>That being said, I bought the same exact one  as soon as I got home.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why we keep buying new ones when the old ones go kaput.  </li>
            <li>People with carpel tunnel will also benefit as it weights nearly nothing.</li>
            <li>The thing I value most about this hair dryer is that it is so quiet - far less damaging to your hearing than other small/travel models.  </li>
            <li>Only issue is that it is fairly loud.</li>
            <li>love, this is like my 4th one in 20 years maybe a little less on the years.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super thick</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This dryer is a great product.  Every other hairdryer (since I was a child) I used also left my hair dry but, this one never over dries your hair &amp; helps with humid days also. As for the price it&#x27;s fine as long as it does the job.  Had mine for 7 years now bought it from brookestone never one problem with it and also brookestone warrenties their products for life so as long as you have the receipt they will replace it for nothing so the price is right.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when Brookstone dropped their small travel hair dryer from their line.  It was good to find this unit via Amazon.  The hair drying meets the need.  I bought this as a back up to the Brookstone travel dryer I already have.</li>
            <li> We first bought this hairdryer on a trip to Europe when our &amp;#34;global&amp;#34; dryer turned out to be very local. It was great. So good, in fact, that we bought this on our return so we both have one.</li>
            <li> Purchased from Brookstone via Amazon.   Caught fire when used as \\&quot;dual voltage\\&quot;.   Brookstone would not stand behind.   Amazon reimbursed me.   DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM BROOKSTONE EVER!</li>
            <li> This dryer was light weight and very powerful.  Loved it until I took it to Europe and tried out the dual voltage feature.  IT CAUGHT FIRE AND SHOT SPARKS AT MY HEAD!!!!!  Couldn&#x27;t believe another person had the same experience, so I decided to write a review about my experience even though I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon.  I returned it to Brookstone for a refund.</li>
            <li> I too experienced this hair dryer catching on fire while plugged into a European outlet. That being said, I bought the same exact one  as soon as I got home. Why? Because it is a GREAT travel hair dryer to use while on vacation (in the US only) and at the gym. It&#x27;s worth the money as it makes frizzy hair look smooth and silky. Additionally, it is very powerful so it dries your hair FAST. Just don&#x27;t use out of the US!</li>
            <li> I have tried many travel hairdryers. This is the best! Love it. It is truly powerful and it really does work in two modes in both voltages. I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is not tiny but it is not a large standard dryer either. It is fine for travel and has dual voltage, which if you use correctly (push selector switch all the way in the direction of the voltage you select) should operate with no problem. It is my belief that those people who report that the dryer caught on fire did not push the switch all the way and therefore were still in 110 mode when they used 220, which will always cause a fire.</li>
            <li> I searched for the lightweight hair dryer because I have a weak right arm and after much searching experienced this wonderful travel dryer as well as using it at home. My friend shared her dryer with me on a trip to New York and I am convinced it is the best dryer even though the price is a little high.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!  I would have never considered using a travel hair dryer as my primary, but my mum had one when I went to visit her and I just loved it.  The regular sized one I was using ended up causing my hand to hurt by the time I was done with it each day, and this has as much, if not more power.  The fact that it folds together is very handy when storing.  Highly recommend this!</li>

            <li> The Ionic Dual-Voltage Travel Hair Dryer is really great. Because it folds, to a very small profile, Perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this hair dryer, it is the best! Unfortunately the package got lost in the mail. Brookstone issued me a full refund, though. I ended up buying one in the airport on my last trip.</li>
            <li> love, this is like my 4th one in 20 years maybe a little less on the years.  I love that it is small, easy to travel with, drys hair somewhat fast.  The dryer last 1-2 years to me well worth the money but depends what you are looking for.  My hair is super thick so it takes about 15min. to dry med. length hair, is loud, but all dryers are, does not frizz hair, folds up nicely for travel, does not work in Europe even with attachments, but have never found one that does, easier to just buy a european one or use theirs when traveling and this way you do not have to rely on converters but for her in the US love this dryer and use it daily</li>
            <li> Love it  Very powerful.  Good size.  Comfortable.  Would get&lt;br /&gt;This again for sure. Thank you for a wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product to buy.</li>
            <li> We have owned 4 of these hair-dryers - we use one EVERY day and have another for travel - we have used it in several international locations with NO problem.  It is a great hair dryer!  I think the issues experienced by those noting \\&quot;fire\\&quot;, \\&quot;tripping power\\&quot; are due to user errors.  If used correctly, as instructed, the dryer works as expected on both 110 and 220 V outlets.  Just be sure to use correctly.  The thing I value most about this hair dryer is that it is so quiet - far less damaging to your hearing than other small/travel models.  Be careful if you&#x27;re using the  \\&quot;run of the mill\\&quot; travel hair dryer!  Most are very damaging to your hearing.  And if used everyday, you could be doing real harm to your hearing health.  This one works great and is quiet...WELL worth the price.  That&#x27;s why we keep buying new ones when the old ones go kaput.  Oh - the warranty is great - they just last longer than the coverage, so time for a new one when that happens.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000KEMZ0O Ionic 1,875-watt Travel Hair Dryer]]    I purchased this expensive travel dryer looking for a higher quality product. The switch broke a week after the warranty expired and Brookstone refused to fix it, even for a fee. I wish I had just bought the cheaper model at Target! I won&#x27;t make that mistake again. Brookstone just lost a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I have owned several of these for many years. I love the look, quality and performance. Never tried it abroad however.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love it, but it didn&#x27;t work and I returned it over a month ago and haven&#x27;t heard a word form Brookstone.  Disappointed in their costumer service!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I love it yet because I haven&#x27;t used it for an international trip.  However it seems to have good power here in the US.  If nothing else, will work well in a pinch!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is light weight due to wrist arthritis.  Only issue is that it is fairly loud.</li>
            <li> My Mom ordered this and she has decided that it is so good that she will use it as her regular dryer in addition to travel. Great for people with arthritis as it is just so light. People with carpel tunnel will also benefit as it weights nearly nothing. Strong motor and not too loud</li>
            <li> I just love it ! Powerful and the size is also perfect to travel.</li>
            <li> I swear by this dryer.  Most other dryers are just too powerful for my fine, thin hair.  Also - it&#x27;s so easy on the arm since it&#x27;s so lightweight.  Can&#x27;t speak to using it in Europe, though.  I guess I could just use a converter as I would with any other dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this travel hair dryer for years and the switch finally gave way - and I went out &amp; bought another one.  It fits nicely into my carryon luggage, fits in my hand, &amp; has the drying power I need.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. I don&#x27;t know. I know I ordered one and received two in the same box.</li>
