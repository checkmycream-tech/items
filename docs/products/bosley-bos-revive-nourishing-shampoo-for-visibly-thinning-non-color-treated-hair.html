            <li>I have pretty much tried every hair loss shampoo out there and bosley is one of the best I have tried I&#x27;d not the best it is not it leaves your hair</li>
            <li>I like its nice minty scent.  </li>
            <li>thicker more manageable</li>

            <li>Really makes my thinning hair look full !!</li>
            <li>I have used this item for many years and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to those with fine hair similar to my own.</li>
            <li>Has not helped me regrow any hair on its own, but recently started using rogaine as well which seems to be helping.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Scalp was tingly fresh the first couple of times.  </li>
            <li>I use this shampoo with the bosley thinking foam the 2 together are magic my hair is nice n thick.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo, works better when leaving it on for few mins before using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo only have been using it for 5 days</li>
            <li>but it s fine with shampoo and other conditioners as all if you have really fine baby hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my middle 30&#x27;s,caucasian, male and used the product once a day, every day for many months now!</li>
            <li>No sulfates, dense enough to use sparingly, smells fine.</li>

            <li>The stuff really works.</li>
            <li>was getting a real winner.</li>
            <li>But, it turned out to be a real dud and just made my situation worse.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Bosley, I just got balder quicker.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does clean the hair well, as well as a regular $4 shampoo.</li>
            <li>Bought this shampoo based on the glowing reviews to be highly dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Looking over the reviews of this item I really can&#x27;t Believe  there is as many negative reviews as there is</li>
            <li>So far, no luck!</li>
            <li>It did not help the volume and made my hair extremely soft and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>Who will find the secret to bring the hair back will sell it on good money and everybody will know it&#x27;s name..</li>
            <li>Thank god for the conditioner and hair treatment I have to bring my hair back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it will help my hait grow back, but it is still to early to tell.</li>

            <li> like I do I highly recommend you try bosley especially with the price of some of the other hair loss products you really can&#x27;t loose any way it works for me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s about the only product that I have used that I have seen a little new hair regrowth with and has given me a fuller head of hair I did use the conditioner as well</li>

            <li> Been using now for a few weeks makes hair feel thick and clean a little goes</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this shampoo is not that great at all i have used it for two weeks, and have seen no results...please dont buy it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Finallly a shampoo that complements my overall strategy for decreasing hair loss.</li>
            <li> I feel this was not a Bosley product that I know</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and am very happy with it.  My hair seems to like it too and I have had some hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product. It did not help the volume and made my hair extremely soft and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Looking over the reviews of this item I really can&#x27;t Believe  there is as many negative reviews as there is I have pretty much tried every hair loss shampoo out there and bosley is one of the best I have tried I&#x27;d not the best it is not it leaves your hair thicker more manageable it&#x27;s about the only product that I have used that I have seen a little new hair regrowth with and has given me a fuller head of hair I did use the conditioner as well and I do recommend people use the conditioner with it but it s fine with shampoo and other conditioners as all if you have really fine baby hair like I do I highly recommend you try bosley especially with the price of some of the other hair loss products you really can&#x27;t loose any way it works for me</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo only have been using it for 5 days but it definitely made my hair thicker.I saw some bad reviews I don&#x27;t know why at all. I use this shampoo with the bosley thinking foam the 2 together are magic my hair is nice n thick. Before u could see a little of my scalp now u cant.  I will always use this product.</li>
            <li> Been using now for a few weeks makes hair feel thick and clean a little goes a long way.product is not watery very thick.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo, works better when leaving it on for few mins before using the conditioner. For short hair this bottle lasted me almost 10 months. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> The stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Really makes my thinning hair look full !!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo quite a bit and plan to continue to use it.  I like its nice minty scent.  I really dislike heavy perfume scented products</li>
            <li> After 8 months of usage ( every day) I see no change. I have loss of hair in the front ( the hair line has moved about 1.5 inch) and in the top of my head ( circle of about 2 inch has lost about 50% hair). The shampoo does clean the hair well, as well as a regular $4 shampoo. Who will find the secret to bring the hair back will sell it on good money and everybody will know it&#x27;s name.. So far, no luck! I&#x27;m in my middle 30&#x27;s,caucasian, male and used the product once a day, every day for many months now!</li>
            <li> Awful. Product just made my hair fall out faster. Based on all of the great reviews, I thought that&lt;br /&gt;I was getting a real winner. But, it turned out to be a real dud and just made my situation worse.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Bosley, I just got balder quicker. I think I&#x27;ll check out the reviews on razors, so I can just&lt;br /&gt;shave my head and finish the job.</li>
            <li> I have just started to use this shampoo and i have noticed improvement which i am happy with.  I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The Bosley Bos Revive Nourishing Shampoo makes my fairly thin red hair feel much thicker.  I would recommend it to those with fine hair similar to my own.</li>
            <li> Tingling shampoo.  Seems to help.</li>
            <li> Great product! Started using it everyday and noticed no more hair loss in the shower. Maybe it will help my hait grow back, but it is still to early to tell. We recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for more than 4 months. No loosing hair and a little growing. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> this shampoo make my scal too greasy and thats why I came back to my horse shampoo.</li>
            <li> Definitely improved the perceived thickness of my hair. I haven&#x27;t been using a white pillowcase, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually preventing me from losing any. No sulfates, dense enough to use sparingly, smells fine. Seems to work, haven&#x27;t found any hair on my pillow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months.  I think it&#x27;s working.  Lets see what happens in another 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scalp was tingly fresh the first couple of times.  Probably combats a lot of impurities from the water system, that cause more harm to healthy scalp than other things.</li>
            <li> Love it!  My hair looks so thick</li>
            <li> I have tried other products before. It is good product made in the USA. Quality product that works well for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo based on the glowing reviews to be highly dissapointed. Made my hair brittle and unmanageable.  Thank god for the conditioner and hair treatment I have to bring my hair back to normal.  Sticking to B&amp;B shampoos for now.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I have used this item for many years and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Has not helped me regrow any hair on its own, but recently started using rogaine as well which seems to be helping.  I still like this shampoo and continue to use it.  I had given it (along with conditioner and the step 3 of the regime) about 9 months, but like I said, no hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, neatly packaged.  Have used Bosley&#x27;s product for years - great shampoo.  I highly recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
