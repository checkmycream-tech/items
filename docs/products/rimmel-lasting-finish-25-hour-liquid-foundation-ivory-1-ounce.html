            <li>Best foundation I&#x27;ve ever found!!!</li>

            <li>i&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>What a great, affordable foundation!</li>
            <li>Best inexpensive makeup I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Rimmel BB Cream is awesome</li>
            <li>Beautiful texture, beautiful coverage.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how flawless my face looked after applying it</li>
            <li>The coverage  is amazing and gives a flawless  finish without leaving you looking made up.</li>
            <li>This is a great foundation.</li>
            <li>However, I found this shade blended well into my face and is effective at covering up my blemishes!</li>
            <li>perfect color for many skin tones.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>My make-up looks good even after working all day .I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>Good coverage.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for people with really light skin.</li>
            <li>Good coverage</li>
            <li>which is good.</li>
            <li>Very smooth I got the recommendation from my good housekeeping book!</li>
            <li>While some of these foundations have worked okay for me, this Rimmel foundation is superior to all of them in my opinion!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thicker coverage and feels a bit tacky until it drys completely, but looks great when all is said and done and it&#x27;s awesome in photos.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this foundation!  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day, goes on smoothly and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>My favorite foundation ever!</li>
            <li>I really love this foundation!</li>
            <li>love this foundation!</li>
            <li>I  LOVE them!</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely and stays on all day with no touch up.</li>
            <li>Nice airbrused looking finish&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a nice product, and would buy again.</li>
            <li>I quite like this foundation, the coverage is nice and its not too greasy.</li>
            <li>It matches perfectly and really stays on.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff in the world i cant and won&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>So far, this is the best foundation I have ever had!</li>
            <li>If I can&#x27;t have Coty Airspun Powderessence (in my opinion the best foundation ever commercially sold), this will do nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a kind of runny consistency which I think made it easy to rub into my skin</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>be buying again and its so cheap!</li>
            <li>even more if it wasn&#x27;t tested on animals, is it?</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect from this makeup as I was buying it online</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t just open it up and look at the color, but it is really awesome.  </li>
            <li>Love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>Like many women, I have tried a variety of different drug store foundations attempting to find the perfect match.</li>
            <li>Wish it was still available in stores!</li>
            <li>I just hope there is more color selection for lighter tone.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic foundation!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great foundation, I highly recommend trying this one!</li>
            <li>I have found another foundation I like better though, so this will be my backup.</li>
            <li>and I think it looks okay.</li>
            <li>I liked it and it went on smoothly</li>
            <li>I love.</li>
            <li>I wear a medium biege in most foundations.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much either to cover, it has great coverage.</li>
            <li>The best coverage to last all day.</li>
            <li>Cannot belive not sold in stores ant more.</li>
            <li>It does last all day though (about 10-12 hours) flawlessly.</li>
            <li>It is quite sheer, I add mineral powder to hide flaws and it is perfect, I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li>I bought this rimmel product at wal-mart and i&#x27;m in love with this foundation.</li>
            <li>Top of my list in foundations.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because of my skin, not the product I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>still wear it for occasions because it provides such a great look!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this makeup.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of drug store foundation, but they need to add more</li>
            <li>Decent coverage, great color, and</li>
            <li>Best find in a long time, compares to department store foundations.</li>
            <li>It feels pretty good, as in I don&#x27;t feel like my pores are being clogged up or anything.</li>
            <li>Because someone shared with me, I found a great new product.  </li>
            <li>Great price if you want to try a new foundation.</li>
            <li>But, I was able to get it to blend in pretty nicely</li>
            <li>Okay, I will start off by saying that I&#x27;m probably not the best person to ask about makeup, since I hardly ever wear it.</li>
            <li>Light, yet it covers everything and feels like you are not wearing anything.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I have 2 bottles of this stuff sitting around that I use when I&#x27;m going somewhere important.</li>
            <li>I wore it last month as a bridesmaid and my face looked great all night.</li>
            <li>This entire brand is full of great products and a fraction of the price</li>
            <li>My new favorite foundation!</li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion, and I was nervous that their lightest shade of ivory looked rather dark.</li>
            <li>Good coverage- if you need a little more concealing on a spot you can apply some more without it looking caked on.</li>
            <li>This is the lightest color and it really is a super light ivory.</li>
            <li>Now,  I am very pale,  and the lightest shade is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>This is great for the money - better than many others that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li>It has a matte finish and its color stays true.</li>
            <li>Like I said I don&#x27;t know that much about makeup, but I am pleased with this and will probably buy it again if I ever run out.</li>
            <li>Better than some of the high dollar foundations I have bought from the cosmetic counters at department stores.</li>
            <li>First I ordered Ivory which was WAY too light for me.  </li>
            <li>This product looks pretty on face for hours!</li>
            <li>I have very light skin with ruddiness and nearly no facial fuzz and the ivory works well, giving an all-over smooth color.</li>
            <li>This is that rare thing-</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my light skin that doesn&#x27;t find a match, but fortunately Ivory IS a shade match, and it gives nice medium-to-full coverage without ever looking heavy or cakey.</li>
            <li>It does last all day which is nice and its VERY affordable.</li>
            <li>I am almost out of my first tube</li>
            <li>Then I ordered Soft Beige which was still too light.  </li>
            <li>Spreads like a higher end product.</li>
            <li>this is a good shade for pale individuals</li>
            <li>Very light and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of my skin after I use it as well</li>
            <li>But since finding this I honesty  skip over my Mac and go straight  to this foundation.  </li>
            <li>However, the color of the product appearing on the front of the tube was much darker; in fact, it matched the Sand, which also appears online.</li>
            <li>Very affordable price but works well.</li>
            <li>I got it from another seller and the product was very oily, as if it had been tamoereg with.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li>Hmm, an okay product and not very pricey.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t handle liquid foundation very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But,  however,  I work in fast food in which my shifts are 8+ hours.</li>
            <li>I was so shocked when I saw it still looked perfect after sweating and dealing with grease,  not to mention living in hot West Texas.</li>
            <li>Finally a makeup that is AFFORDABLE and stays on for FULL day of work.</li>
            <li>I sometimes pick out a color that&#x27;s too dark and end up mixing products to find a better match for skin tone.</li>
            <li>I live it so much i will pay the price.</li>
            <li>Used Clinique for  20 years, but they discontinued my particular product, and I could not find another offering that worked for me......</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this foundation is one of the only cheap foundatons that does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>medium to high coverage for me.</li>
            <li>Cant live without it.</li>
            <li>First off,  let me say that I bought this in the new package,  the glass bottle because I guess rimmel re launched it as new and improved in different packaging.  </li>
            <li>I think that it is probably better for younger skin, but as long as I use a cream base, it covers excellently.  </li>
            <li>one tube usually lasts me two or more months.</li>
            <li>Discovered it in a local large shopping store when I was looking for a foundation and a another women shopper</li>
            <li>When I purchased this product online, I was worried about how my sensitive skin would react to this brand.</li>
            <li>but i definitely will not put it on my whole face unless I want to wear it as a mask.</li>
            <li>I realize that everyone has different skin types, and so what works for me might not work for others, but I would highly recommend giving this foundation a try!</li>
            <li>It looks so natural when used with their powder.</li>
            <li>I was worried that Ivory would be too dark (I&#x27;m pretty fair) &amp; usually when cosmetic lines (like Rimmel) have a limited shade selection</li>
            <li>the runny side&lt;br /&gt;-it will drip right out of the bottle so be careful and mind your clothing</li>
            <li>My type of skin is rather normal, not oily, not dry...</li>
            <li>In this picture, it appeared light enough to match my pale skin.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-stays for a decent amount of time, but not as long as they claim&lt;br</li>
            <li>was telling me how much she like this Rimmel and that it is  really long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long as advertised, but didn&#x27;t really expect it to.</li>
            <li>Leaves you with fresh-looking skin, smells nice, and isn&#x27;t expensive at all.</li>
            <li>Worked great for covering my dark tattoo in conjunction with Hard Candy Glamoflauge HEAVY DUTY CONCEALER with pencil (MEDIUM TAN color).</li>
            <li>After two months of using it about every other day, I have not broken out or had any rashes associated with this makeup.</li>
            <li>Price was very reasonable (no free shipping on this item at the time</li>
            <li>I have tried others labeled &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; that were really too dark with an orange tint.</li>

            <li> I am almost out of my first tube</li>
            <li> Then I ordered Soft Beige which was still too light.  </li>
            <li> Spreads like a higher end product.</li>
            <li> this is a good shade for pale individuals</li>
            <li> Very light and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of my skin after I use it as well</li>
            <li> But since finding this I honesty  skip over my Mac and go straight  to this foundation.  </li>
            <li> However, the color of the product appearing on the front of the tube was much darker; in fact, it matched the Sand, which also appears online.</li>
            <li> Very affordable price but works well.</li>
            <li> I got it from another seller and the product was very oily, as if it had been tamoereg with.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> Hmm, an okay product and not very pricey.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t handle liquid foundation very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But,  however,  I work in fast food in which my shifts are 8+ hours.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked when I saw it still looked perfect after sweating and dealing with grease,  not to mention living in hot West Texas.</li>
            <li> Finally a makeup that is AFFORDABLE and stays on for FULL day of work.</li>
            <li> I sometimes pick out a color that&#x27;s too dark and end up mixing products to find a better match for skin tone.</li>
            <li> I live it so much i will pay the price.</li>
            <li> Used Clinique for  20 years, but they discontinued my particular product, and I could not find another offering that worked for me......</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this foundation is one of the only cheap foundatons that does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> medium to high coverage for me.</li>
            <li> Cant live without it.</li>
            <li> First off,  let me say that I bought this in the new package,  the glass bottle because I guess rimmel re launched it as new and improved in different packaging.  </li>
            <li> I think that it is probably better for younger skin, but as long as I use a cream base, it covers excellently.  </li>
            <li> one tube usually lasts me two or more months.</li>
            <li> Discovered it in a local large shopping store when I was looking for a foundation and a another women shopper</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product online, I was worried about how my sensitive skin would react to this brand.</li>
            <li> but i definitely will not put it on my whole face unless I want to wear it as a mask.</li>
            <li> I realize that everyone has different skin types, and so what works for me might not work for others, but I would highly recommend giving this foundation a try!</li>
            <li> It looks so natural when used with their powder.</li>
            <li> I was worried that Ivory would be too dark (I&#x27;m pretty fair) &amp; usually when cosmetic lines (like Rimmel) have a limited shade selection</li>
            <li> the runny side&lt;br /&gt;-it will drip right out of the bottle so be careful and mind your clothing</li>
            <li> My type of skin is rather normal, not oily, not dry...</li>
            <li> In this picture, it appeared light enough to match my pale skin.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-stays for a decent amount of time, but not as long as they claim&lt;br</li>
            <li> was telling me how much she like this Rimmel and that it is  really long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as advertised, but didn&#x27;t really expect it to.</li>
            <li> Leaves you with fresh-looking skin, smells nice, and isn&#x27;t expensive at all.</li>
            <li> Worked great for covering my dark tattoo in conjunction with Hard Candy Glamoflauge HEAVY DUTY CONCEALER with pencil (MEDIUM TAN color).</li>
            <li> After two months of using it about every other day, I have not broken out or had any rashes associated with this makeup.</li>
            <li> Price was very reasonable (no free shipping on this item at the time</li>
            <li> I have tried others labeled &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; that were really too dark with an orange tint.</li>
            <li> I usually use Revlon ColorStay (combo/oily formula) foundation in Buff for my daily/full-coverage look -but was looking for something else that&#x27;s readily available to wear daily that isn&#x27;t quite as heavy feeling as RevlonCS</li>
            <li> Have wasted money on high end foundations that do not perform like this one does.  </li>
            <li> lasts a long time,</li>
            <li> Who wears their makeup that long?  </li>
            <li> It stays all day and doesn&#x27;t turn flaky or dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s is the PERFECT everyday base!</li>
            <li> and it works as long as i put it on carefully and sparsely</li>
            <li> The colors are very limited.</li>
            <li> other than that, this product is on its last few squirts.</li>
            <li> it does not make my skin feel all oily like if I use other liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> In other words, the picture on the ordering page, does not match the product I received.</li>
            <li> Start out with less than you think you&#x27;ll need or are used to as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i have really dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> Nope; it was just as dark.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I got the Ivory 100, which is the lightest shade (I believe), and it&#x27;s still a shade or so too dark for me.</li>
            <li> For one thing it&#x27;s way too dark, even in it&#x27;s lightest shade.</li>
            <li> But other than  that one little thing,  </li>
            <li> panicked because all the previous reviews said the colors were too dark.  </li>
            <li> Not super orange on my face</li>
            <li> Needs to be blotted a few times a day, as it looks a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years to cover heavy discoloration on my legs.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> but this is my humble opinion about this product:&lt;br</li>
            <li> However there are a few cons the makers should take into consideration:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too heavy for summer wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for heavy coverage, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Does not feel heavy, chalky, or drying.  </li>
            <li> the only two things i can find wrong with this as well as other rimmel foundations is that there&#x27;s not a huge shade selection and that the ivory shade, (i&#x27;m very pale), is on the dark side.</li>
            <li> This Rimmel foundation blended perfectly on my pale skin.</li>
            <li> I read through some of the reviews about how it can make you look orange if you are really pale, which I am really pale but it does not make my skin look orange at all.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know whether this dark color visible on the outside was merely part of the package, and thought perhaps the product inside the tube would be lighter.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse, so I usually slap on the foundation at 6am, and by 1130 at night, it&#x27;s just gone.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear it for about 12+hours and no issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale.</li>
            <li> but it is so thick and cakey and blending</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s crazy thick.</li>
            <li> It does transfer unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> As a result, thr coverage was very poor.</li>
            <li> Sadly I can&#x27;t wear it all the time because it makes me break out a bit :(</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hope not,so cruel.</li>
            <li> It was the worst foundation i ever buy</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product. Very light and lasts long. I didn&#x27;t even have to re-apply my make up!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying again and its so cheap!</li>
            <li> Good product. My make-up looks good even after working all day .I&#x27;d like it even more if it wasn&#x27;t tested on animals, is it? I hope not,so cruel. Thanks.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product online, I was worried about how my sensitive skin would react to this brand. After two months of using it about every other day, I have not broken out or had any rashes associated with this makeup. This Rimmel foundation blended perfectly on my pale skin. I really liked how flawless my face looked after applying it and I don&#x27;t plan on going back to covergirl or almay.</li>
            <li> This is that rare thing- a product that does what it says it does. It gives lasting coverage that doesn&#x27;t come off on clothing. It has a matte finish and its color stays true. I have very light skin with ruddiness and nearly no facial fuzz and the ivory works well, giving an all-over smooth color. I recommend moisturizing beforehand and letting that sink in, as this is a quick-drying foundation and you want it to glide on evenly. If I can&#x27;t have Coty Airspun Powderessence (in my opinion the best foundation ever commercially sold), this will do nicely.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely and stays on all day with no touch up. Better than some of the high dollar foundations I have bought from the cosmetic counters at department stores.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect from this makeup as I was buying it online and I couldn&#x27;t just open it up and look at the color, but it is really awesome.  I read through some of the reviews about how it can make you look orange if you are really pale, which I am really pale but it does not make my skin look orange at all.  It truly sticks to its word as well, 25 hour makeup.  I really like the feel of my skin after I use it as well it does not make my skin feel all oily like if I use other liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation.  Discovered it in a local large shopping store when I was looking for a foundation and a another women shopper was telling me how much she like this Rimmel and that it is  really long lasting.  Decided that I would give it a try and now this is the only make-up I buy.  Because someone shared with me, I found a great new product.  Now I want to pass the word along to others.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before.  I LOVE this foundation!  Makes my skin look and feel great!  I am a nurse, so I usually slap on the foundation at 6am, and by 1130 at night, it&#x27;s just gone.  The ivory blends perfectly with my skin.  I am sticking with this product!</li>
            <li> it covers well but it is so thick and cakey and blending it is chore. i have really dark circles under my eyes so i use it there and it works as long as i put it on carefully and sparsely but i definitely will not put it on my whole face unless I want to wear it as a mask.</li>
            <li> It laden me breakout,  And didn&#x27;t stay on all day like it said it would. The package was sorta leaking too when I got it.</li>
            <li> Like many women, I have tried a variety of different drug store foundations attempting to find the perfect match. While some of these foundations have worked okay for me, this Rimmel foundation is superior to all of them in my opinion! I have a very fair complexion, and I was nervous that their lightest shade of ivory looked rather dark. However, I found this shade blended well into my face and is effective at covering up my blemishes! The foundation has a silky texture without being too oily. I realize that everyone has different skin types, and so what works for me might not work for others, but I would highly recommend giving this foundation a try!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years to cover heavy discoloration on my legs. It allows me to wear dresses and shirts during the summer. Wish it was still available in stores!</li>
            <li> The Foundation is creamy and dries powdery. I think that it is probably better for younger skin, but as long as I use a cream base, it covers excellently.  It is a great travel size and for evening wear - I will use this heavier base.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best foundation I have ever had! I bought it from Walmart, but I still decided to write a review about this product, so as to share my experience. I definitely recommend it! My type of skin is rather normal, not oily, not dry... The foundation is creamy and it lays perfectly on my skin, leaving no trays whatsoever! I will probably use this one forever! :D</li>
            <li> Worked great for covering my dark tattoo in conjunction with Hard Candy Glamoflauge HEAVY DUTY CONCEALER with pencil (MEDIUM TAN color).</li>
            <li> Finally a makeup that is AFFORDABLE and stays on for FULL day of work. Used Clinique for  20 years, but they discontinued my particular product, and I could not find another offering that worked for me......enter Rimmel. I have stocked up for future.</li>
            <li> I have both Mac liquid foundation  and powder foundation. But since finding this I honesty  skip over my Mac and go straight  to this foundation.  The coverage  is amazing and gives a flawless  finish without leaving you looking made up.</li>
            <li> The color I ordered was Ivory, as shown here. In this picture, it appeared light enough to match my pale skin. The package arrived on time. The sticker on the outside of the tube was the only identifier of the color inside. It read, \\&quot;Ivory.\\&quot; However, the color of the product appearing on the front of the tube was much darker; in fact, it matched the Sand, which also appears online. I didn&#x27;t know whether this dark color visible on the outside was merely part of the package, and thought perhaps the product inside the tube would be lighter. Nope; it was just as dark. In other words, the picture on the ordering page, does not match the product I received. I cannot use this product. What a waste.</li>
            <li> It is just great! Very affordable price but works well. I just hope there is more color selection for lighter tone.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic foundation! Light, yet it covers everything and feels like you are not wearing anything. Best find in a long time, compares to department store foundations. If you are looking for a great foundation, I highly recommend trying this one! FIVE STARS</li>
            <li> Now I am by no means a cosmetologist or expert on makeup but this is my humble opinion about this product:&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is of quality and does the job. However there are a few cons the makers should take into consideration:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Nice airbrused looking finish&lt;br /&gt;- this is a good shade for pale individuals&lt;br /&gt;-even coating&lt;br /&gt;-covers up blemishes and flaws&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-on the runny side&lt;br /&gt;-it will drip right out of the bottle so be careful and mind your clothing&lt;br /&gt;-stays for a decent amount of time, but not as long as they claim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a nice product, and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I quite like this foundation, the coverage is nice and its not too greasy. I have found another foundation I like better though, so this will be my backup. It does last all day which is nice and its VERY affordable.</li>
            <li> This product looks pretty on face for hours! perfect color for many skin tones.  Been using it for years. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s intended to do. It lasts all day, goes on smoothly and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation ever! Cant live without it. Goes on smooth. Good coverage.</li>
            <li> Okay, I will start off by saying that I&#x27;m probably not the best person to ask about makeup, since I hardly ever wear it. This is probably about the third foundation I have ever bought in my lifetime. Now with that aside, I do like it. It&#x27;s a kind of runny consistency which I think made it easy to rub into my skin (I use my hands). It feels pretty good, as in I don&#x27;t feel like my pores are being clogged up or anything. My only complaint is that I got the Ivory 100, which is the lightest shade (I believe), and it&#x27;s still a shade or so too dark for me. I&#x27;m very pale. But, I was able to get it to blend in pretty nicely and I think it looks okay. Like I said I don&#x27;t know that much about makeup, but I am pleased with this and will probably buy it again if I ever run out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing it used by a beauty guru on YouTube. I liked it and it went on smoothly but it did make my face break out which why I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars. Great price if you want to try a new foundation. The colors are very limited.</li>
            <li> My new favorite foundation! Leaves you with fresh-looking skin, smells nice, and isn&#x27;t expensive at all. I am almost out of my first tube and I will be ordering another, no question about it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this foundation is one of the only cheap foundatons that does not irritate my skin. I love. Beware of where you order it from. I got it from another seller and the product was very oily, as if it had been tamoereg with. As a result, thr coverage was very poor.</li>
            <li> Needs to be blotted a few times a day, as it looks a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I like this foundation for use in the winter.  It&#x27;s a thicker coverage and feels a bit tacky until it drys completely, but looks great when all is said and done and it&#x27;s awesome in photos.  It&#x27;s way too heavy for summer wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I panicked because all the previous reviews said the colors were too dark.  I wear a medium biege in most foundations.  First I ordered Ivory which was WAY too light for me.  Then I ordered Soft Beige which was still too light.  I ended up with Nude and it was perfect.  So the color descriptions were spot on for me.</li>
            <li> Best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used. It matches perfectly and really stays on. It looks so natural when used with their powder. I&#x27;ve had a lot of people think I didn&#x27;t even have makeup on. It doesn&#x27;t take much either to cover, it has great coverage. I use it a lot and one tube usually lasts me two or more months. But that&#x27;s because it don&#x27;t take a lot to cover. Best foundation I&#x27;ve ever found!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this foundation! My local stores were ALWAYS sold out of the 1st shade (Ivory 100) so I ordered here on Amazon. Price was very reasonable (no free shipping on this item at the time but *shoulder shrug* to that considering how happy I am with this!) I usually use Revlon ColorStay (combo/oily formula) foundation in Buff for my daily/full-coverage look -but was looking for something else that&#x27;s readily available to wear daily that isn&#x27;t quite as heavy feeling as RevlonCS and this is it! I was worried that Ivory would be too dark (I&#x27;m pretty fair) &amp; usually when cosmetic lines (like Rimmel) have a limited shade selection it&#x27;s my light skin that doesn&#x27;t find a match, but fortunately Ivory IS a shade match, and it gives nice medium-to-full coverage without ever looking heavy or cakey. Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> This foundation is wonderful! It stays all day and doesn&#x27;t turn flaky or dry my skin out. Good coverage- if you need a little more concealing on a spot you can apply some more without it looking caked on. Start out with less than you think you&#x27;ll need or are used to as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is great for the money - better than many others that are much more expensive. This is the lightest color and it really is a super light ivory. I have tried others labeled &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; that were really too dark with an orange tint. This is perfect for people with really light skin.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed. I ordered this after reading all the postive reviews. Cakes on and made me breakout. Didn&#x27;t cover anything</li>
            <li> The best coverage to last all day. Cannot belive not sold in stores ant more.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as advertised, but didn&#x27;t really expect it to. It does last all day though (about 10-12 hours) flawlessly. Decent coverage, great color, and I never broke out while using.</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation. Good coverage and it lasts &#x27;til I remove it,&lt;br /&gt;which is 12 hours! Spreads like a higher end product.</li>
            <li> love this foundation! medium to high coverage for me. lasts a long time,</li>
            <li> I like this, it is moisturizing which is what I was looking for, a lot of make-up dries my skin out. This does not make me shiny, yet is sheer and covering at the same time. If you are looking for heavy coverage, this is not it. It is quite sheer, I add mineral powder to hide flaws and it is perfect, I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Hmm, an okay product and not very pricey. Its doesn&#x27;t work wonders but for the price one can&#x27;t complain. Also I&#x27;ve yet to find a my go to foundation. Not super orange on my face which is good. I sometimes pick out a color that&#x27;s too dark and end up mixing products to find a better match for skin tone.</li>
            <li> I bought this rimmel product at wal-mart and i&#x27;m in love with this foundation. the only two things i can find wrong with this as well as other rimmel foundations is that there&#x27;s not a huge shade selection and that the ivory shade, (i&#x27;m very pale), is on the dark side. other than that, this product is on its last few squirts. i&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Beautiful texture, beautiful coverage.  Lasts all day without settling into lines/pores.  Does not feel heavy, chalky, or drying.  Have wasted money on high end foundations that do not perform like this one does.  Top of my list in foundations.</li>
            <li> It was the worst foundation i ever buy</li>
            <li> What a great, affordable foundation! I have 2 bottles of this stuff sitting around that I use when I&#x27;m going somewhere important. Sadly I can&#x27;t wear it all the time because it makes me break out a bit :( Disclaimer- it&#x27;s because of my skin, not the product I&#x27;m sure. It can&#x27;t handle liquid foundation very well.&lt;br /&gt;I still wear it for occasions because it provides such a great look! I wore it last month as a bridesmaid and my face looked great all night.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff in the world i cant and won&#x27;t live without it. It covers so well and before you apply it, it feels heavey but when i wear it i dont feel cakey. I use to just get it at Walmart.  But i cant find it at any drug store for some reason. I live it so much i will pay the price.</li>
            <li> First off,  let me say that I bought this in the new package,  the glass bottle because I guess rimmel re launched it as new and improved in different packaging.  Now,  I am very pale,  and the lightest shade is perfect for me.  In the winter that is.  About it lasting 25 hours?  I don&#x27;t know.  Who wears their makeup that long?  Not me!  But,  however,  I work in fast food in which my shifts are 8+ hours. Does it last all day without budging?  Yes!!  I was so shocked when I saw it still looked perfect after sweating and dealing with grease,  not to mention living in hot West Texas. I usually wear it for about 12+hours and no issues.  It does claim to be transfer proof,  which is definitely NOT the case.  It does transfer unfortunately.  But other than  that one little thing,  it&#x27;s is the PERFECT everyday base!</li>
            <li> Best inexpensive makeup I&#x27;ve ever used! This entire brand is full of great products and a fraction of the price I  LOVE them!</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the primer and I love it. Very smooth I got the recommendation from my good housekeeping book!</li>
            <li> Love this makeup. hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it any time soon</li>
            <li> It seems lots of customers like this foundation, but I&#x27;m not a fan. For one thing it&#x27;s way too dark, even in it&#x27;s lightest shade. It&#x27;s the tannest Ivory I&#x27;ve ever seen! And it&#x27;s crazy thick. Maybe that&#x27;s why it lasts all day, but it felt like I was putting Crisco on my face. It&#x27;s just not something I can deal with in the summer in the south. Rimmel BB Cream is awesome and I&#x27;ll stick with that.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of drug store foundation, but they need to add more</li>
