            <li>It works wonderful.</li>
            <li>I was concerned when the faculty sealed package contained a coupon that expired 9 years ago, but this is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND DOES ALL</li>
            <li>I bought this in around 2002 and have been quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li>But for 9 years of use at this price, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>I am happy to recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li>So this is amazing and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>AND I AM HAPPY I BOUGHT IT .</li>
            <li>Works great and at a good price.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t get a good shave for me on the underarms.  </li>
            <li>Initially, I loved the product.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is an excellent for the day after I shave to keep my legs smooth without causing razor burn.  </li>
            <li>It works surprisingly well for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I figured, over the years, they must have imporoved the darn things, so I went ahead and purchased this shaver, based on the good ratings I saw for</li>
            <li>I just love this razor!   </li>
            <li>It gives me a nice close shave (</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>once it&#x27;s &amp;quot;broken in&amp;quot; it does a NICE job.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled to have this shaver.</li>
            <li>Well, I purchased an electric shaver years ago, and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>Extremely happy even with the first use.  </li>
            <li>The shave is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thought it did okay on the legs</li>
            <li>This is possibly the best invention since the lightbulb.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend had this shaver many years ago in college.</li>
            <li>I used it mostly to get a close scruff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I have it</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many times I go over the area, the unwanted leg hair is still there.  </li>
            <li>My wife wanted a razor that she could use in the tub.she is more than satisfy with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to read the comments about this product</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy to find you couldn&#x27;t replace them with a new set.  </li>
            <li>So far seems like a great product.</li>
            <li>The Remington WDF-3000 was my all-time favorite electric razor that just stopped being available about 10 years ago or so.  </li>
            <li>Best money I have spent this year.</li>
            <li>It really is that good.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper to boot.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this Remington, I&#x27;m through with electric razors for good.  </li>
            <li>More than worth the money!</li>
            <li>The shaver is easy to grasp and works well no matter what its orientation (or mine).  </li>
            <li>Not only does it do an exceptional job in and out of the shower, but it&#x27;s amazingly safe while doing it!</li>
            <li>The battery has been fine all these years</li>
            <li>This shaver gives me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy enough.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t scrape my legs when I shave.  </li>
            <li>Ladies, don&#x27;t buy any shaver until you know the parts are available.  </li>
            <li>They should start making the Remington WDF-3000 again because there never was anything anywhere near as good since they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable and it is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>I was really pleased when I used the Remington Smooth and Silky Contour Shaver for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for traveling,even comes with a small travel case.</li>
            <li>I  was so excited to receive this item, after learning about it from my mom ( who also purchased on Amazon)</li>
            <li>During the busy summer months, it is nice to have something quick and easy in case of an emergency.</li>
            <li>This is good enough!!</li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t order this because I was thinking that maybe I was remembering it as being better than it really was, but</li>
            <li>An electric razor is an excellent, quick, touch-up between your other more extensive hair removal system.  </li>
            <li>People are probably just used to the cheap garbage that has been the only alternative since they stopped making actually nice electric razors like the WDF-3000.</li>
            <li>NO where in the description does Amazon/Discount Jungle note that the item is factory refurbished, yet it comes in bold type on the packaging.</li>
            <li>Removes hair quickly and adequately.  </li>
            <li>Probably not a big deal for most people and not for me most of the time.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as smooth of a shave as a regular razor, but it&#x27;s good enough for days when you&#x27;re not terribly picky.  </li>
            <li>Some times, it takes 2-3 swipes, but your legs are nice and smooth by the third one.&lt;br /&gt;It may hurt the first couple of times you use it, but</li>
            <li>Great razor, albeit a little too noisy.  </li>
            <li>My old Remington still performs much better.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>The item arrived and I tried it right away ( wet/dry) and the bottom rotating razor didn&#x27;t even move.</li>
            <li>I already have to buy new screens for it because they puncture too easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead with very sensitive skin, and I get razor burn easily.  </li>
            <li>The travel case wasn&#x27;t as good as the last one, so I&#x27;m using the old one.</li>
            <li>It is easy to open and clean out.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it very highly!   </li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is that I liked my old one that died better, but this does at least as good a job, and maybe better.  </li>
            <li>Most areas you do have to go over several times</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this exact model since 2005.</li>
            <li>I charged it to see if that was the issue but unfortunately not.</li>
            <li>It takes awhile to charge and also one time I was shaving and a hole ripped in the top net part.</li>
            <li>and I was only able to finish off shaving one leg</li>
            <li>Battery life is good and not having to mess with either a cord or charger unit in my small bathroom is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I liked that one, and I like this one the same so far.  </li>
            <li>Use the adjustable trimmer function first and then use the main shaver for a close shave.</li>
            <li>For an electric razor, this works very well.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>(Using them simultaneously doesn&#x27;t really work.)</li>
            <li>I could not tell much about it because when I received it, it doesn&#x27;t work after charged times.  </li>
            <li>Now I get a very close shave without nicks or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The head adjustment works smoothly and it is pleasantly quiet.  </li>
            <li>I prefer it over a regular razor right now because of convenience (don&#x27;t need to be taking a shower), no razor burn, and I rarely get nicks.      </li>
            <li>The one I originally bought is better than this one - at least that one worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have only used it for dry shaving on clean skin so cleaning the device has been extremely easy.  </li>
            <li>In the meantime I bought many shavers such as Norelco that would let me trim close which is what I wanted, but not fully shaven (luckily I&#x27;m a work from home guy), but these were always too rough for her.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s great when your regular razor is dull, you need to do a fast touch up before going to the beach w/out jumping in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It was comfortable to use, and held a charge for a long time - it also shaved well.  </li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars (the other would&#x27;ve had 5) as the razor sitting in the charging stand is a little too top heavy and wants to fall over if not inserted perfectly .  </li>
            <li>It shaves much closer than the new electric razors do.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 3 passes to shave decently.  </li>
            <li>8 years later, luckily it did.</li>
            <li>The new razors were a little cheaper and never anywhere near as nice.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is extremely lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>suggestion for a close, smooth, painless shave is to use a sharp disposable twin blade with a moderately-thin coat of shave cream.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it under my arms, it chafed my skin, turned it red and burned.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used that actually did what it was supposed to do; provide a close shave with minimum aggravation.  </li>
            <li>I may just buy another one except that these lasted pretty well, and they might actually listen to a consumer for once.  </li>
            <li>Even full charged, it is not what I expected!  </li>
            <li>The quality of this one is clearly much&lt;BR&gt;better, considering the list prices were similar.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li>As far as a close shave goes, you aren&#x27;t going to get a Braun 700 series shave</li>
            <li>My legs feel so soft and silky while applying lotion after I shave.</li>
            <li>It makes a lot of noise but does nothing as far as a shave is concerned, even if I set it at the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t wake the neighbors but anyone near the bathroom will hear it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor after my old Remington kicked the bucket.  </li>
            <li>From some reviews it&#x27;s clear that some ladies didn&#x27;t realize that the little lever in the front is to raise the front underarm blade up to shave your pits, bikini areas, or for an all-over quick shave and then to lower the blade again to shave even closer with the screens.  </li>
            <li>my hairs are not thick or long, there short and straight.</li>
            <li>I will be interested to see how long the blades and foils last because I have concerns about replacing them, given the dated material in the package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my old one (not made for several years</li>
            <li>This purchase replaced  my old remington that finally died after 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I do not use this when I want to be touchably smooth, but I have fairly thick hairs.    </li>
            <li>but so what, its very close and these dont pull like other shavers i&#x27;ved before.</li>
            <li>I could barely move my arms the entire day.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased a Panasonic, as the replacement parts for the Remington are getting harder to find, and I wish I could return the new one.</li>

            <li> But it&#x27;s great when your regular razor is dull, you need to do a fast touch up before going to the beach w/out jumping in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It was comfortable to use, and held a charge for a long time - it also shaved well.  </li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars (the other would&#x27;ve had 5) as the razor sitting in the charging stand is a little too top heavy and wants to fall over if not inserted perfectly .  </li>
            <li> It shaves much closer than the new electric razors do.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 3 passes to shave decently.  </li>
            <li> 8 years later, luckily it did.</li>
            <li> The new razors were a little cheaper and never anywhere near as nice.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is extremely lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> suggestion for a close, smooth, painless shave is to use a sharp disposable twin blade with a moderately-thin coat of shave cream.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it under my arms, it chafed my skin, turned it red and burned.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used that actually did what it was supposed to do; provide a close shave with minimum aggravation.  </li>
            <li> I may just buy another one except that these lasted pretty well, and they might actually listen to a consumer for once.  </li>
            <li> Even full charged, it is not what I expected!  </li>
            <li> The quality of this one is clearly much&lt;BR&gt;better, considering the list prices were similar.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> As far as a close shave goes, you aren&#x27;t going to get a Braun 700 series shave</li>
            <li> My legs feel so soft and silky while applying lotion after I shave.</li>
            <li> It makes a lot of noise but does nothing as far as a shave is concerned, even if I set it at the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t wake the neighbors but anyone near the bathroom will hear it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor after my old Remington kicked the bucket.  </li>
            <li> From some reviews it&#x27;s clear that some ladies didn&#x27;t realize that the little lever in the front is to raise the front underarm blade up to shave your pits, bikini areas, or for an all-over quick shave and then to lower the blade again to shave even closer with the screens.  </li>
            <li> my hairs are not thick or long, there short and straight.</li>
            <li> I will be interested to see how long the blades and foils last because I have concerns about replacing them, given the dated material in the package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my old one (not made for several years</li>
            <li> This purchase replaced  my old remington that finally died after 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I do not use this when I want to be touchably smooth, but I have fairly thick hairs.    </li>
            <li> but so what, its very close and these dont pull like other shavers i&#x27;ved before.</li>
            <li> I could barely move my arms the entire day.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Panasonic, as the replacement parts for the Remington are getting harder to find, and I wish I could return the new one.</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty close--maybe not as well as non-electric, but I have sensitive skin and electric is less harsh.</li>
            <li> Its adjustable trimmer has helped me alot when shaving the longer hairs on my legs, and the little hairs are finished off with the main razor.</li>
            <li> Because of these medical conditions I have to be extremely careful using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> There is no electric razor in the world that will give you the same results as a razor blade, waxing, depilatory cream, or any other extensive hair removal technique.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been catching and pulling at some hairs instead of cutting them, or missing them entirely.  </li>
            <li> Seems to hold its charge for a long time.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> That will do it, and it doesn&#x27;t take that long to do, either.  </li>
            <li> Very rough shave, especially under arms.</li>
            <li> Can be used wet or dry, I&#x27;ve done both.</li>
            <li> Other than some minor changes</li>
            <li> Be careful of underarm areas, it bites!  </li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s definitely been wearing down noticeably these past 2 or so years</li>
            <li> The blades eventually got worn down after years of use, mostly due to me.     </li>
            <li> Something about this thing is just not right.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for quite a long time and both it and its charger take up very little space.  </li>
            <li> This one is slightly bulkier as well.    </li>
            <li> Like what were they thinking was half the reason we buy these things for?  </li>
            <li> If they had made the stand a little wider and taller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m confused about is why this razor costs $49 now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not available anywhere.  </li>
            <li> and I do not push down hard.  </li>
            <li> I think this small inconvenience would be eliminated.  </li>
            <li> I dropped it in the shower and they are dented and a small hole in the screen is where I believe it pinches my skin.</li>
            <li> Small and space saving charger.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> After constantly cutting my legs while shaving, I finally decided to purchase an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> When shaving your legs it leaves hair behind, it&#x27;s almost as if you haven&#x27;t even shaved.</li>
            <li> I have thin athletic  legs</li>
            <li> It will pinch the skin sometimes and it is very painful and unexpected.  </li>
            <li> so shaving around my knees and ankles can be difficult because of hollows and tendons.  </li>
            <li> Something wrong with the battery.</li>
            <li> The foil has a hole in it and it&#x27;s cutting me, so it&#x27;s time to replace the foil and heads.  </li>
            <li> And shaving your armpits is a painful experience.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas, and I am extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Truly disappointed, it does not work at all</li>
            <li> but when I got mine I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible product.</li>
            <li> unit is terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I see complaints about this product and I am guessing it is from someone who has never used an electric razor.  There is no electric razor in the world that will give you the same results as a razor blade, waxing, depilatory cream, or any other extensive hair removal technique.  For an electric razor, this works very well.  It is comfortable and it is quick and easy.  An electric razor is an excellent, quick, touch-up between your other more extensive hair removal system.  During the busy summer months, it is nice to have something quick and easy in case of an emergency.</li>
            <li> Yery close shave!  Extremely happy even with the first use.  I have had difficulty finding a women&#x27;s shaver that actually shaves close.  Ordered a second one for another location.</li>
            <li> I bought this in around 2002 and have been quite happy with it.  I&#x27;ve used it sporadically (maybe weekly to monthly) from 2002-2007 then probably about twice a week since.  I prefer it over a regular razor right now because of convenience (don&#x27;t need to be taking a shower), no razor burn, and I rarely get nicks.      It doesn&#x27;t get as smooth of a shave as a regular razor, but it&#x27;s good enough for days when you&#x27;re not terribly picky.  I use it for the legs and bikini line.  It can&#x27;t get a good shave for me on the underarms.  I do not use this when I want to be touchably smooth, but I have fairly thick hairs.    The battery has been fine all these years and I&#x27;ve only replaced the foil/cutters once.  That being said, it&#x27;s definitely been wearing down noticeably these past 2 or so years and I have to charge it before each use (maybe every 2 uses) and it&#x27;s been catching and pulling at some hairs instead of cutting them, or missing them entirely.  It takes about 3 passes to shave decently.  But for 9 years of use at this price, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased when I used the Remington Smooth and Silky Contour Shaver for the first time.  I was looking for a shaver I could pack and take on vacations where access to water was unavailable.  This shaver shaves close without nicks or cuts and re-charges in no time at all.  I would highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> I received this shaver to replace a Norelco I had had for several years that was no longer working well.  Initially, I loved the product.  It was comfortable to use, and held a charge for a long time - it also shaved well.  But after four months of use, the shaver just stopped working for no reason at all.  I would not recommend it because of that.  I could have just gotten a lemon though.</li>
            <li> After about 6 years my last Remington wet/dry razor&#x27;s batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  I wasn&#x27;t happy to find you couldn&#x27;t replace them with a new set.  Other than some minor changes this is what Remington replaced that model with.    I only gave 4 stars (the other would&#x27;ve had 5) as the razor sitting in the charging stand is a little too top heavy and wants to fall over if not inserted perfectly .  If they had made the stand a little wider and taller I think this small inconvenience would be eliminated.  This one is slightly bulkier as well.    The travel case wasn&#x27;t as good as the last one, so I&#x27;m using the old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with very sensitive skin, and I get razor burn easily.  This shaver is an excellent for the day after I shave to keep my legs smooth without causing razor burn.  It gives me a nice close shave (although not as close as with a razor) until I can shave again.</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these razors and both have lost the ability to hold a charge after about six months.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it under my arms, it chafed my skin, turned it red and burned.  Second time same thing.  I could barely move my arms the entire day.  Thought it did okay on the legs but I want a shaver that does both - well.  Took it back.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with it.  Not only does it do an exceptional job in and out of the shower, but it&#x27;s amazingly safe while doing it! No nicks, no cuts, no pulled hairs, no pain.  It&#x27;s the first electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used that actually did what it was supposed to do; provide a close shave with minimum aggravation.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas, and I am extremely disappointed with this product. When shaving your legs it leaves hair behind, it&#x27;s almost as if you haven&#x27;t even shaved. And shaving your armpits is a painful experience. I just shaved mine and my armpits are bleeding and burning. It&#x27;s a terrible product. I&#x27;ll be returning mine shortly.</li>
            <li> This is possibly the best invention since the lightbulb. Its adjustable trimmer has helped me alot when shaving the longer hairs on my legs, and the little hairs are finished off with the main razor. Some times, it takes 2-3 swipes, but your legs are nice and smooth by the third one.&lt;br /&gt;It may hurt the first couple of times you use it, but once it&#x27;s &amp;quot;broken in&amp;quot; it does a NICE job. I&#x27;ve used it for 4 months now and I will NOT go back to a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had this shaver many years ago in college. I used it mostly to get a close scruff. She used it for all the girl stuff. The blades eventually got worn down after years of use, mostly due to me.     In the meantime I bought many shavers such as Norelco that would let me trim close which is what I wanted, but not fully shaven (luckily I&#x27;m a work from home guy), but these were always too rough for her. Eventually, i decided to see if this model Remington model still existed.     8 years later, luckily it did. The trimmer on this thing is awesome.  And the woman is very happy for her style of shaving. As far as a close shave goes, you aren&#x27;t going to get a Braun 700 series shave but it works for some purposes.</li>
            <li> I had been using another &amp;quot;lady shaver&amp;quot; from a well-&lt;BR&gt;known company.  The quality of this one is clearly much&lt;BR&gt;better, considering the list prices were similar.&lt;BR&gt;Seems to hold its charge for a long time.&lt;BR&gt;So far seems like a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st electric razor and I thought it would shave as close as a regular blade, but it doesn&#x27;t.  Most areas you do have to go over several times which isn&#x27;t time saving.  But it&#x27;s great when your regular razor is dull, you need to do a fast touch up before going to the beach w/out jumping in the shower.  Be careful of underarm areas, it bites!  It will pinch the skin sometimes and it is very painful and unexpected.  I&#x27;m glad I have it (was a gift) but it could be improved.  I already have to buy new screens for it because they puncture too easily.  I dropped it in the shower and they are dented and a small hole in the screen is where I believe it pinches my skin.</li>
            <li> Low priced. Perfect for traveling,even comes with a small travel case. Can be used wet or dry, I&#x27;ve done both. Small and space saving charger. &lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier with this product! More than worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love it.  It works very well.  The shave is very smooth.  It is extremely lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Even full charged, it is not what I expected!  Don&#x27;t waist your time purchasing this shaver unless you have an extra  hour to reshave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this exact model since 2005. It works surprisingly well for an electric shaver. Use the adjustable trimmer function first and then use the main shaver for a close shave. (Using them simultaneously doesn&#x27;t really work.) Overall, the end result is smooth-to-the-touch. The only thing I&#x27;m confused about is why this razor costs $49 now. I paid $17 and change for mine in 2005.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over 10 years now. I recently purchased a Panasonic, as the replacement parts for the Remington are getting harder to find, and I wish I could return the new one. My old Remington still performs much better.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled to have this shaver. I have to take blood-thinning medication daily. I also have nerve damage that causes my hands to tremble at times. Because of these medical conditions I have to be extremely careful using a regular razor. After constantly cutting my legs while shaving, I finally decided to purchase an electric shaver. This shaver gives me a smooth shave. My legs feel so soft and silky while applying lotion after I shave. I am happy to recommend this shaver to anyone. You will not regret making this purchase.</li>
            <li> I could not tell much about it because when I received it, it doesn&#x27;t work after charged times.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> Something about this thing is just not right.  It scratches my legs up like you wouldn&#x27;t believe and I do not push down hard.  When I was done with this, it looked like my dogs had gone to town with their claws on my legs.</li>
            <li> I just received it today and have already tried it.   I just love this razor!   It shaves so close and takes no time at all.&lt;BR&gt;I recommend it very highly!   You don&#x27;t need to buy the WDF-5000.&lt;BR&gt;This is good enough!!</li>
            <li> I had bought this product over 20 years ago so this is actually a replacement one for me...so now you know it will last over 20 years</li>
            <li> The Remington WDF-3000 was my all-time favorite electric razor that just stopped being available about 10 years ago or so.  The new razors were a little cheaper and never anywhere near as nice.  I almost didn&#x27;t order this because I was thinking that maybe I was remembering it as being better than it really was, but no.  It really is that good.  It shaves much closer than the new electric razors do.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that the last razor I bought before I bought this one had the nerve that when you got the package all the way open, it said way inside the package that you weren&#x27;t supposed to shave your pits &amp; bikini areas with it. ??!!#*@???  Like what were they thinking was half the reason we buy these things for?  So this is amazing and wonderful.  They should start making the Remington WDF-3000 again because there never was anything anywhere near as good since they stopped making it.  I may just buy another one except that these lasted pretty well, and they might actually listen to a consumer for once.  From some reviews it&#x27;s clear that some ladies didn&#x27;t realize that the little lever in the front is to raise the front underarm blade up to shave your pits, bikini areas, or for an all-over quick shave and then to lower the blade again to shave even closer with the screens.  It works like a champ.  People are probably just used to the cheap garbage that has been the only alternative since they stopped making actually nice electric razors like the WDF-3000.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND DOES ALL IT SAYS AND I AM HAPPY I BOUGHT IT . ILOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Works great and at a good price. Best money I have spent this year. Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> ( ZERO star review) I  was so excited to receive this item, after learning about it from my mom ( who also purchased on Amazon) The item arrived and I tried it right away ( wet/dry) and the bottom rotating razor didn&#x27;t even move. I charged it to see if that was the issue but unfortunately not. NO where in the description does Amazon/Discount Jungle note that the item is factory refurbished, yet it comes in bold type on the packaging. Truly disappointed, it does not work at all and now I am returning.</li>
            <li> Well, I purchased an electric shaver years ago, and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.  I figured, over the years, they must have imporoved the darn things, so I went ahead and purchased this shaver, based on the good ratings I saw for it.&lt;br /&gt;This unit is terrible.  It doesn&#x27;t shave a thing.  No matter how many times I go over the area, the unwanted leg hair is still there.  It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not working at all.  It makes a lot of noise but does nothing as far as a shave is concerned, even if I set it at the lowest setting.  I&#x27;ve never abused it or dropped it, either.  The one I originally bought is better than this one - at least that one worked.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion for a close, smooth, painless shave is to use a sharp disposable twin blade with a moderately-thin coat of shave cream.  Use short, multiple strokes when shaving.  That will do it, and it doesn&#x27;t take that long to do, either.  Much cheaper to boot.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this Remington, I&#x27;m through with electric razors for good.  I&#x27;ve never ranked a product this low before, but if I could go lower, I would.&lt;br /&gt;Consider yourself warned and save your money by avoiding this product.</li>
            <li> Removes hair quickly and adequately.  My biggest complaint is that I liked my old one that died better, but this does at least as good a job, and maybe better.  It&#x27;s a little loud.  Won&#x27;t wake the neighbors but anyone near the bathroom will hear it.  Probably not a big deal for most people and not for me most of the time.  Battery life is good and not having to mess with either a cord or charger unit in my small bathroom is a good thing.  Overall, I&#x27;d say if the dogs ran off with it and buried it in the backyard, I&#x27;d probably replace it with the same thing so I&#x27;m happy enough.  It&#x27;s not my old one (not made for several years and I don&#x27;t even remember what brand it was) but this does the job.</li>
            <li> This purchase replaced  my old remington that finally died after 10 years.  Great razor, albeit a little too noisy.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a razor that she could use in the tub.she is more than satisfy with this product. It works wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was concerned when the faculty sealed package contained a coupon that expired 9 years ago, but this is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  It holds a charge for quite a long time and both it and its charger take up very little space.  The shaver is easy to grasp and works well no matter what its orientation (or mine).  I have thin athletic  legs so shaving around my knees and ankles can be difficult because of hollows and tendons.  Now I get a very close shave without nicks or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it for dry shaving on clean skin so cleaning the device has been extremely easy.  The head adjustment works smoothly and it is pleasantly quiet.  I will be interested to see how long the blades and foils last because I have concerns about replacing them, given the dated material in the package.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor after my old Remington kicked the bucket.  I think I had that one for about 11 years.  I liked that one, and I like this one the same so far.  It&#x27;s got different setting for longer hairs or for shorter stubble.  It is easy to open and clean out.  I also like that it&#x27;s rechargeable.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t scrape my legs when I shave.  It shaves pretty close--maybe not as well as non-electric, but I have sensitive skin and electric is less harsh.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  The foil has a hole in it and it&#x27;s cutting me, so it&#x27;s time to replace the foil and heads.  Guess what?  It&#x27;s not available anywhere.  Ladies, don&#x27;t buy any shaver until you know the parts are available.  Unless you like to pay $50 for a disposable shaver...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about seven or eight years now and I use it now and then not to often because it hurts. When I&#x27;m shaving my skin it stings me and my hairs are not thick or long, there short and straight. When I use to shave my legs with it, it would leave scars on my skin and I would have to repeat the process about three times. It takes awhile to charge and also one time I was shaving and a hole ripped in the top net part. I like the cleaning supplies it came with, that&#x27;s about it. The model I have is WDF-1400.</li>
            <li> Very rough shave, especially under arms.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to read the comments about this product but when I got mine I was a bit disappointed. Something wrong with the battery. I charged it and I was only able to finish off shaving one leg and then the battery died. Not sure why.</li>
            <li> this was just what i was looking for. I know they arent going to be as close as a razor but so what, its very close and these dont pull like other shavers i&#x27;ved before.Well worth the money</li>
