            <li>Nothing unique about them.</li>
            <li>Overall it is good &amp; colors</li>
            <li>Only good to try out the color, maybe 4-5 times per bottle tops.</li>
            <li>The mint green and the red are both kind of streaky, but these are great polishes otherwise.</li>
            <li>The colors are fun for spring and summer.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast as well.</li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it was old or what but streaked and did not cover even with two coats!!</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t find anything particular new .  </li>
            <li>I guess you can say my favorite one is the pastel green one for spring/summer</li>
            <li>nothing really new here.  </li>
            <li>Colors dry quickly.</li>

            <li> love the small bottles and the colors!</li>
            <li> I like all the colors but the only one I have tried so far</li>
            <li> The quality is slightly lower than normal OPI standards in our opinion.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected them to be</li>
            <li> Just as ordered &amp; expected</li>
            <li> A couple of the colors were not to my liking, I did not realize they were so dark.  </li>
            <li> the green and pink go on streaky...and don&#x27;t care for the matte finish!</li>
            <li> The pink and the green one are too thick to apply.</li>
            <li> The polish does go on a little streaky, had to apply at least 2-3 coats.</li>
            <li> Also the brush is small and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Now not suitable to be given as gifts.</li>
            <li> #34;my paprika is hotter than yours&amp;#34; , at least it is on me.  </li>
            <li> and my wife is disappointed with the colors.</li>
            <li> This is the worst fingernail polish I have ever had.</li>
            <li> but these are awful (and I tried all four).</li>

            <li> Got the item and it was packaged very nicely I could tell the product had never been opened! I like all the colors but the only one I have tried so far is Aloha from OPI (see picture) and it is my favorite of all the colors judging from the package. These are mini (1/8 ounce) but I knew what to expect I have ordered them before. It is perfect to try the colors without breaking the bank and if your like me and never use a full bottle. Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li> The colors were nice and I really like OPI products.</li>

            <li> great polish,and price.i love it and will be ordering more colors.</li>
            <li> Nice small color set of OPI.</li>
            <li> Love the polish and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Ordered these as one of the gifts for my bridesmaids. SO cute! Comes exactly as shown - they&#x27;re going to love them!</li>
            <li> It was a gift, but came as promised.</li>
            <li> The mint green and the red are both kind of streaky, but these are great polishes otherwise. The mini size is also great! My personal favorite is Aloha from OPI (see below).</li>
            <li> I ordered these as part of my bridal shower favors. they are perfectly, adorably sized and love the shades.</li>
            <li> great color assortments :)</li>
            <li> The colors are fun for spring and summer. I was happy to find these on Amazon for a reasonable price. I have seen this set on other websites for a lot more money. The polish does go on a little streaky, had to apply at least 2-3 coats.</li>
            <li> I bought three of these sets as gifts but the gift boxes were damaged on arrival. Now not suitable to be given as gifts.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a gift and I am pleased with my purchase.  I received it promptly. Thank you</li>
            <li> A couple of the colors were not to my liking, I did not realize they were so dark.  But the polish itself is great.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my wife. Smaller than I expected them to be and my wife is disappointed with the colors. These are mate so they kinda look like colored white out when applied. I was expecting something grand for a Hawaiian color....like sparkles or gloss! I guess it all just depends on what you&#x27;re looking for. Colors dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Just as ordered &amp; expected</li>
            <li> nothing really new here.  I am only looking at the colors in the sampler collection.  I do like &amp;#34;Suzi shops and Island Hops&amp;#34; .  Nice pale pink.  Aloha from OPI is the exact same color as &amp;#34;my paprika is hotter than yours&amp;#34; , at least it is on me.  &amp;#34;Lost my bikini in Molokini&amp;#34;  is a lighter purple than the Nordic Collection&#x27;s &amp;#34; do you have this color in Stockholm&amp;#34;.  &amp;#34;that&#x27;s Hula-rious&amp;#34; is paler than &amp;#34;My dogsled is a hybrid&amp;#34;.  I just didn&#x27;t find anything particular new .  Just paler forms or identical colors .  I am going to look at the rest of the collection but I use OPI all the time so I know the colors pretty well.</li>
            <li> Love these colors, just wished that all the colors in this collection were available in the mini sizes</li>
