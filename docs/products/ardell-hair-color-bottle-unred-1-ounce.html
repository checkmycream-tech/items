    <ol>
            <li>I just did my roots this time and it matched the color perfectly even though I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in 2 months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed that a cheaper product like this can get me close to the hair color</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d rather just tone it and make the color a perfect 10</li>
            <li>But I gave this a go, and I am very happy that I did because it does work!</li>
            <li>Great product please stop going up in the price!!!  </li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s best to add it to your hair color.  </li>
            <li>((: sooo happy!</li>
            <li>Very happy with Unred.</li>
            <li>the price was the best I have ever purchased it at.</li>
            <li>It works great!</li>
            <li>So, I took my Pantene conditioner and some mayonnaise (great conditioner) and 10 drops of the Unred</li>
            <li>Great, great stuff.</li>
            <li>The color came out so nice, not brassy and orange!  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product and I received it very quickly!</li>
            <li>Buy good hair product, treat your hair well.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent to look your best!</li>
            <li>A much better deal online than in Sallys!</li>
            <li>Sally&#x27;s stopped carrying this for some reason, so glad I found here!</li>
            <li>I found this large 1oz size on Amazon for the best price and have used it twice since receiving it.  </li>
            <li>my own hair.</li>
            <li>You need to play with the number of drops needed for your particular hair, but this is an excellent product!</li>
            <li>Good luck to everyone and feel free to email me if you have any questions...</li>
            <li>Good price for good product, does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>So, I used Garnier Medium ash (cool) brown, I LOVED the results - a nice medium ash brown....</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing; it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>However, I use 75 drops per hair color which is much more than they say to use.    </li>
            <li>For every step along the way, I use the UNRED additive with 5 pumps of Goldwell SilkLift Serum, his hair, even though its processing several times, is an excellent condition because of the products being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love experimenting with my hair</li>
            <li>Oh, one more thing, I&#x27;ve also started to take Biotin by Natrol, bc</li>
            <li>But, if you figure out the right ratio of purple and conditioner, it can get you a really good result.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you put the right amount in!</li>
            <li>it really makes doing my own hair easy.</li>
            <li>2: I use 20Vol developer and 9BG/9NN with 1 packet of &amp;#34;Ardell&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Unred&amp;#34;, the color arrives perfectly as a 9 neutral with little ash...</li>
            <li>The second time, the color came out great, not brassy.  </li>
            <li>Instead, do highlights and make your way to a light color.</li>
            <li>since I am going for a light ash brown color</li>
            <li>Great produkt, took the red tones out of my brown hair.</li>
            <li>Great product, wish I could find in larger sizes.</li>
            <li>Great results to help balance red tones and cancel out brashness.</li>
            <li>your hair is red or really copper, this UNRED will help, you may have to use 80 drops (2 packets) for best results.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not the ashy color I want at the first place, but it has become a lot more good-looking.</li>
            <li>she can handle it right!</li>
            <li>Ardell Unred takes out the red tones in my hair and keeps my color bright.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, good luck to all of you and definitely give ardell unred a try!</li>
            <li>I do a full dye job every 6 weeks</li>
            <li>Between full color jobs</li>
            <li>It is a good product though, I had to order a much smaller size from somebody else.</li>
            <li>when reds or coppers appear but are not so intense that I have to start over, I use Unred with 10A and 10-20Vol as a toner, this usually works perfectly, depending on what he&#x27;s been using in his hair between colors.</li>

            <li>A little tricky to use and stains anything it touches but over all I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>Bought this out of desperation after the Nice and Easy hair color I&#x27;ve been using for years began to leave extremely noticeable brassy tones.  </li>
            <li>so I was experimenting with the purple dye, I found that mixing blue and purple actually give me a pretty good result!</li>
            <li>I get a rich warm color instead of an orangy mess.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural light brunette and am now fighting the dreaded gray.  </li>
            <li>Mind that if you buy a lighter shade of color than your hair color, it will only leaves you more orange.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years to remove the red tint from my hair and</li>
            <li>I had bright red hair when I was a baby, blondish hair when I was a kid, and now mousy dishwater blonde hair as an</li>
            <li>It is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I notice that if he uses certain shampoo / conditioner, his hair will become brassy within 30 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I notice that if he uses certain shampoo / conditioner, his hair will become brassy within 30 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>who now has lots of gray concentrated in certain areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using 30vol with 9NN &amp; 9A, the hair turns brassy brass and becomes a shade closer to 10G to 10RG or K (copper), too light and very brassy, especially brassy on the roots.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll see that this is a real bargain &amp; why I recommend this product &amp; seller.</li>
            <li>It really helped to remove the redness from my blond coloration.</li>
            <li>but he wants a blend between Sahara Beige (9GB) and Tourmaline (9GN) and NO Golds or Reds detected at all</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t affect the outcome of the dye/ bleach and it gives your hair so much nutrition.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; Unred is not permanent, so you really aren&#x27;t risking much by trying it</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the result</li>
            <li>your hair is red or really copper, this UNRED will help, you may have to use 80 drops (2 packets) for best results.f &amp;#34;Color Fix&amp;#34;, I have to repeat step 1 two or three times to pull it as a pale yellow using 30 vol, 30vol is SO</li>
            <li>I have medium to light brown hair naturally, but have been dyeing it at home for several years.</li>
            <li>unless I&#x27;m out of Color Fix, then I use 30Vol with UNRED), applying color fix to roots first, for the first 10 minutes trying to remain only on the roots then apply to remainder of head.</li>
            <li>Without this product, my dye job would have too much red that would quickly wash out to orange.  </li>
            <li>I am suffering a little hair loss from bleaching and dying so many times to get the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>use Clairol Professional haircolor from Sally, and this product thickens the liquid so much that it doesn&#x27;t come out of the applicator bottle.  </li>
            <li>However, the problem is, how much time you need to figure out the right amount and how long you can handle the purple/orange hair.</li>
            <li>I still have red highlights in the sun, which I never had with the L&#x27;Oreal drabber, but it&#x27;s a whole lot better than with any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Here&#x27;s the formula that finally works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: I use &amp;#34;Color Fix&amp;#34; by &amp;#34;One n&#x27; Only&amp;#34;, first (</li>
            <li>I dislike red in my hair and this permits me to add an extra layer of protection to the colorant to make absolutely sure I have no red highlights.</li>
            <li>The first time I didn&#x27;t put enough drops, so it had lesser of a positive effect.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a little tip for my girls who are like me, just want a light ash brown</li>
            <li>( The formula is from a professional colorist)  </li>
            <li>I use about 35 drops per ounce of hair color (70 drops for a full bottle of color) and this tones down the red a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>I bleached my hair once and mixed ardell unred with ion dark ash blonde because the dye is darker than my bleached hair, the &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; toner will be able to cover up my orangeness.</li>
            <li>The problem is that my hair has always kept that reddish undertone, and it comes out FULL FORCE (in the form of red, orange, pink, you name it) when I lighten it.</li>
            <li>this was less effective than Ardell&#x27;s other product for reducing both red and gold tones.</li>
            <li>My natural hair is black and EVERY single time I&#x27;ve had my hair dyed (whether by professionals or at home), my hair has always had a strong orange/red tone.  </li>
            <li>BUT....as always, within a matter of washing it a few times (I wash my hair every other day, I&#x27;d go longer but I&amp;#34;m neurotic about clean hair ;-))</li>
            <li>Every professional coloring I&#x27;ve had has turned my hair red!  </li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t want to bleach my hair to blond and dye back to a ash brown, and I almost dye my hair back to dark brown because there&#x27;s no way I can do a light ash brown color.</li>
            <li>adult-- i.e. I dye it a lighter brighter medium blonde.</li>
            <li>it is worth spending a few hundreds dollar to save your hair from yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is a light brown, some ashy tones but it can get a lot of red hues in it due to my heritage (Irish, Italian and German) and I don&#x27;t like the color of that.  </li>

            <li> this was less effective than Ardell&#x27;s other product for reducing both red and gold tones.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is black and EVERY single time I&#x27;ve had my hair dyed (whether by professionals or at home), my hair has always had a strong orange/red tone.  </li>
            <li> BUT....as always, within a matter of washing it a few times (I wash my hair every other day, I&#x27;d go longer but I&amp;#34;m neurotic about clean hair ;-))</li>
            <li> Every professional coloring I&#x27;ve had has turned my hair red!  </li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t want to bleach my hair to blond and dye back to a ash brown, and I almost dye my hair back to dark brown because there&#x27;s no way I can do a light ash brown color.</li>
            <li> adult-- i.e. I dye it a lighter brighter medium blonde.</li>
            <li> it is worth spending a few hundreds dollar to save your hair from yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is a light brown, some ashy tones but it can get a lot of red hues in it due to my heritage (Irish, Italian and German) and I don&#x27;t like the color of that.  </li>
            <li> I am a dark brunette with lots of natural gold and red highlights......</li>
            <li> I use this on a guy&#x27;s hair which is 50%-60% grey with a dark sandy blonde natural color, which is about a 7-8 BG color on Goldwell&#x27;s topchic chart.</li>

            <li> 30 minutes brings a 7 to a 9 or 10, the hair arrives at a pale banana yellow color...</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m out of &amp;#34;Color Fix&amp;#34;, I have to repeat step 1 two or three times to pull it as a pale yellow using 30 vol, 30vol is SO HARSH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to bleach my hair to a pale yellow/ white color,</li>

            <li> This thing just dark my hair a little, does not seem to eliminate red tones, I used mix with water and leave for 30 minutes, no difference, then I used mix with conditioner and leave for 10 minutes, and maybe it did something i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t recommend you to a hairdresser because sometimes they don&#x27;t even know how to work on dark hair.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the reddish tones (it&#x27;s still my hair, after all), but it minimizes them enough to avoid a crazy unnatural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few drops of Unred solves the problem.</li>

            <li> If you color your hair &amp; it turns out too red or brassy even tho the tint/color you used is correctly selected, this is a must-have. Color obtained from hair dyes can vary for several reasons, such as your present color or the amount of graying you may have. A few years ago, L&#x27;oreal discontinued their \\&quot;drabber\\&quot; &amp; this is the only acceptable replacement on the market. And with the few drops needed per each hair treatment, this package size will last you a looong time. Start with a smaller amount than they recommend &amp; you can adjust as needed. If you check other sellers for this item, you&#x27;ll see that this quantity PLUS the fact that they ship it free of charge with no minimum(not an Amazon shipped item), you&#x27;ll see that this is a real bargain &amp; why I recommend this product &amp; seller.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is black and EVERY single time I&#x27;ve had my hair dyed (whether by professionals or at home), my hair has always had a strong orange/red tone.  I&#x27;ve used only Ash colors for years to try to combat this which helps, but didn&#x27;t actually solve the problem. I came across Unred in a sample size and I was wowed by the results!  The color came out so nice, not brassy and orange!  I found this large 1oz size on Amazon for the best price and have used it twice since receiving it.  The first time I didn&#x27;t put enough drops, so it had lesser of a positive effect.  The second time, the color came out great, not brassy.  For a regular box dye from the drug store, I used 30 drops this time.  It says to use 10 drops per ounce of hair color.  I just did my roots this time and it matched the color perfectly even though I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in 2 months and the color had gotten lighter with washings etc.</li>
            <li> It was my fault. I need the one in the purple box will keep buying as long as I&lt;br /&gt;Do my own hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I received it very quickly! A much better deal online than in Sallys! However, I use 75 drops per hair color which is much more than they say to use.    Martha</li>
            <li> Ardell Unred takes out the red tones in my hair and keeps my color bright.  I mix a few drops with my hair conditioner and leave on my hair for several minutes.  A bottle lasts a long time.  It is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bought this out of desperation after the Nice and Easy hair color I&#x27;ve been using for years began to leave extremely noticeable brassy tones.  Adding the Ardell product to the very same coloring agent I&#x27;d been using miraculously changed everything.  Don&#x27;t hesitate, this will work to tone your hair down too.  The insert in the packaging also instructs that the product can be added to shampoo if you&#x27;re not ready to color again.  Worth every cent to look your best!</li>
            <li> I have medium to light brown hair naturally, but have been dyeing it at home for several years. I usually use a dark ash blonde shade, and my hair usually ends up a golden blonde with lots of red/orange tones. I decided to try L&#x27;Oreal Preference 8 1/2A Champagne Blonde and use the Ardell. It turned the dye a dark purple/black like the other reviews mentioned, and I only used 5 drops, which is much less than they say to use. I could tell a difference as soon as my hair dried- my hair was lighter than I&#x27;ve ever been able to take it, but instead of seeing more orange or red, I saw much less- I look closer to a blonde instead of a strawberry blonde. I have also mixed some into my conditioner and used it that way. Next time, I&#x27;ll be adding the recommended amount to the hair dye. I&#x27;m really impressed that a cheaper product like this can get me close to the hair color I&#x27;ve been wanting for years.</li>
            <li> Every professional coloring I&#x27;ve had has turned my hair red!  Then I found this at Sally&#x27;s and it saved by hair, but then Sally&#x27;s discontinued it.  It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that keeps my hair from turning red when coloring and in the 1 ounce size I don&#x27;t have to order as often.  I&#x27;m a natural light brunette and am now fighting the dreaded gray.  You need to play with the number of drops needed for your particular hair, but this is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> have been using this for years. it really makes doing my own hair easy. gets rid of red highlights and allows my color to be the ashy blonde i want</li>
            <li> It really helped to remove the redness from my blond coloration. However it is not permanent, you need to do it every 2 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> I use this on a guy&#x27;s hair which is 50%-60% grey with a dark sandy blonde natural color, which is about a 7-8 BG color on Goldwell&#x27;s topchic chart. I use the packets (2ml each) and just now found the 1oz bottle, here, and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1oz is 600 drops. The packets are 2ml so they&#x27;re pre-measured at 40 drops per packet, I use a brush instead of a bottle as this thickens the color, makes it look like black ink (doesn&#x27;t stain, for me anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using 30vol with 9NN &amp; 9A, the hair turns brassy brass and becomes a shade closer to 10G to 10RG or K (copper), too light and very brassy, especially brassy on the roots. I&#x27;ve figured out a formula for a guy&#x27;s &amp;#34;sandy blonde&amp;#34; color.  Here&#x27;s the formula that finally works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: I use &amp;#34;Color Fix&amp;#34; by &amp;#34;One n&#x27; Only&amp;#34;, first (unless I&#x27;m out of Color Fix, then I use 30Vol with UNRED), applying color fix to roots first, for the first 10 minutes trying to remain only on the roots then apply to remainder of head. This remains on the head for 20-30 minutes (can go longer or multiple times to remove pigment). 30 minutes brings a 7 to a 9 or 10, the hair arrives at a pale banana yellow color... I like the color it arrives at at this point, I&#x27;d rather just tone it and make the color a perfect 10 but he wants a blend between Sahara Beige (9GB) and Tourmaline (9GN) and NO Golds or Reds detected at all, otherwise I have to start over, if he sees any reds/brass, I have to start over. So, I have to adjust everything each time I color his hair. The Color Fix removes pigment but it doesn&#x27;t damage his hair, I&#x27;m not sure how Color Fix works without damaging but it does indeed work. It helps to use Dual Senses Shampoo/Cond+Treatment &amp; Moroccanoil daily. Unred mixed with Conditioner once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: I use 20Vol developer and 9BG/9NN with 1 packet of &amp;#34;Ardell&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Unred&amp;#34;, the color arrives perfectly as a 9 neutral with little ash... USUALLY. When I&#x27;m out of &amp;#34;Color Fix&amp;#34;, I have to repeat step 1 two or three times to pull it as a pale yellow using 30 vol, 30vol is SO HARSH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On occasion, when reds or coppers appear but are not so intense that I have to start over, I use Unred with 10A and 10-20Vol as a toner, this usually works perfectly, depending on what he&#x27;s been using in his hair between colors. I notice that if he uses certain shampoo / conditioner, his hair will become brassy within 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3 is toner: 10A with 1 packet Ardell Unred using 10Vol (or 20Vol for 1 level lift) to tone out any remaining gold/red/copper hues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: Once a week, after shampooing, equal amounts of Unred and Goldwell DualSenses conditioner applied to towel dried hair cuts brassy buildup, 5 minutes letting it sit on hair then rinse, it works and doesn&#x27;t turn blue! Many kinds of red cutting products will turn hair blueish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that 1 packet of UNRED (or 40 drops of UNRED) is usually the only amount needed for moving from a 7 to a proper 9. For every step along the way, I use the UNRED additive with 5 pumps of Goldwell SilkLift Serum, his hair, even though its processing several times, is an excellent condition because of the products being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is red or really copper, this UNRED will help, you may have to use 80 drops (2 packets) for best results.f &amp;#34;Color Fix&amp;#34;, I have to repeat step 1 two or three times to pull it as a pale yellow using 30 vol, 30vol is SO HARSH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On occasion, when reds or coppers appear but are not so intense that I have to start over, I use Unred with 10A and 10-20Vol as a toner, this usually works perfectly, depending on what he&#x27;s been using in his hair between colors.

            <li> I use about 35 drops per ounce of hair color (70 drops for a full bottle of color) and this tones down the red a whole lot.  I still have red highlights in the sun, which I never had with the L&#x27;Oreal drabber, but it&#x27;s a whole lot better than with any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Clairol Professional haircolor from Sally, and this product thickens the liquid so much that it doesn&#x27;t come out of the applicator bottle.  I&#x27;ve switched to the stuff in the tube and apply with a brush.</li>
            <li> Use this in a darkest ash brown hair color and have not had a problem with any red showing up. I dislike red in my hair and this permits me to add an extra layer of protection to the colorant to make absolutely sure I have no red highlights.</li>
            <li> Good price for good product, does exactly what it says. Sally&#x27;s stopped carrying this for some reason, so glad I found here!</li>
            <li> This thing just dark my hair a little, does not seem to eliminate red tones, I used mix with water and leave for 30 minutes, no difference, then I used mix with conditioner and leave for 10 minutes, and maybe it did something i don&#x27;t know.

            <li> My hair tends to go to red no matter what color I use. A few drops of Unred solves the problem.</li>
            <li> It did help to reduce the brass and redness, a bit. this was less effective than Ardell&#x27;s other product for reducing both red and gold tones.</li>
            <li> if Redkin et al turns your hair orange and you don&#x27;t want to use an ash formula, use this. Take it to the salon.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of ways to make my hair look &amp;#34;ash,&amp;#34; but nothing helps. Yet, THIS helps to tone down my orange brown hair a lot!!!! I am not a blonde, so purple shampoo, Toner, etc. never helps. I definitely don&#x27;t want to bleach my hair to blond and dye back to a ash brown, and I almost dye my hair back to dark brown because there&#x27;s no way I can do a light ash brown color. But I gave this a go, and I am very happy that I did because it does work! Although it&#x27;s not the ashy color I want at the first place, but it has become a lot more good-looking. Here&#x27;s a little tip for my girls who are like me, just want a light ash brown color.&lt;br /&gt;1. If you can, don&#x27;t bleach all your hair at once. Instead, do highlights and make your way to a light color. I am suffering a little hair loss from bleaching and dying so many times to get the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; color.&lt;br /&gt;2. Do coconut oil hair mask before and after process. It won&#x27;t affect the outcome of the dye/ bleach and it gives your hair so much nutrition.&lt;br /&gt;3. since I am going for a light ash brown color and I don&#x27;t want to bleach my hair to a pale yellow/ white color, toner and purple shampoo will never going to work on the level of color I want. So sisters, don&#x27;t waste your money on it if you only want a brown color.&lt;br /&gt;4. I bleached my hair once and mixed ardell unred with ion dark ash blonde because the dye is darker than my bleached hair, the &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; toner will be able to cover up my orangeness. Mind that if you buy a lighter shade of color than your hair color, it will only leaves you more orange.&lt;br /&gt;5. Because we need a darker shade to cover the orange-ness, you have to be prepared that the result will be darker.&lt;br /&gt;6. People always say buy a demi-permenant purple dye mix with conditioner will get rid of the orange-ness, but it never works on me. Well, maybe it helps a little when my hair actually turned purple and when the purple fades, it becomes ashy. But I never want to have purple hair, so I can&#x27;t use this method.&lt;br /&gt;7. But, if you figure out the right ratio of purple and conditioner, it can get you a really good result. However, the problem is, how much time you need to figure out the right amount and how long you can handle the purple/orange hair. I almost give up my hair so I was experimenting with the purple dye, I found that mixing blue and purple actually give me a pretty good result! BUT! it only last for a few washes because the color is based on conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;8. Buy good hair product, treat your hair well. I won&#x27;t recommend you to a hairdresser because sometimes they don&#x27;t even know how to work on dark hair. But definitely go to a hairdresser if you know he/she can handle it right! it is worth spending a few hundreds dollar to save your hair from yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, good luck to all of you and definitely give ardell unred a try!</li>
            <li> Great product please stop going up in the price!!!  It was 3$ cheaper last night!  Ugh makes me so mad!</li>
            <li> My hair is a light brown, some ashy tones but it can get a lot of red hues in it due to my heritage (Irish, Italian and German) and I don&#x27;t like the color of that.  I&#x27;ve dyed/highlighted my hair for about 20 years, and I decided to dye it darker, which people actually like.  So, I used Garnier Medium ash (cool) brown, I LOVED the results - a nice medium ash brown....BUT....as always, within a matter of washing it a few times (I wash my hair every other day, I&#x27;d go longer but I&amp;#34;m neurotic about clean hair ;-)) the red comes out.  So, I took my Pantene conditioner and some mayonnaise (great conditioner) and 10 drops of the Unred, I let it sit for an hour.  I washed my hair and there&#x27;s was no real difference. ;-(  So, I&#x27;m going to add it to my hair dye the next time I do it. Here&#x27;s hoping! I&#x27;m also ordering Jhirmack shampoo - my hair is not blond but I&#x27;m hoping this will bring out the ashy tones in my hair and decrease the red tones.  I also am going to use Revlon Frost and Glow highlights in a few months to break up the medium brown hair.  Anyway, it&#x27;s an experiment, but what I CAN say is this; Unred is not permanent, so you really aren&#x27;t risking much by trying it, I think it&#x27;s best to add it to your hair color.  I also think you should ALWAYS use ASH tones when you color your hair if you do not want red - it&#x27;s not a 100% solution against getting red tones BUT it does help.  Good luck to everyone and feel free to email me if you have any questions...I love experimenting with my hair ;-) Oh, one more thing, I&#x27;ve also started to take Biotin by Natrol, bc all this dyeing and highlighting has made me loose hair (and stress and being 45 ;-(( so, I&#x27;ll keep you posted on how (if) that works!!!</li>
            <li> Great produkt, took the red tones out of my brown hair. A little tricky to use and stains anything it touches but over all I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> I used about 20 drops of this product blended into my Ion Brilliance Lightening Creme bleach and I do believe it helped a lot to reduce the orange/red/yellow brassiness that results when lifting color from a dark brown color dyed hair to blond. I would give it 2.5 stars, if I could rate it that way. I wear gloves whenever I&#x27;m doing color so the purple/blue fingers were never an issue, and it didn&#x27;t stain my scalp or face.  I had no problems with wiping spills off the white floors or in my white enclosed shower/bathtub.  I find it awfully expensive for what it is, though. I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It simply works! I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the result I active with this product! I used it in combination whit a purple toning shampoo...and I don&#x27;t have any red/orange in my hair anymore ((: sooo happy!</li>
            <li> Very happy with Unred. I have used it for many years to remove the red tint from my hair and the price was the best I have ever purchased it at.</li>
            <li> Great, great stuff. I had bright red hair when I was a baby, blondish hair when I was a kid, and now mousy dishwater blonde hair as an adult-- i.e. I dye it a lighter brighter medium blonde. The problem is that my hair has always kept that reddish undertone, and it comes out FULL FORCE (in the form of red, orange, pink, you name it) when I lighten it. This stuff is amazing; it makes a huge difference. When I don&#x27;t use it, it shows. It doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the reddish tones (it&#x27;s still my hair, after all), but it minimizes them enough to avoid a crazy unnatural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: I always use &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; blonde tones to help with this cause, along with this stuff. Together, red is kept to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
            <li> It works great! Just make sure that you put the right amount in!</li>
            <li> Great product, wish I could find in larger sizes. Great results to help balance red tones and cancel out brashness.</li>
            <li> Could not live without this product!  I am a dark brunette with lots of natural gold and red highlights......who now has lots of gray concentrated in certain areas.  Coloring my hair is difficult.  Without this product, my dye job would have too much red that would quickly wash out to orange.  I do a full dye job every 6 weeks and I add a drabber  from Wella to my dye formula. ( The formula is from a professional colorist)  Between full color jobs I do a touch-up about every 10 days and add Unred to the boxed product I use.  I get a rich warm color instead of an orangy mess.  I have also added this product to my shampoo to tone down any orange tones.</li>
            <li> keeps the red overtones from saturating your hair when it is mixed into the haircolr itself, keeps brassiness dpwn a minimum</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and I never received it.I got an email saying it was shipped then days later I got another email saying they were out of this product. I would think they would know they were out when it was ordered,not after they contacted me and said it was shipped.It is a good product though, I had to order a much smaller size from somebody else.</li>
