            <li>Although, because the color is so gorgeous I&#x27;m not returning it.  </li>
            <li>Fairly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I just did one quick coat to try it out on one finger and the coverage is incredible!</li>
            <li>Very pretty color and a perfect addition for my nail art.  </li>
            <li>and I am fully satisfied!</li>
            <li>My husband even commented on how nice the color was</li>
            <li>but I did not expect the coverage to be so great on the first coat.</li>
            <li>I used Dior gel top coat</li>
            <li>I just love ZOYA...</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish.</li>

            <li>I would not hesitate to order more from this seller.</li>
            <li>Love the Zoya brand.</li>
            <li>I did like it more after wearing it all day.</li>
            <li>Zoya is my favorite polish.  </li>
            <li>Top notch.  </li>
            <li>I had never purchased/used a Zoya nail polish before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice pastel, is opaque, and the color is true to the pictures.</li>
            <li>But, I saw this color during a monthly favorites video on youtube and thought it was the perfect summer light blue and decided to try it out.  </li>
            <li>Zoya polishes on the other hand are incredible!</li>
            <li>Brush is easy to control.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care, it is too fabulous to leave on the shelf till Spring.</li>
            <li>Plus, ZOYA has a huge variety of colors available.</li>
            <li>I like that their polishes are free of toluene, formaldehye, DBP, and camphor.</li>
            <li>&quot; the first coat can show some streaks, but thereafter is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I own many different colors of ZOYA polishes and ZOYA</li>
            <li>The light blue really stands out and is a great color for spring.</li>
            <li>Super pigmented.</li>
            <li>This is so creamy and pretty!</li>
            <li>and he rarely notices that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>The polishes go on smoothly and the polishes last longer than most polishes do.</li>
            <li>A nail polish worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get complete coverage with two coats.  </li>
            <li>Because it has so much white in this blue shade, it stands out beautifully.</li>
            <li>i cant say enough its amazing nail polish its thick, the colour is so beautiful ( excactly what you see on the online nail polish bottle), and the brush good quality too.its expensive but it worth the money for sure</li>
            <li>the perfect pale blue color.</li>
            <li>Even more importantly, it lasts longer without chipping on my nails than any other brand (about a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I noticed so many pretty and different colors coming out of the Zoya line.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely shade of pale blue and my favorite of all of the blue polishes I currently own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a pretty, summery light blue.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery with no problems, and the bottle of polish was individually hand-wrapped in bubble paper that was then securely taped and inside the mailer packaging to prevent damage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear blue nail polish colors because of my skin tone (olive), but this one is a beautiful, sunny, spring shade that I would describe as a &#x27;light blue sky&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Complete success</li>
            <li>Wears very well too.</li>
            <li>and when zoya finally released it i had to buy it right away!</li>
            <li>It is rather more white than blue</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I really like both the color and the consistency of this nail polish, very easy to put on (not too liquid, not too thick) and it doesn&#x27;t get thicker in the bottle even after a year.</li>
            <li>I am somewhat new to the Zoya line, I was an OPI fan.  </li>
            <li>I have found that more watery formulas are more prone to streaking, messy, and too thin of a coat.</li>
            <li>It looked different online, kinda flat and reminds me of light blue chalk in person.</li>
            <li>Love the color, but ultimately it was very difficult to apply precisely</li>
            <li>as I thought it would need several coats, but the color is vibrant and solid with just one coat!  </li>
            <li>The polish is not sheer and covers completely in one coat.</li>
            <li>This color is such a pretty pale blue</li>
            <li>Very pretty, delicate blue.</li>

            <li> Not worth the time and loss of postage to send it back, so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> It works with almost every color - white, black, pinks, grey, other blues and greens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still wearing this color even though some people consider this a summer/spring shade.  </li>
            <li> The polish color is just what I had expected and hoped that it would be.</li>

            <li> I also like that the consistency is on the thick side.</li>
            <li> and I found problems with bubbles and chipping because it was so thick.  </li>
            <li> Not a great formula either.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the color &amp;#34;blu&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> I have neutral, medium, skin tone and this shade looks gorgeous with almost every color I wear. Because it has so much white in this blue shade, it stands out beautifully. I also like that the consistency is on the thick side. I have found that more watery formulas are more prone to streaking, messy, and too thin of a coat. This is my 1st purchase of the Zoya brand and it has lasts the longest on my nails.</li>
            <li> Zola polish is the best</li>
            <li> I was just in Mexico and saw somebody with this color on their nails &amp; has to have it! Just got my Zoya polish in the mail and tried it. It&#x27;s beautiful! I just did one quick coat to try it out on one finger and the coverage is incredible! Usually with such light colors it&#x27;s hard to prevent streaky coverage. This is so creamy and pretty! Yay!</li>
            <li> I really like both the color and the consistency of this nail polish, very easy to put on (not too liquid, not too thick) and it doesn&#x27;t get thicker in the bottle even after a year.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this once I actually got it and tried the color on.  Not a great formula either.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful on.  I used Dior gel top coat and it stayed put with no chipping.  My husband even commented on how nice the color was and he rarely notices that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat new to the Zoya line, I was an OPI fan.  But I noticed so many pretty and different colors coming out of the Zoya line.  Plus, Zoya has always been a 5-free nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this polish \\&quot;Blu,\\&quot; the first coat can show some streaks, but thereafter is lovely.  It is a dreamy chalky blue.  Very pretty color and a perfect addition for my nail art.  It works with almost every color - white, black, pinks, grey, other blues and greens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still wearing this color even though some people consider this a summer/spring shade.  I don&#x27;t care, it is too fabulous to leave on the shelf till Spring.</li>
            <li> I just love ZOYA...I own many different colors of ZOYA polishes and ZOYA never disappoints. The polishes go on smoothly and the polishes last longer than most polishes do. Plus, ZOYA has a huge variety of colors available.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish. It&#x27;s creamy and goes on perfect not to mention the color is beautiful.</li>

            <li> This is the best chalky pastel for those who love summery milky colors. Would buy again! Wear lasted long and did not chip with 2 coats.</li>
            <li> This color is such a pretty pale blue but I did not expect the coverage to be so great on the first coat. Wears very well too. Love the Zoya brand.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, delicate blue. Could be worn for weddings with a matching dress.  Some blue nail polishes don&#x27;t work but this one does</li>
            <li> i cant say enough its amazing nail polish its thick, the colour is so beautiful ( excactly what you see on the online nail polish bottle), and the brush good quality too.its expensive but it worth the money for sure</li>
            <li> the perfect pale blue color. this is so gorgeous. i&#x27;ve been looking for a color like this forever and when zoya finally released it i had to buy it right away!</li>
            <li> It is rather more white than blue but I may just not think it looks that great on me.  I did like it more after wearing it all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime OPI user, but after trying Zoya, it&#x27;s the only brand i buy now. I like that their polishes are free of toluene, formaldehye, DBP, and camphor. Even more importantly, it lasts longer without chipping on my nails than any other brand (about a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty, summery light blue. It&#x27;s a nice pastel, is opaque, and the color is true to the pictures. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Super pigmented. You can get away with one coat. Brush is easy to control.</li>
            <li> Finally! A nail polish worth the price.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of OPI as I don&#x27;t think it works well enough for me to spend $9 on.  Zoya polishes on the other hand are incredible! I&#x27;m an art teacher and it will easily last me 3 days before it chips- I&#x27;ve NEVER had a nail polish last that long!  I was skeptical about the color &amp;#34;blu&amp;#34; as I thought it would need several coats, but the color is vibrant and solid with just one coat!  I&#x27;m only purchasing zoya polishes from now on!</li>
            <li> It looked different online, kinda flat and reminds me of light blue chalk in person. Not worth the time and loss of postage to send it back, so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely shade of pale blue and my favorite of all of the blue polishes I currently own.  I do a lot of nail stamping and this is perfect for that.  I was able to get complete coverage with two coats.  Easy to apply.  This is a good color for spring and summer but I am thinking I will be using it also in the winter to do some snowflake stamping nail art. Zoya is my favorite polish.  Top notch.  I highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I have pale, cool-toned skin and this looked great on me. The light blue really stands out and is a great color for spring. Creme finish that shines (i.e. not matte). Fairly pigmented. Had a little trouble with bubbles. Didn&#x27;t chip.</li>
