            <li>He told me he needed some more cologne</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly, and we were very pleased.</li>

            <li>On me, this has a nice clean smell, and it is almost at the wholesale price.</li>
            <li>Great price for a decent amount of cologne.</li>
            <li>love it...have been using Stetson original for many years</li>
            <li>but it makes a a pleasant change from more masculine scents.</li>
            <li>THIS WAS EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>Smells great after mixing with my natural scent, and huge bottle.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because my dad loves strong, manly colognes.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, not too light.</li>
            <li>Nice, reasonably priced scent.</li>
            <li>it smells good but with in 1 hour you can barely smell the s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to best describe it, but to me it comes off as a woodsy smell, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>and I would make sure you know exactly what your buying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small size, perfect for a travel bag.</li>
            <li>True quality product and</li>
            <li>On the whole, quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I THINK I WILL END UP USING MORE THAN NORMAL.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to sample cologne, or to commit to cologne for less than a year.</li>
            <li>You will be in Heaven tonight if you use it before that Hot Date!</li>
            <li>You will have them all looking at you as you pass and thinking things that most people would blush over if spoken out loud!</li>
            <li>and it is well worth the price</li>
            <li>I wish there were bigger bottles at a cost effective price</li>
            <li>and you get what you want for less money - without having to leave your own house!</li>
            <li>the price is right</li>
            <li>it is very heavy and just smells like cheap cologne I had heard good things about stetson</li>
            <li>Thanks for helping me make his gift special.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not single, but if I were to use cologne for dating, I wouldn&#x27;t select Stetson because it doesn&#x27;t have the sexy/clean qualities of more Ã  la mode colognes.</li>
            <li>Like this cologne very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thought about moving to a more premium \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; cologne, but the couple times I tried out others, I couldn&#x27;t really tell what would be the best for me, and only ended up confused at all the choices.</li>
            <li>It has been hard to find this item in stores, so I was happy to see it offered online.  </li>
            <li>Price is better than found in a CVS or similar store.</li>
            <li>The price was better than what we could find here locally.</li>
            <li>I have been using Stetson cologne since it was first introduced.</li>
            <li>Stetson scent is very &#x27;Dad,&#x27; which is fine for professional settings.</li>
            <li>old school original.  </li>
            <li>AND I RECEIVED MORE THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li>TO ME IT DOES NOT SMELL AS INTENSE AS WHEN IN A NON SPRAY BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>I am assuming the person liked it as he did not say that he disliked it to me.</li>
            <li>I like the Stetson cologne spray best there is very little waste.  </li>
            <li>No reason to switch, really, cause the main reason I even use cologne at all, is that women like a nice-smelling man.</li>
            <li>but he just seems to always revert back to tried and true Stetson.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of different brands competing with the space on our dresser top, but this is the only one that ever gets used.</li>
            <li>Been using it ever since high school, 25 years ago.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend</li>
            <li>It is far better than the most expensive, exotic pherimones and is a lot less in pricey.</li>
            <li>Always get good feed back -- it&#x27;s not overwhelming or does it smell like perfume....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this since I was a very young man.</li>
            <li>Almost &amp;#34;butterscotchy&amp;#34; but in a masculine way.</li>
            <li>I am not a huge cologne wearer, however, I do enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s unavailable at most stores here where I live, so I order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a hard to find product in stores which was a special requested gift for an elderly man.</li>

            <li> This is a hard to find product in stores which was a special requested gift for an elderly man.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s quite a &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; as the last bottle I had, so Coty may be diluting it a bit from the more expensive one you buy directly from Stetson, but I may be imagining this.  </li>
            <li> The product was packaged extremely well and delivery time was phenomenally short.  </li>
            <li> I have used English Leather and a few others  back in the day.</li>
            <li> you would have to spary half of the god dam bottle for it to last all day</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I have used Stetson in the past and went to Amazon because where I live it is not available.  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering, subtle, but lasting.</li>
            <li> P.S. Stetson is a little flowery like a woman&#x27;s perfume</li>
            <li> The smell vaguely reminds me of an old school barbershop.</li>
            <li> Bought now that Stetson black is so hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have never, never, EVER met a woman who did not love this scent.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help saying that this mens cologne might be a little weak.</li>
            <li> small size to keep in the truck!</li>
            <li> Manufacturer&#x27;s cost cutting?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go bad, so at the price, I can load up.</li>

I&#x27;ve thought about moving to a more premium \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; cologne, but the couple times I tried out others, I couldn&#x27;t really tell what would be the best for me, and only ended up confused at all the choices. No reason to switch, really, cause the main reason I even use cologne at all, is that women like a nice-smelling man. And since I&#x27;ve only received compliments with Stetson, why shouldn&#x27;t I just stick with what works?</li>
            <li> My husband has used this scent for years, smells great for a great price.  Price is better than found in a CVS or similar store.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time after a show - lasts forever</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find product in stores which was a special requested gift for an elderly man. Great masculine smell, great price! Thanks for helping me make his gift special.</li>
            <li> I have used Stetson in the past and went to Amazon because where I live it is not available.  I like it and I think that is all I need to say to make the word count.</li>
            <li> Love it,and lots of good comments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Stetson products. This will make a great Christmas gift for my uncle. A great product.</li>
            <li> Bought for a gift. Arrived quickly. Good price.</li>
            <li> Now my go-to day to day cologne. No sweetness or fruitiness to the scent. The smell vaguely reminds me of an old school barbershop.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for years, My wife loves It.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. I am a repeat user and like the price.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift.  I am assuming the person liked it as he did not say that he disliked it to me.</li>
            <li> Smells great after mixing with my natural scent, and huge bottle. Bought now that Stetson black is so hard to find.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly, and we were very pleased.</li>
            <li> As advertised and delivered on time.  Good price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne about 8 years back and I refused to finish it up &#x27;cos I wanted another one. It is one of the best colognes I have ever used.</li>
            <li> As expected. Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Les</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent for years! It is inexpensive and not a fad type of fragrance. This is almost like my signature, people know it is me before they even see me. I have used English Leather and a few others  back in the day. On me, this has a nice clean smell, and it is almost at the wholesale price. Next time I will order 4 as opposed to only  this time. It doesn&#x27;t go bad, so at the price, I can load up. A 1 1/2 oz bottle lasts me a month, with daily use.</li>
            <li> old school original.  small size to keep in the truck!</li>
            <li> Almost &amp;#34;butterscotchy&amp;#34; but in a masculine way. Nice, reasonably priced scent.</li>
            <li> it smells good but with in 1 hour you can barely smell the s*** you would have to spary half of the god dam bottle for it to last all day</li>
            <li> Stetson is a timeless fragrance.  I bought it for my husband and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Good product for a great price</li>
            <li> I love the scent that almost lasts 8 hours! I have been using it for more than 6 years. Great prices here at Amazon!</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne. great price</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells. I&#x27;m not sure how to best describe it, but to me it comes off as a woodsy smell, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> The cologne arrived on time and in good condition. If you like Stetson, you&#x27;ll be satisfied. P.S. Stetson is a little flowery like a woman&#x27;s perfume but it makes a a pleasant change from more masculine scents.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT AND SERVICE. EVERYTHING WAS GOOD. I RECOMMEND THE SPRAY BOTTLE. WORE TI OUT TO EAT AND THE WAITRESS BOUGHT MY MEAL.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price !</li>
            <li> The classics don&#x27;t always go out of style!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it when I wear it!</li>
            <li> This cologne spray for men is great! It has a nice pleasant scent that is also very manly, yet it is not overpowering. I looked in local stores for it, but it was no wheres to be found.</li>
            <li> i loved the priduct and how cheap it is!!! and i would recommend buying it. it got here fast!!!! packaged well</li>
            <li> Women all XOXOXO this cologne on a man! It is far better than the most expensive, exotic pherimones and is a lot less in pricey. You will be in Heaven tonight if you use it before that Hot Date! There is simply nothing like the aroma and female draw and attraction of this cologne. You will have them all looking at you as you pass and thinking things that most people would blush over if spoken out loud!</li>
            <li> great price. fast shipping</li>
            <li> True quality product and this is why I buy it.  When you rely on a product that defines a man&#x27;s personality, this puts the punctuation on it.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves this cologne. Tried getting him to try out Oldspice, but he refuses to switch. Great price for a decent amount of cologne.</li>
            <li> I like this product my wife likes this also the price is right I use it every day quality packaging.</li>
            <li> Is a fragrance that I&#x27;ve loved for years. Not too strong, not too light. Most important, its my wife&#x27;s fav as well!</li>
            <li> I wish there were bigger bottles at a cost effective price but this was a good deal and it is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge cologne wearer, however, I do enjoy this product. I have been using it for years. Great manly, outdoorsy, scent. Not overpowering, subtle, but lasting. Lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne of all time. I have never, never, EVER met a woman who did not love this scent.  Been using it ever since high school, 25 years ago. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s unavailable at most stores here where I live, so I order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> love it...have been using Stetson original for many years</li>
            <li> Love this scent on my husband.</li>
            <li> This is one of my husband&#x27;s (and my) favorite colognes. The price was better than what we could find here locally. Great value. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I like the Stetson cologne spray best there is very little waste.  I also use Relm which is also a spray, that I buy form Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is very nice the smell and is not overpowering</li>
            <li> This is a great way to sample cologne, or to commit to cologne for less than a year. A standard bottle of cologne is a 2-3 year commitment, if used properly. With smaller samples like this one, I can switch it up every six months without feeling as though I&#x27;m wasting money and product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stetson scent is very &#x27;Dad,&#x27; which is fine for professional settings. I&#x27;m 24, and co-workers affirm this smells &#x27;like a grown man&#x27;s cologne.&#x27; I&#x27;m not single, but if I were to use cologne for dating, I wouldn&#x27;t select Stetson because it doesn&#x27;t have the sexy/clean qualities of more Ã  la mode colognes.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne at an even more fantastic price! Very easy online order  - and you get what you want for less money - without having to leave your own house!</li>
            <li> I do not like this product at all it smells like it came from the dollar store it is very heavy and just smells like cheap cologne I had heard good things about stetson and I would make sure you know exactly what your buying.</li>
            <li> It has been hard to find this item in stores, so I was happy to see it offered online.  It&#x27;s a small size, perfect for a travel bag.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s quite a &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; as the last bottle I had, so Coty may be diluting it a bit from the more expensive one you buy directly from Stetson, but I may be imagining this.  On the whole, quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of his on my husband.</li>
            <li> Great stuff even a country hick finds it great .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help saying that this mens cologne might be a little weak. Manufacturer&#x27;s cost cutting? I remember this to be a much more pungent  scent and lingered alot longer on my skin. Still good but wait for the bargains.</li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;s favorite and the price was good.</li>
            <li> I always shop for the best price on Amazon for my Stetson. Can always save money verses what I must pay locally. I have been using Stetson cologne since it was first introduced. My all time favorite plus the ladies compliment me when I wear. Just a spray or two is all it takes.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and price was good.</li>
            <li> Hey, my wife loves it, so I wear it.  What more can I say? - - - - - - -</li>
            <li> This is a favorite scent so I was overjoyed to obtain it at a greatly discounted price.  The product was packaged extremely well and delivery time was phenomenally short.  Things just don&#x27;t get better than this.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Seems to last. The hubby&#x27;s favorite scent. He&#x27;s been using it ever since I&#x27;ve known him. He&#x27;s tried more expensive brands (that I like) but he just seems to always revert back to tried and true Stetson. There&#x27;s a lot of different brands competing with the space on our dresser top, but this is the only one that ever gets used. The others are just more like expensive &#x27;decorations&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> You cant HIDE with this on...</li>
            <li> It seems to be the same as the store version, and it was a lot cheaper than anything I found at any local store.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because my dad loves strong, manly colognes. He told me he needed some more cologne and this is what I got him, and I guess he loves it. Since there are no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the last 10 years... Always get good feed back -- it&#x27;s not overwhelming or does it smell like perfume.... Highly recomend</li>
