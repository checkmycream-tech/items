            <li>She liked it very much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great price, product was exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>What she got smelled nothing like the original perfume -it</li>
            <li>I found that ordering through Amazon, I received a better price and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m now a loyal Amazon customer</li>

            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>well worth it to search.</li>
            <li>It is light, yet deep -- like light filtering through an afternoon forest.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>When she wore for the first time</li>
            <li>i have used this for 30 years and am only able to get it from you thanks and keep selling</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume for my wife because it is her long time favorite</li>
            <li>Amazingly, Amazon and Tuccini have it for less than I had paid for it years ago.      </li>
            <li>This has been my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume for a long time, and it is no longer available in our local department stores.</li>
            <li>the vendor, cosmetic solutions, tried to pull a fast one.</li>
            <li>My Son said he really likes it, so score one.</li>
            <li>paid for expedited shipping friday evening to have by the special day at the end of the next week...  </li>
            <li>got the perfume tuesday of the second week out...  not in time for her special day.....  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li>they were completely non-responsive to my emails trying to resolve this issue.</li>
            <li>Unless perhaps it&#x27;s been sitting around since the 70s or 80s and has completely changed scent.</li>
            <li>I have worn Lauren since the early 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>What is amazing is that she says it even smells WORSE than the super-cheap knock-off version  being sold out of the back of a trunk at a flea market for $5.</li>

            <li> my wife has been using this product for years and just loves it. i do too:)    the vendor, cosmetic solutions, tried to pull a fast one. I purchased a 4oz bottle but they sent me a 2oz bottle. they were completely non-responsive to my emails trying to resolve this issue. luckily, Amazon&#x27;s wonderful people assisted me and i was able to get this resolved. i&#x27;m now a loyal Amazon customer but i will never do any business with cosmetic solutions again.</li>

            <li> I received this item in perfect condition, and in a very short period of time.  I definitely will use this vender again.</li>
            <li> I have worn Lauren for over 20 years now and I continue to get compliments on it every time I wear it.  It is a wonderful fragrance that will never go out of style!</li>
            <li> I always have a difficult time finding my favorite perfume in department stores. I found that ordering through Amazon, I received a better price and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since the 70&#x27;s -- My daughter says she can&#x27;t smell it, she says it just \\&quot;smells like Mom.\\&quot;    It is light, yet deep -- like light filtering through an afternoon forest.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite of mine, and Amazon&#x27;s price was the best I found anywhere.</li>
            <li> i have used this for 30 years and am only able to get it from you thanks and keep selling</li>
            <li> We were very pleased with the timely shipment and received the product as ordered.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I love Lauren.  Can&#x27;t wear most perfumes but Lauren has never bother me.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance for many years.  Unable to find it easily in stores so I am thankful for the ability to order online.  Great service from the providing company.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not how I remembered it.  I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t smell the same since it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> This has been my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume for a long time, and it is no longer available in our local department stores. It made her (and my) Christmas nicer.</li>
            <li> I was worried as I could not get it in any stores so happy to find it on line. It is a great sent.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Worth the price.  If you think this might be what you&#x27;re looking for today, give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance for at least 30 years and it is now very difficult to find.  I have tried other colognes and keep going back to Lauren.  My husband also loves it on me and I still get so many compliments from everyone asking me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing after so many years of using it.  I was so happy to find Lauren on Amazon when no other stores carried it anymore!!!</li>
            <li> Not like the Lauren I remember. Unless perhaps it&#x27;s been sitting around since the 70s or 80s and has completely changed scent.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y ENTREGA DEL PRODUCTO, RAPIDO EL ENVIO Y MUY RESPONSABLE AL MOMENTO DEL EMBALAJE PARA UN TRANSPORTE HASTA VENEZUELA</li>
            <li> I have worn Lauren since the early 80&#x27;s. It is my scent and when I have tried other fragrances, I always return to Lauren. I agree with the other reviewer-my kids say it smells like mom.  I have found it harder and harder to find this product, especially the lotion; but well worth it to search. I just hope they continue to produce this scent-I would be lost without it.</li>
            <li> BLUF -Do NOT buy this from Amazon; there is no way to get your money back! My wife has been wearing Lauren for years and has loved it (and I love it on her). I decided to get it for her from Amazon as a gift because I had Amazon Prime. What she got smelled nothing like the original perfume -it smelled a LOT like the anti-ant spray we use on the patio. What is amazing is that she says it even smells WORSE than the super-cheap knock-off version  being sold out of the back of a trunk at a flea market for $5. I am out of 70 bucks and in the doghouse with my wife. At least I can use it to keep ants (and any other self-respecting bug) off of our patio!</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent for years, but it is no longer carried by the department stores in my area. I was happy to find this source.</li>
            <li> My wife was just about out of this product and want to get some more. Bought it for her birthday and was very happy to receive it. She likes the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, I love it and have been wearing it for years. I would highly recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> I am waiting to get this as a gift for my daughter-in-law.  My Son said he really likes it, so score one.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my wife because it is her long time favorite and when I took it out for her , I just simply blew her mind.  When she wore for the first time and I smelt it , it reminded me of when we just met.</li>
