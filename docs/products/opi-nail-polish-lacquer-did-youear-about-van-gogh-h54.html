            <li>Love the suttleness of this color!  </li>
            <li>but it should be nice.</li>
            <li>It is a nice tan, but it has some warmth to it that makes it stand out.</li>
            <li>Stays on nicely.</li>
            <li>but it looks so nice on my nails.</li>
            <li>that I kind of like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update</li>
            <li>This is a nice color if you have a tan.</li>
            <li>it is a nice &amp;#34;greige.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I wanted to have this kind of color in my polish box.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color, it matches everything and is really a nice take on a nude.</li>
            <li>I kind of love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of the grey/tan type.</li>
            <li>Thought this was going to be a more beige color.</li>
            <li>I love nude polishes.</li>
            <li>thank you very much, i love the colour</li>
            <li>In my opinion it looks better on darker skin tones (which I have).</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE THIS SHADE OF NUDE.</li>
            <li>I use the most.</li>
            <li>Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li>I had sooo many compliments.</li>
            <li>Ok so it&#x27;s been 10 minutes</li>
            <li>So maybe I kinda love this color because it&#x27;s \\&quot;different\\</li>
            <li>customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I love gray nail polish</li>
            <li>and together they are awesome for a colored french manicure.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Royal Rajah Ruby was my perfect color for a long time.</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking it would be a shade of nude, but it turned out to be more of a light taupe.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m easy to please when it comes to 50 shades.</li>
            <li>, is that the color can easily travel into the fall and winter.</li>
            <li>- I liked it that much!</li>
            <li>Cannot really return it, since nail polish is hazardous material.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice neutral and it goes on really well.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a light, creamy, close to off-white color.</li>
            <li>worn alone it has a greyish tone depending on how the light hits it.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very interesting warm kind of grey that completely suits me</li>
            <li>and I always feel very sophisticated and classy wearing this shade.</li>
            <li>This one looks clean.</li>
            <li>It gives off that kind of vibe and is a very mature color.</li>
            <li>I keep hunting out a nice shade of brown and this color is actually more grey toned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool-nude, not yellowish and is true to skin tone.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel classier than I really am. :]</li>
            <li>Any other color designs ontop of this nailpolish also look great.</li>
            <li>Lucky that I did not hurt my hand.</li>
            <li>I have tan skin and when i put this nailpolish on, it looks very pretty against my skin.</li>
            <li>It looks great on a dark skin.</li>
            <li>It is a great nude for me with a slight gray undertone.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite color of OPI.</li>
            <li>I am naturally tan and mostly, nude colors don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>My favorite nail polish by OPI by far and the color</li>
            <li>I just noticed my original review was one of the most helpful critical reviews,</li>
            <li>Much better looking color, more dark than on the pic.</li>
            <li>This color is amazing, its thats nude off gray color that is the perfect base to wear alone or with designs on.</li>
            <li>I had very low expectations going into buying this color because I wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of grey it would be.</li>
            <li>great color and long lasting polish</li>
            <li>I really like the color of this polish!</li>
            <li>When you first see this color you think ehh</li>
            <li>I went to the nail salon last Saturday, saw this color and fell in love with it IMMEDIATELY . . .</li>
            <li>be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s alright not something I think I&#x27;ll use much, let me be the first to tell you it&#x27;s a nail polish</li>
            <li>I had a a little animal print and tribal print on top of this color and it work!</li>
            <li>I literally got it done on my nails for two months straight.</li>
            <li>This color in real life is nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li>so much so that I purchased it within 24 hrs from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Like much of our wall paint</li>
            <li>it is a slightly weird and kind of dead-looking color in normal light, and looks classy like the picture in brighter light.</li>
            <li>This color looks so nice in contrast to my very dark brown skin!</li>
            <li>Might look better if you have an extremely dark complexion. ?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It has more body to it than Samoan Sand which is really pale to my mind.  </li>
            <li>thank you for the quick delivery, pretty color for the summer that can be dressed up if need be, not sure if i&#x27;ll use the cracked with it yet</li>
            <li>although I think this color would still look cool if I had a dark tan and look forward to finding out.</li>
            <li>It does tend to make you look a bit pale if you have light skin like I do.</li>
            <li>I have relatively pale skin (light)</li>
            <li>Everything I said previously is still true...</li>
            <li>The consistency is smooth the brush is thick like a normal OPI.</li>
            <li>Mine is medium tan and it kind of looks weird.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if you&#x27;re pale, you&#x27;re better off with a dark color like Get In the Espresso Lane, or Lincoln Park</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s so bad that it&#x27;s almost good.</li>

            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s so bad that it&#x27;s almost good.</li>
            <li> I would say that it should probably go on someone with either really dark skin or super pale.</li>
            <li> Also I almost always keep my nails painted and get bored easily with colors.</li>
            <li> Sucks because I was really looking forward to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;d be helpful to note that I&#x27;m suuuper pale now, especially compared to when Royal Rajah Ruby was my ultimate fave..</li>
            <li> I am a dark skin Black American and this definitely compliments my skin tone.</li>
            <li> &quot; enough not to be boring but not over the top different like lime green with hot pink and black or anything (which I sometimes do).</li>
            <li> Crushed bottle.</li>
            <li> but I think if you chugged a gallon of chocolate milk on an empty stomach and then puked, it might look something like this.</li>
            <li> The opi polish product is good as always but the color is horrible, flat gray.</li>
            <li> Pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I received my order before I expected to and the day I put it on I&#x27;ve been receiving compliments!</li>
            <li> Or maybe close to the color of Roger the alien from American Dad.</li>
            <li> After Dark.</li>
            <li> maybe b/c of my dark complexion.</li>
            <li> Oh worse color non-color ever.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s difficult to get the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; shade you&#x27;re looking for, just by looking at samples.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe I just have bad taste now</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> thank you for the quick delivery, pretty color for the summer that can be dressed up if need be, not sure if i&#x27;ll use the cracked with it yet but it should be nice.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite color of OPI. It is a nice tan, but it has some warmth to it that makes it stand out. It does tend to make you look a bit pale if you have light skin like I do.</li>
            <li> It is lighter than the color in the photo. It is not like some coffee-ish color. It&#x27;s more of the grey/tan type. I can&#x27;t pinpoint the shade but my sister said it looks good on me. I am naturally tan and mostly, nude colors don&#x27;t work for me. This one looks clean.</li>
            <li> The opi polish product is good as always but the color is horrible, flat gray. did not look like that in picture on line.</li>
            <li> Thought this was going to be a more beige color. I know it&#x27;s difficult to get the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; shade you&#x27;re looking for, just by looking at samples. It&#x27;s not that I won&#x27;t use this, just wish it was closer to what I wanted. Can&#x27;t beat OPI tho.....great polish!</li>
            <li> I loveeeeee this color! I literally got it done on my nails for two months straight. I love nude polishes. It&#x27;s the perfect taupe!</li>
            <li> Good color. Does what its supposed to do. Stays on nicely. I would say that it should probably go on someone with either really dark skin or super pale. Mine is medium tan and it kind of looks weird. Like grayish.</li>
            <li> great color and long lasting polish</li>
            <li> thank you very much, i love the colour, i think i looks just like the picture and i would recomend it</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with the speedy delivery of polish and the color (which is amazing)!  I am going to purchase another one so I don&#x27;t run out - I liked it that much!</li>
            <li> This color looks so nice in contrast to my very dark brown skin!</li>
            <li> This is the neutral shade I&#x27;ve been looking for! In my opinion it looks better on darker skin tones (which I have). Looks great on my nails. Love it!</li>
            <li> I keep hunting out a nice shade of brown and this color is actually more grey toned. Not at all like the photo.</li>
            <li> This color is one of my favorites by OPI. I am a dark skin Black American and this definitely compliments my skin tone. It is a great nude for me with a slight gray undertone. I received compliments while wearing this nail polish! Would recommend as well as repurchase</li>
            <li> Loved the neutral color.  Daughter took it!</li>
            <li> Arrived in an envelope. Crushed bottle. Pretty useless. Lucky that I did not hurt my hand. Cannot really return it, since nail polish is hazardous material. As is glass shards.</li>
            <li> I received my order before I expected to and the day I put it on I&#x27;ve been receiving compliments! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product and the speedy delivery! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really like the color of this polish! It&#x27;s a nice neutral and it goes on really well. You can get away with only one coat. I have swatches of this polish on my blog: [...]</li>
            <li> I received the package today. The packaging was great arrived in perfect condition! I gave 5 stars because the color matches the picture and matches with anything I wear ,all I did was apply a top coat over the polish and it looks great also the seller did a great job preparing for shipment! Thankyou!</li>
            <li> When you first see this color you think ehh it&#x27;s alright not something I think I&#x27;ll use much, let me be the first to tell you it&#x27;s a nail polish must have it&#x27;s amazing! On tan skin which I have it&#x27;s gorgeous for the summer get compliments all the time! Great quality!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS SHADE OF NUDE. It&#x27;s a perfect color for weddings if you wanna keep your polish netural.</li>
            <li> My favorite nail polish by OPI by far and the color I use the most. Opaque, just as I had hoped. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> the color looks like wall paint but it looks so nice on my nails. I have tan skin and when i put this nailpolish on, it looks very pretty against my skin. Any other color designs ontop of this nailpolish also look great. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color! I&#x27;m all about nude/neutral colors for my hands and this is the best color. It&#x27;s a cool-nude, not yellowish and is true to skin tone. I absolutely love this color, it matches everything and is really a nice take on a nude.</li>
            <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li> Sphan was correct. It looks great on a dark skin. I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;Chocolate&amp;#34; female and I gave this color a go when I took a trip to Australia. I had sooo many compliments. I wish I could post a pic but I couldn&#x27;t find the option for this item. I had a a little animal print and tribal print on top of this color and it work! I even wear it to work now (on my hands and feet). Will def. be buying this color again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Much better looking color, more dark than on the pic. But I like it even more.&lt;br /&gt;Very good for my tanned hands.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect nude color.  I hope they never stop making it!!! Cause it is perfect!!!  Go OPI!! Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> Great nude for fair skin.</li>
            <li> I had very low expectations going into buying this color because I wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of grey it would be. It&#x27;s a very interesting warm kind of grey that completely suits me and I always feel very sophisticated and classy wearing this shade. It gives off that kind of vibe and is a very mature color. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This color in real life is nothing like the picture. I was expecting a light, creamy, close to off-white color. I can&#x27;t even describe the actual color but I think if you chugged a gallon of chocolate milk on an empty stomach and then puked, it might look something like this. Or maybe close to the color of Roger the alien from American Dad. Maybe it will grow on me. Maybe it&#x27;s so bad that it&#x27;s almost good. Might look better if you have an extremely dark complexion. ? Sucks because I was really looking forward to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing against the seller I bought from though, I received the item in perfect condition in just a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit... Ok so it&#x27;s been 10 minutes and I&#x27;ve almost convinced myself that I kind of like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update.. this is the 3rd or 4th time I&#x27;ve used this nail polish now. I kind of love it. I just noticed my original review was one of the most helpful critical reviews, lol. Everything I said previously is still true... it is a slightly weird and kind of dead-looking color in normal light, and looks classy like the picture in brighter light. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I just have bad taste now but I like and actually look forward to wearing this color. Royal Rajah Ruby was my perfect color for a long time. But I haven&#x27;t worn that in months and went out of my way to paint my nails with Did You&#x27;ear About Van Gogh tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;d be helpful to note that I&#x27;m suuuper pale now, especially compared to when Royal Rajah Ruby was my ultimate fave.. although I think this color would still look cool if I had a dark tan and look forward to finding out. Also I almost always keep my nails painted and get bored easily with colors. So maybe I kinda love this color because it&#x27;s \\&quot;different\\&quot; enough not to be boring but not over the top different like lime green with hot pink and black or anything (which I sometimes do). Makes me feel classier than I really am. :]</li>
            <li> This is a nice color if you have a tan. Otherwise, if you&#x27;re pale, you&#x27;re better off with a dark color like Get In the Espresso Lane, or Lincoln Park After Dark.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect color! This color goes with almost anything. I get compliments every time I wear this incredible nail polish.</li>
            <li> Oh worse color non-color ever.  Why did I buy???</li>
            <li> I went to the nail salon last Saturday, saw this color and fell in love with it IMMEDIATELY . . . so much so that I purchased it within 24 hrs from Amazon. I just got it in the mail yesterday. Honestly, it looks great on me . . . maybe b/c of my dark complexion. Can&#x27;t beat a great nude color . . . it can/will go with everything!</li>
            <li> This color is a basic neutral.  Like much of our wall paint it is a nice &amp;#34;greige.&amp;#34;  Could go gray or beige.</li>
            <li> Love the suttleness of this color!  I would definitely buy again.xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx x x xx x xx</li>
            <li> 。☆。。☆ 。&lt;br /&gt;★。＼\｜/／。★&lt;br /&gt;  I used this for my nail Spa. customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;★。／/｜\＼。★&lt;br /&gt;。☆。。☆</li>
            <li> I love gray nail polish so I&#x27;m easy to please when it comes to 50 shades. Opi, China Glaze an Essie are my favorites.</li>
            <li> I like this color [[ASIN:B007X7R312 OPI Nail Polish Color Did You &#x27;ear About Van Gogh nail polish NL H54 0.5oz 15ml]]. I bought it thinking it would be a shade of nude, but it turned out to be more of a light taupe. I have the OPI Over the Taupe and together they are awesome for a colored french manicure.&lt;br /&gt;If worn alone it has a greyish tone depending on how the light hits it.&lt;br /&gt;What I like also about it, is that the color can easily travel into the fall and winter.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing, its thats nude off gray color that is the perfect base to wear alone or with designs on. The consistency is smooth the brush is thick like a normal OPI. I am beyond happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have this kind of color in my polish box.  It has more body to it than Samoan Sand which is really pale to my mind.  I have relatively pale skin (light) so I want a polish that will still show but not be overpowering.  This one works well.</li>
