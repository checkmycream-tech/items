            <li>He smells great.</li>
            <li>After about an hour or so on, it smooths out really nice and just smells great, and again, not overpowering, so you have to be fairly close to someone for them to smell it, which is the way I like it!</li>
            <li>It still smells as great as I remember and he was very pleased with this in his Christmas stocking.</li>

            <li> Love this colong I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
            <li> This particular cologne is becoming very hard to find locally, so I was very pleased to find it at Amazon. I have worn this for years and have had a lot of components on the fragrance  very good item guys the girls will love it on you</li>
            <li> I buy this every year for my Son and Husband love the smell</li>
            <li> did not receive eau de toilette, but rather a third bottle of cologne (which I purchased 2 bottles of same day). Since I use the cologne I decided not to complain to avoid the hassle, but someone needs to look at this for future sales. They look alike, sound alike which alone can result in packaging errors. I used to be a regulator of pharmacy profession and look alike-sound-alike drugs get mixed up very easy and are usually separated in pharmacies f.y.i.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much what others think of it. I like it. Over the years there have been some ladies who liked it, too :)</li>
            <li> My wife loves it...nothing else needs to be said. She has always been a fan of Royal Copenhagen and decided it would be good for me.</li>
            <li> My father, husband, and son have been wearing this for years.  Love how it smells on them.  Also love the online price :)</li>
            <li> Product smells like baby powder, there is nothing citrus about it. Very old man...</li>
            <li> I have used this same cologne for over 40 years and people (read females) ask me what the name is they like it so....unless they are all lying.</li>
            <li> not what I ordered but, adjustments were promised.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful fragrance.  My husband and I love it.</li>
            <li> No matter where I go, or travel throughout the world, I get compliments. I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for over 25 years.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my better half and he absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> This was my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne many years ago.  I stopped being able to find it in the stores, and was thrilled to find it at Amazon.com.  It still smells as great as I remember and he was very pleased with this in his Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great!! It seems like a lot of colognes now a days smell the same. This one definitely stands apart. I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> hard to find in this area L have been using for 25 years only one L like</li>
            <li> My brother brought this back from Denmark when he was an exchange student in high-school over 22 years ago. I dig this cologne and I&#x27;ve always had compliments on it from women. I like it most b/c it is subtle and not overpowering. It is slightly sweet smelling, yet masculine. To be honest, it is very similar to Stetson. After about an hour or so on, it smooths out really nice and just smells great, and again, not overpowering, so you have to be fairly close to someone for them to smell it, which is the way I like it! Great price here too. This is a very large spray bottle, much bigger than my original ones. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I felt the scent was a bit different than what I&lt;br /&gt;was used to! A bit stronger! I prefer the old scent.</li>
            <li> Great cologne.  Wife and daughter both love it and keep ordering it for me when I get low.  Just remember, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I was searching for a carnation smelling cologne, somehow I was directed to this brand.  I did not read the ingredients and just clicked on the add to my box.  It does not smell anything like carnations.</li>
            <li> User for many many years.  women comment on it often.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;YOU  SMELL GOOD&#x27;  I LOVE THAT COMMENT.&lt;br /&gt;I AM 85 YEARS OLD.and still work at the office as a&lt;br /&gt;CPA.</li>
            <li> I Have used it...since the age of 25..I am now 85.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how in the past and present a woman&lt;br /&gt;will say &#x27;you smell good.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;and some of them are pretty young..and pretty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ken keltner</li>
            <li> My husband received this as a gift at church several years ago.  LOVED the smell so... He looks forward to receiving a new bottle every Christmas!</li>
            <li> Excellent buy!  Cologne just perfect for work and weekend!  Not too strong!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, I buy it for my husband cause it smells great. I didn&#x27;t know I could get it on amazon. Was happy to get it, gave it to my hubby for his birthday. He smells great.</li>
