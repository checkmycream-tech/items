            <li>My girls already loved bath time..</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of this cover</li>
            <li>All in all a good product.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have the knob to divert water to your shower on your faucet its good and stays on...</li>
            <li>Loved the look of this spout cover and the colored bath drop feature</li>
            <li>It was great and my Grand son loved it when it held on....</li>
            <li>Very cute, but does not stay on the spout.</li>
            <li>Very cute</li>
            <li>Very cute spout cover.</li>
            <li>This item is very cute to look at, but it will not stay on once the water is turned on.  </li>
            <li>We picked this octopus because we thought it was very cute.</li>
            <li>This fit my tub faucet perfectly and we love it.</li>
            <li>At this point if I got it on I wouldnt &#x27;t be able to get it off again!</li>
            <li>but baby is more thrilled with all the spouts of water!</li>
            <li>Boy did she love it!</li>
            <li>so adorable!</li>
            <li>otherwise we love it!</li>
            <li>my grandson absolutely loves this!!!!!</li>
            <li>I liked the octopus spout cover.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for something nice to cover the faucet to protect your baby&#x27;s head from hitting it.</li>
            <li>so the water kind of backs up in the octopus.  </li>
            <li>Was nice to have 3 Crayola water cookies included in the package.</li>
            <li>Also, if I did want to use that shower, it&#x27;s very easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Very easy to install as it just glides over the spout.</li>
            <li>so my daughter can pull it off the spout very easily</li>
            <li>Fun and great service</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m glad we made it work on our own.</li>
            <li>Fits great over the spout and the color drop ins are fun for my son.</li>
            <li>This seems like a great and fun idea</li>
            <li>love love love and will buy from here again!</li>
            <li>Cute as can be.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>our spout is more square thats</li>
            <li>I was able to get it on our corner tub faucet, but it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li>Also you receive three tablets which allow you to be able to change the water color.  </li>
            <li>We have the shower pull on top.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the product is cute and probably works well if you don&#x27;t mind having to remove it every time you need to use the shower.</li>
            <li>Cute as at it shows in the picture.  </li>
            <li>I keep trying to make this work with our spout because it&#x27;s so cute, but it just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Toddler loves it - biggest issue is not being able to access the shower pull to turn the shower head on</li>
            <li>I think Ozzie is realy cute.  </li>
            <li>My kids love this.</li>
            <li>a cute idea</li>
            <li>This is so cute, but it doesn&#x27;t stay snug on the spout and i have to all but break it to get it off.</li>
            <li>but that is ok.</li>
            <li>If only we had a shower divider on our spout, i feel like this would have been the perfect spout cover.</li>
            <li>At this time I am unsure if I am able to get a refund or not.</li>
            <li>My kids LOVE the way the water comes out all four legs</li>
            <li>Like many others, this ripped as soon as we put it on.</li>
            <li>The top part of the Octopus&#x27;s head has no hole for bath tubs with a downspout pull rod  (to switch from a shower head function to bath fill downspout when filling a tub)</li>
            <li>Cute toy but not what i was expecting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and serves its purpose</li>
            <li>Wish I had read more of the reviews before buying.</li>
            <li>They love to stand in the tub (we bathe them in a clothes basket in the tub)</li>
            <li>They love to play with the water as it streams out of his tentacles.  </li>
            <li>and when it arrived, it was  even more adorable than I imagined.</li>
            <li>We love this spout cover.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still cute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it online.  </li>
            <li>even more so when we add the color drops.</li>
            <li>I feel better knowing if he falls he won&#x27;t hit his head on the metal spout.</li>
            <li>(Maybe it&#x27;s just my faucet...not sure.)</li>
            <li>The kids love it.</li>
            <li>My toddler love it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work if you ever intend to use the tub as a shower, as the item covers the &amp;#34;pull knob&amp;#34; on the top of the faucet.</li>
            <li>I love this guy, and so does my son, that&#x27;s why he keeps pulling it off the spout.</li>
            <li>Better than I thought</li>
            <li>we love it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure if it had the thing you pull up for a shower it would work better.</li>
            <li>The plastic rings that are located in the inside to help secure the octopus to the spout detach very easy and rip.  </li>
            <li>this is a very cute and fun spout cover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too easy for my baby girl to pull off... but its cute</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that will add even more fun!</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly on the faucet, and when my son tries to pull on the tentacles, it stays in place, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about him removing it from the faucet.  </li>
            <li>He is cute and does fit on...</li>
            <li>I wish I had gotten something a bit more secure.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure one day she will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend....requires some design improvements; namely, more flexible fit, and ability to access shower activator.</li>
            <li>Cute, does not work properly or fit snuggly.</li>
            <li>but I wish it fit better.</li>
            <li>The colors coming out of the arms is way cool!  </li>
            <li>the water squirts out of the tentacles and you have the option to put in a crayola water changing tabblet that has no harm if ingested which makes it much more fun for bath time!</li>
            <li>It protects her from hitting her head on the faucet, and its easy to put on and take off for those in the house that use the shower.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like how easily he comes off what he is meant to be protecting.  </li>
            <li>Amazon rocks for easy refunds, so it&#x27;s now a dog toy.</li>
            <li>water comes out of all the legs though if you have a grabby baby it can be easily pulled off</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t have one your child can easily pull this guy off.</li>
            <li>...Be sure to clean it every so often as it can get moldy.</li>
            <li>Kids love this thing and the colored tablets are really cool</li>
            <li>Fits perfect on our spout and we even have the pull down on it for the shower.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t realize this is a perfect mold breeder - the interior of the head turned black within weeks (even after being washed/bleached/vinegared</li>
            <li>and it is super cute</li>
            <li>Super cute</li>
            <li>Very affordable and cute!</li>
            <li>Had to tear apart the part that fits over the faucet to get it to fit.</li>
            <li>We have used the bath color tablets that it came with and that makes bath time even more fun.</li>
            <li>Had to cut it to fit the faucet.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really fit secure now tho.  </li>
            <li>The opening can be changed to fit the water spout.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit our bathrub</li>
            <li>cute, fun, fits well.</li>
            <li>The octopus had to be modified to fit over our faucet.</li>
            <li>but now it is much more fun</li>
            <li>so Ollie still isn&#x27;t 100% secure.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would use it to color the water to make bathtime more fun, but I end up having to run the water before I put the cover on bc</li>
            <li>great product, only issue is it doesn&#x27;t stay very well on the spout and kind of tilts when the water runs.</li>
            <li>Faucet Cover has a very friendly face, and is fun as water comes out four of his tentacles.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these for my youngest daughter and it was so much fun and super cute</li>
            <li>So much fun!</li>
            <li>But make sure you angle it over the diverter first then twist.</li>
            <li>We have to clean it every time we run a bath</li>
            <li>Ozzie solved that problem, and the fact that I can put the color tabs in just makes it super fun!  </li>
            <li>It cool product daughter likes it</li>
            <li>Baby thinks it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>It looks cute and the water really comes out of each of its legs.</li>
            <li>Overall it does a good job covering the spout</li>
            <li>but our granddaughter loved the multiple streams of water that come out</li>
            <li>but I dont see me being able to use it much since I have to remove it all the time.</li>
            <li>My son is not old enough yet to fully enjoy this, but it is awesome.</li>
            <li>but it did hold super</li>
            <li>my older kids love feeding it color changing tablets.</li>
            <li>Collected mold quickly.</li>
            <li>I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to fit at first</li>
            <li>I think I was more excited about this than my 10 month old son.</li>
            <li>Although this comes off fairly easy, with much \\&quot;no&#x27;s\\&quot; my son no longer pulls it off.</li>
            <li>Long story short: We would have had to switch the faucet for almost any tub spout we purchased, but unless you have a diverter knob ON the faucet, Ollie may not be the best choice.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!!</li>
            <li>so I just had to find another for my first granddaughter!</li>
            <li>recommend to anyone with kids interested in the faucet!</li>
            <li>and I just had to buy one for my little great grandson.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised more people didn&#x27;t comment about how you&#x27;d have to take it off to pull the downspout lever for the shower (assuming you could even get it on in the first place!)</li>
            <li>Fun times with grandson.</li>
            <li>we have fun together.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I was a bit surprised that no one mentioned that the tentacles look a bit more phallic than is pictured on the box.</li>
            <li>It doubles as a fun toy to play with while the water is running and protects against the sharp/hard faucet.</li>
            <li>The water comes out the legs, so my baby has a lot of fun playing with the water stream.  </li>
            <li>and it is fun.</li>
            <li>She loved the pink water also.</li>
            <li>but it works and the water comes out fun for baby.</li>
            <li>It is fun to put the color tablets in his mouth and see the water come his legs...</li>
            <li>Just fell right off of water spout.</li>
            <li>and once the water is on the weight makes it slide right</li>
            <li>I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have because they were right</li>
            <li>it is large and protects from all the bumbs!</li>
            <li>He does not stay on the spout well if it is touched and my 2 year old easily removes him.  </li>
            <li>I definitely would look for a spout cover that is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>We unscrewed the tab to make it smaller which it did fit over it and was a huge hit however the first time I had to take it off (</li>
            <li>But our little loved the octopus, so dad went to the hardware store and picked up a fatter spout.</li>
            <li>Great for safety but hard to get off n on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better for a regular faucet though.</li>
            <li>This is such a cute product.</li>
            <li>This spout cover does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>which is exactly what she does during bath time.</li>
            <li>The tentacles piece of this product broke off from its head on first use.  </li>
            <li>I just cut a small hole in the top with some kitchen shears to be able to reach the tub diverter.  </li>
            <li>My kids love seeing the different colors come out and into the water.</li>
            <li>it would be more universal.</li>
            <li>Super cute idea, but not very practical.</li>
            <li>I use an old toothbrush and some bleach solution to clean it well.</li>
            <li>I was expecting to leave this on at all times, but you cant because you ca not close and open the water nozzle easily.</li>
            <li>Very safe for little noggins!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of toy I would buy for every little child who loves the bathtub.</li>
            <li>A great product for kids to add a little something extra to any bath.</li>
            <li>My faucet has a pull tab on top to turn the shower on so this didn&#x27;t fit at all no matter how hard i tried.</li>
            <li>defeats the whole purpose.</li>
            <li>This is not for someone who wants to take it on and off.</li>
            <li>Water comes out of his mouth as well as his tentacles, which has rendered the whole \\&quot;put a color tab in his mouth\\&quot; business</li>
            <li>absolutely moot.</li>
            <li>Thankfully our daughter plays mostly at the back of the tub, and is big enough that at this point Ollie fufills spoiling her rotten more than protecting her noggin.  </li>
            <li>Works really neat.</li>
            <li>Only giving 4 stars because I will have to cut it to fit over my faucet.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really fit well on our standard faucet</li>
            <li>I especially like that you can add the water colorant to it, which should be a super cool bath-time thing in about a year, when it can be appreciated more by the little one.</li>
            <li>Love the product; it&#x27;s exactly what we expected for our new daughter.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s wedged on to the spout pretty well, and our daughters little lobster claws won&#x27;t be able to pull him off anytime soon.</li>
            <li>If you read other reviews, many others have this issue as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son thinking he would love the octopus looking water faucet, which he thought interesting for a few moments, which is about right for a little one.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on you can&#x27;t see the small cuts on the opening.. &amp; The shower diverter pops right out of the hole on top.</li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t handle full water pressure or water starts coming out of the back.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish was different is the design of not being able to access the shower spout.</li>
            <li>I did have a hard time with the shower tab fitting in and out of the toy, but I tore out the inner rings and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Unless all you need is a cute octopus for your little to have a bath time chat with.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to cover the faucet to protect your little one, its ok.</li>
            <li>Only useful for bathtubs that is not also used as showers.</li>
            <li>My son hates baths, and Ozzie has not only made them tolerable for him, but sometimes he even has fun.      </li>
            <li>Seems like he needs a softer grippy surface not a hard molded plastic to stay on.</li>
            <li>, however it must come off for us to use the shower, it does not stay in a completely upright position when on the faucet but more or less hangs on it.</li>
            <li>Even though this is a cute product and ensures that your child does not hurt themselves while in the bathtub it is disappointing that the inside detaches very easily and the product becomes less secure while on the spout.  </li>
            <li>I liked the color tablets and the multiple tentacles thing, but it did not fit our faucet.</li>
            <li>It is very old and out dated.</li>
            <li>It fits pretty snug and my son likes to sit and fill cups with water that comes out of the different tentacltentacles.</li>
            <li>My 8 month old loves this!</li>
            <li>Once it was on i felt around &amp; measured out where the diverter was &amp; cut a circle on top with a small knife.</li>
            <li>We had the opposite problem of other reviewers - our tub spout was way to skinny for Ollie to fit on!</li>
            <li>Such a cute idea and love the colored tablets that poor out!</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit of tugging and twisting, but I can easily do it a couple seconds (now that I&#x27;m used to it).    </li>
            <li>So i got it anyway &amp; after a little altering it was easy.</li>
            <li>We do have a pull for the shower, so the cover couldn&#x27;t fit on tight.</li>
            <li>Turn it upside down for some waterfall fun!</li>
            <li>Overall, this is cute and it does the job of protecting the little ones in the bath tub.</li>
            <li>It only holds on to the spout through friction, and my little guy managed to pull it almost all the way off, but I imagine that is the case with most spout covers.</li>
            <li>and we kept her head safe from the hard faucet</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m not dealing with any molds or whatnots.</li>
            <li>Also, my 14 month old son pulls this off the spout no problem.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old does also.  </li>
            <li>It keps my 1 year old from bumping his head on the spout and</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t used the color tablets because she is still young</li>
            <li>My four year old loves this</li>
            <li>Ripped the moment we put it on, and was placed/removed with difficulty (even for an adult).</li>
            <li>Using it in an old un-updated apartment doesn&#x27;t work out well</li>
            <li>my friend has this and recommended it to me for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>We have not used the color tablets since our baby is too young for them.</li>
            <li>The kids loved feeding the colored tablets to the octopus, even though they were difficult to get into the mouth.</li>
            <li>This little guy is 100% fun and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not particularly easy to get clean.</li>
            <li>(the other four legs are underneath him, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about an inaccurate octopus!), and the bath coloring tablets are so much fun -</li>
            <li>Study hard rubber but its also soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>no sharp edges and softens the spout ...</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pretty big, bigger than I thought it was actually.</li>
            <li>The water comes out of his little legs which is so fun.</li>
            <li>My husband and I were not able to get this to fit on a standard faucet with a shower diverter.  </li>
            <li>My son, who is ten months old, loves it and it always keeps him entertained.  </li>
            <li>When you remove it of you are not careful the plastic seal wil rip.</li>
            <li>The only problem is, we have an old fashoned shower that has the water diverter up on the wall (seperate knob)</li>
            <li>My twins are 11 months old and just transitioning to the big tub.  </li>
            <li>BUT - to get him wedged on well enough, we had to push him so far back</li>
            <li>Also, him being so far back has rendered his big squishy head moot as padding too.</li>
            <li>Got absolutely covered inside with black mold.</li>
            <li>, it is very hard to make it stay securely on the faucet</li>
            <li>&amp; if it doesn&#x27;t fit it&#x27;s pretty useless!</li>
            <li>Fun but hard to get off the spout</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My girls already loved bath time..</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of this cover</li>
            <li> All in all a good product.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have the knob to divert water to your shower on your faucet its good and stays on...</li>
            <li> Loved the look of this spout cover and the colored bath drop feature</li>
            <li> It was great and my Grand son loved it when it held on....</li>
            <li> Very cute, but does not stay on the spout.</li>
            <li> Very cute</li>
            <li> Very cute spout cover.</li>
            <li> This item is very cute to look at, but it will not stay on once the water is turned on.  </li>
            <li> We picked this octopus because we thought it was very cute.</li>
            <li> This fit my tub faucet perfectly and we love it.</li>
            <li> At this point if I got it on I wouldnt &#x27;t be able to get it off again!</li>
            <li> but baby is more thrilled with all the spouts of water!</li>
            <li> Boy did she love it!</li>
            <li> so adorable!</li>
            <li> otherwise we love it!</li>
            <li> my grandson absolutely loves this!!!!!</li>
            <li> I liked the octopus spout cover.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for something nice to cover the faucet to protect your baby&#x27;s head from hitting it.</li>
            <li> so the water kind of backs up in the octopus.  </li>
            <li> Was nice to have 3 Crayola water cookies included in the package.</li>
            <li> Also, if I did want to use that shower, it&#x27;s very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install as it just glides over the spout.</li>
            <li> so my daughter can pull it off the spout very easily</li>
            <li> Fun and great service</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m glad we made it work on our own.</li>
            <li> Fits great over the spout and the color drop ins are fun for my son.</li>
            <li> This seems like a great and fun idea</li>
            <li> love love love and will buy from here again!</li>
            <li> Cute as can be.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> our spout is more square thats</li>
            <li> I was able to get it on our corner tub faucet, but it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li> Also you receive three tablets which allow you to be able to change the water color.  </li>
            <li> We have the shower pull on top.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the product is cute and probably works well if you don&#x27;t mind having to remove it every time you need to use the shower.</li>
            <li> Cute as at it shows in the picture.  </li>
            <li> I keep trying to make this work with our spout because it&#x27;s so cute, but it just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Toddler loves it - biggest issue is not being able to access the shower pull to turn the shower head on</li>
            <li> I think Ozzie is realy cute.  </li>
            <li> My kids love this.</li>
            <li> a cute idea</li>
            <li> This is so cute, but it doesn&#x27;t stay snug on the spout and i have to all but break it to get it off.</li>
            <li> but that is ok.</li>
            <li> If only we had a shower divider on our spout, i feel like this would have been the perfect spout cover.</li>
            <li> At this time I am unsure if I am able to get a refund or not.</li>
            <li> My kids LOVE the way the water comes out all four legs</li>
            <li> Like many others, this ripped as soon as we put it on.</li>
            <li> The top part of the Octopus&#x27;s head has no hole for bath tubs with a downspout pull rod  (to switch from a shower head function to bath fill downspout when filling a tub)</li>
            <li> Cute toy but not what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and serves its purpose</li>
            <li> Wish I had read more of the reviews before buying.</li>
            <li> They love to stand in the tub (we bathe them in a clothes basket in the tub)</li>
            <li> They love to play with the water as it streams out of his tentacles.  </li>
            <li> and when it arrived, it was  even more adorable than I imagined.</li>
            <li> We love this spout cover.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still cute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it online.  </li>
            <li> even more so when we add the color drops.</li>
            <li> I feel better knowing if he falls he won&#x27;t hit his head on the metal spout.</li>
            <li> (Maybe it&#x27;s just my faucet...not sure.)</li>
            <li> The kids love it.</li>
            <li> My toddler love it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work if you ever intend to use the tub as a shower, as the item covers the &amp;#34;pull knob&amp;#34; on the top of the faucet.</li>
            <li> I love this guy, and so does my son, that&#x27;s why he keeps pulling it off the spout.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought</li>
            <li> we love it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure if it had the thing you pull up for a shower it would work better.</li>
            <li> The plastic rings that are located in the inside to help secure the octopus to the spout detach very easy and rip.  </li>
            <li> this is a very cute and fun spout cover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too easy for my baby girl to pull off... but its cute</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that will add even more fun!</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly on the faucet, and when my son tries to pull on the tentacles, it stays in place, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about him removing it from the faucet.  </li>
            <li> He is cute and does fit on...</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten something a bit more secure.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure one day she will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend....requires some design improvements; namely, more flexible fit, and ability to access shower activator.</li>
            <li> Cute, does not work properly or fit snuggly.</li>
            <li> but I wish it fit better.</li>
            <li> The colors coming out of the arms is way cool!  </li>
            <li> the water squirts out of the tentacles and you have the option to put in a crayola water changing tabblet that has no harm if ingested which makes it much more fun for bath time!</li>
            <li> It protects her from hitting her head on the faucet, and its easy to put on and take off for those in the house that use the shower.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like how easily he comes off what he is meant to be protecting.  </li>
            <li> Amazon rocks for easy refunds, so it&#x27;s now a dog toy.</li>
            <li> water comes out of all the legs though if you have a grabby baby it can be easily pulled off</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t have one your child can easily pull this guy off.</li>
            <li> ...Be sure to clean it every so often as it can get moldy.</li>
            <li> Kids love this thing and the colored tablets are really cool</li>
            <li> Fits perfect on our spout and we even have the pull down on it for the shower.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize this is a perfect mold breeder - the interior of the head turned black within weeks (even after being washed/bleached/vinegared</li>
            <li> and it is super cute</li>
            <li> Super cute</li>
            <li> Very affordable and cute!</li>
            <li> Had to tear apart the part that fits over the faucet to get it to fit.</li>
            <li> We have used the bath color tablets that it came with and that makes bath time even more fun.</li>
            <li> Had to cut it to fit the faucet.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really fit secure now tho.  </li>
            <li> The opening can be changed to fit the water spout.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit our bathrub</li>
            <li> cute, fun, fits well.</li>
            <li> The octopus had to be modified to fit over our faucet.</li>
            <li> but now it is much more fun</li>
            <li> so Ollie still isn&#x27;t 100% secure.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would use it to color the water to make bathtime more fun, but I end up having to run the water before I put the cover on bc</li>
            <li> great product, only issue is it doesn&#x27;t stay very well on the spout and kind of tilts when the water runs.</li>
            <li> Faucet Cover has a very friendly face, and is fun as water comes out four of his tentacles.  </li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my youngest daughter and it was so much fun and super cute</li>
            <li> So much fun!</li>
            <li> But make sure you angle it over the diverter first then twist.</li>
            <li> We have to clean it every time we run a bath</li>
            <li> Ozzie solved that problem, and the fact that I can put the color tabs in just makes it super fun!  </li>
            <li> It cool product daughter likes it</li>
            <li> Baby thinks it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> It looks cute and the water really comes out of each of its legs.</li>
            <li> Overall it does a good job covering the spout</li>
            <li> but our granddaughter loved the multiple streams of water that come out</li>
            <li> but I dont see me being able to use it much since I have to remove it all the time.</li>
            <li> My son is not old enough yet to fully enjoy this, but it is awesome.</li>
            <li> but it did hold super</li>
            <li> my older kids love feeding it color changing tablets.</li>
            <li> Collected mold quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to fit at first</li>
            <li> I think I was more excited about this than my 10 month old son.</li>
            <li> Although this comes off fairly easy, with much \\&quot;no&#x27;s\\&quot; my son no longer pulls it off.</li>
            <li> Long story short: We would have had to switch the faucet for almost any tub spout we purchased, but unless you have a diverter knob ON the faucet, Ollie may not be the best choice.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed!!</li>
            <li> so I just had to find another for my first granddaughter!</li>
            <li> recommend to anyone with kids interested in the faucet!</li>
            <li> and I just had to buy one for my little great grandson.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised more people didn&#x27;t comment about how you&#x27;d have to take it off to pull the downspout lever for the shower (assuming you could even get it on in the first place!)</li>
            <li> Fun times with grandson.</li>
            <li> we have fun together.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I was a bit surprised that no one mentioned that the tentacles look a bit more phallic than is pictured on the box.</li>
            <li> It doubles as a fun toy to play with while the water is running and protects against the sharp/hard faucet.</li>
            <li> The water comes out the legs, so my baby has a lot of fun playing with the water stream.  </li>
            <li> and it is fun.</li>
            <li> She loved the pink water also.</li>
            <li> but it works and the water comes out fun for baby.</li>
            <li> It is fun to put the color tablets in his mouth and see the water come his legs...</li>
            <li> Just fell right off of water spout.</li>
            <li> and once the water is on the weight makes it slide right</li>
            <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have because they were right</li>
            <li> it is large and protects from all the bumbs!</li>
            <li> He does not stay on the spout well if it is touched and my 2 year old easily removes him.  </li>
            <li> I definitely would look for a spout cover that is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> We unscrewed the tab to make it smaller which it did fit over it and was a huge hit however the first time I had to take it off (</li>
            <li> But our little loved the octopus, so dad went to the hardware store and picked up a fatter spout.</li>
            <li> Great for safety but hard to get off n on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably better for a regular faucet though.</li>
            <li> This is such a cute product.</li>
            <li> This spout cover does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> which is exactly what she does during bath time.</li>
            <li> The tentacles piece of this product broke off from its head on first use.  </li>
            <li> I just cut a small hole in the top with some kitchen shears to be able to reach the tub diverter.  </li>
            <li> My kids love seeing the different colors come out and into the water.</li>
            <li> it would be more universal.</li>
            <li> Super cute idea, but not very practical.</li>
            <li> I use an old toothbrush and some bleach solution to clean it well.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to leave this on at all times, but you cant because you ca not close and open the water nozzle easily.</li>
            <li> Very safe for little noggins!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the kind of toy I would buy for every little child who loves the bathtub.</li>
            <li> A great product for kids to add a little something extra to any bath.</li>
            <li> My faucet has a pull tab on top to turn the shower on so this didn&#x27;t fit at all no matter how hard i tried.</li>
            <li> defeats the whole purpose.</li>
            <li> This is not for someone who wants to take it on and off.</li>
            <li> Water comes out of his mouth as well as his tentacles, which has rendered the whole \\&quot;put a color tab in his mouth\\&quot; business</li>
            <li> absolutely moot.</li>
            <li> Thankfully our daughter plays mostly at the back of the tub, and is big enough that at this point Ollie fufills spoiling her rotten more than protecting her noggin.  </li>
            <li> Works really neat.</li>
            <li> Only giving 4 stars because I will have to cut it to fit over my faucet.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really fit well on our standard faucet</li>
            <li> I especially like that you can add the water colorant to it, which should be a super cool bath-time thing in about a year, when it can be appreciated more by the little one.</li>
            <li> Love the product; it&#x27;s exactly what we expected for our new daughter.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s wedged on to the spout pretty well, and our daughters little lobster claws won&#x27;t be able to pull him off anytime soon.</li>
            <li> If you read other reviews, many others have this issue as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son thinking he would love the octopus looking water faucet, which he thought interesting for a few moments, which is about right for a little one.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s on you can&#x27;t see the small cuts on the opening.. &amp; The shower diverter pops right out of the hole on top.</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t handle full water pressure or water starts coming out of the back.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was different is the design of not being able to access the shower spout.</li>
            <li> I did have a hard time with the shower tab fitting in and out of the toy, but I tore out the inner rings and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Unless all you need is a cute octopus for your little to have a bath time chat with.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to cover the faucet to protect your little one, its ok.</li>
            <li> Only useful for bathtubs that is not also used as showers.</li>
            <li> My son hates baths, and Ozzie has not only made them tolerable for him, but sometimes he even has fun.      </li>
            <li> Seems like he needs a softer grippy surface not a hard molded plastic to stay on.</li>
            <li> , however it must come off for us to use the shower, it does not stay in a completely upright position when on the faucet but more or less hangs on it.</li>
            <li> Even though this is a cute product and ensures that your child does not hurt themselves while in the bathtub it is disappointing that the inside detaches very easily and the product becomes less secure while on the spout.  </li>
            <li> I liked the color tablets and the multiple tentacles thing, but it did not fit our faucet.</li>
            <li> It is very old and out dated.</li>
            <li> It fits pretty snug and my son likes to sit and fill cups with water that comes out of the different tentacltentacles.</li>
            <li> My 8 month old loves this!</li>
            <li> Once it was on i felt around &amp; measured out where the diverter was &amp; cut a circle on top with a small knife.</li>
            <li> We had the opposite problem of other reviewers - our tub spout was way to skinny for Ollie to fit on!</li>
            <li> Such a cute idea and love the colored tablets that poor out!</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of tugging and twisting, but I can easily do it a couple seconds (now that I&#x27;m used to it).    </li>
            <li> So i got it anyway &amp; after a little altering it was easy.</li>
            <li> We do have a pull for the shower, so the cover couldn&#x27;t fit on tight.</li>
            <li> Turn it upside down for some waterfall fun!</li>
            <li> Overall, this is cute and it does the job of protecting the little ones in the bath tub.</li>
            <li> It only holds on to the spout through friction, and my little guy managed to pull it almost all the way off, but I imagine that is the case with most spout covers.</li>
            <li> and we kept her head safe from the hard faucet</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m not dealing with any molds or whatnots.</li>
            <li> Also, my 14 month old son pulls this off the spout no problem.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old does also.  </li>
            <li> It keps my 1 year old from bumping his head on the spout and</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t used the color tablets because she is still young</li>
            <li> My four year old loves this</li>
            <li> Ripped the moment we put it on, and was placed/removed with difficulty (even for an adult).</li>
            <li> Using it in an old un-updated apartment doesn&#x27;t work out well</li>
            <li> my friend has this and recommended it to me for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li> We have not used the color tablets since our baby is too young for them.</li>
            <li> The kids loved feeding the colored tablets to the octopus, even though they were difficult to get into the mouth.</li>
            <li> This little guy is 100% fun and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not particularly easy to get clean.</li>
            <li> (the other four legs are underneath him, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about an inaccurate octopus!), and the bath coloring tablets are so much fun -</li>
            <li> Study hard rubber but its also soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> no sharp edges and softens the spout ...</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pretty big, bigger than I thought it was actually.</li>
            <li> The water comes out of his little legs which is so fun.</li>
            <li> My husband and I were not able to get this to fit on a standard faucet with a shower diverter.  </li>
            <li> My son, who is ten months old, loves it and it always keeps him entertained.  </li>
            <li> When you remove it of you are not careful the plastic seal wil rip.</li>
            <li> The only problem is, we have an old fashoned shower that has the water diverter up on the wall (seperate knob)</li>
            <li> My twins are 11 months old and just transitioning to the big tub.  </li>
            <li> BUT - to get him wedged on well enough, we had to push him so far back</li>
            <li> Also, him being so far back has rendered his big squishy head moot as padding too.</li>
            <li> Got absolutely covered inside with black mold.</li>
            <li> , it is very hard to make it stay securely on the faucet</li>
            <li> &amp; if it doesn&#x27;t fit it&#x27;s pretty useless!</li>
            <li> Fun but hard to get off the spout</li>
            <li> But we also take it with us every time we go out of town to visit family (which is frequently, since we&#x27;re military and not stationed near family), and I&#x27;ve never had any problems getting it on or off any other faucet.  </li>
            <li> Love this except it&#x27;s insanely hard to get off the spout if you what to take a shower :-/</li>
            <li> It is made of a pretty hard rubber &amp; the hole to go over the faucet</li>
            <li> Still have yet to completely remove \\&quot;Ozzie,\\&quot; and while it still works, half of the water spits out the back.</li>
            <li> (It doesn&#x27;t take long to take it off and put it back on, though.)</li>
            <li> I love what this spout cover does and how cute it looks, but it often falls off my faucet and makes my little boy cry &#x3D;(!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t put it back so it&#x27;ll stay put or attached to the head, so it must have been glued on originally.</li>
            <li> Based on the design (which happens to trap a little water inside), I don&#x27;t think this spout cover ever completely dries between baths.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the color tabs because I think she is a little to young</li>
            <li> Unable to access shower activator through octopus which is important for a thorough rinse.</li>
            <li> It is NOT a toy so as long as it isn&#x27;t played with</li>
            <li> I did read other reviews that said it was too big for their faucet</li>
            <li> it gets wet inside, its difficult to clean or dry.</li>
            <li> BUT it is very difficult to remove on a spout with a shower diverter on the top.</li>
            <li> The thing that is on top of my faucet that you pull up to make the shower head go makes it impossible to put this cover on.</li>
            <li> We have to remove it in order to take showers and in less than 6 months the back started tearing from the on and off</li>
            <li> BUT it doesn&#x27;t make a mess outside the tub</li>
            <li> Oh, and it protects their little heads from hitting that hard metal faucet, too - and you certainly don&#x27;t need to worry about it slipping off, if the faucet has a shower pull.</li>
            <li> the shower pull being a little taller than standard.</li>
            <li> but the the three rings all are ripping off from taking the octupus off an putting back on everyday</li>
            <li> Does not fit properly to serve it&#x27;s purpose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only annoyed that I bought this before baby was born and only recently tried to put it on since he&#x27;s out of his baby</li>
            <li> harder to get off</li>
            <li> We did have to cut out the smallest circle that fits over the faucet due to</li>
            <li> Other than that, we take it off to wash the inside.</li>
            <li> Trying to figure out a way to attach it so he stays put, even with curious little hands.</li>
            <li> The hole in the back was a little small</li>
            <li> We have a kids&#x27; bathroom that is rarely to never used for showers, so it hasn&#x27;t been an issue to leave it on the faucet, once it&#x27;s on there.  </li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because people said it was difficult to get on &amp; there wasn&#x27;t a whole for the shower diverter.</li>
            <li> and it thought my bathtub faucet would end up too wide instead of too narrow.</li>
            <li> we turn it upside down...</li>
            <li> but angles down and</li>
            <li> This spout cover has been in my house for less than 9 months and after every bath</li>
            <li> There are black markings that look like some sort of grease on both sides of product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, my daughter loves it and it protects her little head and mouth from the sharp faucet!</li>
            <li> That was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> It fits easily on my spout but the base of the structure keeps water pooled in it and doesn&#x27;t drain when we&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> so i did 4 little cuts..</li>
            <li> and it was not friendly to my faucet.</li>
            <li> I think if it was made of softer rubber &amp; the hole would just stretch a little</li>
            <li> be careful of mold!!!</li>
            <li> Seems like a waste</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bottom heavy</li>
            <li> The only dislike about this is it shows placing the color tabs through the mouth of the octopus, but it is thick rubber with a tiny slit which makes it difficult to push the tabs through it&#x27;s mouth</li>
            <li> Ozzie doesn&#x27;t stay on the spout when water is glowing heavily.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you need to make a few changes yourself..</li>
            <li> Had it for only one day and its broken.</li>
            <li> only a few weeks later bc someone needed to take a shower) the material had almost dry rotted and broke apart :(</li>
            <li> it is not easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> Hard to get off because we have the faucet with the piece you pull up and down to close the drain.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a little difficult to get over a faucet with a shower pull tab on it, but it&#x27;s definitely do-able.  </li>
            <li> Is very tight around spout and you have to remove to turn shower on.  </li>
            <li> My little one has bumped her head on it and no tears!</li>
            <li> She also loves the water coming out of the little tentacles!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little hard to shove the color drops into his mouth without making it fall off.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> That said, it was difficult to attach to a fairly standard spout.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to get them in there since it&#x27;s just a slit</li>
            <li> Really hard to get on</li>
            <li> Too hard of plastic to even push over our faucet.</li>
            <li> We had the ELMO bubbles one for 2 years and that acquired mold in the bubble portion...also really hard to keep drained of water...</li>
            <li> Also, the inside of Ozzie&#x27;s head seems hard to drain water from</li>
            <li> It is a bit hard for them to push even the mini tablets in and the water needs to be off, so</li>
            <li> big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I bought this despite some negative reviews about difficulty getting it on/off and don&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and poor kids&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> Too small for the spout!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not as expensive as the other brands.</li>
            <li> I only give it 2 starrs because i do like the color quality, but It is very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to keep on the actual faucet.</li>
            <li> We have to remove the cover after each use in order to spray out the tub and noticed that water droplets accumulate and are difficult to get out without wiping it down.</li>
            <li> It did not matter how often you cleaned this guy, the mold was ever present and impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little creepy...</li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> Poor quality IMHO.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the brand fool you, this is poorly made.</li>
            <li> Poor product design all the way around.</li>
            <li> When I got this it didn&#x27;t stay on and when I looked it was broken</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid over time even after drying it may develop mold in the hard to drain crevices.</li>
            <li> The tablets are difficult to put inside the octopus&#x27;s mouth.  </li>
            <li> One on each side of the hole &amp; instead of pushing it on i twisted it on.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s quite inconvenient to put on and take off every time.  </li>
            <li> , it was dirty when I received it.</li>
            <li> I may end up cutting a spot for the lever.</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> but it is impossible to keep all the water out because if its shape...and is now sprouting mold!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Cute as can be. Wanted something different. Does what it says it will do. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Broke and tore after three uses. Only useful for bathtubs that is not also used as showers. Covers the knob that switches from bath to shower.</li>
            <li> Had to return. Just fell right off of water spout.</li>
            <li> I love this. It fits pretty snug and my son likes to sit and fill cups with water that comes out of the different tentacltentacles. I didn&#x27;t care for the color tablets that change the eayer color for like 2 mins.  Seems like a waste but this does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It cool product daughter likes it but the the three rings all are ripping off from taking the octupus off an putting back on everyday our spout is more square thats why though but it did hold super so baby could never take it off my husband always had to do it. I would reccomend on a rounder spout.</li>
            <li> It split after the third use and kept popping off</li>
            <li> My 8 month old loves this! It protects her from hitting her head on the faucet, and its easy to put on and take off for those in the house that use the shower. I would definatley recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> Does not fit properly to serve it&#x27;s purpose</li>
            <li> Mold in 3 months. Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Had to tear apart the part that fits over the faucet to get it to fit. Otherwise, my daughter loves it and it protects her little head and mouth from the sharp faucet!</li>
            <li> Very cute, but does not stay on the spout. When I put it on, it only takes about 10-15 second to fall off... defeats the whole purpose.</li>
            <li> My husband and I were not able to get this to fit on a standard faucet with a shower diverter.  I was able to get it on our corner tub faucet, but it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  The kids loved feeding the colored tablets to the octopus, even though they were difficult to get into the mouth.</li>
            <li> It does cover the pull for the shower head, but since we only use that bathroom for her baths, it&#x27;s never a concern. Also, if I did want to use that shower, it&#x27;s very easy to remove. We have used the bath color tablets that it came with and that makes bath time even more fun. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Saved my kid from bumping his head on the spout.</li>
            <li> The plastic rings that are located in the inside to help secure the octopus to the spout detach very easy and rip.  Even though this is a cute product and ensures that your child does not hurt themselves while in the bathtub it is disappointing that the inside detaches very easily and the product becomes less secure while on the spout.  Also you receive three tablets which allow you to be able to change the water color.  The tablets are difficult to put inside the octopus&#x27;s mouth.  When you place the tablet inside only two of the of four tentaciles will come out with the change of color for the water.</li>
            <li> Got absolutely covered inside with black mold. It did not matter how often you cleaned this guy, the mold was ever present and impossible to remove. Poor design.</li>
            <li> My kids love the octopus!! We did have to cut out the smallest circle that fits over the faucet due to the shower pull being a little taller than standard. The water pressure doesn&#x27;t keep up with the 4 spouts BUT it doesn&#x27;t make a mess outside the tub and it doesn&#x27;t bother my kids, so I don&#x27;t let it bother me. I would recommend. It&#x27;s probably better for a regular faucet though.</li>
            <li> Had to cut it to fit the faucet. We have the shower pull on top. doesn&#x27;t really fit secure now tho.  Baby loves it</li>
            <li> Although this comes off fairly easy, with much \\&quot;no&#x27;s\\&quot; my son no longer pulls it off. It definitely protects my boy&#x27;s noggin from the spout but i kinda do wish it was a bit thicker or had padding. Other than that, we take it off to wash the inside. So far, I&#x27;m not dealing with any molds or whatnots. It&#x27;s been several months since my purchase.</li>
            <li> My faucet has a pull tab on top to turn the shower on so this didn&#x27;t fit at all no matter how hard i tried.</li>
            <li> I liked the octopus spout cover. Very easy to install as it just glides over the spout. We do have a pull for the shower, so the cover couldn&#x27;t fit on tight. Also, my 14 month old son pulls this off the spout no problem. That would be the only thing I don&#x27;t like. But it does entertain my son when water flows out of the tentacles.</li>
            <li> Fun times with grandson. no sharp edges and softens the spout ... we have fun together.</li>
            <li> Ozzie the Octopus Faucet Cover has a very friendly face, and is fun as water comes out four of his tentacles.  My son, who is ten months old, loves it and it always keeps him entertained.  It fits perfectly on the faucet, and when my son tries to pull on the tentacles, it stays in place, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about him removing it from the faucet.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for something nice to cover the faucet to protect your baby&#x27;s head from hitting it.</li>
            <li> Very cute but it doesn&#x27;t stay on the faucet.  It&#x27;s too bottom heavy and once the water is on the weight makes it slide right off.&lt;br /&gt;You can put the crayons color drops into it&#x27;s mouth but it&#x27;s hard to get them in there since it&#x27;s just a slit opening.&lt;br /&gt;My son does like playing with it in the bath but it doesn&#x27;t work for the intended purpose for us.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product if your spout has a shower diverter as it covers it up. For some reason I was thinking mine did not when I purchased this and will be returning it to purchase a different style instead. Otherwise, the product is cute and probably works well if you don&#x27;t mind having to remove it every time you need to use the shower.</li>
            <li> Fun and great service</li>
            <li> Ozzie the octopus does what he is supposed to do and we did not have any difficulties with installation. We have to remove the cover after each use in order to spray out the tub and noticed that water droplets accumulate and are difficult to get out without wiping it down. Additionally, I was a bit surprised that no one mentioned that the tentacles look a bit more phallic than is pictured on the box. It&#x27;s a little creepy...especially when the water is colored with a color tablet. I would still recommend the product but think buyers should beware! I attempted to upload a picture but didn&#x27;t see that option.</li>
            <li> Really hard to get on but I guess that means it won&#x27;t fall off either!  Baby thinks it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> Cute as at it shows in the picture.  The opening can be changed to fit the water spout.  The colors coming out of the arms is way cool!  Grandson loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a year and my son loves it.  Haven&#x27;t had any mold issues, like others have.  It doubles as a fun toy to play with while the water is running and protects against the sharp/hard faucet.</li>
            <li> This is such a cute product. It&#x27;s a shame that after repeated use over a couple of months (and with shaking out the water after each bath), that mold starts to grow inside. Based on the design (which happens to trap a little water inside), I don&#x27;t think this spout cover ever completely dries between baths.</li>
            <li> I keep trying to make this work with our spout because it&#x27;s so cute, but it just doesn&#x27;t. We have a newer bathroom, but not a fancy spout or anything! But I can&#x27;t even get it on and have to tried everything. At this point if I got it on I wouldnt &#x27;t be able to get it off again! I&#x27;m surprised more people didn&#x27;t comment about how you&#x27;d have to take it off to pull the downspout lever for the shower (assuming you could even get it on in the first place!). I&#x27;m only annoyed that I bought this before baby was born and only recently tried to put it on since he&#x27;s out of his baby tub now, so it&#x27;s well beyond my return period!</li>
            <li> Toddler loves it - biggest issue is not being able to access the shower pull to turn the shower head on</li>
            <li> kept comming off the spout ....</li>
            <li> Larger than you think.  Is very tight around spout and you have to remove to turn shower on.  When you remove it of you are not careful the plastic seal wil rip.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put this on my bathtub it broke. Very dissapointed!!</li>
            <li> it gets wet inside, its difficult to clean or dry. be careful of mold!!!</li>
            <li> I think Ozzie is realy cute.  He does not stay on the spout well if it is touched and my 2 year old easily removes him.  I do like that the water is diverted out the 4 tentacles.  My 2 year old does also.  She removes him from the spout and then likes to pour water in him and watch it come out the 4 locals.  I have never used the color as I don&#x27;t know how I feel about coloring my daughter&#x27;s bath water.  He is cute and does fit on...I just don&#x27;t like how easily he comes off what he is meant to be protecting.  Seems like he needs a softer grippy surface not a hard molded plastic to stay on.</li>
            <li> My kids love this. The color tablets work great with it and the fact that water comes out of 4 different places is neat.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my youngest daughter and it was so much fun and super cute so I just had to find another for my first granddaughter! The only dislike about this is it shows placing the color tabs through the mouth of the octopus, but it is thick rubber with a tiny slit which makes it difficult to push the tabs through it&#x27;s mouth</li>
            <li> It looks cute and the water really comes out of each of its legs. Goes on but with some strategic work. Hard to get off because we have the faucet with the piece you pull up and down to close the drain.</li>
            <li> I only give it 2 starrs because i do like the color quality, but It is very uncomfortable to use. it is not easy to put on and take off. I was expecting to leave this on at all times, but you cant because you ca not close and open the water nozzle easily.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize this is a perfect mold breeder - the interior of the head turned black within weeks (even after being washed/bleached/vinegared etc)&lt;br /&gt;while a cute idea, i don&#x27;t need my kids being bathed in pieces of mold!</li>
            <li> Garbage. Too hard of plastic to even push over our faucet. Waste of money and poor kids&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> Ozzie doesn&#x27;t stay on the spout when water is glowing heavily. However, my son loves this guy!</li>
            <li> This is so cute, but it doesn&#x27;t stay snug on the spout and i have to all but break it to get it off. This is not for someone who wants to take it on and off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too easy for my baby girl to pull off... but its cute and she does like seeing the water come out!  I wish I had gotten something a bit more secure.</li>
            <li> If your spout doesn&#x27;t have a pop-up stopper, it&#x27;ll fall off constantly. But my son likes it, whether it&#x27;s on the faucet or not.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit our bathrub</li>
            <li> So much fun! I tried the color tabs once but baby is more thrilled with all the spouts of water! I did have a hard time with the shower tab fitting in and out of the toy, but I tore out the inner rings and it works fine.</li>
            <li> This product caused our water pressure to backflow into our pipes and ultimately into our walls causing a ton of drywall damage. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. It keep her protected from hitting her head on the water spout. I haven&#x27;t tried the color tabs because I think she is a little to young but I&#x27;m sure one day she will enjoy it. I give it four stars because it does move around a bit on the spout. I has never come off though.</li>
            <li> cute, fun, fits well. harder to get off but that is ok. comes with the tablets that change color. recommend to anyone with kids interested in the faucet!</li>
            <li> This is a great product again the negative reviews have to be user errors or unrealistic views. This spout cover does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Cover the spout! It stays on quite well despite the fact that we do not have a shower pull on the faucet. It is NOT a toy so as long as it isn&#x27;t played with it stays on. My daughter will walk up and touch it etc and it stays put but she knows not to try and play with it. Its made by crayola so it comes with the color changing bath tabs that go in his mouth. The water comes out of his front four legs. It&#x27;s quite neat and my kid loves it.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is cute and it does the job of protecting the little ones in the bath tub. The only thing I wish was different is the design of not being able to access the shower spout. (It doesn&#x27;t take long to take it off and put it back on, though.)</li>
            <li> our spout doesn&#x27;t have a shower divider so my daughter can pull it off the spout very easily which is exactly what she does during bath time. We start bath time with Ozzie being a spout cover, but end up with him being just another bath toy by the time we finish. If only we had a shower divider on our spout, i feel like this would have been the perfect spout cover.</li>
            <li> I hate this product. It is very old and out dated. When putting it on my spout the plastic cracked and the item fell apart on me. I ended up returning it back for a refund. At this time I am unsure if I am able to get a refund or not.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a little difficult to get over a faucet with a shower pull tab on it, but it&#x27;s definitely do-able.  We have a kids&#x27; bathroom that is rarely to never used for showers, so it hasn&#x27;t been an issue to leave it on the faucet, once it&#x27;s on there.  But we also take it with us every time we go out of town to visit family (which is frequently, since we&#x27;re military and not stationed near family), and I&#x27;ve never had any problems getting it on or off any other faucet.  It takes a little bit of tugging and twisting, but I can easily do it a couple seconds (now that I&#x27;m used to it).    My kids LOVE the way the water comes out all four legs (the other four legs are underneath him, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about an inaccurate octopus!), and the bath coloring tablets are so much fun - the kids pop them in his mouth, and the water comes out brightly colored.  My son hates baths, and Ozzie has not only made them tolerable for him, but sometimes he even has fun.      Oh, and it protects their little heads from hitting that hard metal faucet, too - and you certainly don&#x27;t need to worry about it slipping off, if the faucet has a shower pull.</li>
            <li> Love this except it&#x27;s insanely hard to get off the spout if you what to take a shower :-/</li>
            <li> This spout cover has been in my house for less than 9 months and after every bath we turn it upside down... but it is impossible to keep all the water out because if its shape...and is now sprouting mold! I definitely would look for a spout cover that is easy to clean. We had the ELMO bubbles one for 2 years and that acquired mold in the bubble portion...also really hard to keep drained of water...</li>
            <li> The tentacles piece of this product broke off from its head on first use.  Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t put it back so it&#x27;ll stay put or attached to the head, so it must have been glued on originally. Amazon refunded us our money, so kudos to Amazon.  Poor quality IMHO.</li>
            <li> Fun but hard to get off the spout</li>
            <li> The octopus had to be modified to fit over our faucet. The water sprayed backward toward the tub instead of outward toward the kids. Unable to access shower activator through octopus which is important for a thorough rinse. Would not recommend....requires some design improvements; namely, more flexible fit, and ability to access shower activator.</li>
            <li> Like many others, this ripped as soon as we put it on. Amazon rocks for easy refunds, so it&#x27;s now a dog toy. Don&#x27;t let the brand fool you, this is poorly made.</li>
            <li> Kids love this thing and the colored tablets are really cool</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because people said it was difficult to get on &amp; there wasn&#x27;t a whole for the shower diverter. So i got it anyway &amp; after a little altering it was easy. The hole in the back was a little small so i did 4 little cuts..One on each side of the hole &amp; instead of pushing it on i twisted it on. But make sure you angle it over the diverter first then twist. Once it was on i felt around &amp; measured out where the diverter was &amp; cut a circle on top with a small knife. Now it&#x27;s perfect. Once it&#x27;s on you can&#x27;t see the small cuts on the opening.. &amp; The shower diverter pops right out of the hole on top. Perfect. No complaints here. Sometimes you need to make a few changes yourself..Not everyone&#x27;s tubs are the same. My niece loves Ozzie so i&#x27;m glad we made it work on our own.</li>
            <li> This spout cover works well.  Our shower switch is located on the bottom of our faucet.  This spout cover fits over that well.  The water comes out the legs, so my baby has a lot of fun playing with the water stream.  We have not tried the color tablets yet.  Overall it does a good job covering the spout and it is fun.</li>
            <li> Love the product; it&#x27;s exactly what we expected for our new daughter.  That said, it was difficult to attach to a fairly standard spout.  And once we tried to remove the spout (as our daughter has to share the guest bathroom with, well, guests...) the plastic around the suction started to tear.  Still have yet to completely remove \\&quot;Ozzie,\\&quot; and while it still works, half of the water spits out the back.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for what we were needing! it is large and protects from all the bumbs! the water squirts out of the tentacles and you have the option to put in a crayola water changing tabblet that has no harm if ingested which makes it much more fun for bath time! love love love and will buy from here again!</li>
            <li> The octopus would not stay on the faucet.  It was great and my Grand son loved it when it held on....but it fell off after nly a minute or so...big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my nieces 1st bday because she loves bath time. Boy did she love it! She was laughing at it because of how the water comes out of his legs! She loved the pink water also. Very affordable and cute! Its unisex which is a plus considering she has a 3 y/o brother.</li>
            <li> I guess this was only meant as a bath time only play toy? The top part of the Octopus&#x27;s head has no hole for bath tubs with a downspout pull rod  (to switch from a shower head function to bath fill downspout when filling a tub) so it&#x27;s quite inconvenient to put on and take off every time.  Also, the inside of Ozzie&#x27;s head seems hard to drain water from and I&#x27;m afraid over time even after drying it may develop mold in the hard to drain crevices. Cute toy but not what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> Cute, does not work properly or fit snuggly.</li>
            <li> My girls already loved bath time..but now it is much more fun watching the water come out of the octopus.! The color blocks are great too, but I wont make a habit of using them.!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and serves its purpose but we had to scrub the inside of the tentacles often to keep the mold away.</li>
            <li> We had the opposite problem of other reviewers - our tub spout was way to skinny for Ollie to fit on! But our little loved the octopus, so dad went to the hardware store and picked up a fatter spout. The only problem is, we have an old fashoned shower that has the water diverter up on the wall (seperate knob) so Ollie still isn&#x27;t 100% secure.  He&#x27;s wedged on to the spout pretty well, and our daughters little lobster claws won&#x27;t be able to pull him off anytime soon. BUT - to get him wedged on well enough, we had to push him so far back it now looks like Ollie has one of the aliens from \\&quot;Alien\\&quot; about to pop out of the front of his face. Water comes out of his mouth as well as his tentacles, which has rendered the whole \\&quot;put a color tab in his mouth\\&quot; business absolutely moot. Also, him being so far back has rendered his big squishy head moot as padding too. Thankfully our daughter plays mostly at the back of the tub, and is big enough that at this point Ollie fufills spoiling her rotten more than protecting her noggin.  Long story short: We would have had to switch the faucet for almost any tub spout we purchased, but unless you have a diverter knob ON the faucet, Ollie may not be the best choice. Unless all you need is a cute octopus for your little to have a bath time chat with.</li>
            <li> Too small for the spout! Wish I had read more of the reviews before buying. There are black markings that look like some sort of grease on both sides of product. I also found that the glue was chipping off in several places. Inside there is a raised hole for the water to come out but after washing I could not get all the water out. Seems like this product would be a mildew trap to me. Poor product design all the way around.</li>
            <li> My son is not old enough yet to fully enjoy this, but it is awesome. Every bathtub should have this guy in it. The water comes out of his little legs which is so fun. And it&#x27;s pretty big, bigger than I thought it was actually. Very safe for little noggins!</li>
            <li> Study hard rubber but its also soft and smooth. A great product for kids to add a little something extra to any bath.</li>
            <li> We skipped the color dye pellets that come with the octopus (just 3, I believe) but our granddaughter loved the multiple streams of water that come out and we kept her head safe from the hard faucet</li>
            <li> My twins are 11 months old and just transitioning to the big tub.  They love to stand in the tub (we bathe them in a clothes basket in the tub) and I was so scared they would bump their heads on the faucet.  Ozzie solved that problem, and the fact that I can put the color tabs in just makes it super fun!  They love to play with the water as it streams out of his tentacles.  This little guy is 100% fun and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> We have a pull tab for the shower on our faucet. We unscrewed the tab to make it smaller which it did fit over it and was a huge hit however the first time I had to take it off (only a few weeks later bc someone needed to take a shower) the material had almost dry rotted and broke apart :(</li>
            <li> This fit my tub faucet perfectly and we love it. It is the cutest spout cover I could find- and when it arrived, it was  even more adorable than I imagined.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to cover the faucet to protect your little one, its ok. I loved the idea of this cover and it is super cute, however it must come off for us to use the shower, it does not stay in a completely upright position when on the faucet but more or less hangs on it. I thought I would use it to color the water to make bathtime more fun, but I end up having to run the water before I put the cover on bc it can&#x27;t handle full water pressure or water starts coming out of the back. All in all it works for my basic needs but I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> my friends lovesit  playin in bath with us n after three</li>
            <li> I have a &amp;#34;standard spout&amp;#34; and it took 30 minutes to squeeze the thing on. To turn on the shower I have to remove it again to lift the metal stick thing. It was a fight to get it off too.</li>
            <li> this is a very cute and fun spout cover. water comes out of all the legs though if you have a grabby baby it can be easily pulled off</li>
            <li> Works really neat. http://tinypic.com/r/jkc80l/8&lt;br /&gt;However, it was dirty when I received it. That was pretty disappointing. http://tinypic.com/r/1zh376c/8&lt;br /&gt;http://tinypic.com/r/27wrimx/8&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is very hard to make it stay securely on the faucet and it thought my bathtub faucet would end up too wide instead of too narrow.</li>
            <li> We love this spout cover. It keps my 1 year old from bumping his head on the spout and my older kids love feeding it color changing tablets. It is a bit hard for them to push even the mini tablets in and the water needs to be off, so we often &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34; and put them in the back then put it on the spout.  We have to remove it in order to take showers and in less than 6 months the back started tearing from the on and off so it will go o now but angles down and water comes out the back. We still use it though and it still serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to keep on the actual faucet. Also, water sits inside after use and has led to mildew.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect on our spout and we even have the pull down on it for the shower. I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to fit at first put just had to put it on at an angle and it fits perfect! My little one has bumped her head on it and no tears! She also loves the water coming out of the little tentacles!</li>
            <li> I think I was more excited about this than my 10 month old son. I had no idea that the water gets diverted through this and comes out his front 4 legs! Its AWESOME!!! He also enjoyed the water flow from the legs, as it was a cause for random clapping and squeals. It only holds on to the spout through friction, and my little guy managed to pull it almost all the way off, but I imagine that is the case with most spout covers. I especially like that you can add the water colorant to it, which should be a super cool bath-time thing in about a year, when it can be appreciated more by the little one.</li>
            <li> Very cute spout cover. Only giving 4 stars because I will have to cut it to fit over my faucet. The thing that is on top of my faucet that you pull up to make the shower head go makes it impossible to put this cover on. But it&#x27;s still cute.</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose but I wish it fit better.</li>
            <li> I wish this product was easier to find.........I&#x27;m so glad I found it online.  My grandson had one and I just had to buy one for my little great grandson.  It&#x27;s the kind of toy I would buy for every little child who loves the bathtub.</li>
            <li> baby loves to play with the streams of water, even more so when we add the color drops. I feel better knowing if he falls he won&#x27;t hit his head on the metal spout.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t stay on faucet</li>
            <li> I bought this despite some negative reviews about difficulty getting it on/off and don&#x27;t have any problems. My daughter loves that water comes out of each tentacle! We haven&#x27;t used the color tablets because she is still young but I&#x27;m sure that will add even more fun!</li>
            <li> Our grandson loves his octopus!!!!!</li>
            <li> Collected mold quickly.</li>
            <li> Fits great over the spout and the color drop ins are fun for my son. It&#x27;s also not as expensive as the other brands.</li>
            <li> I just cut a small hole in the top with some kitchen shears to be able to reach the tub diverter.  No problem.  The leg holes aren&#x27;t very big so the water kind of backs up in the octopus.  All in all a good product.</li>
            <li> I love what this spout cover does and how cute it looks, but it often falls off my faucet and makes my little boy cry &#x3D;(! It&#x27;s also a little hard to shove the color drops into his mouth without making it fall off. (Maybe it&#x27;s just my faucet...not sure.)</li>
            <li> My four year old loves this and now I bough additional tablets for all kinds of water colors.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really fit well on our standard faucet but it works and the water comes out fun for baby.</li>
            <li> The kids love it. Was nice to have 3 Crayola water cookies included in the package.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have the knob to divert water to your shower on your faucet its good and stays on...but on our faucet it keeps falling off.  It is fun to put the color tablets in his mouth and see the water come his legs...if only it would stay on without me holding it.</li>
            <li> My toddler love it.  We let any residual water run out after the bath, so no worry about mildew</li>
            <li> This item is very cute to look at, but it will not stay on once the water is turned on.  Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son thinking he would love the octopus looking water faucet, which he thought interesting for a few moments, which is about right for a little one. I liked the color tablets and the multiple tentacles thing, but it did not fit our faucet. If you read other reviews, many others have this issue as well. We ultimately returned the item and bought a duck looking faucet cover that allows you to put your bubbles in its hat.</li>
            <li> Such a cute idea and love the colored tablets that poor out!</li>
            <li> Turn it upside down for some waterfall fun!</li>
            <li> my grandson absolutely loves this!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for safety but hard to get off n on. Perfect item just what I needed great buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Ripped the moment we put it on, and was placed/removed with difficulty (even for an adult). Doesn&#x27;t work if you ever intend to use the tub as a shower, as the item covers the &amp;#34;pull knob&amp;#34; on the top of the faucet.</li>
            <li> When I got this it didn&#x27;t stay on and when I looked it was broken so I give this no stars</li>
            <li> I love this guy, and so does my son, that&#x27;s why he keeps pulling it off the spout. He might stay on if there was one of those shower diverter knobs at the end of the spout but if you don&#x27;t have one your child can easily pull this guy off. Trying to figure out a way to attach it so he stays put, even with curious little hands.</li>
            <li> My kids love seeing the different colors come out and into the water. Now they use the bathtub crayons to put make up and face paint the octopus!...Be sure to clean it every so often as it can get moldy. I use an old toothbrush and some bleach solution to clean it well.</li>
            <li> This did not have the shower lever I thought it would..and it was not friendly to my faucet. While trying to shove this on..it broke the seal to my faucet. It works great but I dont see me being able to use it much since I have to remove it all the time. I may end up cutting a spot for the lever. Will re review if it works..</li>
            <li> Better than I thought</li>
            <li> Had it for only one day and its broken. Using it in an old un-updated apartment doesn&#x27;t work out well</li>
            <li> my friend has this and recommended it to me for my 2 year old. turns out it&#x27;s not in stores anymore so i turned to amazon. we love it. when you throw color tabs in it each of the 4 tentacles pours a different color. very happy with it :)</li>
            <li> We picked this octopus because we thought it was very cute. It fits easily on my spout but the base of the structure keeps water pooled in it and doesn&#x27;t drain when we&#x27;re done. So, it gets slimy inside. We have to clean it every time we run a bath and it&#x27;s not particularly easy to get clean. Super cute idea, but not very practical. We have not used the color tablets since our baby is too young for them.</li>
            <li> Super cute but we found out that there was mold in the tentacles because water didn&#x27;t drain.</li>
            <li> This seems like a great and fun idea but it definitely doesn&#x27;t work on the faucet on my tub. It is made of a pretty hard rubber &amp; the hole to go over the faucet is too big. My tub doesn&#x27;t have a shower so I&#x27;m sure if it had the thing you pull up for a shower it would work better. I think if it was made of softer rubber &amp; the hole would just stretch a little it would be more universal. I did read other reviews that said it was too big for their faucet but I thought I&#x27;d try it anyway anyway because I figured I could make it work. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have because they were right &amp; if it doesn&#x27;t fit it&#x27;s pretty useless!</li>
            <li> Loved the look of this spout cover and the colored bath drop feature BUT it is very difficult to remove on a spout with a shower diverter on the top. Also, got moldy on the inside within a month of use.</li>
            <li> so adorable! my daughter loves this! great product, only issue is it doesn&#x27;t stay very well on the spout and kind of tilts when the water runs. otherwise we love it!</li>
