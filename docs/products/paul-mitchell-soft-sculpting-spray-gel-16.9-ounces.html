            <li>and I was able to find it easly  on the web.</li>
            <li>No,  it is more of a spray than a gel.</li>

            <li>Great product, fast delivery.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>There may be newer products available but this product has worked for me for many years.</li>
            <li>Easily washes out.</li>
            <li>Some spray gels leave my hair sticky, but this is light and does the job.</li>
            <li>; so it doesn&#x27;t make the hair stiff--just holds it lightly.</li>
            <li>Smells like cheap tacky hairspray.</li>
            <li>Spray gel has nice hold, but not stiff.</li>
            <li>Great product but getting harder to find in the retail stores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that the product is a true Paul Mitchell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never liked hair spray but Gel is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for fine hair, it helps it hold some body but doesn&#x27;t feel stiff.</li>
            <li>Love Paul Soft Sculpting Spray Gel!!</li>
            <li>Really keeps my set in and easy to comb out.</li>
            <li>and then you can comb right thru it.</li>
            <li>THE PRICE WAS RIGHT FOR THIS SIZE OF BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>It sculpts very gently and holds my style in place with out &amp;#34;bullying&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and would rather use it than regular gels.</li>
            <li>Much easier than going shopping!</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell has not changed in quality since I first started using it.</li>
            <li>There have been a few others that come close but none as good as this.  </li>
            <li>thanks great product if you don&#x27;t want your heair to be too hard.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and have been using this product for over 10 years (generally purchase it at the hair salon).  </li>
            <li>Have always loved this product but not able to find it in beauty supply stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time living in Fl as I do, I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use it on almost dry hair</li>
            <li>I received the spray gel very promptly.  </li>
            <li>Smooth transaction &amp; will be coming back .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use too much because I find it makes my hair &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; if I do.</li>
            <li>I use it to add body to straight, colored hair.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I am convinced that this is not the real product.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed as I have used this for years.</li>
            <li>The soft sculpting spray gel does exactly what it says it does</li>
            <li>Live the spray gel and have used it for yrs, so much easier to buy online</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT VERY STICKY, EASY TO SPRAY TO ON THE ROOTS OF YOUR HAIR.  </li>
            <li>With standard shipping, came quickly and was as promised.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It gives new bounce and body to my shiny, fly-away</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find this particular product  in the stores in RI, they have other similar products  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair natural looking and not stiff.</li>
            <li>It holds my hair in place and it feels natural to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It has become difficult to find locally and I am very glad I can still purchase it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It gives hair lots of body (mine is thin) without feeling sticky or getting that &amp;#34;hard shell&amp;#34; feeling of many sprays.</li>
            <li>Others are too stiff but this is just right.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, it works better for me in spring, summer and fall -- nothing tames the fly-away poker straight look I must live with in winter:(</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a heavy product but gives my fine hair just enough body and shape without weighing it down and getting oily.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have very short hair and most products are too heavy for my thin hair.  Not so with this one!  It sculpts very gently and holds my style in place with out &amp;#34;bullying&amp;#34; my hair.  This is very hard to find in the stores, so I buy it on-line.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a long time obtaining it thru amazon have save a lot of time and money.</li>
            <li> This is the only one my wife uses.&lt;br /&gt;She orders it when needed.&lt;br /&gt;Tried others that are less expensive.  She did not like them, so back to Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li> Great product that works as advertised. Use it once in the morning and your hair is set all day.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and have been using this product for over 10 years (generally purchase it at the hair salon).  It gives new bounce and body to my shiny, fly-away hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Admittedly, it works better for me in spring, summer and fall -- nothing tames the fly-away poker straight look I must live with in winter:(</li>

            <li> Great product but getting harder to find in the retail stores. I have used this for many years and would rather use it than regular gels.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 25 years and have found nothing else that comes close to it.  It isn&#x27;t a heavy product but gives my fine hair just enough body and shape without weighing it down and getting oily.  There have been a few others that come close but none as good as this.  It has become difficult to find locally and I am very glad I can still purchase it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used P M products;&lt;br /&gt;Scent not strong and holds hair just&lt;br /&gt;the way I wanted; not sticky and flaky.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  My husband uses as he has fine hair and it works beautifully for him.  It holds without being sticky or too hard.  You can comb through it if you need to and it still stays nice.</li>
            <li> This works well on my boss&#x27;s very fine hair.  It&#x27;s not too heavy at all and she swears by it!</li>
            <li> as expected!  Great product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Makes styling easier.  Adds fullness.</li>
            <li> This spray works well when styling hair with a curling iron, and leaves hair with out a stickie build-up. Also it will hold your hair in the wind with out budging and then you can comb right thru it.</li>
            <li> Much easier than going shopping!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but am having trouble finding it since I moved out of NY. I spray it on wet hair after PM Heat Seal, another long used product. I don&#x27;t use too much because I find it makes my hair &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; if I do. I use it to add body to straight, colored hair. Most of the time living in Fl as I do, I let my hair air dry. Then when I want to style it, the product is in, I mist hair with water and proceed. This is not a smoother or frizz tamer, though PM has a setting lotion that includes that, not a big fan. I add the PM frizz smoother in the small pump container last on the dry styled hair.  There may be newer products available but this product has worked for me for many years.</li>
            <li> This product is great for fine hair, it helps it hold some body but doesn&#x27;t feel stiff.</li>
            <li> Some spray gels leave my hair sticky, but this is light and does the job. It is as good as the now discontinued spray gel from TiGi BedHead. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Spray gel has nice hold, but not stiff. Makes my hair natural looking and not stiff. Easily washes out. Reasonably priced. Great product.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this product but not able to find it in beauty supply stores anymore.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff but gives it enough body to help with styling.  Thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time ,I always use this product.</li>
            <li> Love Paul Soft Sculpting Spray Gel!!</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL ENOUGH TO SHAPE MY HAIR &amp; MY HAIR IS THICK &amp; COURSE.  IT&#x27;S NOT VERY STICKY, EASY TO SPRAY TO ON THE ROOTS OF YOUR HAIR.  IF THE NOZZLE DOES GET CLOGGED, IT&#x27;S SO EASY TO JUST RUN THE SPRAY NOZZLE UNDER WARM WATER AND IT DID THE TRICK FOR ME.  THE PRICE WAS RIGHT FOR THIS SIZE OF BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> I love this product as my hair salon no longer carries it I had to turn to Amazon and thy have it what makes it so nice it is in a much larger bottle than I would buy at the salon. The reason I love it ,does not make my hair sticky or all gobbered up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that the product is a true Paul Mitchell.  It doesn&#x27;t hold as well as the Paul Mitchell soft sculpting spray gel that I usually use.</li>
            <li> Very nice alternative to hairspray</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because she said she needed some more and could not find it in a brick and mortar store. I have no clue if it works. Her hair looks nice.</li>
            <li> thanks great product if you don&#x27;t want your heair to be too hard.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in my area.  I always had to search salons and stores for small bottles.  This is perfect.  Like is says, it is &amp;#34;soft sculpting&amp;#34; so it doesn&#x27;t make the hair stiff--just holds it lightly.</li>
            <li> quality as expected Paul Mitchell has not changed in quality since I first started using it. Amazon has a good start in deliveries, please keep it that way.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ORDERED THRU THIS VENDER BEFORE AND HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE AND THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this spray by my hairdresser.  Use it on wet hair before you blow-dry (or let it dry naturally).  It gives hair lots of body (mine is thin) without feeling sticky or getting that &amp;#34;hard shell&amp;#34; feeling of many sprays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years!!  It controls the crazy curls.. Just make sure to use it on almost dry hair so it doesn&#x27;t get that crunchy look.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. I love it.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that this is not the real product. It did not perform like the ones that I have purchased in salons. Very dissapointed as I have used this for years.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in the drugstores. But I think its the best setting lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  Really keeps my set in and easy to comb out. Others are too stiff but this is just right.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected and delivered on time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in here, but this is not the stuff I have bought in salons. Smells like cheap tacky hairspray. Awful.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and hopefully for many more years.  The soft sculpting spray gel does exactly what it says it does and what I need!  I&#x27;ve never liked hair spray but Gel is perfect.  It holds my hair in place and it feels natural to the touch.  Love it!</li>
