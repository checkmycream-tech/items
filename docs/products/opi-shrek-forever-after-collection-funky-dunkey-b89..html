            <li>Such a beautiful color.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s still available when I use up this bottle, I may purchase it again.</li>

            <li>It goes on smoothly without being streaky.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li>It has great coverage and is long wearing.  </li>
            <li>As a result it peeled clean off after 3 hours.  </li>
            <li>just right!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this polish.  </li>
            <li>Overall LOVED</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty purple color, Thankyou for the nail polish.</li>
            <li>but it is still a very pretty darker purple.</li>
            <li>This is my number one new favorite color.  </li>
            <li>It is so pretty on!</li>
            <li>I love the color purple and have lots of different clothes that are all different shades of purple, so what better way to top off an outfit with jewelry and nail polish.</li>
            <li>but this one is really nice and deep.</li>
            <li>It goes on quick and dries quick too, and I love O.P.I nail polishes, they have tons of different colors</li>
            <li>it is long lasting and OPI is a really good brand :)</li>
            <li>Mom reported she got another color, but she didn&#x27;t get it right</li>
            <li>I received the item right on time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the prefect shade or purple, not too bright and not too dark,</li>
            <li>Love the different names!</li>
            <li>Had this color by OPI first at a salon &amp; decided to have it at home, too.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this color!!</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful dark purple with blue undertones.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear bright colors on my hands b/c</li>
            <li>As usual with OPI the quality is good.</li>
            <li>The color was great but was very thick and gloopy.  </li>
            <li>As always, I really like the OPI product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to tell from pictures exactly what the color will be, but once the &amp;#34;Funky Dunkey&amp;#34; was on my nails, it was great.  </li>
            <li>If you wanted to tone it down a bit, I&#x27;m thinking maybe you could opt for the Matte polish on top?</li>
            <li>Recommend product (and color) plus the seller highly.</li>
            <li>I had hoped it was going to be a little more funky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my new fav</li>
            <li>Wish I had bought a bright blue instead, this is rather a dull purple for my taste.</li>
            <li>A must have especially now since purple is the new hot color in nail fashion.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty flat, and it is more of a pale, darkish purple.</li>
            <li>not too bright but not too dark like almost black too.   </li>
            <li>My mom always fusses about how many of the \\&quot;same nail color polish I have\\&quot; - not understanding that they are  different SHADES of the same color, which is totally different!</li>
            <li>that \\&quot;pop,\\&quot; just enough for those who fear too much color.)</li>
            <li>I saw this particular color on my friend when i visited Alaska last year and thought I had to have it!</li>
            <li>It was very apparent they were worn, returned, and resold on the web.</li>
            <li>If other shoppers were wise, they would not buy and throw away their money on items sold by a poor quality manufacturing company.</li>

            <li> My daughters long nails and our toes.</li>
            <li> and I wore this color, with a top coat of Mad as a Hatter, for 4 weeks without a single chip on my toenails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too dark, but it&#x27;s definitely not lavender</li>

            <li> Opi seems to not chip as much as other nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it is a little darker than I usually wear</li>

            <li> Anywho, I had ran out of a previous purple by OPI (the name eludes me at the moment) and had been looking for a replacement purple.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have a problem with O.P.I polishes but did here.  </li>
            <li> Stays on at least a week.</li>
            <li> I usually always use OPI nail polish!</li>
            <li> I am a nail polish fanatic!</li>
            <li> I thought the seller sent the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the confusion.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Picking out a color sight unseen is crazy!!  But, I thought I&#x27;d take a chance.  When it came &amp; I put it on my nails, it was great!  And I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments.  Give it a try &amp; see for yourself.  It&#x27;s a great color for women who&#x27;s color wheel is winter.</li>
            <li> My mom always fusses about how many of the \\&quot;same nail color polish I have\\&quot; - not understanding that they are  different SHADES of the same color, which is totally different! Anywho, I had ran out of a previous purple by OPI (the name eludes me at the moment) and had been looking for a replacement purple. OPI is the ONLY brand that makes  a purple that I would wear and this purple is PERFECT! It is so pretty on! If you wanted to tone it down a bit, I&#x27;m thinking maybe you could opt for the Matte polish on top? (Beauty tip: Matte always tones down colors that \\&quot;pop,\\&quot; just enough for those who fear too much color.) Try it! You will love it too!</li>
            <li> I am a nail polish fanatic! I use polishes from China glaze to OPI. I saw this particular color on my friend when i visited Alaska last year and thought I had to have it! I couldn&#x27;t find this color anywhere in the stores, so i ordered it online. When i got it, i tried it on and it was just OK. The color is pretty flat, and it is more of a pale, darkish purple. Its still cute tho.</li>
            <li> Opi is a great quality of nail polish. I will only by opi for this reason. Opi seems to not chip as much as other nail polishes. Love the different names!</li>
            <li> I got the nail polish In time. It&#x27;s a very pretty purple color, Thankyou for the nail polish.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have a problem with O.P.I polishes but did here.  The color was great but was very thick and gloopy.  As a result it peeled clean off after 3 hours.  I added a little nail polish remover to it in the hope that it will salvage a new bottle of polish.</li>
            <li> I thought the seller sent the wrong color. MY BAD! Mom reported she got another color, but she didn&#x27;t get it right (maybe she&#x27;s gotten color-blind!). This is PERFECT!! Sorry for the confusion. Great seller, great product~~!!</li>
            <li> I like this color. The purple is very nice. not too bright but not too dark like almost black too.   I received the item right on time however the bottle has some white permanent scratches.</li>
            <li> Fundy Dunky is a great name for this polish and even better that its my favorite color Ü</li>
            <li> Had this color by OPI first at a salon &amp; decided to have it at home, too.  It is great, quickly delivered &amp; just what I wanted. Recommend product (and color) plus the seller highly.</li>
            <li> DIFFENENTLY PURPLE. WAS IMPRESED. DOESNT CHIP I DO PUT A GLOSS OVER IT. LONG LASTING. PROTECTS NAILS WELL. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE THAT LIKES PURPLE.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish it&#x27;s great! I love the color purple and have lots of different clothes that are all different shades of purple, so what better way to top off an outfit with jewelry and nail polish. This color polish looks good on my finger nails and toe nails too! It goes on quick and dries quick too, and I love O.P.I nail polishes, they have tons of different colors and it&#x27;s a better quality nail polish. It lasts longer! :)</li>
            <li> I love this purple! It&#x27;s a great polish. It&#x27;s a cream medium plum purple color. It&#x27;s not too dark, but it&#x27;s definitely not lavender, it&#x27;s the perfect shade of purple.</li>
            <li> I like this OPI purple creme color.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is a little darker than I usually wear but it is still a very pretty darker purple.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect purple!  It&#x27;s a grape/raisin color :0) Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my number one new favorite color.  It is gorgeous!!!  It is everything I expect out of a purple and I wore this color, with a top coat of Mad as a Hatter, for 4 weeks without a single chip on my toenails.  I got a lot of compliments.  I recommend this color to everyone!!!  The seller was awesome as well.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this polish.  A definite \\&quot;must have\\&quot; to every girls collection!!!</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful color. It&#x27;s been my new fav since I got it in the mail. It&#x27;s the prefect shade or purple, not too bright and not too dark, just right! A must have especially now since purple is the new hot color in nail fashion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product just 3 days ago and today i wanted to get the mail and I found this in my mailbox! I immediately opened the package and started to apply the coat. I was so happy, the color is amazing epecially for now, since its getting into the fall season. It&#x27;s perfect and my sisters and friends love it and want to borrow it from me, this is a definitely awesome color. I &lt;3 OPI</li>
            <li> This color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of purple polishes but this one is really nice and deep. It&#x27;s good on many skin tones.</li>
            <li> Love this color. This goes on very smooth * the color shown is very accurate. Not disappointed with this product. Stays on at least a week.</li>
            <li> this is a great color for all who love purple. it is long lasting and OPI is a really good brand :)</li>
            <li> I received a pair of boots for which I paid $44.98 with my credit card. They were used and damaged with glue coming out of them, scratched up, and scuffed on the side. It was very apparent they were worn, returned, and resold on the web. After I sent them photos of the damaged boots, they crediting my account $10.00, which only covers the shipping. If other shoppers were wise, they would not buy and throw away their money on items sold by a poor quality manufacturing company. Forever Funky should change their name to \\&quot;Forever Junky.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no patronage here,&lt;br /&gt;Gabriela M.</li>
            <li> I had hoped it was going to be a little more funky. When I put it on I thought my nails looked like they had ben bruised , but I got used to the color. Wish I had bought a bright blue instead, this is rather a dull purple for my taste.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in the expected time frame. It was packaged properly.The item looks identical to picture and description. I love mine and use it a lot,</li>
            <li> As always, I really like the OPI product.  It has great coverage and is long wearing.  It&#x27;s difficult to tell from pictures exactly what the color will be, but once the &amp;#34;Funky Dunkey&amp;#34; was on my nails, it was great.  If it&#x27;s still available when I use up this bottle, I may purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I usually always use OPI nail polish! It is the best and I received sooo many compliments when wearing this color. I don&#x27;t usually wear bright colors on my hands b/c I am a nurse but this purple is really terrific looking on!! Keep up the good work OPI and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love the color. Last Long. OPI is my favorite nail polish. Price was great. Shipping speed was great. Overall LOVED IT!&lt;br /&gt;Looks great on my short nails. My daughters long nails and our toes.</li>
            <li> Very happy to have found this color.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful dark purple with blue undertones. As usual with OPI the quality is good. It goes on smoothly without being streaky. You could get by with two coats for opacity but I used three. If you love purple I would highly recommend this color!!</li>
