            <li> Agreed that this price is too high, but can be found for less.</li>
            <li> For the price paid I would have expected it to come with someone to actually administer the oil for me as part of the fee</li>
            <li> I know of no ratings for shaver oil, the Braun oil lubricates as expected and has no odor (oily)</li>
            <li> The oil works fine, but it is VERY expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the bottle of oil was only half full!</li>
            <li> Someone recommended olive oil or any other types of oil.  </li>
            <li> Will look other places for a cheaper price, but Amazon probably has the cheapest price.</li>
            <li> its not what i expected !</li>
            <li> Now if any spills it will be completely empty!  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money to return and try again.</li>
            <li> Not worth price.  </li>
            <li> My shaver came with one bottle, and am still slowly using it a year later.</li>
            <li> I complained by E Mail</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive for a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> TOO EXPENSIVE FOR A FEW DROPS.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and the bottle has hardly anything to begin with.</li>
            <li> Poor show.</li>
            <li> very small amount of oil comparing to the price!</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of oil for shavers over the years, and this is outrageously priced for a few drops of oil.  </li>
            <li> Outrageous for oil.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Wish I would have read the reviews, also felt cheated.  Not only is the bottle only an inch high, but it is only half full of oil.  Outrageous for oil.  I have purchased a lot of oil for shavers over the years, and this is outrageously priced for a few drops of oil.  For the price paid I would have expected it to come with someone to actually administer the oil for me as part of the fee</li>
            <li> Using this stuff makes a difference. Agreed that this price is too high, but can be found for less. My shaver came with one bottle, and am still slowly using it a year later.</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive for a tiny bottle. As soon as I figure out what it is composed of, I will probably be embarrassed that I have purchased it for the price paid and will use a substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive the product reliably and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naively Ripped Off</li>
            <li> The item arrived timely and in good condition. I was disappointed that the bottle of oil was only half full! Not worth the money to return and try again. Will order elsewhere next time.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended olive oil or any other types of oil.  It is expensive and the bottle has hardly anything to begin with.</li>
            <li> Very good oil my hubby uses for his electric razor.  Would recommend if needed for your type of razor.  Ordered the larger size, would not have to order as often.</li>
            <li> husband really like the oil, keeps his old braun shaver working well. thanks</li>
            <li> Delivery and  product are as promised.  Thanks for your efforts.&lt;br /&gt;Servando Mendez</li>
            <li> So glad to have received this, but it&#x27;s a bit costly, but works great on my Braun electric razor.  Will look other places for a cheaper price, but Amazon probably has the cheapest price.</li>
            <li> its not what i expected ! very small amount of oil comparing to the price! over all it was ok !</li>
            <li> Oil is oil is oil...I guess. I know of no ratings for shaver oil, the Braun oil lubricates as expected and has no odor (oily) so gave it a 5 as I&#x27;m satisfied that it does as anticipated.</li>
            <li> We got just what we needed!</li>
            <li> I love the oil, but not the price. I did some shopping around online and found a 4 pack from Newegg for $27.95 and free shipping.</li>
            <li> The oil works fine, but it is VERY expensive.  It cost $8.65 or thereabouts for a tiny bottle.  I can&#x27;t read the amount on the bottle because it is so tiny that even with a magnifying glass I can&#x27;t read it.  I would guess the bottle holds about 1/2 ounce.  I wasn&#x27;t surprised at the size of the bottle, but I WAS surprised to discover it comes only half-full!  Whe I emailed to complain I was told that the manufacturer ships it that was &amp;#34;to prevent spillage.&amp;#34;  Ha!  Now if any spills it will be completely empty!  What a rip-off!</li>
            <li> Very over priced - $4 for a teaspoon of oil, and $6 for shipping.  Buy sewing machine oil instead for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mineral oil.  I stumbled onto the MSDS sheet for it at http://www.pg.com/productsafety/msds/appliances/braun/BRAUN_Shaver_Oil_2014.pdf.  You probably already have it in your medicine cabinet.  A 16oz. bottle must be worth a fortune.</li>
            <li> The oil is identical to the bottle suppplied with the original shaver.</li>
            <li> excellent service and product</li>
            <li> I was very upset because the bottle was only half full.&lt;br /&gt;N. Belcher</li>
            <li> TOO EXPENSIVE FOR A FEW DROPS. AFTER THIS I WILL USE INSTRUMENT OIL FROM AN INSTRUMENT INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY HOUSE. THEY HAVE THIS  LIGHT INSTRUMENT OIL FOR INST. MOVEMENT LUBRICATION</li>
            <li> When I received the bottle of oil it was only half full. I complained by E Mail but nobody had the courtesy to answer to me. Poor show. I hope this message goes public</li>
            <li> In the description there is never a size mentioned.  Does not say &amp;#34;Sample Size&amp;#34;, tricked into believing it is regular size.  Not worth price.  Truly feel cheated.</li>
