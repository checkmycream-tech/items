            <li>One afternoon when we came home and opened the garage, my husband said, your air fresheners smell really good :)  </li>

            <li>I use more than the recommended 4-5 drops because I like the stronger scent.  </li>
            <li>Better than candles or air sprays which contain harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>so I would make sure you like the smell of mint before buying.</li>
            <li>We LOVE this oil.</li>

            <li> I use this with my diffuser and it smells very good. I use more than the recommended 4-5 drops because I like the stronger scent.  It has a very minty smell, which I love.  If you don&#x27;t like the smell of mint, don&#x27;t get this.  I use this after I cook and when hubby or the kids have a stuffy nose and it clears the air from the smell of food and clears stuffy noses as well.  Better than candles or air sprays which contain harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use the air purifying blend in my diffuser at least once a month. The smell is very minty so I would make sure you like the smell of mint before buying.

A little goes a long way and sometimes I mix it with a citrus oil to balance out the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great, helped my house not smell like wet dog when my pets had come in from outside. Will definitely be using again.</li>
            <li> Makes my home smell freshly wonderful in my diffuser.  Have also used a couple of drops in my sea salt baths for a revitalizing aromatherapy bath.</li>
            <li> I like to diffuse this blend while I work. I find it uplifts and centers me. I love this blend of essential oils!</li>

            <li> I love the smell of Now&#x27;s Clear The Air Purifying essential oils blend.  It&#x27;sclean and refreshing and truly &amp;#34;cleans the air&amp;#34;.  I recently made homemade air fresheners for the garage.  I simply infused baking soda with drops of Clear the Air and Sweet Orange essential oils.  One afternoon when we came home and opened the garage, my husband said, your air fresheners smell really good :)  I recently tried another brands purifying blend and absolutely did not like it.  I&#x27;m switching back to Now&#x27;s Clear The Air Purifying blend.  It&#x27;s good stuff. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Smells great. Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Nice mint smell. Not too much eucalyptus, which can quickly overpower. It&#x27;s like peppermint, with a touch of eucalyptus. I put it in my daughter&#x27;s humidifier at night when she had a cold. It cleared her nose significantly, and she slept better.</li>
            <li> Not as clean smelling as I expected.</li>
