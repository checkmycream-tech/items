            <li>They are a pretty purple color and quickly dissolve in a warm bath.</li>
            <li>Ginger root is fairly strong, so the bath soak does not smell like lemon or orange, it just hit a bit of citrus along the stronger sweet ginger scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Bath Soak is perfect for those wanting a little luxury on a budget!</li>
            <li>Great for coming home from a long day of work and pouring in the bath.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than the higher priced bath soaks.</li>
            <li>love this product&#x27;s refreshing minty scent and the soft way it leaves my skin feeling</li>
            <li>(I am including a full list of ingredients I copied from the jar</li>
            <li>The teal color bath soak (Sooth) combined eucalyptus and mint scents with a sweet undertone.  </li>
            <li>It creates the right amount of foamy bubbles that are lightly scented.  </li>
            <li>mo2SMYE27QE8S11]]Aqua Spa Bath soak combines granules of bath salt with bold sweet scents and colors.</li>
            <li>My skin felt amazing, relaxed and within just a few minutes my skin felt amazing</li>
            <li>I love the minty mix with eucalyptus, it is such a refreshing smell and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and not too overpowering, and there is a decent amount of foam without being too much.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried that the scent would be overpowering, but no no no!</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic at first, but after using this, I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li>is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit, I am not usually crazy about bath soak products.</li>
            <li>It left my skin smooth, clean and LIGHYLY scented!</li>
            <li>When I got out of the tub, there was a light, lingering scent on my skin, and my skin felt super soft.</li>

            <li>The smell was wonderful and brought about a sort of energy boost to this tired mama!  </li>

            <li>It leaves my skin soft, silky, and smooth.</li>
            <li>Buying products where a scent is an important part of the experience without being able to smell them first hand is a little tricky, so here is my take on how scent and foaming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love me a hot bath after a long day.</li>
            <li>So when I tried this Aqua Spa soak, I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations at all.</li>
            <li>Very affordable as well.</li>
            <li>bubble soak generates light foam (see video), the scent is bold in the jar but when mixed with water is not overpowering, the colors initially look like stripes in the foam and then blend with a bit of agitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First thing you&#x27;ll notice after pouring this in, is the bathroom fills up with a soft, relaxing scent.</li>
            <li>I like the vibrant colors the jars bring my bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the vibrant colors the jars bring my bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it starts out as an epsom salt looking treatment, but then it bubbles up just enough to give you bubbles, but not enough to fill the bathtub.</li>
            <li>This product is of high quality and to me</li>
            <li>As someone with very sensitive skin, I was hesitant to put a new and unfamiliar (to my skin) product on my body.  </li>
            <li>However, after trying these items, I can tell you that I really enjoy using them - especially after a long day of being &amp;#34;Mom&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount to create a spa-like experience in my own tub.  </li>
            <li>When getting out I notice the slight scent on my skin and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>so it is  my least favorite of the bath</li>
            <li>When I pour a capful into my bath, it immediately begins to bubble and the salt dissolves completely.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft, the water even feels silky.</li>
            <li>I was actually pleasantly surprised....</li>
            <li>Then, you&#x27;ll see the soft foamy bubbles that appear.</li>
            <li>Mint and eucalyptus with a Marine Youth Complex leaves my senses feeling refreshed and my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little bit - enough to have a fun bath without all the bubbles crackling in your ears.</li>

            <li> Do you love the relaxing scent of lavender? If so, you will love Aqua Spa Bath Soak salts! They are a pretty purple color and quickly dissolve in a warm bath. They are perfect for relaxing in the tub, and leave your legs and body silky smooth. i love to use them after shaving!</li>
            <li> I loved everything about this bath soak! It smells great and its relaxing. Great for coming home from a long day of work and pouring in the bath.</li>
            <li> The bath soak comes in three scents: Lavender &amp; Chamomile, Eucalyptus &amp; Mint, and Citrus &amp; Ginger.  Oh My Gosh!  So relaxing and the scent is amazing. SO RELAXING!!!!</li>

            <li> These Aqua Spa bath salts are wonderful. The lavender scent is long-lasting and luxurious without being overpowering. When I pour a capful into my bath, it immediately begins to bubble and the salt dissolves completely. No grainy texture or irritating pieces between my toes! I would buy it again. Lovely stuff.</li>
            <li> I recently received a jar of Aqua Spa&#x27;s new Eucalyptus &amp; Mint Bath Soak as a gift and it could not have come at a more perfect time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product&#x27;s refreshing minty scent and the soft way it leaves my skin feeling afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is attractive - the product amount is plentiful - and yet it is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great gift item - this is it!</li>
            <li> yay for a product that is made in the USA! I used the Eucalyptus and mint soak. At first I was worried that the scent would be overpowering, but no no no! It is light and clean-and felt like it just opened my senses up! The price is very affordable too and a little goes a long way! It left my skin smooth, clean and LIGHYLY scented! Love love love love it. this would also be a great scent to use during the winter to use when you  are not feeling your best!</li>
            <li> This Bath Soak is perfect for those wanting a little luxury on a budget! Mint and eucalyptus with a Marine Youth Complex leaves my senses feeling refreshed and my skin silky smooth. Can&#x27;t beat that price tag either! I received a product for free in exchange for this review.</li>
            <li> As someone with very sensitive skin, I was hesitant to put a new and unfamiliar (to my skin) product on my body.  However, after trying these items, I can tell you that I really enjoy using them - especially after a long day of being &amp;#34;Mom&amp;#34;.  They not only feel great, they smell great too.  They would make a great gift too!</li>
            <li> I love this!  My water is hard here in Arizona so I need all the help that I can get to add moisture.  This seemed to help my skin in the water here.  The smell was wonderful and brought about a sort of energy boost to this tired mama!  The product definitely matches its name: bringing a little bit of the spa to your bath.</li>
            <li> If I had to pick just one Aqua Spa product, I would pick the Aqua Spa Bath Salt in Eucalyptus +Mint. I love the minty mix with eucalyptus, it is such a refreshing smell and not overpowering. A little also goes a long way, which is great for those on a budget! If you haven&#x27;t tried this, you need to ASAP!</li>
            <li> This bath soak is fabulous. The scent is great! Soaking in the tub, the bath soak makes relax, as well as soften and hydrate your skin. This product is of high quality and to me it&#x27;s better than the higher priced bath soaks.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic at first, but after using this, I&#x27;m a believer! This absolutely soaked my achy muscle pain away! Loved the scent, I tried the one with Eucalyptus, really felt like I was at the spa. It makes your skin so soft, the water even feels silky. Very affordable as well. I would recommend this to my friends and family and I plan to purchase the other 2 scents ASAP!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I am not usually crazy about bath soak products. I have found that many of them leave an odd, chalky residue behind that I just cannot stand. So when I tried this Aqua Spa soak, I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations at all. I was actually pleasantly surprised....The scent is amazing and not too overpowering, and there is a decent amount of foam without being too much. When I got out of the tub, there was a light, lingering scent on my skin, and my skin felt super soft. I would definitely recommend this product, even if you don&#x27;t usually like bath soaks. This is very spa-like in quality, and won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> This bath soak is absolutely wonderful. It smells really  nice and it relaxes me. It softens and hydrates my skin too. Another great thing about this product is the quality, it&#x27;s truly  up there with the higher priced and designer bath soaks.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bath soak, Aqua Spa is a great value &amp; at the end of a long day I love coming home &amp; pouring a cap full into the tub &amp; relaxing. It smells great, not too over powering, it&#x27;s an invigorating scent, and the foam is the right amount. When getting out I notice the slight scent on my skin and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have the Eucalyptus &amp; Mint scent and love it!  It only takes a small amount to create a spa-like experience in my own tub.  It creates the right amount of foamy bubbles that are lightly scented.  It is not overwhelming and very soothing.  It leaves my skin soft, silky, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love me a hot bath after a long day. When the day has been stressful too, I like to use epsom salts because it helps my muscles relax even more. This soak has totally upgraded my bathtime! First thing you&#x27;ll notice after pouring this in, is the bathroom fills up with a soft, relaxing scent. Then, you&#x27;ll see the soft foamy bubbles that appear. It&#x27;s just a little bit - enough to have a fun bath without all the bubbles crackling in your ears. My skin has never felt softer! I&#x27;m a total fan!</li>
            <li> The perfect way to end a busy week... a bath with this will help ease tension and relax! I love it!</li>
            <li> Aqua Spa Sooth Bath Soak with Eucalyptus +Mint with Marine Youth Complex is nothing short of amazing.  The mint and eucalyptus is the perfect combination of smells to turn your bathroom into a spa with an affordable price tag. I love that it starts out as an epsom salt looking treatment, but then it bubbles up just enough to give you bubbles, but not enough to fill the bathtub. My skin felt amazing, relaxed and within just a few minutes my skin felt amazing and I felt more relaxed than I have in years.</li>
