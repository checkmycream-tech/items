            <li>I used it in creating my own foundation</li>
            <li>Using this to make my own not-bad-for-you-sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>That will come in quite handy when making my homemade products.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it to make my own sunscreen</li>
            <li>Use some kind of protection over nose and mouth when mixing in product.</li>
            <li>you are looking to make some of your own sunscreens, soaps, skin ointments, and etc, then this is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I never realized I could buy it and add it to my own lotion to make a quality sunscreen.  </li>

            <li>so i needed to make my own.</li>
            <li>and my thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>This product was great - multiple uses and great price, too!</li>
            <li>To make it easier for me to reapply, I use this in conjunction with a pre-colored powdered sunscreen, bronzer, and setting powder to make my own &amp;#34;correctly colored&amp;#34; sunscreen powder.  </li>
            <li>This product is really nice.</li>
            <li>Used it for making my own sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>If you are making your own sunscreens, deodorants, rash creams including diaper rash creams, I recommend you buy this product.</li>
            <li>However, since I always do a full face make-up (youâ€™re welcome, world)</li>
            <li>Good quality zinc oxide, mixes easily with whatever lotion to make sunscreen.</li>

            <li>am new to making my own sunscreen etc., but this product is a key ingredient of good quality and I am pleased to have purchased</li>
            <li>I can also wear a shade I would consider too dark and lighten it up with the zinc oxide, which is a great thing because Clarins discontinued my favorite shade.&lt;br /&gt; - NYX bronzer Ibiza 02</li>
            <li>This is a review that I have been particularly excited about doing.</li>
            <li>The company has a free ebook on their website full of recipes</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Zinc Oxide Powder, but I had seen it used in many items that I have around my home.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tested it out yet, but  excited to do so</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any issues but have received multiple emails to make sure I am enjoying the product and am satisfied with everything.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>:)  More importantly, I absolutely love the final result.  </li>
            <li>In quantity this product gives you many applications for a nice SPF sunscreen, whether mixed with a powder or lotion.  </li>
            <li>Zinc Oxide is a white powder with wonderful astringent &amp; soothing properties and can also provide 28 times the skinâ€™s natural protections against harmful UVA &amp; UVB</li>
            <li>My skin is usually pretty sensitive but this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I also plan on making my own natural sunscreen with it.</li>
            <li>I can make my own deodorant and rash creams naturally.</li>
            <li>I was afforded the opportunity to review La Lune Natural Zinc Oxide for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li>I just mixed a couple spoonfuls of my zinc oxide powder with some aloe vera gel until it was a good consistency</li>
            <li>love that the La Lune Zinc Oxide powder has not broken out my skin</li>
            <li>It is a good idea &amp; not for internal use as I understand it.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and was as described.  </li>
            <li>but I dab some on with a makeup brush to any super itchy spots.</li>
            <li>but I go through them quickly as I will use 5-10 at a time and those are the rice paper with powder versions.  </li>
            <li>Customer service is exceptional, I will definitely continue to La Lune Naturals.</li>
            <li>I love that I can add this to a organic healthy lotion and boom instant sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The product was well packaged and arrived quickly after I placed my order.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>If I pick up too much zinc oxide this way, I tap my fingers and let some of the powder fall off, which makes it easy to control the ratio of zinc oxide to foundation being used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other top rated brands and none were even close to the effectiveness of the original BurnOut formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You certainly could be adventurous &amp; make the whole thing from scratch with the beeswax , coconut oil , etc...</li>
            <li>and I used too much; even though I am a fair person, I had to use heaps of cacao powder to counter-balance the white.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I got to try this product complimentary</li>

            <li>The sunblock recipe it comes with is so easy and works better than any other of the expencive natural alternatives out there!</li>
            <li>Also really like how fast the shipping was!</li>
            <li>Which is nice because I go through an average of 5 blotting papers a day to cut the shine in my t-zone as it is.  </li>

            <li>mixes easily with liquids(I mixed with shampoo- for anti-dandruff use); put in slippers as deodorant:</li>
            <li>The container is large.</li>
            <li>I was interested in it, but quite honestly didn&#x27;t know enough about any of it &amp; was uncertain about the expense involved in even trying such a thing.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality item,  at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I initially bought it for homemade sun screen, but the seller have me a free ebook on all sorts of ways to use it, including a few different sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff to make a home made sunscreen, it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a teacher, so I don&#x27;t think I really put the concoction to the test.</li>
            <li>so much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>but I can say that this is an absolute lifesaver for me.</li>
            <li>Just thinking that whatever I put on my skin goes into my blood stream really grosses me out.</li>
            <li>thanks so much for making this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the shipping was amazingly fast.  </li>
            <li>the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the recipes that came with made my first batch of sunscreen to be made even faster than I had expected.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for, my daughter has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I had heard amazing things about people who were into a lot of the all natural &amp; homeopathic type lifestyles making a lot of their own health products that had none of the crazy additives in them.</li>
            <li>For now though I am content with my new found sunscreen making agent!</li>
            <li>Commercial sunscreens have so many chemicals, this may make a big difference for him.</li>
            <li>, it kept sinking to the bottom, but I think that may be the nature of the non-nano sized particle and not exclusive to this particular brand.</li>
            <li>but I had too on this particular product.</li>
            <li>One highly recommended DIY product is sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>As described, high quality</li>
            <li>I would highly reccommend this product ...</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend trying this out if you have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>but I highly recommend trying this out if you have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is intense.</li>
            <li>I really like the way my skin was so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It really calms the skin and helps to clear up my dermatitis.</li>
            <li>So far I have made homemade sunscreen and  the whole family loves it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also free of some of those crazy things if you use a good natural lotion to begin with.  </li>
            <li>have so far made a very simple at home sunscreen by simply mixing this with my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and it will definitely last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know they will have fun getting this and trying all different ways it can be used.</li>
            <li>I did end up with some powder in the bottom of the jar and remelted everything to try to solve that issue but it seems this is normal.</li>
            <li>Then use a separate amount of foundation with a different amount of zinc oxide - more for oily T zone - or less/none for a dry spot.  </li>
            <li>Anyone with the right recipe and ingredients can make personal care products that they use everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trying out new things and seeing what I can create.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People with sensitive skin love homemade skin and beauty products because it keeps harsh chemicals away.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s almost completely cleared away after just a couple of uses!  </li>
            <li>I have gotten really into making my own beauty and cleaning products and this has changed the whole game for me!</li>
            <li>Anything to encourage people to use non-toxic, natural products on their bodies!  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive in general and particularly to the sun.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this because I wanted to make my own natural sunscreen because I realized how many nasty chemicals and ingredients were in my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; store-bought sunscreen.</li>
            <li>but really you would spend a fortune &amp; you could just as easily buy a nice lotion base already done.</li>
            <li>The powder itn&#x27;t so dusty that the particles fly everywhere if your careful with it.  </li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I also made some cream for my 6 month old&#x27;s eczema</li>
            <li>My plan is to make sunscreen for my son whose skin is ridiculously sensitive.</li>
            <li>It comes with a green scoop and a coupon and free recipes.  </li>
            <li>It also acts as a natural spf to protect against sun damage.</li>
            <li>Used to make all natural sunscreen</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s not just for fancy DIYers on Pinterest or natural product lovers.</li>
            <li>My son has developed an allergy to sunscreen</li>
            <li>I find it to be a bonus to know that my 3 year old is coated in an antiviral substance.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this product to make natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but it has worked well so far.</li>
            <li>recipes with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Young skin.</li>
            <li>and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>no more beeswax :) left my skin soo  soft and helped my daughters eczema...</li>
            <li>It is okay if there are small amounts of white zinc oxide still showing because it will blend when I apply the foundation.  </li>
            <li>Ever Matte Shine Control Mineral Powder Compact 01 transparent light (gives me a slightly airbrushed but not flat finish)&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I avoid that side like the pink plague ;)</li>
            <li>I live in Southern California by the beach</li>
            <li>Planning on making deodorant next, the powder was not clumped, but a very soft evenly textured substance.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, although it can get a little messy.</li>
            <li>I could not be happier because my skin was starting to get me down, I had tried many other topicals and vitamins to heal my acne that weren&#x27;t working</li>
            <li>I can sleep in my makeup after a full day and that is the only time my face starts to look a little dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other applications are listed right on the container, with measure hints for different levels of SPF.  </li>
            <li>I needed to reapply obviously but was surprised at how nourishing it is to the skin to have homemade sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so I just mixed some of this zinc with organic virgin coconut oil (which naturally has an SPF of around 5) and ran out the door.  </li>
            <li>so sometimes I use barely any zinc oxide</li>
            <li>It was soft and powdery in the container which is why it mixed together so well with the oils.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it comes in a jar with a scoop, which makes it much easier to measure than the other brands I saw on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but it will also last a while.  </li>

            <li> am new to making my own sunscreen etc., but this product is a key ingredient of good quality and I am pleased to have purchased</li>
            <li> I can also wear a shade I would consider too dark and lighten it up with the zinc oxide, which is a great thing because Clarins discontinued my favorite shade.&lt;br /&gt; - NYX bronzer Ibiza 02</li>
            <li> This is a review that I have been particularly excited about doing.</li>
            <li> The company has a free ebook on their website full of recipes</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Zinc Oxide Powder, but I had seen it used in many items that I have around my home.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tested it out yet, but  excited to do so</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues but have received multiple emails to make sure I am enjoying the product and am satisfied with everything.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> :)  More importantly, I absolutely love the final result.  </li>
            <li> In quantity this product gives you many applications for a nice SPF sunscreen, whether mixed with a powder or lotion.  </li>
            <li> Zinc Oxide is a white powder with wonderful astringent &amp; soothing properties and can also provide 28 times the skinâ€™s natural protections against harmful UVA &amp; UVB</li>
            <li> My skin is usually pretty sensitive but this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I also plan on making my own natural sunscreen with it.</li>
            <li> I can make my own deodorant and rash creams naturally.</li>
            <li> I was afforded the opportunity to review La Lune Natural Zinc Oxide for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> I just mixed a couple spoonfuls of my zinc oxide powder with some aloe vera gel until it was a good consistency</li>
            <li> love that the La Lune Zinc Oxide powder has not broken out my skin</li>
            <li> It is a good idea &amp; not for internal use as I understand it.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was as described.  </li>
            <li> but I dab some on with a makeup brush to any super itchy spots.</li>
            <li> but I go through them quickly as I will use 5-10 at a time and those are the rice paper with powder versions.  </li>
            <li> Customer service is exceptional, I will definitely continue to La Lune Naturals.</li>
            <li> I love that I can add this to a organic healthy lotion and boom instant sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The product was well packaged and arrived quickly after I placed my order.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> If I pick up too much zinc oxide this way, I tap my fingers and let some of the powder fall off, which makes it easy to control the ratio of zinc oxide to foundation being used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other top rated brands and none were even close to the effectiveness of the original BurnOut formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You certainly could be adventurous &amp; make the whole thing from scratch with the beeswax , coconut oil , etc...</li>
            <li> and I used too much; even though I am a fair person, I had to use heaps of cacao powder to counter-balance the white.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product complimentary</li>
            <li> Did you know that you can save potentially hundreds of dollars per year making your own toiletry products?</li>
            <li> The ones I&#x27;ve tried so far are fantastic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like most sunscreen.</li>
            <li> La Lune Naturals Zinc Oxide Powder is a good product for anyone wanting to make their own sunscreen, deodorant or other creations for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The amount of powder in the container is sufficient for several applications</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see why anyone would chose anything other than this awesome zinc mixed with coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> Got my product super fast and it was just as described!</li>
            <li> Revived this just before a camping trip and made some sunscreen right away to take along.</li>
            <li> I plan to make a sunscreen with this powder soon, but right now I&#x27;ve been using it to treat my acne.</li>

            <li> thanks so much for making this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the shipping was amazingly fast.  </li>
            <li> the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the recipes that came with made my first batch of sunscreen to be made even faster than I had expected.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for, my daughter has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I had heard amazing things about people who were into a lot of the all natural &amp; homeopathic type lifestyles making a lot of their own health products that had none of the crazy additives in them.</li>
            <li> For now though I am content with my new found sunscreen making agent!</li>
            <li> Commercial sunscreens have so many chemicals, this may make a big difference for him.</li>
            <li> , it kept sinking to the bottom, but I think that may be the nature of the non-nano sized particle and not exclusive to this particular brand.</li>
            <li> but I had too on this particular product.</li>
            <li> One highly recommended DIY product is sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> As described, high quality</li>
            <li> I would highly reccommend this product ...</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend trying this out if you have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> but I highly recommend trying this out if you have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is intense.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin was so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It really calms the skin and helps to clear up my dermatitis.</li>
            <li> So far I have made homemade sunscreen and  the whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also free of some of those crazy things if you use a good natural lotion to begin with.  </li>
            <li> have so far made a very simple at home sunscreen by simply mixing this with my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and it will definitely last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know they will have fun getting this and trying all different ways it can be used.</li>
            <li> I did end up with some powder in the bottom of the jar and remelted everything to try to solve that issue but it seems this is normal.</li>
            <li> Then use a separate amount of foundation with a different amount of zinc oxide - more for oily T zone - or less/none for a dry spot.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with the right recipe and ingredients can make personal care products that they use everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trying out new things and seeing what I can create.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People with sensitive skin love homemade skin and beauty products because it keeps harsh chemicals away.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost completely cleared away after just a couple of uses!  </li>
            <li> I have gotten really into making my own beauty and cleaning products and this has changed the whole game for me!</li>
            <li> Anything to encourage people to use non-toxic, natural products on their bodies!  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive in general and particularly to the sun.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I wanted to make my own natural sunscreen because I realized how many nasty chemicals and ingredients were in my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; store-bought sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but really you would spend a fortune &amp; you could just as easily buy a nice lotion base already done.</li>
            <li> The powder itn&#x27;t so dusty that the particles fly everywhere if your careful with it.  </li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I also made some cream for my 6 month old&#x27;s eczema</li>
            <li> My plan is to make sunscreen for my son whose skin is ridiculously sensitive.</li>
            <li> It comes with a green scoop and a coupon and free recipes.  </li>
            <li> It also acts as a natural spf to protect against sun damage.</li>
            <li> Used to make all natural sunscreen</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s not just for fancy DIYers on Pinterest or natural product lovers.</li>
            <li> My son has developed an allergy to sunscreen</li>
            <li> I find it to be a bonus to know that my 3 year old is coated in an antiviral substance.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this product to make natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but it has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> recipes with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Young skin.</li>
            <li> and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> no more beeswax :) left my skin soo  soft and helped my daughters eczema...</li>
            <li> It is okay if there are small amounts of white zinc oxide still showing because it will blend when I apply the foundation.  </li>
            <li> Ever Matte Shine Control Mineral Powder Compact 01 transparent light (gives me a slightly airbrushed but not flat finish)&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I avoid that side like the pink plague ;)</li>
            <li> I live in Southern California by the beach</li>
            <li> Planning on making deodorant next, the powder was not clumped, but a very soft evenly textured substance.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, although it can get a little messy.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier because my skin was starting to get me down, I had tried many other topicals and vitamins to heal my acne that weren&#x27;t working</li>
            <li> I can sleep in my makeup after a full day and that is the only time my face starts to look a little dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other applications are listed right on the container, with measure hints for different levels of SPF.  </li>
            <li> I needed to reapply obviously but was surprised at how nourishing it is to the skin to have homemade sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so I just mixed some of this zinc with organic virgin coconut oil (which naturally has an SPF of around 5) and ran out the door.  </li>
            <li> so sometimes I use barely any zinc oxide</li>
            <li> It was soft and powdery in the container which is why it mixed together so well with the oils.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it comes in a jar with a scoop, which makes it much easier to measure than the other brands I saw on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but it will also last a while.  </li>
            <li> If I get too much, I look too pale.  </li>
            <li> It has REALLY helped a lot and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Apply foundation with as little or as much zinc oxide as works for your skin, avoiding the oily or dry area.  </li>
            <li> but I have used a non chemical block in the past &amp; much preferred it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you are supposed to use it straight out of the tub</li>
            <li> This is product will last a long time.</li>
            <li> But I am using as a powder &amp; gently applying with dry round makeup remover pads to keep dry.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;a long way.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting strange chemicals and things on my children&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> (technically it is a combo with a pink too</li>
            <li> The chemical spray sunscreens are so unhealthy, they get absorbed into the bloodstream, we&#x27;re inhaling it and our kids our ingesting it.</li>
            <li> WAAAAYY bigger than I expected also!</li>
            <li> , I was dry all day.</li>
            <li> oily in the T-zone or have a dry spot?  </li>
            <li> I tend to get a dry spot just under my nose from blowing it all winter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used the loose powder along with a makeup brush to cover some sun spots on my face...</li>
            <li> It was sealed but still a bit of powder on outside of container so created quite a mess when opening.</li>
            <li> (I push the foundation into my hairline a little with my fingers then apply pressure to my hair using the heels of my hands to do the last bit of &#x27;blend&#x27;, if that makes any sense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I get too little, my face is oily about 4 hours later.  </li>
            <li> The only time my skin was not oily, I was 6 months into a round of Accutane.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in wearing sunscreen on your face daily.</li>
            <li> Regarding sun-sensitive, I&#x27;m on the pale but pinkish red side and</li>
            <li> There were other projects that I may one day try like deodorant &amp; burn cream.</li>
            <li> ingredient that is extremely versatile is La Lune Zinc Oxide Powder.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and the zinc in this</li>
            <li> The problem:  extremely oily and sun-sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> - I use my other fingers to blend the foundation and zinc oxide together.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would try this out since I like their other products</li>
            <li> I use it for making sunscreen but since LaLune provides other suggestions I&#x27;m looking forward to expanding use.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this to make sunscreen as I am allergic to every other sunscreen I have tried.  </li>
            <li> They also provide a link for other skincare recipes.</li>
            <li> This is a powder I am supposed to be very careful not to inhale it .</li>
            <li> Youâ€™d be surprised at how many awful chemicals are in even name brand sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Mixed up thick to use on bed sores</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t mean it will work on the next person</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t mean it will work on the next person</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t subject it to non-organic substances like under-arm deodorant.</li>
            <li> Does give  a whitish look to the skin but that is typical of zinc oxcide products</li>
            <li> I use a small container for this purpose so that the zinc oxide doesn&#x27;t collect accidental extras such as a small amount of foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a</li>
            <li> I did purchase it to make sunblock but a little nervous to try it.</li>
            <li> Product seems to work very well, just remember not to inhale this stuff as it can be dangerous if inhaled when it is still in a powder form.</li>
            <li> and I hate the idea of rubbing chemically filled sunscreen on my skin.</li>
            <li> You do get a very slight chalky look after the application.</li>
            <li> By oily skin, I mean like Crisco shiny about half an hour after a shower.  </li>
            <li> but it looks flat on my skin and looked bad enough for me to throw away the rest of the sample).  </li>
            <li> I used this to make sunscreen and plan to add a small amount to my lip balm.</li>
            <li> Had I known the healing powers of zinc oxide powder in the past I&#x27;d would have used it sooner.</li>
            <li> I mix ingredients in a small plastic container that comes with a lid</li>
            <li> /&gt; - Apply foundation as usual.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I should be using this product the way I am....</li>
            <li> My old sunscreen was breaking me out bad -</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> This has caused a dramatic improvement in my skin in just a week.</li>
            <li> a  Difficult to mix into solution</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.  </li>

            <li> Wow, this stuff is intense. And it will do a million things! I used it in creating my own foundation and I used too much; even though I am a fair person, I had to use heaps of cacao powder to counter-balance the white. I now have an effective sun-guard in my face makeup! I plan to make deodorant for my underarms next. I don&#x27;t mind absorbing this stuff into my system, because it&#x27;s zinc, after all! Needed in the body. Do remember that whatever you put on your skin your body &amp;#34;eats&amp;#34;. So if you are putting poisons on your skin, you are &amp;#34;eating&amp;#34; poisons! The skin is your largest breathing organ. Don&#x27;t subject it to non-organic substances like under-arm deodorant. Buy this, and there&#x27;s a recipe that comes in an email for lots of things. You&#x27;ll love it and your skin and your liver will love it, too!</li>
            <li> I bought this brand specifically for the non-nano quality. I just recently tested its effectiveness in the Floridian sun on the beach with my homemade sun screen and it worked great! I needed to reapply obviously but was surprised at how nourishing it is to the skin to have homemade sunscreen. I also really liked the r-recipes that came with it and offered more ideas of what I can do with it.</li>
            <li> We bought this to help with heat rash this last summer. Worked great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for making natural sunscreen. A little goes a&lt;br /&gt;a long way. This is product will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, and great company. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Using this to make my own not-bad-for-you-sunscreen.  Thank you for an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Great service and product</li>
            <li> I use this for everything like sunscreen, skin issue ointment. Lasts for years!</li>
            <li> This is a review that I have been particularly excited about doing. I had heard amazing things about people who were into a lot of the all natural &amp; homeopathic type lifestyles making a lot of their own health products that had none of the crazy additives in them. I was interested in it, but quite honestly didn&#x27;t know enough about any of it &amp; was uncertain about the expense involved in even trying such a thing. When the opportunity arose to be given a jar of&lt;br /&gt;La Lune Naturals Zinc Oxide Powder complimentary &amp; all I had to do was provide a honest, unbiased review I was beyond thrilled! What&#x27;s more exciting is that a free ebook with 10 recipes for zinc oxide powder was included!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I decided that I would make some sunscreen. The book had 2 recipes, one that was for a aloe vera version &amp; another that was for a basic DIY one. The Basic DIY one isn&#x27;t fully committing to making your own really but it is a great option if you have a good lotion you already use that is perfect on your skin &amp; it&#x27;s uber simple! Here goes... 2 oz zinc oxide powder &amp; 8 oz lotion. That&#x27;s it.  It says mix in a bowl you will not use for food &amp; this is higher than 20 SPF. Use 1.2 -1.5 ox for Spf of 12-19. It&#x27;s not an exact science, no but it&#x27;s also free of some of those crazy things if you use a good natural lotion to begin with.  You certainly could be adventurous &amp; make the whole thing from scratch with the beeswax , coconut oil , etc... but really you would spend a fortune &amp; you could just as easily buy a nice lotion base already done. You also have the added bonus of the scent being what you bought the lotion to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s still too much winter to tell how effective my concoction is but I have used a non chemical block in the past &amp; much preferred it. You do get a very slight chalky look after the application. I guess you could say you look a bit ashy. It&#x27;s well worth it to me. I was very pleased with my finished product &amp; the ease of making it. I would highlyrecommend.  There were other projects that I may one day try like deodorant &amp; burn cream. For now though I am content with my new found sunscreen making agent!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality zinc oxide!  Shipping time was phenomenal and recipes were easy and effective.  I used this to make sunscreen and plan to add a small amount to my lip balm.</li>
            <li> So glad this summer I will safely be protecting myself and my son from the sun. The sunblock recipe it comes with is so easy and works better than any other of the expencive natural alternatives out there!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price too .. very pleased with my purchase , and happy with the results of my&lt;br /&gt;first batch of diaper ointment .. If you need Zink Oxide , this is the place to buy it !</li>
            <li> This Zinc Oxide powder was exactly what I was looking for.  I&#x27;m making a sunscreen for the summer and I love that this powder is non-nano and non-coated.  It shipped fast and I was pleasantly surprised to also receive a free recipe book from La Lune Naturals!  That will come in quite handy when making my homemade products.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more of your great products in the future.</li>
            <li> Good product. I purchased it to make my own sunscreen and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> It was perfect.  Came quickly and was as described.  Great seller.</li>
            <li> I got this zinc oxide to use to make skincare products, specifically sunscreen and diaper rash creme.  The company has a free ebook on their website full of recipes so I used that to make a diaper rash cream that&#x27;s safe for our cloth diapers.  It was super easy and works great, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about damaging our diapers. I also made some cream for my 6 month old&#x27;s eczema and it&#x27;s almost completely cleared away after just a couple of uses!  I also put a bit of it in chapstick tubes to keep in her diaper bag for use when we are away from home (see photos).  I&#x27;m really happy to have a product that works well and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting strange chemicals and things on my children&#x27;s skin.  I will definitely be using it to make sunscreen once the weather gets warmer!</li>
            <li> Good product. Arrived on time. I mix it with my face cream and it seems to help heal my acne/rosacea. Does give  a whitish look to the skin but that is typical of zinc oxcide products</li>
            <li> I got to try this product complimentary and I LOVE IT! I have gotten really into making my own beauty and cleaning products and this has changed the whole game for me!</li>
            <li> Smooth, easy to use and great recipes! I made diaper balm and sunscreen. Amazingly creamy and effective. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well. I used this stuff to make a home made sunscreen, it worked very well. At the end of the day after being out in the sun and using my home made sunscreen containing this product, my skin felt great, I didn&#x27;t burn. Product seems to work very well, just remember not to inhale this stuff as it can be dangerous if inhaled when it is still in a powder form. Use some kind of protection over nose and mouth when mixing in product.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product at a great discount in order to leave an honest review. I recieved it very quickly and have used it once. I really like the way my skin was so soft and hydrated. I also plan on making my own natural sunscreen with it. There are so many things you can do with this product!</li>
            <li> Product of very good quality.</li>
            <li> I really like making my own at home versions of products. This was my first time using Zinc Oxide Powder, but I had seen it used in many items that I have around my home. The problem with those mass bought items, I don&#x27;t exactly know what is in them. The day this arrived at my door, I began looking up recipes that used zinc oxide powder. I found some to make sunscreens, diaper cream, soaps, and skin ointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have so far made a very simple at home sunscreen by simply mixing this with my favorite moisturizer. I have also made my own skin rash ointment to help me battle some problem areas that I have with dry, flaky, irritated skin. There are many more diy recipes for zinc oxide powder that I am going to try! It is very easy to use, although it can get a little messy. I keep it stored in the container, inside a zip bag. I do also recommend using something to cover your mouth and nose when using this, just so you don&#x27;t inhale the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to make some of your own sunscreens, soaps, skin ointments, and etc, then this is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for a lot of reasons.  I always knew zinc oxide was in sunscreen but I never realized I could buy it and add it to my own lotion to make a quality sunscreen.  I also have added this to sunscreens I already had, that I would like to have a higher level of SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to get zinc oxide powder, I would definitely recommend getting non-nano.  Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and it will definitely last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;____________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: LaLuneNaturals&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 7 days after order date</li>
            <li> This works great for many body Care recipes. I made homemade deodorant and it works great! Fast shipping and comes with $2 coupon!</li>
            <li> I have actually been using this as a drying powder for my under arms. I read something about using zinc oxide for a deodorant with a drop of lavender essential oil for fragrance and it worked well, I was dry all day. I&#x27;m a teacher, so I don&#x27;t think I really put the concoction to the test. My plan is to make sunscreen for my son whose skin is ridiculously sensitive. Commercial sunscreens have so many chemicals, this may make a big difference for him. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT! EASY TO USE, I MADE SOME HOMEMADE SUNBLOCK WITHOUT ALL THE CHEMICALS!</li>
            <li> La Lune zinc oxide powder is exactly what I was looking for.  It is a very fine powder, so it mixes well.  I tested it as a sunscreen by mixing it with coconut oil, a 25% zinc oxide powder mixture, &amp; it has worked great so far.  The price is right for the quality &amp; amount, &amp; I love that it comes with a scoop &amp; recipes.</li>
            <li> This is the most silky powder I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is great for baby&#x27;s butt and the other recipes are wonderful also.  The lip balm is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  thank you</li>
            <li> This is my first Zinc oxide powder ever to make homemade sunscreen for my family and I love it.  The powder itn&#x27;t so dusty that the particles fly everywhere if your careful with it.  It comes with a green scoop and a coupon and free recipes.  It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but it will also last a while.  Great product, cute jar and the customer service seems genuine and show they really care about their product.</li>
            <li> I made my first batch of zinc rash cream today. I&#x27;m very happy about the free recipe ebook. It was a helpful guide for making the cream. The zinc is a very nice product with a lot of uses. Can&#x27;t wait to try making the deodorant. Good price too!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I read that zinc oxide was good for rosacea.  I think it is starting to help.  I like that they include a recipe if for sunscreen if you wanted to make your own.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own itch relief cream for my perioral dermatitis. It has REALLY helped a lot and a little goes a long way. I mixed it in my coconut oil as well in my homemade lotion (coconut oil, Jasons vitamin e oil, bees wax). I mixed about 2 tablespoons into my homemade deodorant (baking soda, cornstarch)  to help sooth my itchy pits. I&#x27;m not sure if you are supposed to use it straight out of the tub but I dab some on with a makeup brush to any super itchy spots. It really calms the skin and helps to clear up my dermatitis. I plan on using it as an anti chaffing powder during the summer on my chesticales and thighs. Had I known the healing powers of zinc oxide powder in the past I&#x27;d would have used it sooner. Anyone with perioral dermatitis or Rosacea  should consider using this mixed into their favorite lotions or creams. It also acts as a natural spf to protect against sun damage.</li>
            <li> Used to make all natural sunscreen yesterday/ works well.</li>
            <li> This powder worked great for my sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Blends really well with lotion (especially with hand blender) to make your own Sunscreen. Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without it</li>

            <li> Great product, feels good on your skin, does bother my sensitive skin.  Will not cake, and gives great coverage when mixed with another medium.  In quantity this product gives you many applications for a nice SPF sunscreen, whether mixed with a powder or lotion.  Other applications are listed right on the container, with measure hints for different levels of SPF.  This company follows up your order immediately and are quite appreciative of your business, these are companies I definately enjoy spending my money with.</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t tested it out yet, but  excited to do so</li>
            <li> Seems like great product.  Once ordered you will receive recipe e-books.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues but have received multiple emails to make sure I am enjoying the product and am satisfied with everything.  Great customer service!</li>
            <li> Great product, I initially bought it for homemade sun screen, but the seller have me a free ebook on all sorts of ways to use it, including a few different sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love their non nano zinc oxide! Fast shipping &amp; sturdy packaging</li>
            <li> It was sealed but still a bit of powder on outside of container so created quite a mess when opening.</li>
            <li> very impressed...i received a sample free of testing i was pretty happy witht the results no more beeswax :) left my skin soo  soft and helped my daughters eczema...i deff recommend great product for great price</li>
            <li> Good quality zinc oxide, mixes easily with whatever lotion to make sunscreen. It blends well with the skin, doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or a ghostly appearance. The only issue I had was how the inside seal wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; but slid off while I was opening the lid. Glad the jar was wrapped in a layer of shrink plastic!</li>
            <li> Nice sized tub, can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and pricing was very good. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Made my own sunscreen with this, amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Fast ship!  Can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product. The ebook with recipes on how to use it was easy to download in a pdf format. I&#x27;ve used it in some of my homemade cosmetics and it works great!</li>
            <li> Nice size container and love that there are free recipes on how to use the product:)</li>
            <li> I made sunscreen with this zinc and it turned out great! Smooth mixing. Its not too white when I apply to skin. Make sure you use a mask when mixing.</li>
            <li> This works great for diy sunscreen! Quality product and great customer service</li>
            <li> Used in deodorant. Great quality</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product! Great bang for your buck. My son has developed an allergy to sunscreen so i needed to make my own. So happy it wasnt the zinc he was allergic  to.this helps our homemade sunscreen so much!</li>
            <li> I made my own non toxic sunscreen, so much better than the cancer causing stuff the stores sell.</li>
            <li> Product is awesome and so is the company.  Thank you guys so much!</li>
            <li> As a teenager of the 80&#x27;s when I think of Zinc I immediately think of that colored Zinc product called Zinka.  Well, this is not that!  This Zinc Oxide Powder by La Lune Naturals is a very fine and french pressed Zinc Oxide powder that can be used for all sorts of DIY beauty products from sunscreen, homemade deodorant, masks and even acne cream.  Zinc Oxide is a white powder with wonderful astringent &amp; soothing properties and can also provide 28 times the skinâ€™s natural protections against harmful UVA &amp; UVB rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite way to use the Zinc Oxide Powder by La Lune Naturals is for an overnight acne spot treatment...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overnight Acne Spot Treatment:&lt;br /&gt;1 Tbsp. La Lune Naturals Zinc Oxide Powder&lt;br /&gt;1 Tbsp, Distilled Water&lt;br /&gt; 1/2 tsp. Tea Tree Oil&lt;br /&gt;Combine all ingredients and mix well.  I mix ingredients in a small plastic container that comes with a lid so I can save any leftover treatment to use at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product at a discount or complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
            <li> La Lune Naturals Zinc Oxide Powder is a good product for anyone wanting to make their own sunscreen, deodorant or other creations for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The amount of powder in the container is sufficient for several applications and I appreciate that free (e-book) recipes for making your own products are supplied when you purchase a container of Zinc Oxide Powder.&lt;br /&gt;I am new to making my own sunscreen etc., but this product is a key ingredient of good quality and I am pleased to have purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;The company, La Lune Naturals is very helpful and encourages questions to be asked about this product and they respond quickly with great advice.</li>
            <li> Love it! I can make my own deodorant and rash creams naturally. So many different recipe&#x27;s you can download them off of La Lunes Naturals website. Great company! I was afforded the opportunity to review La Lune Natural Zinc Oxide for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> I bought this for making sunscreen.  The package arrived as we were headed out to the pool for my son&#x27;s swim lessons.  I didn&#x27;t have time to make the recipe I had in mind so I just mixed some of this zinc with organic virgin coconut oil (which naturally has an SPF of around 5) and ran out the door.  Amazing results.  Even my very fair skinned husband who burns easily was thoroughly impressed.  He thought I should make tubs of it for friends and familyâ€¦and I&#x27;m going to do that.  Anything to encourage people to use non-toxic, natural products on their bodies!  The chemical spray sunscreens are so unhealthy, they get absorbed into the bloodstream, we&#x27;re inhaling it and our kids our ingesting it. I can&#x27;t see why anyone would chose anything other than this awesome zinc mixed with coconut oil.  The consistency was perfect and it smelled great too!  Also, it&#x27;s cheap!  Get it and make your own sunscreen!  It takes 2 minutes!  Also, on a side note, coconut oil is antiviral.  I find it to be a bonus to know that my 3 year old is coated in an antiviral substance.  You just can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and well packaged.  Drawback:  a  Difficult to mix into solution, it kept sinking to the bottom, but I think that may be the nature of the non-nano sized particle and not exclusive to this particular brand.</li>
            <li> Not often do I take time to write reviews but I had too on this particular product. My skin is very sensitive in general and particularly to the sun. Being able to mix and regulate the concentration was so helpful. I also really appreciate the timeliness of receiving the product. I didn&#x27;t know if I would receive it prior to vacation as I had ordered so close to the time I was leaving. Next day service is awesome. Thank you, thank you!!</li>
            <li> used some on my son&#x27;s smelly shoes and now they don&#x27;t smell!!!! yay!!!!!! and excellent for homemade sunscreen!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this only once but it did what I wanted We shall see if it lasts</li>
            <li> This product is great, and I love all the recipes that come in the eBook! The seller is wonderful to work with. Thank you La Lune for another amazing product!</li>
            <li> Revived this just before a camping trip and made some sunscreen right away to take along. My mind was at easy putting this sunscreen on my family and myself. Easy to use and the recipes that came with made my first batch of sunscreen to be made even faster than I had expected.</li>
            <li> This product was great - multiple uses and great price, too!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product to make natural sunscreen. It worked great!!!  No one in our family was sunburned on our vacation at the beach and we had the best tans ever!! Will never buy store sunscreen again!!!!</li>
            <li> Great service. Would order again no question.</li>
            <li> made sunscreen--love it!</li>
            <li> When I received this HUGE container of Zinc Oxide Powder, I was more than excited to try the recipes! The ones I&#x27;ve tried so far are fantastic! The eBook that I got in my email has very easy-to-follow instructions! I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the Seaweed powder that I also ordered! Incredibly fast shipping and great packaging. Great company!</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff! And what a great value!! The tub is really big for the price and quality of product. I originally bought this because I wanted to make my own natural sunscreen because I realized how many nasty chemicals and ingredients were in my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; store-bought sunscreen. My old sunscreen was breaking me out bad - I have sensitive skin. I plan to make a sunscreen with this powder soon, but right now I&#x27;ve been using it to treat my acne. It is amazing at healing my acne and keeping it under control. I just mixed a couple spoonfuls of my zinc oxide powder with some aloe vera gel until it was a good consistency and I have been applying the mixture every night before bed. This has caused a dramatic improvement in my skin in just a week. And it is just getting better. I could not be happier because my skin was starting to get me down, I had tried many other topicals and vitamins to heal my acne that weren&#x27;t working and I had even cleaned up my diet. Who knew that zinc oxide would do the trick? This is a really great product. I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great service!</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen every day under my make-up on all exposed areas, even in the winter.  However, since I always do a full face make-up (youâ€™re welcome, world) I wouldnâ€™t re-apply the sunscreen later in the day.  To make it easier for me to reapply, I use this in conjunction with a pre-colored powdered sunscreen, bronzer, and setting powder to make my own &amp;#34;correctly colored&amp;#34; sunscreen powder.  I have extremely oily skin and the zinc in this does NOT break me out, it also helps to keep my face matte.  Which is nice because I go through an average of 5 blotting papers a day to cut the shine in my t-zone as it is.  This is super affordable and pretty fine on its own and for the extra protection, Iâ€™m super happy I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> WOW!!! SUPER FAST SHIPPING and excellent customer service. My skin is usually pretty sensitive but this product is amazing! WAAAAYY bigger than I expected also! Very impressed with the product and the seller! I will definitely be ordering more!!!!!! Thanks LaLuneNaturals!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and super fast shipping!  Deserves 7 stars!</li>
            <li> Great service...great product. When making toxin-free sunscreen, this is the product to use!</li>
            <li> Great product- used it to make homemade deodorant. I did purchase it to make sunblock but a little nervous to try it.</li>
            <li> I made my own sunscreen and put it to the test, it works! I do have to work on perfecting it though. I didn&#x27;t allow it to set s mong as it needed.</li>
            <li> mixes easily with liquids(I mixed with shampoo- for anti-dandruff use); put in slippers as deodorant: it works well for both.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried all their recipes yet (sunscreen, for skin rashes etc) but it has worked well so far. container and scoop are very helpful&lt;br /&gt;(other companies sell it in bags) Seems like a very good product. I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for, my daughter has very sensitive skin so I&#x27;m always looking for do it yourself recipes with natural ingredients. I can&#x27;t wait to try it out!</li>
            <li> Use a 1/2 teaspoon in each shoe to cover bottom of shoes, dump out excess, and insert your favorite odor control insoles for the freshest, odor free shoes.  I prefer Dr.Scholl&#x27;s Odor-X insoles.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Made homemade sunscreen the day after receiving. Thankful for products you can feel good using.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it shipped fast!!</li>
            <li> As described, high quality</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m always trying to find a product line that I can try.  The best part about this is that it&#x27;s one tub for me to make my own entire product line from!  I have tried making a deodorant, skin rash aide and added some to my foundation for added protection.  After reading the great reviews on using for baby care as well I&#x27;m going to start mixing for my newborn.  Buying one product that myself, my husband and my baby can all use is awesome.  I love that it shipped so quickly too.  I think I will be buying this as stocking stuffers for my sister and sister in laws.  I know they will have fun getting this and trying all different ways it can be used.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service and quality products. On my list as an order from again company. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love the zinc oxide powder!  I have a favorite body lotion that I like but it does not have any sun protection.  I added the zinc powder to the lotion and now I have the product I want.  I&#x27;ve also used the loose powder along with a makeup brush to cover some sun spots on my face... I would highly reccommend this product ... What a great way to add sun protection to your favorite products.</li>
            <li> The problem:  extremely oily and sun-sensitive skin.  By oily skin, I mean like Crisco shiny about half an hour after a shower.  Blotter papers are a help but I go through them quickly as I will use 5-10 at a time and those are the rice paper with powder versions.  The only time my skin was not oily, I was 6 months into a round of Accutane.  Regarding sun-sensitive, I&#x27;m on the pale but pinkish red side and 15 minutes of sun exposure will turn me into a cherry.  To add insult to injury, skin cancer runs in my family so I really need a good sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compounding the problem:  I used BurnOut sunscreen then they changed their formula and it is now both oily and ineffective.  Very frustrating.  I&#x27;ve tried many other top rated brands and none were even close to the effectiveness of the original BurnOut formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution:  Blend zinc oxide into my foundation, which works to absorb the oil and block the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt; - Two pumps of my liquid makeup on my fingers then dip my fingers into the zinc oxide.  If I pick up too much zinc oxide this way, I tap my fingers and let some of the powder fall off, which makes it easy to control the ratio of zinc oxide to foundation being used.  Note:  I use a small container for this purpose so that the zinc oxide doesn&#x27;t collect accidental extras such as a small amount of foundation.&lt;br /&gt; - I use my other fingers to blend the foundation and zinc oxide together.  It is okay if there are small amounts of white zinc oxide still showing because it will blend when I apply the foundation.  Just mix most of it and any clumps.&lt;br /&gt; - Apply foundation as usual.  Take care to blend around your hairline well (I push the foundation into my hairline a little with my fingers then apply pressure to my hair using the heels of my hands to do the last bit of &#x27;blend&#x27;, if that makes any sense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve adjusted the amount of zinc oxide up and down to find the perfect mix for me.  If I get too much, I look too pale.  If I get too little, my face is oily about 4 hours later.  I&#x27;ve also tried applying zinc oxide with my powder brush and that worked okay but I was happier with the final result when I blended it into my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just oily in the T-zone or have a dry spot?  Apply foundation with as little or as much zinc oxide as works for your skin, avoiding the oily or dry area.  Then use a separate amount of foundation with a different amount of zinc oxide - more for oily T zone - or less/none for a dry spot.  I tend to get a dry spot just under my nose from blowing it all winter so sometimes I use barely any zinc oxide there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good to know:  Like makeup, zinc oxide is being applied to your face.  You will need to remove it daily so that it doesn&#x27;t build up.  Makeup remover towels work great but I still exfoliate daily.  You&#x27;ll see proof of the buildup on your fingers after you apply your makeup in the morning so a good handwashing afterward will be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final result:  I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my makeup.  :)  More importantly, I absolutely love the final result.  I can sleep in my makeup after a full day and that is the only time my face starts to look a little dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products I use (and love!):&lt;br /&gt; - Clarins Skin Illusion liquid foundation (note: Clarins also makes Ever Matte liquid foundation but it looks flat on my skin and looked bad enough for me to throw away the rest of the sample).  I can also wear a shade I would consider too dark and lighten it up with the zinc oxide, which is a great thing because Clarins discontinued my favorite shade.&lt;br /&gt; - NYX bronzer Ibiza 02 (technically it is a combo with a pink too but I avoid that side like the pink plague ;)&lt;br /&gt; - Clarins Ever Matte Shine Control Mineral Powder Compact 01 transparent light (gives me a slightly airbrushed but not flat finish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc oxide is supposed to be inert, as in chemically inactive.  However, I am not a chemical engineer by any means but I highly recommend trying this out if you have oily skin.  I don&#x27;t know what kinds of reactions can occur when mixing different makeups with zinc oxide, which is why I mention the products I&#x27;ve used with no drawbacks.  This doesn&#x27;t mean it will work on the next person but I can say that this is an absolute lifesaver for me.y any means but I highly recommend trying this out if you have oily skin.

            <li> Amazing product, I really like using it as a sunscreen! I can&#x27;t wait to try all the recipes, especially the baby powder and diaper rash cream once my baby is born!!!! Also really like how fast the shipping was!</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this out since I like their other products and I&#x27;m definitely a happy customer. Great line of products!!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, mixed very will with a cream lotion for a homemade sunscreen. Planning on making deodorant next, the powder was not clumped, but a very soft evenly textured substance. Customer service is exceptional, I will definitely continue to La Lune Naturals. Thank you for a superior product.</li>
            <li> easy to scoop and store. good smooth quality.</li>
            <li> Good price for quite a bit.  Going to use it in sunscreen.  It&#x27;s a nice fine powder.</li>
            <li> Great to make your own sun screen, I have been experimenting since getting this. Good price for the convenience of a jar and for the amount.</li>
            <li> I have just received the product . Pictures below. This is a powder I am supposed to be very careful not to inhale it .</li>
            <li> This zinc oxide is awesome. I live in Southern California by the beach and I hate the idea of rubbing chemically filled sunscreen on my skin. Just thinking that whatever I put on my skin goes into my blood stream really grosses me out. I love that I can add this to a organic healthy lotion and boom instant sunscreen. I can also add to my foundation for added sun protection. I downloaded the the ebook for free recipes and I am looking foreword to making my own deodorant.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it for making sunscreen but since LaLune provides other suggestions I&#x27;m looking forward to expanding use.  I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I should be using this product the way I am.... But I am using as a powder &amp; gently applying with dry round makeup remover pads to keep dry.</li>
            <li> This product is really nice. I purchased it to make home made deodorant and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to make your own deodorant without aluminum, this product is great and La Lune gets everything to us immediately!</li>
            <li> I love this product....i have told all my friends about it....thanks so much for making this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee</li>
            <li> Great product, nicely packaged.  Used it for making my own sunscreen.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite figured out what the usage in this is all about?  Can anyone enlighten me?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in wearing sunscreen on your face daily. This product makes it easy. It&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like most sunscreen. Young skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to make sunscreen as I am allergic to every other sunscreen I have tried.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the shipping was amazingly fast.  I like the fact that it comes in a jar with a scoop, which makes it much easier to measure than the other brands I saw on Amazon.  And, the fact that you also get recipes makes this a winner.</li>
            <li> Great product, you can make your own cream. Works well.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product!&lt;br /&gt;The texture is so fine and yet non-nano. They also provide a link for other skincare recipes. Made my first homemade sunscreen, it came out beautifully with all healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received this product for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to make the Lavender Rash Cream recipe that came with the free ebook when I ordered this product. The La Lune Zinc Oxide Powder melted very nicely when I added it to the hot oils. I had no issues with it clumping. I did end up with some powder in the bottom of the jar and remelted everything to try to solve that issue but it seems this is normal. Possibly if I had whipped the mixture it would have incorporated better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the La Lune Zinc Oxide powder has not broken out my skin and I do have sensitive skin. It was soft and powdery in the container which is why it mixed together so well with the oils. The product was well packaged and arrived quickly after I placed my order. If you are making your own sunscreens, deodorants, rash creams including diaper rash creams, I recommend you buy this product. It is simply wonderful!</li>
            <li> Fine product and service is great.</li>
            <li> Great product and costumer service! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Very nice product and transaction!</li>
            <li> I loved your super fast shipping service!!!  I&#x27;m still learning how to make sunscreen lotion with your product.  It had gritty feel on my skin. So I&#x27;m not used to it yet. I need to find a perfect recipe to make non oily and greasy sunscreen lotion. Hopefully without any gritty feel.  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality item,  at a very reasonable price.  Super fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect transaction,  I will be purchasing this again.&lt;br /&gt;Thankbyou.</li>
            <li> So excited about this product!!!! There are so many different things that you could make with this product.So far I have made homemade sunscreen and  the whole family loves it. You get a lot of product for a great prices. I used the suggested recipes from the company website. Love love love it:)</li>
            <li> I love this.  Mixed up thick to use on bed sores and it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> I used this product to make diaper cream and also to mix with lotion to make sunscreen. It worked great! Great quality and price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the zinc oxide powder!  The product is great and they even send you a recipe book for different uses of the powder!</li>
            <li> Love it. The container is large. the delivery was fast. The zinc is perfect. I couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li> I love to make my own skin care products. Trying out new things and seeing what I can create. When I was given this zinc oxide to try out and provide my opinion on I was ecstaticâ€‹. I&#x27;ve always wanted to try it, I just hadn&#x27;t gotten around to it yet. So far, I&#x27;ve created a new skin cream using it and coconut oil and made a healthy alternative sunblock creme for my kids and me. Its soft and feels wonderful. Very soothing.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a very nice product for topical sunscreen use &amp; other things. You make your own natural sunscreen by mixing with your natural cremes. It is a good idea &amp; not for internal use as I understand it.</li>
