    <ol>
            <li>This lotion feels and smells incredible!</li>
            <li>Nice lotion!!</li>
            <li>Great profuct will buy again</li>
            <li>Great for after sun too as the Vitamin C repairs skin cells</li>
            <li>and I must say it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many products and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>But before I bought the product I read in a review that the smell should be pleasant.</li>
            <li>For a lotion, I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Very good value, very rich but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion to use along my micro needling and it leaves my face and hands really smooth and has a great smell too.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and it feels so good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells like lemon rind but effective.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything particularly nice about that aspect.</li>
            <li>good product  does not seem to be a full bottle  </li>
            <li>I love this product and my skin</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>So I started pealing the top label and</li>
            <li>The orginal label under the top label states the product is 100% Vegetarian (The top label does not)</li>
            <li>ok did not see any difference</li>
            <li>Okay, just too strong of a scent.</li>
            <li>If you like to smell good, I would highly discourage you this cream!</li>
            <li>I really wanted a good Vitamin C lotion and thought I would give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure maybe the original labels were just mis-prints</li>
            <li>goes on smoothly  </li>
            <li>Let me just say that the smell is very strong and like medicine, so much so that while wearing it, my boyfriend asked &amp;</li>
            <li>After I bought the first one, I immediately bought 2 more to put around the house.  </li>
            <li>On the back labels the original under the top States Organic Ingredients and 100% Vegetarian (The top label does not).  </li>
            <li>This lotion has many organic ingredients, which is great, but the scent is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I do not care for the smell, however, the lotion absorbs quickly, so the scent does not linger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant per se and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>BWC is a new favorite brand of mine.</li>
            <li>The cream went straight in the bin!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be returning for more......</li>
            <li>thanks you!  </li>
            <li>As far as the seller review, the product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I really like using this lotion.  </li>
            <li>would like to know how much C it contains</li>
            <li>I used it a few times and it was ok, nothing I would order again, but</li>
            <li>This cream is thick and absorbs quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>sure enough there was another label, so I was curious to see if it just accidentally was double labeled or if there were any differences.  </li>
            <li>However after a few uses I noticed it looked like it had another label underneath the top label, on both the front and back of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>and it was cheaper to relabel than to get new bottles and start over, but it was enough for me to not use the product any longer since I didn&#x27;t know the reason.  </li>
            <li>There were a few other differences but those are the ones that stood out the most.  </li>

            <li> Maybe I have a delicate sense of smell. But before I bought the product I read in a review that the smell should be pleasant. Having had the cream on for a few hours, I have to wash it off because it stank so terrible! The cream went straight in the bin! If you like to smell good, I would highly discourage you this cream!</li>
            <li> Helps a ton with Colorado climate.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many products and this is perfect.  Has a peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> I really like using this lotion.  I love the smell and it feels so good on my skin.  I look forward to putting it on.  I have a bottle of this on my desk at work.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels and smells incredible! I will definitely be returning for more...... After this purchase I went ahead and bought the facial cleanser and I must say it&#x27;s amazing! BWC is a new favorite brand of mine.</li>
            <li> Great profuct will buy again</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to use along my micro needling and it leaves my face and hands really smooth and has a great smell too.  Love!</li>
            <li> Has a nice non greasy feel and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering nasty smell.  For a lotion, I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I do not care for the smell, however, the lotion absorbs quickly, so the scent does not linger. Too soon to tell about results.</li>
            <li> My skin loves anything with Vitamin C and CoQ10 is bonus!  I love this product and my skin thanks you!  Great for after sun too as the Vitamin C repairs skin cells</li>
            <li> Nice lotion!! I like the citrus scent!!</li>
            <li> Very good value, very rich but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it five stars because when I got it, it already opened.  I wondered why it didn&#x27;t sealed.</li>
            <li> Smells like lemon rind but effective.</li>
            <li> This lotion has many organic ingredients, which is great, but the scent is not very pleasant. I will use it, but will not re-purchase again.</li>
            <li> good product  does not seem to be a full bottle  goes on smoothly  would like to know how much C it contains</li>
            <li> I really wanted a good Vitamin C lotion and thought I would give this one a try.  I used it a few times and it was ok, nothing I would order again, but ok.  However after a few uses I noticed it looked like it had another label underneath the top label, on both the front and back of the bottle.  So I started pealing the top label and sure enough there was another label, so I was curious to see if it just accidentally was double labeled or if there were any differences.  The orginal label under the top label states the product is 100% Vegetarian (The top label does not), that&#x27;s the one on the front of the bottle.  On the back labels the original under the top States Organic Ingredients and 100% Vegetarian (The top label does not).  There were a few other differences but those are the ones that stood out the most.  I&#x27;m sure maybe the original labels were just mis-prints and it was cheaper to relabel than to get new bottles and start over, but it was enough for me to not use the product any longer since I didn&#x27;t know the reason.  As far as the seller review, the product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Okay, just too strong of a scent. Made me smell like a medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hands and arms after every shower for years. It resolved and keeps my skin from having sun damage. Wouldn&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised. The only thing I would change is the smell. It&#x27;s not unpleasant per se and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> After I bought the first one, I immediately bought 2 more to put around the house.  This cream is thick and absorbs quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading mixed reviews about the smell. Let me just say that the smell is very strong and like medicine, so much so that while wearing it, my boyfriend asked &amp;#34;what is that smell??&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t want to kiss me with it on. It moisturizes, but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything particularly nice about that aspect. I love that it doesn&#x27;t test on animals, but unfortunately I won&#x27;t buy it again because the smell is just too bad.</li>
            <li> ok did not see any difference</li>
