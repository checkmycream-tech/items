            <li>I love matte lippys</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how cheap this was, and how amazing the pigmentation was.</li>
            <li>I love the finish (semi-matte) and it doesn&#x27;t go out of my lips or feather or anything</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap too!</li>

            <li>and I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li>I love this on me.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I ended up with a fuchsia color (Which it ended up being my favorite fuchsia lipstick out of my collection).</li>
            <li>This is THE perfect lipstick shade you&#x27;ve recently seen in commercials and been coveting!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of these!!!</li>
            <li>I paid $2.99 at Walgreens which is great compared to my normal $15.00 purchases.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color and came early</li>
            <li>I thought these lipsticks were going to be easy to put on and glide on the lips like</li>
            <li>Nice vibrant color and applies smoothly!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and even</li>
            <li>and it actually looks like a lipstick but feels like a chapstick which is great.</li>
            <li>I picked up this lipstick at a drug store for $2 and wasn&#x27;t expecting a product that was as great as it actually is.</li>
            <li>Applies on smoothly.</li>
            <li>beautiful color and stays long...</li>
            <li>and the price is right!</li>
            <li>This turned out to be very vibrant and beautiful red.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really bright red</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good red color.  </li>
            <li>However it came right on time and the price was cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a strict RED lip girl, but this shade looks lovely and gives my face a healthy, girly, rosy glow.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty smooth and pigmented.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful matte red; the color is more on the berry side than I&#x27;d expected, but it&#x27;s still a nice color overall.</li>
            <li>but it is an amazing color, especially for AA.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and the seller sent this to me pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>, it stays right where it should.</li>
            <li>The color is true, the only thing is it does come off when u eat or drink but for as cheap as it was its worth the price</li>
            <li>Might buy again ;)</li>
            <li>It goes on more purple/pink then a red.</li>
            <li>When i first applied it to my lips literally nothing came off, but I guess it just needed to be warmed up.</li>
            <li>I really like this lipstick for the price you just cant beat it!</li>
            <li>, i thought I would try it...very pretty</li>
            <li>My favorite red is cherry jubilee from avon</li>
            <li>but it was packaged in a big box, it was covered with like hard cardboardish wrap and tape and that was put in a plastic box so it was perfect!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright but not too bright that it looks bad.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not light pink or sheer and delivers EXACTLY the shade as it appears on top edge of tube (conveniently, top 1/4\\&quot; sticks out!)--even better!</li>
            <li>Wet n Wild is usually hit or miss, but this is a pretty good product, and worth much more than $2.00.</li>
            <li>another one delivery was fast</li>
            <li>Love this shade of pink.</li>
            <li>Not only is the color a dead on dupe, but it&#x27;s actually a pretty good formula.</li>
            <li>It says mega last however that not so true.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this color and put my faith back in red lipsticks!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear lipstick</li>
            <li>The only downfall, which really wasn&#x27;t a downfall to me considering I love the color, was that I was expecting a pink color</li>
            <li>It is a blue red (not classic red) that looks great on me.</li>
            <li>but Wet N Wild is helping me see the light.</li>
            <li>The color is so vivid and dries matte just like it should..</li>
            <li>using in Winter, dab a small bit of balm on top, as it&#x27;s not moisturizing by nature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s in between pink and red but more on the red side.</li>
            <li>This lipstick surprised me.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 more tubes, as I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a limited edition thing!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this and the Fergie wet n wild collection.</li>

            <li> It did last long and has a lot of pigment.</li>
            <li> Like any red you have to be careful of it bleeding around your lip line etc.  </li>
            <li> Too much pink for me but long lasting</li>
            <li> color was not what i expected. will not be buying again</li>
            <li> Save the money with MAC and buy Wet n Wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I went a head and other</li>
            <li> Im a matte lipstick lover but have been trying other finishes</li>
            <li> I only waited for days for a small lipstick.</li>
            <li> The formula has a slight shine to it.</li>
            <li> however its a little dark.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a little package</li>
            <li> but it does transfer easily (not 5 stars), so I blot between applications to lessen that.</li>
            <li> I was shocked on how fast it came.</li>
            <li> I almost wonder if this is even it or if someone filled it with home made crap, either or it sucks!</li>
            <li> Glides on thickly (waxy?)</li>
            <li> Second time I was shocked.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t even tough your lips ...</li>
            <li> came broken off.</li>
            <li> But when I tried it on it would not stay in place, it is by far the worst lipstick in history,</li>
            <li> Stays on at least 4 hours with no touch ups!!</li>
            <li> I was afraid of color</li>
            <li> and I was shocked!</li>

            <li> Very good lipstick!!!! will buy again...</li>
            <li> This color is perfect for my medium skin tone, not to bright, and it comes on matte style. I could definitely buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like this color when I saw the pictures, but when I received it, I loved it! Shipping was pretty fast and was well packaged. Might buy again ;)</li>
            <li> Love the colour and it is great</li>
            <li> I thought these lipsticks were going to be easy to put on and glide on the lips like a lot of people said but it did not. It did last long and has a lot of pigment.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be very vibrant and beautiful red. I fell in love with this color and put my faith back in red lipsticks!</li>
            <li> It goes on more purple/pink then a red. I ended up giving it to my sister she likes it. So it worked out great</li>
            <li> It is bright and can be worn during the day as well as the night. Love this shade of pink.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreen&#x27;s not Amazon but it is an amazing color, especially for AA.  It is a blue red (not classic red) that looks great on me. I love matte lippys so I took a chance on Wet&amp;Wild and I was shocked! I went back to buy it and it was all sold out so I guess I&#x27;ll have to stock up on amazon.  It goes on smooth and even but it does transfer easily (not 5 stars), so I blot between applications to lessen that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how cheap this was, and how amazing the pigmentation was. When i first applied it to my lips literally nothing came off, but I guess it just needed to be warmed up. Second time I was shocked. It&#x27;s a really bright red that&#x27;s in between pink and red but more on the red side. I love the finish (semi-matte) and it doesn&#x27;t go out of my lips or feather or anything, it stays right where it should. It&#x27;s so cheap too! Just get it!</li>
            <li> I really like this lipstick for the price you just cant beat it! I paid $2.99 at Walgreens which is great compared to my normal $15.00 purchases. I feel that if you are a feel lipstick lover you have to have a variety of brands. I love MAC lipstick but those are for my glammy dress up days. This is good for school or work or just going out. I have a mocha skin complexion and it shows up good on me and it actually looks like a lipstick but feels like a chapstick which is great. Im a matte lipstick lover but have been trying other finishes and I like this even though it doesnt have a matte finish. I would highly recommend this and the Fergie wet n wild collection. I will definitely be purchasing more of these!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after I learned that it was a close dupe to the MAC RiRi collection lipstick called \\&quot;Heaux\\&quot; (Rihanna&#x27;s MAC line). Heaux is sold out everywhere and not likely to return. This lipstick surprised me. Not only is the color a dead on dupe, but it&#x27;s actually a pretty good formula. No tugging, dragging.. it&#x27;s pretty smooth and pigmented. The formula has a slight shine to it. If you want the matte look like the RiRi Heaux lipstick, just pat some translucent finishing powder over your lips. Voila! Wet n Wild is usually hit or miss, but this is a pretty good product, and worth much more than $2.00. Oh, and the seller sent this to me pretty quickly. I received it in about 3 or 4 business days</li>
            <li> It came very secure I was expecting a little package but it was packaged in a big box, it was covered with like hard cardboardish wrap and tape and that was put in a plastic box so it was perfect! The color is so vivid and dries matte just like it should..its a nice bright red that can work on any skin tone , (darker girls like me can pull this off with a lil lip liner and were good to go) The color is true, the only thing is it does come off when u eat or drink but for as cheap as it was its worth the price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear lipstick but this one had so many good reviews, i thought I would try it...very pretty and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Love love love this lipstick! Nice vibrant color and applies smoothly! Perfect for a playful look</li>
            <li> Love love love this lipstick !  Stays on forever and doesn&#x27;t bleed love the color too!</li>
            <li> came broken off. color was not what i expected. will not be buying again</li>
            <li> I was afraid of color but Wet N Wild is helping me see the light. Quality as great or maybe greater than MAC...don&#x27;t be duped</li>
            <li> Not a good product, it was cakey and dry and didnt come on smoothly. However it came right on time and the price was cheap. You get wat u paid for ^_^</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and came early</li>
            <li> This is a great color and I love the matte finish. Stays on at least 4 hours with no touch ups!!</li>
            <li> I recently started trying wearing lipstick and have even trying out different colors. I love this on me. It&#x27;s bright but not too bright that it looks bad. I love it.</li>
            <li> I picked up this lipstick at a drug store for $2 and wasn&#x27;t expecting a product that was as great as it actually is. This lipstick IS a matte lipstick, so if you aren&#x27;t into that sort of thing then you definitely don&#x27;t need to pick this up. The only downfall, which really wasn&#x27;t a downfall to me considering I love the color, was that I was expecting a pink color and I ended up with a fuchsia color (Which it ended up being my favorite fuchsia lipstick out of my collection). Overall, this product is definitely something I would repurchase, but if you aren&#x27;t fond of matte lipsticks then it&#x27;s not for you.</li>
            <li> Came within the 4 days I ordered it . Amazing color ! Totally recommend it to all girls who are lipstick lovers. I was shocked on how fast it came. I only waited for days for a small lipstick.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful matte red; the color is more on the berry side than I&#x27;d expected, but it&#x27;s still a nice color overall. Can be a bit drying, but if you apply lip balm or another lip moisturizer before you apply the lipstick, you should be alright.</li>
            <li> My package for this arrived on time everything was perfect. But when I tried it on it would not stay in place, it is by far the worst lipstick in history, can&#x27;t even tough your lips ...AT ALL!  I almost wonder if this is even it or if someone filled it with home made crap, either or it sucks! Will never by lipstick online again</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good red color.  My favorite red is cherry jubilee from avon however its a little dark.  It says mega last however that not so true.  Like any red you have to be careful of it bleeding around your lip line etc.  However did not buy it for the lasting power.  This pairs great with my cherry jubilee I use this on the inner part of my like lip and use a lip brush to line my lips with cherry jubilee.  Perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> This is THE perfect lipstick shade you&#x27;ve recently seen in commercials and been coveting! It&#x27;s not light pink or sheer and delivers EXACTLY the shade as it appears on top edge of tube (conveniently, top 1/4\\&quot; sticks out!)--even better! Glides on thickly (waxy?) with remarkable staying power. I initially wore at work for 8 hrs, had coffee, lunch, and it remained quite vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;If using in Winter, dab a small bit of balm on top, as it&#x27;s not moisturizing by nature.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a strict RED lip girl, but this shade looks lovely and gives my face a healthy, girly, rosy glow. I bought 3 more tubes, as I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a limited edition thing!</li>
            <li> Check out this video comparing Wet n Wild Cherry Picking and MAC All Fired Up.! NYX is a dupe and just as great as MAC. Save the money with MAC and buy Wet n Wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/0c5r7zCjL9w</li>
            <li> Love love loveeeee it! I wear it everyday and the delivery was fast</li>
            <li> This is a nice color but it&#x27;s not red.  Applies on smoothly.</li>
