            <li>I can no longer find roll-on in stores, so its wonderful that amazon carries it.</li>

            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>great buy.  </li>
            <li>It is Good..</li>
            <li>The price was good and I like the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not knowing what&#x27;s good for me, I&#x27;m now ordering another dozen...</li>
            <li>I had to put my top on with sticky pits (yuck!)</li>
            <li>Great value, but only three out of the eight I purchased had perfectly functioning rollerballs.</li>
            <li>I also thought the scent was nice - not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing to me how customers don&#x27;t know the difference between a pleasant aroma and a Too Strong Stench.</li>
            <li>great price for this deodorant which I like very much</li>
            <li>Good price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>My favorite times 4.</li>
            <li>Also, no fragrance that I can tell, which I truly love</li>
            <li>is my #1 favorite of all time.</li>
            <li>Roll On deoderant is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have used this for more years than I can remember and never had a problem with it not working until I started using the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; packaging.  </li>
            <li>I tried several others and this is still the best.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and got it for cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li>My favorite for over twenty years.</li>
            <li>I love the scent (as do those who get close to me) and the product works well as a deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love that I can order online now.</li>
            <li>Easy  way to buy this.</li>
            <li>I sweat so I need a strong deodorant</li>
            <li>The powder scent is not as strong as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed buying a larger amount of my favorite deod-at a good price.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>I prefer scented over unscented just because it&#x27;s nice to smell the baby powder when applying it, but I certainly don&#x27;t care if the scent lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;so wasn&#x27;t such a great deal</li>
            <li>I thought the non-moving balls were just an anomaly with me, but now I know others have experienced the same problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to order run of the mill stuff you need for everyday, in bulk, and at a discounted price.</li>
            <li>For those, I wanted to update my post to tell them to look for the WHITE CAP formula, which is the quick drying formula that he all have loved for years.</li>
            <li>loyal 10</li>
            <li>I love this light natural baby powder scent.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find the powder fresh in any store of late, so this was great.</li>
            <li>This new \\&quot;Advanced Formula\\&quot; makes my armpits feel like flypaper!</li>
            <li>I did successfully get the ball moving in one of the deodorants where it seemed to be stuck, but it took about a week of struggling with trying to use it everyday before it began rolling smoothly.</li>
            <li>Good luck Dry Idea.</li>
            <li>the fact that it has powder in it is okay for me--some people prefer clear, I do not.  </li>
            <li>Just received my order and while it&#x27;s &amp;#34;dry Idea&amp;#34; - its not the &#x27;powder fresh&#x27; scent as pictured and advertised</li>
            <li>I applied the new formula in my nice cool house and GROSS!!!!</li>
            <li>And, Dry Idea provides me with the best protection out of all the other anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li>The reason I liked it was that it went on DRY.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not the same product any more</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>How can you go wrong and with a great price!!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured and arrived promptly, thanks!</li>
            <li>Throughout the years I have switched a lot of people to this exact deodorant, it works really well!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant and for some reason the company is not selling it in stores recently so purchased online .  </li>
            <li>The one thing I do like is the fresh clean scent that does not sour as the day progresses.</li>
            <li>We really don&#x27;t like the new advanced formula</li>
            <li>anyone can recommend a replacement, or if you have found a warehouse full of the old formula, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Dry Idea for years and years, I&#x27;d say 20 years or more</li>
            <li>Of the last dozen I ordered, two of the balls wouldn&#x27;t roll, which was a huge pain.  </li>
            <li>I try to make my life easier by doing as much online ordering as I can.</li>
            <li>the name sounds very odd,butthe qualityhas beeneconssistent trough the years.</li>
            <li>very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then I came home and was getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>Dry Idea Powder Fresh Roll-on has been my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product for many years, and I stuck with it even after the scent change several years ago, which I got used to.  </li>
            <li>I agree with other people who have posted that it works really good but not quiet as long as the original.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this, but this applies easily just like the old style, and dries almost instantly, under 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>This is getting more and more difficult to find in the store.</li>
            <li>I assumed it was the high temperatures where we were camping, and</li>
            <li>I bought a bunch on Amazon, several years worth...</li>
            <li>Not wanting to waste 1/6 of what I paid for, I would use the pointy end of a small knife blade to &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; the ball around, apply some deodorant, move the ball around a bit more, apply more deodorant, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still confronted with a new scent that ends up smelling nothing like baby powder..</li>
            <li>This is most certainly not the same product that it was a year ago.  </li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time was last week camping</li>
            <li>I explained that I had a new &#x27;old&#x27; variety in front of me</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and is just what I expected.</li>
            <li>+ year customer to disgruntled dejected old customer just like that.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this brand since her early twenties.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the product seemed so old that I couldn&#x27;t get the rollerball to move</li>
            <li>It is the only one that keeps me dry and drives so quickly once you put it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and have found that sometimes too much liquid drips out of the roller as I&#x27;m applying it</li>
            <li>However, perhaps the company tried to correct that by tightening the roller because the most recent container I bought sticks so hardly any liquid comes out at all.</li>
            <li>unless of course its some new future form of spray-on baby powder.</li>
            <li>tried the \\&quot;Cotton dry\\&quot; version, which is much better, but is very hard to find anywhere.</li>
            <li>have seen others with similar reviews as mine, complaining about how the new formula does not dry.</li>
            <li>The price was right, and it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going to use extra just because I have a few new ones sitting in the drawer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Dry Idea&#x27;s &#x27;Powder Fresh&#x27; roll on for over a decade, but am sad to find that their new formulation, which they&#x27;re calling &#x27;Advanced Dry&#x27;, doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the previous version of Powder Fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called their 800 number to ask why it was changed and was confronted by the support person who let me know that it smelled exactly the same as their old product.</li>
            <li>(I had bought out all the old ones I could find locally) as well as the &#x27;new&#x27; and that they smell very different from each other, and her script let her know that I was completely wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I noticed it did not dry at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;I found that the \\&quot;WHITE\\&quot; cap roll on Dry Idea is the old formula.</li>

            <li> and I noticed it did not dry at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;I found that the \\&quot;WHITE\\&quot; cap roll on Dry Idea is the old formula.</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY antiperspirant that actually went on dry, and I have tried millions of different products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for decades, really, decades and have recently found it hard to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I, too, have used this deodorant for decades, but all of a sudden it no longer goes on dry.  </li>
            <li> Nivea is producing their product in Thailand which has  a generally dubious reputation for quality control standards in other industries.</li>
            <li> When I went to the store to buy it last week I was surprised by the change in the look, but was not concerned and stocked up (as usual).</li>
            <li> I started using the brand long time ago..</li>
            <li> (has it been around that long?)</li>
            <li> My other really big problem with this</li>
            <li> go back to the other one, please.  </li>
            <li> But like other users, it got to the point where I couldn&#x27;t find the product in my local stores</li>
            <li> as in you can touch your finger to your skin and it feels completely dry.  </li>
            <li> It is so dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;She couldn&#x27;t find a deodorant that kept her dry.</li>
            <li> Dry Idea roll on in baby powder scent</li>
            <li> If Dial or whoever intends to keep using this formula, they need to change its&#x27; name because it is no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I would dry Dry Idea in another form but this roll on is not something I recommend or plan to use.</li>
            <li> as Dry Idea does now.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dry Idea unscented roll on for years, probably 15-20 years.</li>
            <li> ~ it is no longer dry . . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bit of difficulty finding Dry Idea in rollon (not the gel-goop), so buying 4 at a time means I won&#x27;t have to look for it again for a bit.</li>
            <li> Yea... always a dry idea.</li>
            <li> I have no idea (no pun intended) why other reviewers are giving this a low rating and saying it is wet or doesn&#x27;t come out on the roller</li>
            <li> I did not notice a small difference between this and the old baby powder scent.  </li>
            <li> It stays wet and sticky, and takes a while to dry.  </li>
            <li> Like other people posting here, my husband and I have used Dry Idea for years.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no &amp;#34;dampness&amp;#34; at all no matter what I am doing.  </li>
            <li> an odor, but always had the wet armpits.</li>
            <li> I had to dress with wet, sticky arm pits again.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for years, but was having trouble finding it locally, thus the Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> but I am certainly not going to find out.  </li>
            <li> Still the actual smell did not interfere with my perfume,so it worked as usual for me.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the white cap is available in the stores still or if it was completely replaced by the blue cap version (which is a sticky, nasty mess...</li>
            <li> I have used Dry Idea or Dove roll on for at least 15+ years.  </li>
            <li> , One of them also leaked a little in shipping, but just a little.</li>
            <li> You can use a small amount of it and it will keep you DRY!!!</li>
            <li> So I have used nothing else for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I finally tried two other brands (Dove and Secret) but was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I found that tI did not like the roll on as there is no way to control the amount of liquid that comes out on the roller; therefore application is very uneven.</li>
            <li> late for a return</li>
            <li> this \\&quot;powder fresh\\&quot; version or at least change the name to \\&quot;bathroom fresh!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for the past 38 years!</li>
            <li> I mean for hours - no exaggeration here.</li>
            <li> it back  :(</li>
            <li> Not happy with this situation.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re unable to admit they made a change, so</li>
            <li> I was uncomfortable from the time I applied it until well into the lunch</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s useless if it won&#x27;t come out!</li>
            <li> hate this product now and will have to go on the hunt again for a drying</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only deodorant I have found that totally works.  You can go running and it still works.</li>
            <li> Easy  way to buy this. Comes to my door. I have use this forever.  It is Good..</li>
            <li> I had no problems with this product as some others have mentioned. great deal.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed buying a larger amount of my favorite deod-at a good price.</li>
            <li> Great value, but only three out of the eight I purchased had perfectly functioning rollerballs. I did successfully get the ball moving in one of the deodorants where it seemed to be stuck, but it took about a week of struggling with trying to use it everyday before it began rolling smoothly.</li>
            <li> Its a roll on antiperspirant and out of the 4 bottles I&#x27;ve ordered the roller on 3 of the bottles won&#x27;t roll. I like the product but it&#x27;s useless if it won&#x27;t come out!</li>
            <li> great price for this deodorant which I like very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dry Idea&#x27;s &#x27;Powder Fresh&#x27; roll on for over a decade, but am sad to find that their new formulation, which they&#x27;re calling &#x27;Advanced Dry&#x27;, doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the previous version of Powder Fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called their 800 number to ask why it was changed and was confronted by the support person who let me know that it smelled exactly the same as their old product. I explained that I had a new &#x27;old&#x27; variety in front of me (I had bought out all the old ones I could find locally) as well as the &#x27;new&#x27; and that they smell very different from each other, and her script let her know that I was completely wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaking it forever doesn&#x27;t help. Wearing it doesn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;m still confronted with a new scent that ends up smelling nothing like baby powder.. unless of course its some new future form of spray-on baby powder. It&#x27;s just not the same product any more and they&#x27;re unable to admit they made a change, so now I&#x27;m trying out alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From loyal 10+ year customer to disgruntled dejected old customer just like that. Good luck Dry Idea.</li>
            <li> I have used Dry Idea or Dove roll on for at least 15+ years.  I was hesitant to try this, but this applies easily just like the old style, and dries almost instantly, under 30 seconds. as in you can touch your finger to your skin and it feels completely dry.  I have no idea (no pun intended) why other reviewers are giving this a low rating and saying it is wet or doesn&#x27;t come out on the roller - I haven&#x27;t had this experience at all!  It&#x27;s great! There is absolutely no &amp;#34;dampness&amp;#34; at all no matter what I am doing.  It is so dry I wondered if it would even wash off!  I also thought the scent was nice - not overpowering.  I did not notice a small difference between this and the old baby powder scent.  I prefer scented over unscented just because it&#x27;s nice to smell the baby powder when applying it, but I certainly don&#x27;t care if the scent lasts all day.  Supposedy lasts for 72 hours but I am certainly not going to find out.  ;)  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was 19 and I&#x27;m now 55+.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this brand since her early twenties.&lt;br /&gt;She couldn&#x27;t find a deodorant that kept her dry. She never&lt;br /&gt;had an odor, but always had the wet armpits. EMBARASSING!&lt;br /&gt;Dry Idea did the job.</li>
            <li> My favorite times 4. How can you go wrong and with a great price!!!!</li>
            <li> It is amazing to me how customers don&#x27;t know the difference between a pleasant aroma and a Too Strong Stench.</li>
            <li> I sweat so I need a strong deodorant and this is this one for me.  I do not wear sleeveless, so the fact that it has powder in it is okay for me--some people prefer clear, I do not.  I t lasts  Also, no fragrance that I can tell, which I truly love</li>
            <li> received product on time&lt;br /&gt;used two of them&lt;br /&gt;when I opened 3rd one it was broken&lt;br /&gt;too late for a return&lt;br /&gt;so wasn&#x27;t such a great deal</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured and arrived promptly, thanks!</li>
            <li> This is getting more and more difficult to find in the store. The price was right, and it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going to use extra just because I have a few new ones sitting in the drawer.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 star even though it is still the best product out there.  I agree with other people who have posted that it works really good but not quiet as long as the original.  I have placed them standing up to store even when in use, One of them also leaked a little in shipping, but just a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for decades, really, decades and have recently found it hard to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived :&lt;br /&gt;a) it was leaking&lt;br /&gt;b) the product seemed so old that I couldn&#x27;t get the rollerball to move&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sent it back  :(</li>
            <li> I try to make my life easier by doing as much online ordering as I can. This is a GREAT product...couldn&#x27;t beat the price...and....didn&#x27;t have to use my own gas!!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly! I have not been able to find the powder fresh in any store of late, so this was great. I have been using this deodorant for the past 38 years! It smells great and stops my sweating. Throughout the years I have switched a lot of people to this exact deodorant, it works really well!</li>
            <li> Just received my order and while it&#x27;s &amp;#34;dry Idea&amp;#34; - its not the &#x27;powder fresh&#x27; scent as pictured and advertised here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ones I got are called &amp;#34;Cotton Dry&amp;#34; which is definitely a different scent.  It&#x27;s definitely a very different scent.</li>
            <li> This is my go to deodorant. What else can I say? It is the only one that keeps me dry and drives so quickly once you put it on.</li>
            <li> I love this light natural baby powder scent. And, Dry Idea provides me with the best protection out of all the other anti-perspirants. So I have used nothing else for quite a few years. A few months ago, I finally tried two other brands (Dove and Secret) but was not impressed. Dry Idea roll on in baby powder scent is my #1 favorite of all time.</li>
            <li> I, too, have used this deodorant for decades, but all of a sudden it no longer goes on dry.  It stays wet and sticky, and takes a while to dry.  If Dial or whoever intends to keep using this formula, they need to change its&#x27; name because it is no longer dry.</li>
            <li> Great product.  We have used it for years. It is wonderful</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product</li>
            <li> Roll On deoderant is not my favorite. i was sent a bottle of this to try out when its packaging changed. I found that tI did not like the roll on as there is no way to control the amount of liquid that comes out on the roller; therefore application is very uneven. This item also drys on crusty and white. Leaving a very obvious residue. The one thing I do like is the fresh clean scent that does not sour as the day progresses. I would dry Dry Idea in another form but this roll on is not something I recommend or plan to use.</li>
            <li> Prefer this to Arrid role on for the scent and value. Prefer Nivea roll on except Nivea is producing their product in Thailand which has  a generally dubious reputation for quality control standards in other industries.</li>
            <li> I started using the brand long time ago..the name sounds very odd,butthe qualityhas beeneconssistent trough the years.I  believe the pack of  4 i s  an  excellent  price  and my complaint  is  that I cannot smell he powder fresh anywhere.Still the actual smell did not interfere with my perfume,so it worked as usual for me.</li>
            <li> This is most certainly not the same product that it was a year ago.  I have used this for more years than I can remember and never had a problem with it not working until I started using the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; packaging.  I have to apply this twice a day instead of once.  I find that it stops working mid afternoon and I have to apply it again.  My other really big problem with this is that it does not go on &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; anymore.  Well, I guess I will go back to Lady Mitchium as I only have to apply this once a day and it goes on just as &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; as Dry Idea does now.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dry Idea unscented roll on for years, probably 15-20 years. It is the ONLY antiperspirant that actually went on dry, and I have tried millions of different products. When I went to the store to buy it last week I was surprised by the change in the look, but was not concerned and stocked up (as usual). When I used it for the first time was last week camping and I noticed it did not dry at all, stayed sticky for 30 minutes or so. I had to put my top on with sticky pits (yuck!) I assumed it was the high temperatures where we were camping, and very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I came home and was getting ready for work. I applied the new formula in my nice cool house and GROSS!!!! I had to dress with wet, sticky arm pits again. Because I had sleeves, they stayed sticky all day. I mean for hours - no exaggeration here. I was uncomfortable from the time I applied it until well into the lunch hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate this product now and will have to go on the hunt again for a drying solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone can recommend a replacement, or if you have found a warehouse full of the old formula, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;I found that the \\&quot;WHITE\\&quot; cap roll on Dry Idea is the old formula. I bought a bunch on Amazon, several years worth... I am not sure if the white cap is available in the stores still or if it was completely replaced by the blue cap version (which is a sticky, nasty mess...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen others with similar reviews as mine, complaining about how the new formula does not dry. For those, I wanted to update my post to tell them to look for the WHITE CAP formula, which is the quick drying formula that he all have loved for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and have found that sometimes too much liquid drips out of the roller as I&#x27;m applying it so it&#x27;s messy. However, perhaps the company tried to correct that by tightening the roller because the most recent container I bought sticks so hardly any liquid comes out at all. I tried moving the roller with my hand, but it doesn&#x27;t help. Not happy with this situation.</li>
            <li> for some reason my stores stopped carrying this deoderant.  I tried several others and this is still the best. And we got the best price too.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use this deodorant.  Works great.  I can no longer find roll-on in stores, so its wonderful that amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> Like other people posting here, my husband and I have used Dry Idea for years.  We really don&#x27;t like the new advanced formula ~ it is no longer dry . . . go back to the other one, please.  It worked.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and got it for cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> My favorite for over twenty years.</li>
            <li> This deodorant odor smells like bathroom freshener! It also sort of lumps under my armpit after it dries and makes me itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the \\&quot;Cotton dry\\&quot; version, which is much better, but is very hard to find anywhere. I went to four different stores in the last week and I&#x27;m having to order it online.&lt;br /&gt;Dry idea should stop \\&quot;pushing\\&quot; this \\&quot;powder fresh\\&quot; version or at least change the name to \\&quot;bathroom fresh!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Recommended!</li>
            <li> Works well to reduce perspiration. Keeps me dry and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant and for some reason the company is not selling it in stores recently so purchased online .  I sweat so need a heavier deodorant and when I found this Years ago it worked. .  It will last for  ever .  You can use a small amount of it and it will keep you DRY!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bit of difficulty finding Dry Idea in rollon (not the gel-goop), so buying 4 at a time means I won&#x27;t have to look for it again for a bit.</li>
            <li> Good price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to order run of the mill stuff you need for everyday, in bulk, and at a discounted price. Arrived quickly and is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love the scent (as do those who get close to me) and the product works well as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have used Dry Idea for years and years, I&#x27;d say 20 years or more (has it been around that long?) The reason I liked it was that it went on DRY. Not anymore! This new \\&quot;Advanced Formula\\&quot; makes my armpits feel like flypaper! I hate it! I&#x27;m on the hunt for an alternative. Like someone else said if it&#x27;s not broke why fix it?</li>
            <li> great buy.  I thought they made a mistake.  I&#x27;ll take it.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Arrived with only 3 items in package labeled for 4.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for years, but was having trouble finding it locally, thus the Amazon purchase. The price was good and I like the product.</li>
            <li> The powder scent is not as strong as it used to be.  Perhaps others prefer it that way.  I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Yea... always a dry idea.</li>
            <li> Dry Idea Powder Fresh Roll-on has been my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product for many years, and I stuck with it even after the scent change several years ago, which I got used to.  But like other users, it got to the point where I couldn&#x27;t find the product in my local stores so I began ordering in bulk online.  Of the last dozen I ordered, two of the balls wouldn&#x27;t roll, which was a huge pain.  Not wanting to waste 1/6 of what I paid for, I would use the pointy end of a small knife blade to &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; the ball around, apply some deodorant, move the ball around a bit more, apply more deodorant, etc.  I thought the non-moving balls were just an anomaly with me, but now I know others have experienced the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not knowing what&#x27;s good for me, I&#x27;m now ordering another dozen...</li>
            <li> Been using this for over 25 years! I love that I can order online now.</li>
