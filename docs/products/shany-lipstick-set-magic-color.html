            <li>So I really love the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SHANY lipstick set - Magic color]]</li>
            <li>These lipsticks are more gimmick and can be drying for some people.</li>
            <li>I like the range of colors, but what I like most is that when you put this on, it stays on.</li>
            <li>No fault of the lipstick just one of my problems, I am allergic to many foods and medicines</li>
            <li>It is more of a stain</li>
            <li>so gave it a try one more</li>
            <li>love the lipstick although I feel the need to use lipliner because of my \\&quot;thin\\&quot; lips.  </li>
            <li>They are diffirent shades of pink and they look awesome.</li>
            <li>They glide on easy and make your lips feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ok well first if you have amazon student or prime, then its free shipping!</li>
            <li>Work fine, but no color variation between all the colors</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great present for any woman.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth felling on.</li>
            <li>These lipstick are great because they stain your lips so that you would not have to constantly put lipstick on.</li>
            <li>Am not a chemist but did notice the color changes to be very complimentary shade(s) for me.</li>
            <li>it is $5.95 &amp; eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25.</li>
            <li>If all-day bright (almost red but not quite</li>
            <li>Overall, good product and the color lasts for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li>They all come out as varying hues of sheer reds and pinks that look good with a full face of makeup or even worn alone as a balm.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I love it, beautiful colors that last longer time, cheap but quality and variety ,why pay so much in other brands</li>
            <li>and this is my very first review, so</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say the seller has been at all useful either, I tried contacting them twice</li>
            <li>They are just fun to see what color each one will be on my lips.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth buying.</li>
            <li>it comes good colour like pink colour</li>
            <li>It is an ok product for a young girl or for someone looking for some color on their lips.</li>
            <li>It was worth a try.</li>
            <li>It is fun.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>These are exactly as I remember them from being a kid.  </li>
            <li>These are really nice they really stay on for a LONG time.</li>
            <li>suggest you use a lip liner and apply with your favorite lip brush; because if you get this on your skin outside of your lip line it will stain.</li>
            <li>This is more of ChapStick that changes to different pinks.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty when applied.</li>
            <li>Last long and great price.</li>
            <li>I have found if you apply a moisturizing lipbalm or chap stick prior to applying lipstick, then the lipstick sets better and does not cause as much creasing.</li>
            <li>The picture is VERY misleading.</li>
            <li>Which is very upsetting.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat &#x27;em for the price.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a tinted balm that doesn&#x27;t really have much flavor or scent or just for a touch of nostalgia, then you&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from these lipsticks as they were so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>And the seller really cares about customers.</li>
            <li>Color Lipsticks also really moisturize your lips because of the vitamin E and Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li>thats why i was very disapointed  </li>
            <li>It was very silky going on.</li>
            <li>I do really like these.</li>
            <li>Overall, its a cool lipstick..</li>
            <li>However i am willing to bet that this particular product is old or expired.</li>
            <li>Other than that, all the colors come out pretty nice on me and leave a stain so it doesn&#x27;t look like my lipstick has faded strangely over the day.</li>
            <li>I love lipstick that last all day....who wants to continue  to apply their lipstick all day long?</li>
            <li>Cute lipsticks that have long lasting color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too pink for me but looks good when I use a slightly darker lip gloss over it</li>
            <li>These colors were beautiful and vibrant BUT not over done crazy.</li>
            <li>Since I was ordering other items my shipping was free.</li>
            <li>Green makes a bright pink.</li>
            <li>Pretty, sheer, moisturizing colors in fun little &amp;#34;color changing&amp;#34; formulas and packaged in the brightest, cutest, most floral little tubes in town.  </li>
            <li>I love pink but 12 lipstickss of pink...</li>
            <li>but that is really a lot of the same color.</li>
            <li>My grandma had given me these \\&quot;magic\\&quot; lipsticks to play around with when i was 8 years old.</li>
            <li>Leaves lips soft and supple.</li>
            <li>The lipstick in the tube would become soft.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t waste your time and money, there are better drug store options out there for the same price!  </li>
            <li>I love the colors, especially pink, red and orange.  </li>
            <li>The only downfall of that is the colors do not show up as vibrant compared to applying directly to your lips.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long and they are all shades of pink that end up being more of a gloss than a lipstick.</li>
            <li>The only thing about this is that I wish the color would be a little more pigmented and not quite so sheer.</li>
            <li>I used this \\&quot;mood\\&quot; lipstick in the &#x27;70s and was very dissatisfied; it made my lips extremely dry.  </li>
            <li>Found and old tube and finally got the name</li>
            <li>They all have a slightly different shade, but are all close to the brighter pink shade (which I really like).</li>
            <li>Apparently sending me a box that was opened already with twelve of the same color is acceptable when its advertised to be six colors.</li>
            <li>As other reviews have mentioned, this lipstick feels pretty dry.</li>

            <li> As other reviews have mentioned, this lipstick feels pretty dry.</li>
            <li> All is the same colour...but stays on long only if they were different colours..</li>
            <li> The colors do NOT last long at all.</li>
            <li> Lipsticks\\&quot; so your lips are not bare looking...</li>
            <li> It is really long lasting lipstick.  </li>
            <li> so the color last for a very long time...</li>
            <li> The different colors make different shades of pink on my lips.</li>
            <li> The coral pink comes out red or raspberry!</li>
            <li> but they all come out to be the same pink color.</li>
            <li> Colors stay on your lips a long time</li>
            <li> and it stays for long time but</li>
            <li> Aftre a matter of minutes my lips started to swell and feel strange and itchie.</li>
            <li> Varying shades of pink that last for a long time,</li>
            <li> it had a lip-stain-esque sort of feel since it lasts so long and does not spread everywhere when you are eating!</li>
            <li> The lipstick stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> They do tend to dry up and cause creases after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> the shades in my opinion are all the same some a little darker but that just on me.</li>
            <li> not what I expected.</li>
            <li> All the colors were a pink shade.</li>
            <li> I have 12 lipsticks ordered but there were 11 only and  1 lipstick was missing and lipstick case was opened.</li>
            <li> Each one turns a shade of pink on my lips.  </li>
            <li> Purple makes a darker pink.</li>
            <li> ) pink is your color</li>
            <li> Goes on clear and slowly changes to its shade of pink.</li>
            <li> why im giving it a 4 star and not 5 is because all the colors ended up being pink :/.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off like ordinary lip sticks and works well as a chap stick for cracked lips.</li>

            <li> it should include what the colors mean or what the lipstick does.</li>
            <li> The only bad part which is</li>
            <li> Ill just give some out to my friends.</li>

            <li> I have used these lipsticks for 10 or more years..hard to find...but now that I have found this site..hopefully I&#x27;ll never run out again.  This lipstick goes on smoothly; has beautiful colors; moisturizes my lips; and stays on for hours. And the price can&#x27;t be beat!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this set! The lipstick stays on for a very long time. The colors are all beautiful! I cant believe the price.</li>
            <li> Just not what I thought.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long and they are all shades of pink that end up being more of a gloss than a lipstick.</li>
            <li> Ok well first if you have amazon student or prime, then its free shipping! And for 12 dollars for 6 lipsticks that&#x27;s amazing! At first I was leaning towards the Fran Wilson brand since it had great reviews, but this was just under 6 bucks so I was like, why not? And its great! The coral pink comes out red or raspberry! Have not tried the rest but it&#x27;s great! One thing I loved it had a lip-stain-esque sort of feel since it lasts so long and does not spread everywhere when you are eating! Love this product!</li>
            <li> 6 different colors? All mine were the blue one which turns red when put on. I mean, for this price I shouldn&#x27;t be complaining.. but that is really a lot of the same color. I would have been set for /life/ with two or three of the same one. The picture is VERY misleading. The box it came in seemed like it had already been opened. I hope they didn&#x27;t come used.    Overall, its a cool lipstick.. It stays on all day, and doesn&#x27;t come off even when you put on lip gloss over it. Its just A LOT of the same color.. Which is very upsetting. I can&#x27;t say the seller has been at all useful either, I tried contacting them twice and I still have not heard back from them. Apparently sending me a box that was opened already with twelve of the same color is acceptable when its advertised to be six colors. Especially since others have gotten the correct product.</li>
            <li> not what I expected. All the colors were a pink shade. I understand it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; lipstick but it should include what the colors mean or what the lipstick does. The packaging was horrible. Very disappointed in this product. Used as a preteen gift bag item</li>
            <li> Recently they have changed their brand name on mood lipstick,but those are excellent quality.I am sure everybody will love it.The most impotent thing is the experience with seller that was awesome.</li>
            <li> Hello, childhood!  Fancy meeting you here.  Its been a while.  These are exactly as I remember them from being a kid.  Pretty, sheer, moisturizing colors in fun little &amp;#34;color changing&amp;#34; formulas and packaged in the brightest, cutest, most floral little tubes in town.  You really can&#x27;t beat &#x27;em for the price.  If you&#x27;re looking for a tinted balm that doesn&#x27;t really have much flavor or scent or just for a touch of nostalgia, then you&#x27;ve found it.  They all come out as varying hues of sheer reds and pinks that look good with a full face of makeup or even worn alone as a balm.</li>
            <li> Cute lipsticks that have long lasting color but they all come out to be the same pink color. It&#x27;s a bit too pink for me but looks good when I use a slightly darker lip gloss over it (I just have to re-apply the lip gloss often since the lipstick waaaay outlasts the gloss). Since they make the same color, I&#x27;ve been giving some of them out as gifts.</li>
            <li> I rate Shany lipsticks 5 stars for the following: Customer service, ensuring customer satisfaction and delivery time of product and product satisfaction. The moon lipsticks are moist and have a nice color. B. Goshton</li>
            <li> These are really nice they really stay on for a LONG time. I tried all the colors on my hand yesterday and i couldnt get them off so you can still see them today -_- but thats a good thing. The only bad part which is why im giving it a 4 star and not 5 is because all the colors ended up being pink :/. I love pink but 12 lipstickss of pink... They are diffirent shades of pink and they look awesome. Ill just give some out to my friends. I would say Go for it :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from these lipsticks as they were so inexpensive.  They are just fun to see what color each one will be on my lips.  The colors do NOT last long at all.</li>
            <li> This product is worth buying. It&#x27;s a great present for any woman. Good quality, beautiful colors. And the seller really cares about customers. They do their best to satisfy us. I would definitely recommend  this product and the seller. Good job!!!</li>
            <li> It works like aloe magic lipstick that I remember. So glad it is still availiable !  Varying shades of pink that last for a long time,</li>
            <li> I love it, beautiful colors that last longer time, cheap but quality and variety ,why pay so much in other brands</li>
            <li> Will get it again if I ever run out.  Hard to find anywhere else.  Colors stay on your lips a long time</li>
            <li> Very good price and is a good product</li>
            <li> I love these lipsticks. I have been looking for these for years. Found and old tube and finally got the name so I could order them.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Love the lipstick</li>
            <li> I have been shopping with Amazon for years and this is my very first review, so I hope it is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product:  SHANY lipstick set - Magic color&lt;br /&gt;* Brand: SHANY&lt;br /&gt;* 12 color magic lipstick&lt;br /&gt;* Aloe Vera mood lipstick&lt;br /&gt;* Vitamin E lipstick&lt;br /&gt;* 6 different colors 2 of each&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lipsticks are more like a lip stain ... so the color last for a very long time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today my order came in from Amazon and this item was to be at my home no later than 2/03/2011 but it came today 2/01/2011 in perfect condition. Yayyyyyy Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the lip stains lipsticks because you can put them on alone or under your favorite lip gloss or lipsticks. There are 6 different colors 2 of each all for $5.95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic Color Lipsticks also really moisturize your lips because of the vitamin E and Aloe Vera. They glide on easy and make your lips feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you use a lip liner and apply with your favorite lip brush; because if you get this on your skin outside of your lip line it will stain. The bonus to using these \\&quot;Magic Color Lipsticks\\&quot; is even after you have licked away your gloss or lip stick there will still be color from the \\&quot;Magic Color Lipsticks\\&quot; so your lips are not bare looking...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the order is fulfilled by Amazon.com it is $5.95 &amp; eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25. Since I was ordering other items my shipping was free. So I really love the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003UW3I5O SHANY lipstick set - Magic color]]</li>
            <li> picture is misleading all colour are same colours it comes good colour like pink colour and it stays for long time but all are same thats why i was very disapointed  but price is great thats why iam giving 3 stars.</li>
            <li> My grandma had given me these \\&quot;magic\\&quot; lipsticks to play around with when i was 8 years old. That was over 10 years ago. I can&#x27;t believe they still exist. It is an ok product for a young girl or for someone looking for some color on their lips. However i am willing to bet that this particular product is old or expired. Please don&#x27;t waste your time and money, there are better drug store options out there for the same price!  Please also note that the colors of the lipstick will ALL be the same, regardless of the color printed on the tube. Therefore, you&#x27;re purchasing 6 of the same lipsticks (stains). These lipsticks are more gimmick and can be drying for some people. Save your money!</li>
            <li> Not what I looking for :(</li>
            <li> I have 12 lipsticks ordered but there were 11 only and  1 lipstick was missing and lipstick case was opened.</li>
            <li> Work fine, but no color variation between all the colors</li>
            <li> I like the range of colors, but what I like most is that when you put this on, it stays on. It doesn&#x27;t come off like ordinary lip sticks and works well as a chap stick for cracked lips. I don&#x27;t like greasy, glossy, mushy lipsticks...these are perfect for my needs</li>
            <li> All is the same colour...but stays on long only if they were different colours..</li>
            <li> This is tbe same lipstick I used to buy years ago.  There are 6 \\&quot;different\\&quot; shades - 2 of each.  Each one turns a shade of pink on my lips.  It is really long lasting lipstick.  Put on in the morning and it will still be on at noon - maybe all day.  Leaves lips soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, especially pink, red and orange.  I also like the moisturizer in the lip gloss.  I am very happy with the product and price of the product!</li>
            <li> Have used mood lipstick for years.  These had good color. But tended to soften..  The lipstick in the tube would become soft.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package I had to try one of the colors. Aftre a matter of minutes my lips started to swell and feel strange and itchie. I had to remove it. I loved the color-more like a stain. It was worth a try. No fault of the lipstick just one of my problems, I am allergic to many foods and medicines and I have to try things sometimes to know. The price was right. Since I did the review I have tried the yellow and it works like a stain and stay all day. I have had no reaction.</li>
            <li> It is fun. The different colors make different shades of pink on my lips. Green makes a bright pink. Purple makes a darker pink. Etc. It is more of a stain so your lips need to be in good shape. It was very silky going on.</li>
            <li> i bought this product thinking that it will come wit 6 lip sticks of different colors... But they all paint the same awful redish color! I REALLY RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY THIS PEPRODUCT BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BUY 12 LIP STICK OF THE SAME REDISH-LIKE HORRIBLE COLOUR!!!</li>
            <li> If all-day bright (almost red but not quite) pink is your color then this lipstick is a must.</li>
            <li> I do really like these. They all have a slightly different shade, but are all close to the brighter pink shade (which I really like). They don&#x27;t last all day, but do hold color well.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have mentioned, this lipstick feels pretty dry. Other than that, all the colors come out pretty nice on me and leave a stain so it doesn&#x27;t look like my lipstick has faded strangely over the day.</li>
            <li> The only thing about this is that I wish the color would be a little more pigmented and not quite so sheer. This is more of ChapStick that changes to different pinks. Goes on clear and slowly changes to its shade of pink.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty when applied. They do tend to dry up and cause creases after an hour or so. This is not a moisturizing lipstick; it only stains your lips. I have found if you apply a moisturizing lipbalm or chap stick prior to applying lipstick, then the lipstick sets better and does not cause as much creasing. The only downfall of that is the colors do not show up as vibrant compared to applying directly to your lips. Overall, good product and the color lasts for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth felling on. Last long and great price. the shades in my opinion are all the same some a little darker but that just on me. five stars.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get these. They don&#x27;t actually make your lips that colour, and they taste like LIQUID SOAP.</li>
            <li> I used this \\&quot;mood\\&quot; lipstick in the &#x27;70s and was very dissatisfied; it made my lips extremely dry.  Noticed the addition of Aloe and Vitamin E so gave it a try one more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the lipstick although I feel the need to use lipliner because of my \\&quot;thin\\&quot; lips.  Disappointment is that this lipstick does not last the 12 hours advertised.  However, I am constantly drinking water so that may affect its longevity on me.  It did, however, last longer then 12 hours on my hand when I did a \\&quot;test\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re color - Skin chemistry is factor in the final color -not mood IMHO.  Am not a chemist but did notice the color changes to be very complimentary shade(s) for me.</li>
            <li> These lipstick are great because they stain your lips so that you would not have to constantly put lipstick on. This is a great price for this bundle. I would recommend it to others to purchase if they are looking for a quality lipstick at a low price.</li>
            <li> These colors were beautiful and vibrant BUT not over done crazy. I loved the price as well. These lipsticks don&#x27;t come off unless you use soap and water or oil/lotion. I love lipstick that last all day....who wants to continue  to apply their lipstick all day long? Yhis lipstick is truly a good buy</li>
