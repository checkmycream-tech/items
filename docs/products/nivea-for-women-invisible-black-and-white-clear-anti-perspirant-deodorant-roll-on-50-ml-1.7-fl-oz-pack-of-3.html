            <li>This stuff is the best!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product; lives up to its claims of long-term coverage.</li>
            <li>the best anti-perspirant that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nivea antiperspirant for decade and it always gave me great protection .</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great roll-on deodorant.</li>
            <li>Love this!!</li>
            <li>very effective</li>
            <li>Not as good as it used to be.</li>
            <li>It smels good</li>
            <li>Glad I could find it on amazon!</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for almost 15 years and LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>Also keep in mind certain products work best for others</li>
            <li>I liked these</li>
            <li>The smell is nice.</li>
            <li>This one feels sticky and requires more product to get the protection I need.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found them online here.</li>
            <li>This specific kind is not as effective .</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been loving it.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, but it certainly isn&#x27;t 48 hour protection like they promise.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t smell like armpits when I left the gym which is always amazing in my book.</li>
            <li>I first discovered it in Mexico and realized no stores in the states sold it.</li>
            <li>I wore it the first time on an 85 degree day while photographing a rodeo.  </li>
            <li>I doubt there has been a day in my adulthood that didn&#x27;t see me perspire, and this stuff really keeps me fresh.</li>
            <li>It also is not irritating and I smell good and sweat less all day.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never tested the 48 hours claim, I like showers too much).</li>
            <li>Even if you sweat, it doesn&#x27;t smell, which is what I really need.</li>
            <li>Very poor--like old time deodorant.</li>
            <li>It was a long day and this product kept me sweet and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>rolls on clear and it never gets clumpy or sticky.</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot naturally and this deodorant has been holding up.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it does have aluminum, but if it didn&#x27;t, it would be absolutely</li>
            <li>Never shows on my clothes and really does last all day</li>
            <li>love this product - the scent is subtle and it never shows a mark.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and works as hard as you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Long lasting freshness, gr8 for sensitive skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Nivea Invisible For Black and White iis</li>
            <li> It is unlike any other anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not use any other deodorant from this day forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Love this!! I first discovered it in Mexico and realized no stores in the states sold it. I was buying it from overseas. Was ecstatic when I learned that AMAZON carries it now!.. Thank GOD!! I cannot wear any other deodorant!..</li>
            <li> One day my mom and I were at like a lot less which is a discount store and we went in to pick up a couple of things that we needed. I was in need of a deodorant and my mom recommended this to me. So far I&#x27;ve been loving it. It doesn&#x27;t leave me that gross sticky feeling that stick deodorants can sometimes leave even when you shower and use a lot of soap and water the stickiness remains, which I hate.This is my new favorite deodorant. I sweat a lot naturally and this deodorant has been holding up. I went to the gym a couple of times since buying this deodorant and I didn&#x27;t smell like armpits when I left the gym which is always amazing in my book. Bottom line is anyone who&#x27;s considering buying this deodorant go for it. Also keep in mind certain products work best for others so do not become discourage with any negative comments. What&#x27;s the worst that can happen? If you don&#x27;t feel like this product is for you, you can always get a different deodorant.</li>
            <li> Long lasting freshness, gr8 for sensitive skin. No residue on clothes and no white stain or sticky stuff on skin. Glad I could find it on amazon!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!!! I bought it when I was in Europe and cannot forsee ever going back to Secret or Dove, etc. The only downside is that it does have aluminum, but if it didn&#x27;t, it would be absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It rolls on clear and it never gets clumpy or sticky. It also leaves no marks whatsoever on your clothes. It is unlike any other anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve tried. It also is not irritating and I smell good and sweat less all day. I can&#x27;t figure out why it hasn&#x27;t made it to stores in America.</li>
            <li> Not as good as it used to be. I&#x27;ve been using Nivea antiperspirant for decade and it always gave me great protection . This specific kind is not as effective . It smels good and yes it&#x27;s invisible,but after half day of regular work day ,not excessive or something that makes you sweat I do smell a slight odor under my armpits . :(</li>
            <li> I still smell like BO.  What the heck is going on.</li>
            <li> love this product - the scent is subtle and it never shows a mark. very effective</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I wore it the first time on an 85 degree day while photographing a rodeo.  It was a long day and this product kept me sweet and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer, as I do, from sweating from exertion or heat, this is the product for you.  It goes on easily and works as hard as you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not use any other deodorant from this day forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Note:  I liked these so well that I&#x27;ve stocked up on them.  They really do last 48 hours!</li>
            <li> Never shows on my clothes and really does last all day (I&#x27;ve never tested the 48 hours claim, I like showers too much).</li>
            <li> Excellent product; lives up to its claims of long-term coverage.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes!</li>
            <li> Made for a woman but works for a man</li>
            <li> Very poor--like old time deodorant.</li>
            <li> Nivea Invisible For Black and White iis the best anti-perspirant that I have ever used. It keeps me dry all day long and leaves no stains on my white or black clothes. I also bought it for other family members  and my husband uses the men&#x27;s version as well. I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Like it it arrived on timw</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for almost 15 years and LOVE it!  I wish Nivea would make/sell it in the USA!</li>
            <li> I prefer the other Nivea deodorants. This one feels sticky and requires more product to get the protection I need.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but it certainly isn&#x27;t 48 hour protection like they promise. I typically have to re-apply about half way through the day. The smell is nice. Sometimes the ball gets stuck. I will probably try to find something else next time around.</li>
            <li> Great roll-on deodorant. Usually I have to buy them when I go to Europe. Glad to have found them online here.</li>
            <li> Bought this at a drugstore on a whim in Italy and now I don&#x27;t use anything else. It&#x27;s really disappointing they don&#x27;t sell this product in the US. Even if you sweat, it doesn&#x27;t smell, which is what I really need. I doubt there has been a day in my adulthood that didn&#x27;t see me perspire, and this stuff really keeps me fresh.</li>
