            <li>For me, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Therefore I wasn&#x27;t happy about that.</li>
            <li>The powder is very very fine which is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Is good prod.  </li>
            <li>PoliGrip  was good  </li>

            <li>Best denture adhesive on the market by far !!</li>
            <li>Greatly relieved that you had the  Super Poli Grip powder.  </li>
            <li>Is great but can&#x27;t get right now so have to settle for an inferior product</li>
            <li>I used to buy this item for under $ 7.00 for many years untill this company decided to remove all of there</li>
            <li>you, sincerely, Juanita Wilson...</li>
            <li>Love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I have ordered Secure, but I don&#x27;t think I will be using it, Poligrip is just as good as Secure</li>
            <li>Lasts many hours without a problem.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold all day, but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Would not pay $5.00 or more.  </li>
            <li>Use a dusting of the product (either of them) and you should be okay with the zinc.</li>
            <li>Ok, so after watching many folks on YOUTUBE I decided I would give this a try, I already use Fixodent powder and it&#x60;s OK</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>the great way it holds, I can live with the price!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my order - I am pleased with the whole process of ordering with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I use poligrip cream and it works jut fine.  </li>
            <li>I love Super Poli Grip since it has no zinc.  </li>
            <li>The greatest thing about this is there&#x27;s no gooey mess when cleaning or reapplying.</li>
            <li>The powder keeps her dentures secure and is easy clean up at night.</li>
            <li>like it because it has no zinc, holds all day, and is easy to clean up every night.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Amazon should be ashamed of themselves charging so much for a product that cost $3.89 when it&#x27;s in stores!!!</li>
            <li>Manufacturer, Smith, Kline Beecham has promised full production soon.  </li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t get your Palate wet, then I take cheap Papertowels and wipe my palate out, it works!!!</li>
            <li>but everyone was saying how much better this was, so after using it several times now, I have to say, it&#x60;s just OK</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and feel perfectly safe using it.</li>
            <li>I love the product but, the price is too high.</li>
            <li>Need more but not at that high price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The taste is not unpleasant, but I prefer a product that has no flavor at all to interfere with my food.</li>
            <li>works better than the new version</li>
            <li>Works and holds my upper dentures, even better than the RIGIDENT DENTURE ADHESIVE POWDER that I had been using!</li>
            <li>I feel you need a clear statement of how many you are getting for one price.</li>
            <li>Exactly as requested .</li>
            <li>The uppers great last all day 24 hours at least however the bottoms are looser and had to reapply more often.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see it back</li>
            <li>/&gt;and product has been positive experience for me.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to keep it dry.</li>
            <li>i ordered due to such great reviews, but it would not hold my new bottom teeth in for a meal.</li>
            <li>I have a partial top plate, and have always used the gel type of adhiesive.</li>
            <li>It helps me so much .....</li>
            <li>thanks.......</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom as it has not been available locally.  </li>
            <li>This product really turned the corner for me when I thought I&#x27;d always be having to eat food that was ground up.</li>
            <li>Any idea when this product will be available in pharmacies, such as Walgreens and CVS?&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>so I am VERY.</li>
            <li>It stays the whole day and in the evening I really have to juggle my Denture out.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise I had to pay $34 for 1 box.</li>
            <li>The product is great, the price however was ridiculous!</li>
            <li>The Super Polygrip adhesive is no different , or any better than any other denture adhesive.  </li>
            <li>works good for my Dad, but not worth the cost since there are other very capable items that do the same&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff and a little stronger and longer lasting than Polygrip.  </li>
            <li>It worked as good as expected but the price was very high due to a shortage of product on the market shelves.</li>
            <li>the price was to high.</li>
            <li>I feel the price was too high</li>
            <li>I would be delighted, but alas no.</li>
            <li>This stuff works, I have immidiate upper and partial lower Dentures, I tried just about anything for my uppers, my gums are shrinking and I still have 4 more months until I get my Perms.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, but a lousy case of price gouging customers due to temporary shortage.</li>
            <li>First of all let me say that I could not find this product anywhere locally they were sold out at every drug store or supermarket</li>
            <li>I sprinkle the powder on the wet Denture,then I spray it lightly with water and sprinkle a second layer on.</li>
            <li>I would, however, suggest that anyone who wants it wait until the manufacturer gets it back on the market.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is easy to apply the powder with very little mess and waste.</li>
            <li>PoliGrip Super Powder will be back on store shelves in mid-to-late December at the usual $5 price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>still not a perfect solution (no pun intended) but a far sight better than several I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The product I received was quality however was sold at 4 times the normal price because I assume due to some one taking advantage of the shortage.</li>
            <li>At first, I didnt know how to use this product, but with a few trail try-outs, I finially got the hang of it, and if I use this properly, it should last a couple of months, give or take afew days.</li>
            <li>This powder  failed right after my first bite of food  </li>
            <li>for one container is absolute RIP OFF,  at least 3x higher than other retailers.</li>

            <li> for one container is absolute RIP OFF,  at least 3x higher than other retailers.</li>
            <li> used in past it works very well.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I tried the paste, yuck, did not like the Stuff running all back in my throat, tried the wafers, the same thing, then I tried Fixodent Powder,I still had the yucky stuff running down my throat.</li>
            <li> I have a little powder left on my palate,second tip&#x3D; take the Denture out and leave your mouth open</li>
            <li> I have used the Poligrip powder for the 3 years that I&#x27;ve had my dentures, and the only other powder I&#x27;ve tried (Fixodent) only held about half the time frame that Poligrip did.</li>
            <li> Apparently, ill fitting dentures are usually the problem per the adhesive manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Our local Walmart carries it, and it&#x27;s a little under $4 per 1.6 oz bottle, plus tax.  </li>
            <li> I will be trying it in the next few days.</li>
            <li> + is not worth it</li>
            <li> Firm hold Once a day, What I Expected</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t you bring the price down</li>
            <li> and I had to use other products,&lt;br /&gt;all of which were ineffective and some messy.  </li>
            <li> I have previously used this product till the shortage from the factory.</li>
            <li> I bought it at Walmart for less than $4.00.  </li>
            <li> I learned a little tip from Denturesanewsmile.ning.com&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Just wish the price was a little lower but</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product to anyone that has been having trouble with their dentures stay in, slipping, shifting, etc.!!!</li>
            <li> She hates the &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; style as it is so messy to get off her dentures and the roof of her mouth.  </li>
            <li> While it does hold well, after a few hours you feel it oozing onto your gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> It holds well and sets in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This product did not do nothing for me no more than the poli grip paste,  </li>
            <li> I shake off the excess into a small &amp;#34;Tupperware&amp;#34; type bowl (the excess can be used when the bottle is used up).</li>
            <li> Really hard to find.  </li>
            <li> This powder turns into a gooey sticky paste that sticks to your gums, your mouth and is hard to get off the denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in drug stores, etc.</li>
            <li> but so hard to find it lately.</li>
            <li> However, the price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Item to expensive, I can get it for much less money.</li>
            <li> NO YUCKY STUFF IS RUNNING DOWN MY THROAT!!!!</li>

            <li> Excellent product, but a lousy case of price gouging customers due to temporary shortage.</li>
            <li> the price was to high. can&#x27;t you bring the price down</li>
            <li> 25 bucks for one bottle...wont buy again</li>
            <li> Great powder but I am very disappointed with Amazon for selling it at such awful prices !!!!</li>
            <li> Firm hold Once a day, What I Expected</li>
            <li> The product is the same quality product as was always sold in every store prior to a mfg. problem they are having now.  The product I received was quality however was sold at 4 times the normal price because I assume due to some one taking advantage of the shortage.</li>
            <li> works good for my Dad, but not worth the cost since there are other very capable items that do the same&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> The product is very good. I used to buy this item for under $ 7.00 for many years untill this company decided to remove all of there product  from the shelves of all retail stores.For the last two bottles I purchased , it cost me $ 65.00. Needless to say ,I will never again Buy Poli Grip items.</li>
            <li> over charged like crazy</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my order - I am pleased with the whole process of ordering with Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have a partial top plate, and have always used the gel type of adhiesive. At first, I didnt know how to use this product, but with a few trail try-outs, I finially got the hang of it, and if I use this properly, it should last a couple of months, give or take afew days. Overall, I like this product. Thatk you, sincerely, Juanita Wilson...</li>
            <li> I have previously used this product till the shortage from the factory. The price went sky-high but now is back in stock. I like the hold and the ease of use of this product. Works the best all around for me.</li>
            <li> My bottom teeth are ill fitting so the poligrip holds them in place I just remove them when I eat then put them back in again aftrwards</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I was paying $80 for only 1 box.  NEVER AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> What can you say it for dentures and works.</li>
            <li> as of 05/14/2015, CENTRAL SUPPLY is taking advantage of a temporary shortage of PolyGrip Denture Adhesive Powder by charging FOUR TIMES the MSRP.  Manufacturer, Smith, Kline Beecham has promised full production soon.  When prices stabilizes, I will not purchase anything from CENTRAL SUPPLY.</li>
            <li> Best product for dentures.</li>
            <li> It helps me so much ..... thanks.......</li>
            <li> Great price and timely delivery</li>
            <li> A pricey but a great product. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom as it has not been available locally.  She hates the &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; style as it is so messy to get off her dentures and the roof of her mouth.  The powder keeps her dentures secure and is easy clean up at night.</li>
            <li> still not a perfect solution (no pun intended) but a far sight better than several I&#x27;ve tried. grip is strooooong.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for me. I have no problems with it. I would, however, suggest that anyone who wants it wait until the manufacturer gets it back on the market.  The prices being charged are outrageous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best of the best.  It took me to a place where I could actually chew any foods without injury to my gums and wobbling.  This product really turned the corner for me when I thought I&#x27;d always be having to eat food that was ground up.</li>
            <li> The Super Polygrip adhesive is no different , or any better than any other denture adhesive.  Apparently, ill fitting dentures are usually the problem per the adhesive manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff there is!</li>
            <li> Really hard to find.  Arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> If you have to wear dentures this is the best product on the market.  It was unavailable for several months and I had to use other products,&lt;br /&gt;all of which were ineffective and some messy.  I highly recommend it and feel perfectly safe using it.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this product! Any idea when this product will be available in pharmacies, such as Walgreens and CVS?&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This product did not do nothing for me no more than the poli grip paste,  I would not recommend&lt;br /&gt;this to no one.</li>
            <li> Exactly as requested .</li>
            <li> Great product, Used it for years but so hard to find it lately.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> While it does hold well, after a few hours you feel it oozing onto your gums and teeth. This powder turns into a gooey sticky paste that sticks to your gums, your mouth and is hard to get off the denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is not unpleasant, but I prefer a product that has no flavor at all to interfere with my food.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that I could not find this product anywhere locally they were sold out at every drug store or supermarket I looked at.  I was very excited to find it on Amazon with free shipping and the reviews were excellent. I love that it is easy to apply the powder with very little mess and waste. The powder is very very fine which is wonderful. The uppers great last all day 24 hours at least however the bottoms are looser and had to reapply more often. The greatest thing about this is there&#x27;s no gooey mess when cleaning or reapplying. Love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Greatly relieved that you had the  Super Poli Grip powder.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I get this at CVS, on sale for $4.99</li>
            <li> used in past it works very well.</li>
            <li> For me, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see it back</li>
            <li> I feel the price was too high and I thought that I was getting a set of 4 1.6 boxes of PoliGrip for $25.00 instead of one. I think that was misleading and I was so disappointed. I feel you need a clear statement of how many you are getting for one price. I love the product but, the price is too high. I will never purchase this product again at that price from any store.</li>
            <li> Need more but not at that high price.</li>
            <li> Really works well. Love it</li>
            <li> I have used the Poligrip powder for the 3 years that I&#x27;ve had my dentures, and the only other powder I&#x27;ve tried (Fixodent) only held about half the time frame that Poligrip did. Now that there is a (hopefully) temporary shortage of it, I&#x27;ve had to go to the Fixodent. It&#x27;s not as durable as the Poligrip, but at least I get minty fresh breath when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY IT ON THIS SITE!!!! $30+ is not worth it and the seller is obviously trying to take advantage of the shortage. The Fixodent (orange, white and blue box) will work until the Poligrip comes back.</li>
            <li> These prices are just insane, $26.00 for one box!</li>
            <li> Is great but can&#x27;t get right now so have to settle for an inferior product</li>
            <li> Only hit one cause they had no zero stars. Total rip off. For price should have been case not one bottle</li>
            <li> Best powder-type adhesive I have tried. Works as well as Ultra Wernets, which I had been ordering from the U.K.</li>
            <li> Is good prod.  To BAD CANNOT  BUY IN USA.</li>
            <li> This is a rip off I paid $ 18  for one bottle and it said I would get 3 for that price  so I am VERY. Unhappy  so I give them a O</li>
            <li> mis-leading add. I paid for what I thought was 3 boxes. I received 1 box.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and a little stronger and longer lasting than Polygrip.  This is hard to find in drug stores, etc.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, I have immidiate upper and partial lower Dentures, I tried just about anything for my uppers, my gums are shrinking and I still have 4 more months until I get my Perms.I tried the paste, yuck, did not like the Stuff running all back in my throat, tried the wafers, the same thing, then I tried Fixodent Powder,I still had the yucky stuff running down my throat. Finally I tried Poligrip,WOW,what a difference!!! I learned a little tip from Denturesanewsmile.ning.com&#x3D; I sprinkle the powder on the wet Denture,then I spray it lightly with water and sprinkle a second layer on. I can eat everything,my Denture is not moving and best of all IT HAS NO TASTE- NO YUCKY STUFF IS RUNNING DOWN MY THROAT!!!! It stays the whole day and in the evening I really have to juggle my Denture out. I have a little powder left on my palate,second tip&#x3D; take the Denture out and leave your mouth open, don&#x27;t get your Palate wet, then I take cheap Papertowels and wipe my palate out, it works!!! The Powder comes real easy of the Denture, I just rinse it in warm water for a while.I have ordered Secure, but I don&#x27;t think I will be using it, Poligrip is just as good as Secure and I do not have to worry about all the Stuff on my denture</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it works.  Lasts many hours without a problem.  It is hard to find at a reasonable price.  It is around $5 and I found this to be a cheaper way to purchase the product.</li>
            <li> works better than the new version</li>
            <li> The product works amazingly. However, the price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I love Super Poli Grip since it has no zinc.  It doesn&#x27;t hold all day, but that&#x27;s okay.  I can reapply since it doesn&#x27;t have zinc. I bought it at Walmart for less than $4.00.  Would not pay $5.00 or more.  That&#x27;s unreasonable!</li>
            <li> i ordered due to such great reviews, but it would not hold my new bottom teeth in for a meal.</li>
            <li> It worked as good as expected but the price was very high due to a shortage of product on the market shelves.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Unfortunately the maker is pulling it because a few (or one) bad apple spoiled the barrel. If you can find this in your local CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, or local pharmacy, BUY IT! If you cannot find it, try Fixodent Extra Hold Powder. I will be trying it in the next few days. I believe it works the same as the PoliGrip. Use a dusting of the product (either of them) and you should be okay with the zinc. If it doesn&#x27;t contain zinc, it will not work. The zinc is what gives it the adhesive property. Use a &amp;#34;dusting&amp;#34; not a dump. I shake off the excess into a small &amp;#34;Tupperware&amp;#34; type bowl (the excess can be used when the bottle is used up). Just make sure to keep it dry.</li>
            <li> The product is great, the price however was ridiculous! Amazon should be ashamed of themselves charging so much for a product that cost $3.89 when it&#x27;s in stores!!!</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet. Much to my surprise I had to pay $34 for 1 box. Outrageous!!! Therefore I wasn&#x27;t happy about that.</li>
            <li> I use poligrip cream and it works jut fine.  This powder  failed right after my first bite of food  I like the Poligrip brand which I choose over fix-a-dent but not the powder</li>
            <li> Just starting using it and it&#x27;s great!! Works and holds my upper dentures, even better than the RIGIDENT DENTURE ADHESIVE POWDER that I had been using! I do recommend this product to anyone that has been having trouble with their dentures stay in, slipping, shifting, etc.!!! Just wish the price was a little lower but the great way it holds, I can live with the price! Another great product that I have found on Amazon, my favorite online store to order from!!!! Another good job AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> One of the best denture adhesives there is.</li>
            <li> Ok, so after watching many folks on YOUTUBE I decided I would give this a try, I already use Fixodent powder and it&#x60;s OK but everyone was saying how much better this was, so after using it several times now, I have to say, it&#x60;s just OK really no different that Fixodent, except it doesn&#x60;t contain zinc, and I also had to pay 20 bucks to get this, if it held and lasted longer I would be delighted, but alas no.</li>
            <li> no longer avilable, banned by Oboma</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.  Our local Walmart carries it, and it&#x27;s a little under $4 per 1.6 oz bottle, plus tax.  It holds well and sets in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Holds the best... too bad they took it off the market.</li>
            <li> Item to expensive, I can get it for much less money.</li>
            <li> PoliGrip  was good  Service was excellent</li>
            <li> Best denture adhesive on the market by far !!</li>
            <li> would u pay 40.00 bucks for a 1.6 oz. bottle ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????</li>
            <li> PoliGrip Super Powder will be back on store shelves in mid-to-late December at the usual $5 price.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it has no zinc, holds all day, and is easy to clean up every night.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Do not puchase this..You only get one container for $25.99 not counting shipping. Totally upset!</li>
            <li> Product works but  PRICE  for one container is absolute RIP OFF,  at least 3x higher than other retailers. Have used product for years&lt;br /&gt;and product has been positive experience for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered poligrip powder and for 39.99 I thought I was ordering a case. I was very disappointed when I only got one bottle. This should be against the law for deceiving customers like this. I will never order from y&#x27;all again.  And I will tell everyone I know as well</li>
