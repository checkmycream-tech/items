    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Though the idea of a shampoo with beer as an ingredient sounds like a gimmick, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner smells great too!!</li>
            <li>The conditioner is awesome as well!  </li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>also got 20% off so great deal!</li>
            <li>Both smell wonderful - a bit like caramel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, gives lots of body and bounce to hair.  </li>
            <li>They could make me 100% happy by bringing out a leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li>Great shampoo and conditioner!   </li>
            <li>This is the BEST Shampoo / Conditioner I have ever used, period.</li>
            <li>In my case, I received the BEST customer service ever from Sean.</li>
            <li>And if the smell is the best thing about this product, you will be sorely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have been using the beer conditioner for a while and just knew if we added the shampoo to our hair care steps it would be awesome.</li>
            <li>This is just a shampoo which cleans your hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>Very good shampoo.</li>
            <li>It does smell great though and the conditioner is wonderful.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked this good, this products truly lives up to its claims!</li>
            <li>and this product gave it volume and a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li>It does make your scalp feel great though and has a great coconut taste.......</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>Worked great until I started coloring my hair.</li>
            <li>Keep up the great work Duffy&#x27;s Brew.</li>
            <li>and I was so happy with the results.</li>
            <li>and my hair looked great again-</li>
            <li>And they smell great, too.  </li>
            <li>but it makes my hair look great too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great for my hair</li>
            <li>Duffy&#x27;s is great all around and covers all those bases.  </li>
            <li>but I think giving this a try is a great idea, A+!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is also very nice.</li>
            <li>We loved the idea, and the owners were great</li>
            <li>That alone would be worth it, but it also smells great, looks great and feels great to boot!  </li>
            <li>Good work Duffy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Soo good.</li>
            <li>It also smells good.</li>
            <li>My hair looks good too.</li>
            <li>Smells good and cleans and conditions my hair without leaving buildup.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo smells good and cleans well</li>
            <li>but this smell is quite good.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how good my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>It smelled good, but there was no way to salvage it</li>
            <li>The price is comparable with Bumble and Bumble or Aveda, so I was expecting an exceptional product.</li>
            <li>Frankly, my boyfriend has complimented me many times on how great it makes my hair smell.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about getting this since it had great reviews</li>
            <li>This smells very pleasant and shampoo feels mild.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Duffy&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>love the way it smells!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m ordering more and don&#x27;t plan on using anything else for a while!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>it smells great sulfate free</li>
            <li>Regardless, I been using this for about 2 months and its amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo based on reviews and I can honestly say I have not found a shampoo that works quite as well as</li>
            <li>Words cannot describe how good this conditioner smells, makes me want to wash my hair more often...    </li>
            <li>And on top of all that, it&#x27;s simply a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I received this product as a gift, never would have bought it on my own..</li>
            <li>Nice, but not 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product, Duffy&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Nice results.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I tried this stuff out because it does so much good for my hair.</li>
            <li>it smelled nice.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve found it does a great job of controlling my oilier than normal hair) and it smells great.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair how it normally looks and makes it smell great!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.. smells wonderful and definitely makes my hair feel more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; (if that makes any sense).. I just ordered their ESB shampoo as well for when this one runs out.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>and wow I was impressed.!</li>
            <li>/&gt;For now I&#x27;m using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap, the liquid kind, and it works well.</li>
            <li>Good fragrance and leaves my hair feeling healthy and clean.  </li>
            <li>I constantly receive compliments on the great smell and my hair looks and feels amazing, so do yourself a favor and pick some up!</li>
            <li>Also, I get to support a Seattle company, one of my favorite cities.    </li>
            <li>This stuff smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does make my hair feel and smell great.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li>but I use it more than he does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Duffy&#x27;s Brew shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>but since so many of my friends recommended it to me</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming either.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed how it smells.</li>
            <li>, it is also from a favorite Brewery of from my stomping grounds in Seattle, WA.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so healthy.</li>
            <li>This time, I applied it twice and used more.</li>
            <li>After trying out, I feel much better about this product.   </li>
            <li>its Paraben, Sulfate, and Phthalate free!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this was just an issue with my bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that beer possesses components that help make or keep hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way this smells...</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>If dandruff is not a problem for you, I say go for it, for I have really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is just okay.</li>
            <li>Wish it smelled more like &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I have to note for men, women love the smell of this thing.</li>
            <li>I like it myself but women seem to love it.</li>
            <li>I get complemented on it about once a week, which is 1 more a week then before...</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and it really does leave your hair feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>B0047YYHDQ Original Beer Conditioner - Brewed with Elysian Brewing Company&#x27;s Stout Beer! - 8oz]]</li>
            <li>After one use my hair felt soft and silky and was manageable not to mention it made it smell great</li>
            <li>I went with this shampoo and conditioner because I was looking for something gentle with no added sulfates and a good scent.  </li>
            <li>My last shampoo qualified as mild torture in that regard, but the Duffy&#x27;s Brew is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The Duffy&#x27;s Brew shampoo and conditioner make my hair easy to brush.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>Duufy&#x27;s Brew has been hands down the best product on my beard!</li>
            <li>Have used alot of shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners over the years and this hands down is the best stuff I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottles of shampoo and conditioner and my hair gets better and better.  </li>
            <li>Got my first bottle of the shampoo in the mail last week and have been very impressed.</li>
            <li>This has quickly become my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Just thought a product labeled vegan would also be chemical free...</li>
            <li>but the information needs to be available.</li>
            <li>The lady said it works great at getting deep and cleaning those with thicker hair types.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s second great quality is it&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li>Claims it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li>It smells good, cleans well, and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Truly it is made from the best ingredient: beer (haha) plus other healthy things.</li>
            <li>After using the shampoo alone - no conditioner or gels - and blow drying, my hair was fuller, shinier and more manageable than I&#x27;ve ever experienced with any other product.  </li>
            <li>As other reviews said, the smell of shampoo is very unique and attractive.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
            <li>The smell is outstanding and it doesn&#x27;t take very much to lather up you hair.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey and yes, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Another plus is that the product is animal friendly (vegan).  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair so clean and it shines.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft, shiny and smelling delicious.</li>
            <li>If the stuff in Pantene, H&amp;S worth $5, then this shampoo worth $50 or more.</li>
            <li>I thought that my hair didn&#x27;t feel completely clean.</li>
            <li>My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and my hair feels clean without build-up.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, hair nice, not oily or greasy, lather a little lacking, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much eaiser to manage,it&#x27;s shinier and seems to have more body.  </li>
            <li>But the real test for me is that most mornings I find myself reaching for another bottle of shampoo.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>My hairdresser even commented last time I had a cut that she has never seen my hair look this good.  </li>
            <li>About making it more shiny and reducing frizz, it hasn&#x27;t helped me in that area all that much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering some for my daughter because she loved using it at my house on a recent visit.</li>
            <li>light and airy, not too much foam or soapiness and washes off very easily and fast with no oiliness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m embarrassed by the amount of money I&#x27;ve spent over the years in a futile search for the perfect shampoo for my fine, wavy hair, and I thought Duffy&#x27;s Beer Shampoo would be just one more to add to the shelf with my other failures.  </li>
            <li>The Duffy&#x27;s Brew Shampoo/Conditioner arrived quickly with no hassle.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a mild aroma.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 days now, and I felt the difference from the very first use.</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo and conditioner that I would recommend to anyone with no hesitation!  </li>
            <li>I started using both the shampoo and conditioner about 2 months ago - first, intermittently, now exclusively!  </li>
            <li>Hot Damn!   </li>
            <li>I will keep coming back for sure!</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny and soft and I love the beer in it which I think is what makes my hair even healthier.</li>
            <li>no more straggly ends, just beautiful and shiny.</li>
            <li>, i.e., wow, your hair is so shiny, or, your hair looks so healthy.  </li>
            <li>I am not crazy about \\&quot;beer\\&quot; products, but a friend of mine have been using it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>So far I am feeling much better after I use it this afternoon.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really liked how it made my hair feel and</li>
            <li>I definitely recommended this if you want something light and extremely refreshing..</li>
            <li>It does not have paraben or sulfate and phthalates, no artificial colors and is NOT tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so rare to find</li>
            <li>The Shampoo itself is as good as any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>everyone else right.</li>
            <li>and I can tell right away which shampoos are not going to work for me.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed about this shampoo is that I absolutely MUST use a conditioner, otherwise my hair becomes wiry and bristly, like cheap doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is straightened with a keratin blowout, I ordered this particular brand of sulfate free shampoo based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>and I research the ingredients first to make sure they are natural.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find out that using this shampoo while having some small nicks and cuts on my hands produced no stinging at all.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers well, seems to clean my hair, but after 10 applications I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special; certainly nothing to justify the high price.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, curly, naturally soft hair, just a bit dry, and I&#x27;m always looking for more shine.</li>
            <li>More gentle more healing than all the other shampoos I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various other top rated brands of shampoo/conditioner and nothing has been as good as this brand.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of work to get out gels and other products, and, most importantly, it does not fight dandruff (at all).</li>
            <li>It smells like decent sweet caramel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Duffy&#x27;s Brew for about a month now, and have gotten several compliments on how healthy my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>Recently I decided to go sulfate-free and again, have tried many of the varieties on the market.  </li>
            <li>It immediately made my hair shiny, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying this product on regular basis for sure.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t exactly label it, but it reminds me of almond and coconut.  </li>
            <li>There will be more Duffy&#x27;s Brew in my future.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t realized during the first two weeks</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first.</li>
            <li>It suppose to be a five-star product based on it quality, however with that price I could only give four, top.</li>
            <li>But my ultimate favorite thing about this shampoo is the smell...</li>
            <li>First time I got this on Amazon, the price here is cheaper then on their website.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to decide from the fifty different shampoo and conditioners my wife has lined up in our shower, so I went searching for the perfect shampoo and conditioner on Amazon, and this was it!   </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it really work any better or worse than every other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, but the smell is just great!</li>
            <li>We will absolutely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now, and I can&#x27;t see any positive effects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, but I must say that so far, it is doing wonderful things for my hair!  </li>
            <li>strongly keep in mind for future purchases.  </li>
            <li>have fine hair that is wavy/curly and definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>First off, I just want to say that I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell.  </li>
            <li>all I can say is that they must use very high quality fragrances in their formula.</li>
            <li>and it was great all day now a few minutes later its tangled again.</li>
            <li>Ok, not really and you can&#x27;t drink this either.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I am very thankful she did.</li>
            <li>This is a very pleasant-smelling shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY ADORE this</li>
            <li>i really miss the &#x27;body on tap&#x27; shampoo that is now discontinued.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>but ummmm ya don&#x27;t drink it... haha</li>
            <li>Price is a little bit higher than regular shampoo, but think about how much you can save for taking good care of your hair by saving a trip to salon.</li>
            <li>Cleans really well and leaves a good subtle smell.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>Being a former Seattleite, I was familiar with and fond of Elysian beer, and I like \\&quot;craft\\&quot;</li>
            <li>You end up having to use a lot of other products more often to compensate for added harshness of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I aim to take great care of my hair, and have used quite a few different products over the last few years, and none have been as good as Duffy&#x27;s Brew.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but it smells amazing and seems to do a great job with my dry hair that I barely put any thought into.    </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re an all natural shopper be aware that their are chemicals in this product...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Duffy&#x27;s Brew for the past couple of months and can honestly say I will never use another shampoo or conditioner again.</li>
            <li>I did send it back and was given a full refund however</li>
            <li>great fragrance, makes your hair soft, silky, smooth, can also be used on pets  CON&#x27;S: highly addictive, ruins you for other shampoos and conditioners</li>
            <li>I prefer a shampoo a little more gentle.  </li>
            <li>this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair shiny, and even though I haven&#x27;t had my hair coloured in months it brings new life to my hair so much that someone at work asked me if I got my hair coloured.  </li>
            <li>It smells a little bit like coconuts, and it makes your hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>After the very first use of Duffy&#x27;s Shampoo and Conditioniner, my hair felt instantly sofer and was easier to manage and style.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and it does not weigh my hair down!</li>
            <li>First off, it smells great, and secondly it makes my hair feel a lot softer than other hair care products with less \\&quot;original\\&quot; ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, if you&#x27;re debating on getting this because of the price( also the bottle isn&#x27;t the biggest ), I can assure you I&#x27;ve bought Shampoos twice as much as this that didn&#x27;t even get near this products results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a nice change from my regular flowery, froofy shampoos that I have used my entire life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cleans hair OK, but is a bit harsh for my taste.  </li>
            <li>Others I&#x27;ve tried and like better than this:  Crew green mint, Biolage, Nexxus, Paul Mitchell salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few months now and love it.</li>
            <li>The conditioner isn&#x27;t so heavy that it weighs your hair down and the smell is great.</li>
            <li>Was told about this new product by a friend</li>
            <li>So when I ordered new conditioner I lso ordered a bottle of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was using nexus and wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I was able to get about one month of use from this small bottle.  </li>
            <li>It has none of the cheap junk that ruins your hair.</li>
            <li>This is now my official shampoo, the only bummer is not being able to go down the street to a store andjust grab it\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every smoothing shampoo out there with limited success.  </li>
            <li>The only positive thing I&#x27;d say is</li>
            <li>I prefer a certain Australian brand to Duffy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The shampoo is gentle enough for frequent use yet cleans as thoroughly as shampoos with stronger chemicals.</li>
            <li>I opened it and the lid was unscrewed, and even though it was also wrapped in a clear plastic bag it was all over the place.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels wonderfully soft, shiny and bouncy with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Wahhh, that&#x27;s about everything you can get from a professional salon.</li>
            <li>The conditioner makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My fiancee and I both use it every day, we have different hair types but it works very well for both of us.</li>
            <li>A miracle shampoo as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>Also, I can say that this Shampoo far surpasses any BS Salon Brand / Recommend.</li>
            <li>Whatever the explanation is (I am no expert), I will stick to natural shampoos from now on and will try to space out washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>You have to try this product if you like natural products.  </li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t soft and doesn&#x27;t have volume to it or anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too expensive, even though it is a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>I mean, my hair didn&#x27;t fall out and as far as I can tell, my color is still ok.</li>
            <li>If your at all curious or just want to do your hair a favor, you should definitely give Duffy&#x27;s Original Beer Shampoo / Conditioner</li>
            <li>A subtle, manly odor that I just love.</li>
            <li>but the price is way too high compared to similar shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I must also add that I lived near Seattle for a few years and became a big fan of the Elysian craft beers while I was there, so I was excited to try their hair product as well.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it live up to it&#x27;s claims</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and this stuff is great and giving it a little extra volume and texture.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 yrs young, and I have roots which I touchup regularly.</li>
            <li>Another big plus is that it is 100% Natural / Vegan.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of getting my hair washed somewhere professionally before a haircut, those same smells.</li>
            <li>that they wash away entirely the natural oil that the scalp produces.</li>
            <li>Many shampoo products does not help but make it even worse.</li>
            <li>My order just came in today and first I was really surprise about its size: too small!</li>
            <li>I know it sounds funny, but this product keeps the skin on my face hydrated when the previous products I was using were drying the skin under my beard out.  </li>
            <li>The only negative is the price tag attached to such a small amount of product, but for now I am willing and able to pay it.</li>
            <li>First it is a tad bit expensive, the relative worth of it is debatable.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Though the idea of a shampoo with beer as an ingredient sounds like a gimmick, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner smells great too!!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is awesome as well!  </li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> also got 20% off so great deal!</li>
            <li> Both smell wonderful - a bit like caramel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, gives lots of body and bounce to hair.  </li>
            <li> They could make me 100% happy by bringing out a leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner!   </li>
            <li> This is the BEST Shampoo / Conditioner I have ever used, period.</li>
            <li> In my case, I received the BEST customer service ever from Sean.</li>
            <li> And if the smell is the best thing about this product, you will be sorely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have been using the beer conditioner for a while and just knew if we added the shampoo to our hair care steps it would be awesome.</li>
            <li> This is just a shampoo which cleans your hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great buy!</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo.</li>
            <li> It does smell great though and the conditioner is wonderful.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked this good, this products truly lives up to its claims!</li>
            <li> and this product gave it volume and a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> It does make your scalp feel great though and has a great coconut taste.......</li>
            <li> lol.  </li>
            <li> Worked great until I started coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> Keep up the great work Duffy&#x27;s Brew.</li>
            <li> and I was so happy with the results.</li>
            <li> and my hair looked great again-</li>
            <li> And they smell great, too.  </li>
            <li> but it makes my hair look great too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great for my hair</li>
            <li> Duffy&#x27;s is great all around and covers all those bases.  </li>
            <li> but I think giving this a try is a great idea, A+!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is also very nice.</li>
            <li> We loved the idea, and the owners were great</li>
            <li> That alone would be worth it, but it also smells great, looks great and feels great to boot!  </li>
            <li> Good work Duffy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Soo good.</li>
            <li> It also smells good.</li>
            <li> My hair looks good too.</li>
            <li> Smells good and cleans and conditions my hair without leaving buildup.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo smells good and cleans well</li>
            <li> but this smell is quite good.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how good my hair feels.  </li>
            <li> It smelled good, but there was no way to salvage it</li>
            <li> The price is comparable with Bumble and Bumble or Aveda, so I was expecting an exceptional product.</li>
            <li> Frankly, my boyfriend has complimented me many times on how great it makes my hair smell.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about getting this since it had great reviews</li>
            <li> This smells very pleasant and shampoo feels mild.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Duffy&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering more and don&#x27;t plan on using anything else for a while!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> it smells great sulfate free</li>
            <li> Regardless, I been using this for about 2 months and its amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo based on reviews and I can honestly say I have not found a shampoo that works quite as well as</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how good this conditioner smells, makes me want to wash my hair more often...    </li>
            <li> And on top of all that, it&#x27;s simply a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift, never would have bought it on my own..</li>
            <li> Nice, but not 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product, Duffy&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Nice results.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I tried this stuff out because it does so much good for my hair.</li>
            <li> it smelled nice.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve found it does a great job of controlling my oilier than normal hair) and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair how it normally looks and makes it smell great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.. smells wonderful and definitely makes my hair feel more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; (if that makes any sense).. I just ordered their ESB shampoo as well for when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> and wow I was impressed.!</li>
            <li> /&gt;For now I&#x27;m using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap, the liquid kind, and it works well.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance and leaves my hair feeling healthy and clean.  </li>
            <li> I constantly receive compliments on the great smell and my hair looks and feels amazing, so do yourself a favor and pick some up!</li>
            <li> Also, I get to support a Seattle company, one of my favorite cities.    </li>
            <li> This stuff smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li> So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does make my hair feel and smell great.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely the best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li> but I use it more than he does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Duffy&#x27;s Brew shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> but since so many of my friends recommended it to me</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming either.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed how it smells.</li>
            <li> , it is also from a favorite Brewery of from my stomping grounds in Seattle, WA.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so healthy.</li>
            <li> This time, I applied it twice and used more.</li>
            <li> After trying out, I feel much better about this product.   </li>
            <li> its Paraben, Sulfate, and Phthalate free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this was just an issue with my bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that beer possesses components that help make or keep hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way this smells...</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> If dandruff is not a problem for you, I say go for it, for I have really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just okay.</li>
            <li> Wish it smelled more like &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I have to note for men, women love the smell of this thing.</li>
            <li> I like it myself but women seem to love it.</li>
            <li> I get complemented on it about once a week, which is 1 more a week then before...</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and it really does leave your hair feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> B0047YYHDQ Original Beer Conditioner - Brewed with Elysian Brewing Company&#x27;s Stout Beer! - 8oz]]</li>
            <li> After one use my hair felt soft and silky and was manageable not to mention it made it smell great</li>
            <li> I went with this shampoo and conditioner because I was looking for something gentle with no added sulfates and a good scent.  </li>
            <li> My last shampoo qualified as mild torture in that regard, but the Duffy&#x27;s Brew is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The Duffy&#x27;s Brew shampoo and conditioner make my hair easy to brush.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> Duufy&#x27;s Brew has been hands down the best product on my beard!</li>
            <li> Have used alot of shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners over the years and this hands down is the best stuff I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottles of shampoo and conditioner and my hair gets better and better.  </li>
            <li> Got my first bottle of the shampoo in the mail last week and have been very impressed.</li>
            <li> This has quickly become my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just thought a product labeled vegan would also be chemical free...</li>
            <li> but the information needs to be available.</li>
            <li> The lady said it works great at getting deep and cleaning those with thicker hair types.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s second great quality is it&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li> Claims it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li> It smells good, cleans well, and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Truly it is made from the best ingredient: beer (haha) plus other healthy things.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo alone - no conditioner or gels - and blow drying, my hair was fuller, shinier and more manageable than I&#x27;ve ever experienced with any other product.  </li>
            <li> As other reviews said, the smell of shampoo is very unique and attractive.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
            <li> The smell is outstanding and it doesn&#x27;t take very much to lather up you hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey and yes, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Another plus is that the product is animal friendly (vegan).  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair so clean and it shines.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft, shiny and smelling delicious.</li>
            <li> If the stuff in Pantene, H&amp;S worth $5, then this shampoo worth $50 or more.</li>
            <li> I thought that my hair didn&#x27;t feel completely clean.</li>
            <li> My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and my hair feels clean without build-up.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, hair nice, not oily or greasy, lather a little lacking, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so much eaiser to manage,it&#x27;s shinier and seems to have more body.  </li>
            <li> But the real test for me is that most mornings I find myself reaching for another bottle of shampoo.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> My hairdresser even commented last time I had a cut that she has never seen my hair look this good.  </li>
            <li> About making it more shiny and reducing frizz, it hasn&#x27;t helped me in that area all that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering some for my daughter because she loved using it at my house on a recent visit.</li>
            <li> light and airy, not too much foam or soapiness and washes off very easily and fast with no oiliness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m embarrassed by the amount of money I&#x27;ve spent over the years in a futile search for the perfect shampoo for my fine, wavy hair, and I thought Duffy&#x27;s Beer Shampoo would be just one more to add to the shelf with my other failures.  </li>
            <li> The Duffy&#x27;s Brew Shampoo/Conditioner arrived quickly with no hassle.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a mild aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 days now, and I felt the difference from the very first use.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo and conditioner that I would recommend to anyone with no hesitation!  </li>
            <li> I started using both the shampoo and conditioner about 2 months ago - first, intermittently, now exclusively!  </li>
            <li> Hot Damn!   </li>
            <li> I will keep coming back for sure!</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny and soft and I love the beer in it which I think is what makes my hair even healthier.</li>
            <li> no more straggly ends, just beautiful and shiny.</li>
            <li> , i.e., wow, your hair is so shiny, or, your hair looks so healthy.  </li>
            <li> I am not crazy about \\&quot;beer\\&quot; products, but a friend of mine have been using it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> So far I am feeling much better after I use it this afternoon.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really liked how it made my hair feel and</li>
            <li> I definitely recommended this if you want something light and extremely refreshing..</li>
            <li> It does not have paraben or sulfate and phthalates, no artificial colors and is NOT tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so rare to find</li>
            <li> The Shampoo itself is as good as any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> everyone else right.</li>
            <li> and I can tell right away which shampoos are not going to work for me.  </li>
            <li> First thing I noticed about this shampoo is that I absolutely MUST use a conditioner, otherwise my hair becomes wiry and bristly, like cheap doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is straightened with a keratin blowout, I ordered this particular brand of sulfate free shampoo based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> and I research the ingredients first to make sure they are natural.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find out that using this shampoo while having some small nicks and cuts on my hands produced no stinging at all.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers well, seems to clean my hair, but after 10 applications I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special; certainly nothing to justify the high price.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, curly, naturally soft hair, just a bit dry, and I&#x27;m always looking for more shine.</li>
            <li> More gentle more healing than all the other shampoos I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various other top rated brands of shampoo/conditioner and nothing has been as good as this brand.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of work to get out gels and other products, and, most importantly, it does not fight dandruff (at all).</li>
            <li> It smells like decent sweet caramel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Duffy&#x27;s Brew for about a month now, and have gotten several compliments on how healthy my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> Recently I decided to go sulfate-free and again, have tried many of the varieties on the market.  </li>
            <li> It immediately made my hair shiny, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying this product on regular basis for sure.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t exactly label it, but it reminds me of almond and coconut.  </li>
            <li> There will be more Duffy&#x27;s Brew in my future.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t realized during the first two weeks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first.</li>
            <li> It suppose to be a five-star product based on it quality, however with that price I could only give four, top.</li>
            <li> But my ultimate favorite thing about this shampoo is the smell...</li>
            <li> First time I got this on Amazon, the price here is cheaper then on their website.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to decide from the fifty different shampoo and conditioners my wife has lined up in our shower, so I went searching for the perfect shampoo and conditioner on Amazon, and this was it!   </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it really work any better or worse than every other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, but the smell is just great!</li>
            <li> We will absolutely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now, and I can&#x27;t see any positive effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, but I must say that so far, it is doing wonderful things for my hair!  </li>
            <li> strongly keep in mind for future purchases.  </li>
            <li> have fine hair that is wavy/curly and definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> First off, I just want to say that I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell.  </li>
            <li> all I can say is that they must use very high quality fragrances in their formula.</li>
            <li> and it was great all day now a few minutes later its tangled again.</li>
            <li> Ok, not really and you can&#x27;t drink this either.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> I am very thankful she did.</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasant-smelling shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY ADORE this</li>
            <li> i really miss the &#x27;body on tap&#x27; shampoo that is now discontinued.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> but ummmm ya don&#x27;t drink it... haha</li>
            <li> Price is a little bit higher than regular shampoo, but think about how much you can save for taking good care of your hair by saving a trip to salon.</li>
            <li> Cleans really well and leaves a good subtle smell.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> Being a former Seattleite, I was familiar with and fond of Elysian beer, and I like \\&quot;craft\\&quot;</li>
            <li> You end up having to use a lot of other products more often to compensate for added harshness of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I aim to take great care of my hair, and have used quite a few different products over the last few years, and none have been as good as Duffy&#x27;s Brew.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it smells amazing and seems to do a great job with my dry hair that I barely put any thought into.    </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re an all natural shopper be aware that their are chemicals in this product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Duffy&#x27;s Brew for the past couple of months and can honestly say I will never use another shampoo or conditioner again.</li>
            <li> I did send it back and was given a full refund however</li>
            <li> great fragrance, makes your hair soft, silky, smooth, can also be used on pets  CON&#x27;S: highly addictive, ruins you for other shampoos and conditioners</li>
            <li> I prefer a shampoo a little more gentle.  </li>
            <li> this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair shiny, and even though I haven&#x27;t had my hair coloured in months it brings new life to my hair so much that someone at work asked me if I got my hair coloured.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little bit like coconuts, and it makes your hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> After the very first use of Duffy&#x27;s Shampoo and Conditioniner, my hair felt instantly sofer and was easier to manage and style.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and it does not weigh my hair down!</li>
            <li> First off, it smells great, and secondly it makes my hair feel a lot softer than other hair care products with less \\&quot;original\\&quot; ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, if you&#x27;re debating on getting this because of the price( also the bottle isn&#x27;t the biggest ), I can assure you I&#x27;ve bought Shampoos twice as much as this that didn&#x27;t even get near this products results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a nice change from my regular flowery, froofy shampoos that I have used my entire life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cleans hair OK, but is a bit harsh for my taste.  </li>
            <li> Others I&#x27;ve tried and like better than this:  Crew green mint, Biolage, Nexxus, Paul Mitchell salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few months now and love it.</li>
            <li> The conditioner isn&#x27;t so heavy that it weighs your hair down and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> Was told about this new product by a friend</li>
            <li> So when I ordered new conditioner I lso ordered a bottle of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was using nexus and wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I was able to get about one month of use from this small bottle.  </li>
            <li> It has none of the cheap junk that ruins your hair.</li>
            <li> This is now my official shampoo, the only bummer is not being able to go down the street to a store andjust grab it\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every smoothing shampoo out there with limited success.  </li>
            <li> The only positive thing I&#x27;d say is</li>
            <li> I prefer a certain Australian brand to Duffy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The shampoo is gentle enough for frequent use yet cleans as thoroughly as shampoos with stronger chemicals.</li>
            <li> I opened it and the lid was unscrewed, and even though it was also wrapped in a clear plastic bag it was all over the place.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels wonderfully soft, shiny and bouncy with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Wahhh, that&#x27;s about everything you can get from a professional salon.</li>
            <li> The conditioner makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My fiancee and I both use it every day, we have different hair types but it works very well for both of us.</li>
            <li> A miracle shampoo as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Also, I can say that this Shampoo far surpasses any BS Salon Brand / Recommend.</li>
            <li> Whatever the explanation is (I am no expert), I will stick to natural shampoos from now on and will try to space out washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> You have to try this product if you like natural products.  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t soft and doesn&#x27;t have volume to it or anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive, even though it is a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I mean, my hair didn&#x27;t fall out and as far as I can tell, my color is still ok.</li>
            <li> If your at all curious or just want to do your hair a favor, you should definitely give Duffy&#x27;s Original Beer Shampoo / Conditioner</li>
            <li> A subtle, manly odor that I just love.</li>
            <li> but the price is way too high compared to similar shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I must also add that I lived near Seattle for a few years and became a big fan of the Elysian craft beers while I was there, so I was excited to try their hair product as well.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it live up to it&#x27;s claims</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this stuff is great and giving it a little extra volume and texture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 yrs young, and I have roots which I touchup regularly.</li>
            <li> Another big plus is that it is 100% Natural / Vegan.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of getting my hair washed somewhere professionally before a haircut, those same smells.</li>
            <li> that they wash away entirely the natural oil that the scalp produces.</li>
            <li> Many shampoo products does not help but make it even worse.</li>
            <li> My order just came in today and first I was really surprise about its size: too small!</li>
            <li> I know it sounds funny, but this product keeps the skin on my face hydrated when the previous products I was using were drying the skin under my beard out.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is the price tag attached to such a small amount of product, but for now I am willing and able to pay it.</li>
            <li> First it is a tad bit expensive, the relative worth of it is debatable.</li>
            <li> Body on Tap&amp;#34; used to, but it&#x27;s more of a sweet, almost sickening smell.</li>
            <li> The price was way too much and the volume of the shampoo in the bottle was very little.</li>
            <li> Only con is the price is a little much for other sulfate-free shampoos given the small size of the bottle, but I think it is a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair so soft and shinny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> we even use it when we give our little Maltipoo dog a bath, it makes his fur very soft.</li>
            <li> Smells like vanilla, a little weird but still nice.</li>
            <li> I is awfully high priced for such a small amount to get and not work.</li>
            <li> I have a hair issue that my hair gets greasy and uncomfortable very quickly after each wash.</li>
            <li> THOUGH, only Shampoo &amp; Conditioner I use (other than occasionally Head &amp; Shoulders because of how shiny it can leave your hair if you use it once or twice a week after washing with Duffy&#x27;s.)</li>
            <li> My hair had been doing some strange things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised Amazon carries it now    </li>
            <li> It has a strange coconut smell, but I don&#x27;t care what it smells like.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also attracted to the fact that it&#x27;s not some artificial neon green color and has a more natural approach.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because I&#x27;m very picky about my hair products</li>
            <li> /&gt;As other have stated, the only negatives are the price and amount.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair was dry and almost plasticy feeling after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I actually realized this shampoo is not right for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never colored my hair, but it has been damaged due to using curling iron and/or flat iron</li>
            <li> POLYQUATERNIUM-4, SODIUM METHYL-2, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, and a couple more that are difficult to read due to small print....</li>
            <li> If the seller could cut the price a little bit, then I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pour it down the toilet; I&#x27;ll use it up.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo came out of the part where you push down to open it which made it hard to use in general.</li>
            <li> I used regular shampoo once a few weeks ago because I had slept out, and what a difference.  </li>
            <li> I emailed a few questions to someone at Duffy&#x27;s; not only did he respond, but he gave me a code to use for a 20% discount.  </li>
            <li> I was given Duffy&#x27;s Brew shampoo and conditioner as a gift and at first was a little skeptical because I had been using the same shampoo and conditioner for years.</li>
            <li> It is expensive for such a small bottle, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> I tried duffy&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner the other day</li>
            <li> I do agree with others that it is pretty expensive for what you get.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s does not do anything extra ordinary, maybe because it doesn&#x27;t have any of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; stuff in it.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s scent is unlike any other shampoo or conditioner I&#x27;ve used)</li>
            <li> My long brown hair used to be healthy and thick but years of abuse, backwards brushing, ponytails, hair dye, etc has caused it to thin and become unhealthy..</li>
            <li> Secondly, and mainly, it is not a very strong product.</li>
            <li> Average</li>
            <li> What a let down.  </li>
            <li> Also no flyaways or that weighted down coated feel.  </li>
            <li> It does slightly reduce flakiness.</li>
            <li> Your hair doesn&#x27;t feel like straw, but it does have a little of a &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; feeling, which I find is a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> The scent seemed pretty \\&quot;artificial fragrance-y\\&quot;.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to keep it on my hair for a couple minutes and give my hair a little bit to absorb the nutrients.</li>
            <li> Also I had a little issue with the shipping and their customer service swooped in like a swat team and corrected the issue in no time.    </li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t want to waste it, I tried it again.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think my dandruff got much worse since starting using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My conclusion is it&#x27;s not worthy!</li>
            <li> I think that my hair has become a lot less brittle!</li>
            <li> My hair was not soft or shiny afterwards (at least not more than usual).</li>
            <li> I have long (3 ft.), wavy hair that can be difficult to brush through when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> the past few weeks b/c</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll bring small containers with me when I go for my touchups from now on.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past two weeks and as I guy, I have never been happier with a shampoo.</li>
            <li> so my ends usually feel corse.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, it&#x27;s a small bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was getting bored with the big bottles of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works on all hair types</li>
            <li> Smells like a mixture of vanilla and a dull coconut.</li>
            <li> The bottle is hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda hard to squeeze the bottle with soapy</li>
            <li> at least 2-3 times per week</li>
            <li> I filed a shipping complaint with Amazon but never received a response, so I took it as a loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean smell.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I have fine/dry hair</li>
            <li> and I frequently hate my hair for growing so thick as you can only style it within 1-2 weeks of haircuts or with tons of hair product which I hate using however this work wonders for cleaning those heritages with typically thick hair type and for thoroughly cleaning after having to use tons of product to style because of have such think hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered two sets of shampoo/conditioner from the Duffy&#x27;s Brew website: [...] and my wife and I were totally blown away by it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying a few different shampoos lately, and while this is not the worst, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  </li>
            <li> It was a terrible decision my hair went from being soft and silky to being unmanageable</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of shampoos over the years, but this shampoo is merely average.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> sorry no offense to duffy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad</li>
            <li> B000XTFP0I Nioxin Cleanser, System 2 (Fine/Untreated/Noticeably Thinning ), 33.8 Ounce]]) - contained chemicals that are bad for the hair roots or/and</li>
            <li> Wrong!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ok, not really and you can&#x27;t drink this either.  What a let down.  It does make your scalp feel great though and has a great coconut taste.......I mean smell.  lol.  Just wish the bottle was bigger.  Arouses the senses.</li>
            <li> Though the idea of a shampoo with beer as an ingredient sounds like a gimmick, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product.  Good fragrance and leaves my hair feeling healthy and clean.  Also, I get to support a Seattle company, one of my favorite cities.    Good work Duffy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, but I must say that so far, it is doing wonderful things for my hair!  My hair is so much eaiser to manage,it&#x27;s shinier and seems to have more body.  The conditioner smells great too!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fantastic!  I can&#x27;t say that it really work any better or worse than every other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, but the smell is just great!</li>
            <li> 5 out of 5 \\&quot;This shampoo is growing myhair back. So glad I found it. They sayit smelled greatandboy was everyone else right. It smells like a vanilla almond or maybe coconut. Soo good. This is now my official shampoo, the only bummer is not being able to go down the street to a store andjust grab it\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Duufy&#x27;s Brew has been hands down the best product on my beard! I know it sounds funny, but this product keeps the skin on my face hydrated when the previous products I was using were drying the skin under my beard out.  The conditioner is awesome as well!  I will definitely be re-ordering this product!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and it does not weigh my hair down! Have used the shampoo and conditioner...love them both!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does make my hair feel and smell great.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else.  Thank you Duffy&#x27;s Brew!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found. It makes your hair so clean and it shines. The conditioner isn&#x27;t so heavy that it weighs your hair down and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> My hair feels wonderfully soft, shiny and bouncy with this shampoo.  I used it with a conditioner that comes with my haircolor.  Because my hair is straightened with a keratin blowout, I ordered this particular brand of sulfate free shampoo based on the reviews.  Yes, it&#x27;s pricey and yes, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Duffy&#x27;s! It left my hair soft, shiny and smelling delicious. Two thumbs up! I can&#x27;t wait to see if you guys come up with additional products, I will definitely be buying them!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo based on reviews and I can honestly say I have not found a shampoo that works quite as well as this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair shiny, and even though I haven&#x27;t had my hair coloured in months it brings new life to my hair so much that someone at work asked me if I got my hair coloured.  A couple of weeks later someone else asked the same question!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that is wavy/curly and definitely recommend this product. I look forward to trying the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got 20% off so great deal!</li>
            <li> Smells good, hair nice, not oily or greasy, lather a little lacking, but worth it.  Try it out!  Foo!  Bar!</li>
            <li> More gentle more healing than all the other shampoos I have ever used. It also smells good. I&#x27;d like to keep it on my hair for a couple minutes and give my hair a little bit to absorb the nutrients. My hair feels much softer and easier to manage after a few uses.  Apply some [[ASIN:B0047YYHDQ Original Beer Conditioner - Brewed with Elysian Brewing Company&#x27;s Stout Beer! - 8oz]] after shampooing and steam my hair using [[ASIN:B005M1M8YS Secura Hair and Facial Steamer with Ozone Technology]]. Wahhh, that&#x27;s about everything you can get from a professional salon. Price is a little bit higher than regular shampoo, but think about how much you can save for taking good care of your hair by saving a trip to salon. If the stuff in Pantene, H&amp;S worth $5, then this shampoo worth $50 or more. I will recommend this shampoo for anyone who care about his hair.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how good this conditioner smells, makes me want to wash my hair more often...    My hair looks good too.</li>
            <li> I aim to take great care of my hair, and have used quite a few different products over the last few years, and none have been as good as Duffy&#x27;s Brew.  First off, it smells great, and secondly it makes my hair feel a lot softer than other hair care products with less \\&quot;original\\&quot; ingredients.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The Duffy&#x27;s Brew Shampoo/Conditioner arrived quickly with no hassle. The shampoo is gentle enough for frequent use yet cleans as thoroughly as shampoos with stronger chemicals. The conditioner makes my hair soft and manageable. Both smell wonderful - a bit like caramel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other have stated, the only negatives are the price and amount.</li>
            <li> Worked great until I started coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner on a whim, but I&#x27;ve been using it for several days and it&#x27;s my new favorite! It smells wonderful and it really does leave your hair feeling super clean. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was intrigued because beer is used as one of the ingredients but if you&#x27;re an all natural shopper be aware that their are chemicals in this product... POLYQUATERNIUM-4, SODIUM METHYL-2, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, and a couple more that are difficult to read due to small print....Just thought a product labeled vegan would also be chemical free...</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo and conditioner that I would recommend to anyone with no hesitation!  Smells good and cleans and conditions my hair without leaving buildup.  I&#x27;ve been using Duffy&#x27;s Brew for about a month now, and have gotten several compliments on how healthy my hair looks.  I&#x27;m definitely hooked!</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST shampoo I have ever used.  It smells wonderful, gives lots of body and bounce to hair.  My hair has never looked this good, this products truly lives up to its claims!</li>
            <li> After recommending Duffy&#x27;s to all my friends I figured I&#x27;d review it and give the shampoo all the praise it deserves.This is definitely the best shampoo I have ever used! I&#x27;ve been using Duffy&#x27;s Brew for the past couple of months and can honestly say I will never use another shampoo or conditioner again. I constantly receive compliments on the great smell and my hair looks and feels amazing, so do yourself a favor and pick some up!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, curly, naturally soft hair, just a bit dry, and I&#x27;m always looking for more shine. First thing I noticed about this shampoo is that I absolutely MUST use a conditioner, otherwise my hair becomes wiry and bristly, like cheap doll&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now, and I can&#x27;t see any positive effects. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various other top rated brands of shampoo/conditioner and nothing has been as good as this brand. Smells like vanilla, a little weird but still nice.</li>
            <li> Have used alot of shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners over the years and this hands down is the best stuff I have ever used. My hair is so shiny and soft and I love the beer in it which I think is what makes my hair even healthier. Keep up the great work Duffy&#x27;s Brew.</li>
            <li> We found Duffy&#x27;s Brew at a local Settle farmer&#x27;s market recently. We loved the idea, and the owners were great so we decided to give it a try. WOW! This has quickly become my favorite shampoo. My fiancee and I both use it every day, we have different hair types but it works very well for both of us. We will absolutely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I thought this shampoo would be my holy grail of shampoos. Being a former Seattleite, I was familiar with and fond of Elysian beer, and I like \\&quot;craft\\&quot; shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;  The price is comparable with Bumble and Bumble or Aveda, so I was expecting an exceptional product. I have tried hundreds of shampoos over the years, but this shampoo is merely average.&lt;br /&gt;  Average because: I had to apply conditioner with every use because my hair felt so \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; after washing. My hair was not soft or shiny afterwards (at least not more than usual). The scent seemed pretty \\&quot;artificial fragrance-y\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;  I mean, my hair didn&#x27;t fall out and as far as I can tell, my color is still ok. But the real test for me is that most mornings I find myself reaching for another bottle of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;  Damn, I wish I had purchased a bottle of Bumble and Bumble Seaweed shampoo, instead!!</li>
            <li> After deciding to \\&quot;embrace the gray\\&quot; about three years ago, my hair has gotten dryer and frizzier.  I&#x27;ve tried every smoothing shampoo out there with limited success.  Recently I decided to go sulfate-free and again, have tried many of the varieties on the market.  I tried Duffy&#x27;s Brew and found what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottles of shampoo and conditioner and my hair gets better and better.  My hairdresser even commented last time I had a cut that she has never seen my hair look this good.  It smells good, cleans well, and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I use it with the matching conditioner.  They could make me 100% happy by bringing out a leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li> I tried duffy&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner the other day and I was so happy with the results. My hair had been doing some strange things the past few weeks b/c it&#x27;s in dire need of a trim and has been exposed to all the elements this summer! two washes w/ this and my hair looked great again-no more straggly ends, just beautiful and shiny. now if only it could fix my highlights!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this stuff is great and giving it a little extra volume and texture.  The smell is also very nice.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo itself is as good as any other I have tried. The price was way too much and the volume of the shampoo in the bottle was very little.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my hubby but I use it more than he does.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> I ordered two sets of shampoo/conditioner from the Duffy&#x27;s Brew website: [...] and my wife and I were totally blown away by it. all I can say is that they must use very high quality fragrances in their formula. we are totally hooked on this stuff! we even use it when we give our little Maltipoo dog a bath, it makes his fur very soft. I&#x27;m not surprised Amazon carries it now    PRO&#x27;S: great fragrance, makes your hair soft, silky, smooth, can also be used on pets  CON&#x27;S: highly addictive, ruins you for other shampoos and conditioners</li>
            <li> I started using both the shampoo and conditioner about 2 months ago - first, intermittently, now exclusively!  I have never, ever, gotten compliments on the look of my hair, i.e., wow, your hair is so shiny, or, your hair looks so healthy.  But I do now.  I&#x27;m 55 yrs young, and I have roots which I touchup regularly. I&#x27;ll bring small containers with me when I go for my touchups from now on.  I used regular shampoo once a few weeks ago because I had slept out, and what a difference.  My hair felt coarse and not as bouncey when I styled it.  Don&#x27;t hesitate trying these products. And they smell great, too.  I emailed a few questions to someone at Duffy&#x27;s; not only did he respond, but he gave me a code to use for a 20% discount.  Now that&#x27;s what I call customer service!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells good and cleans well but the price is way too high compared to similar shampoos.  Don&#x27;t know if I would purchase this product again for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m embarrassed by the amount of money I&#x27;ve spent over the years in a futile search for the perfect shampoo for my fine, wavy hair, and I thought Duffy&#x27;s Beer Shampoo would be just one more to add to the shelf with my other failures.  Wrong!!  This stuff really works.  After using the shampoo alone - no conditioner or gels - and blow drying, my hair was fuller, shinier and more manageable than I&#x27;ve ever experienced with any other product.  Also no flyaways or that weighted down coated feel.  A miracle shampoo as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past two weeks and as I guy, I have never been happier with a shampoo. It&#x27;s hard to decide from the fifty different shampoo and conditioners my wife has lined up in our shower, so I went searching for the perfect shampoo and conditioner on Amazon, and this was it!   This keeps my hair how it normally looks and makes it smell great! I&#x27;m also attracted to the fact that it&#x27;s not some artificial neon green color and has a more natural approach. Great shampoo and conditioner!   Also I had a little issue with the shipping and their customer service swooped in like a swat team and corrected the issue in no time.    I&#x27;m officially a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I have long (3 ft.), wavy hair that can be difficult to brush through when it&#x27;s wet.  The Duffy&#x27;s Brew shampoo and conditioner make my hair easy to brush.  That alone would be worth it, but it also smells great, looks great and feels great to boot!  Thank you Duffy&#x27;s Brew!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Duffy&#x27;s Brew shampoo and conditioner. Not only does it smell amazing but it makes my hair look great too. I was a little skeptical at first because I&#x27;m very picky about my hair products but since so many of my friends recommended it to me, I thought I would give it a try. It immediately made my hair shiny, smooth and soft. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 days now, and I felt the difference from the very first use. I am not crazy about \\&quot;beer\\&quot; products, but a friend of mine have been using it and she recommended I try it. I am very thankful she did. I&#x27;ve never colored my hair, but it has been damaged due to using curling iron and/or flat iron at least 2-3 times per week so my ends usually feel corse. After the very first use of Duffy&#x27;s Shampoo and Conditioniner, my hair felt instantly sofer and was easier to manage and style. I&#x27;ll be buying this product on regular basis for sure.</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo as a gift from a friend because I am such a beer fan. Turns out even my hair appreciates beer! It&#x27;s such a nice change from my regular flowery, froofy shampoos that I have used my entire life. The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming either. Frankly, my boyfriend has complimented me many times on how great it makes my hair smell. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasant-smelling shampoo.  I can&#x27;t exactly label it, but it reminds me of almond and coconut.  Another plus is that the product is animal friendly (vegan).  I was happy to find out that using this shampoo while having some small nicks and cuts on my hands produced no stinging at all.  My last shampoo qualified as mild torture in that regard, but the Duffy&#x27;s Brew is wonderful.  And on top of all that, it&#x27;s simply a good shampoo.  There will be more Duffy&#x27;s Brew in my future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and I actually realized this shampoo is not right for me.  As other reviews said, the smell of shampoo is very unique and attractive. It smells like decent sweet caramel. I really enjoyed how it smells. But that&#x27;s all. I haven&#x27;t realized during the first two weeks but my hair got so itchy and gave me lots of dandruff.  This product is also a bit pricey for tiny bottle. My conclusion is it&#x27;s not worthy!</li>
            <li> Hot Damn!   This is the BEST Shampoo / Conditioner I have ever used, period. Not only does it live up to it&#x27;s claims, it is also from a favorite Brewery of from my stomping grounds in Seattle, WA. Another big plus is that it is 100% Natural / Vegan. So, your not putting unwanted chemicals in your hair. Also, I can say that this Shampoo far surpasses any BS Salon Brand / Recommend. If your at all curious or just want to do your hair a favor, you should definitely give Duffy&#x27;s Original Beer Shampoo / Conditioner a try. It&#x27;s worth the money. *In my case, I received the BEST customer service ever from Sean. He definitely went above and beyond- I will keep coming back for sure!</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift, never would have bought it on my own.. but because it was given to me, I gave it a try.  My long brown hair used to be healthy and thick but years of abuse, backwards brushing, ponytails, hair dye, etc has caused it to thin and become unhealthy.. I&#x27;ve been struggling to improve the health of my hair for 2 -3 years now, and had given up... In just 3 days of using this shampoo/conditioner, my hair is NOTICEABLY healthier.. It feels thicker already, I&#x27;m not kidding. I will continue to use this product.. and recommend you give it a shot yourself.</li>
            <li> First off, I just want to say that I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell.  And if the smell is the best thing about this product, you will be sorely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans hair OK, but is a bit harsh for my taste.  Your hair doesn&#x27;t feel like straw, but it does have a little of a &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; feeling, which I find is a bad thing.  I prefer a shampoo a little more gentle.  You end up having to use a lot of other products more often to compensate for added harshness of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying a few different shampoos lately, and while this is not the worst, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  It&#x27;s not so bad I&#x27;d pour it down the toilet; I&#x27;ll use it up.  Thankfully, it&#x27;s a small bottle.  I do agree with others that it is pretty expensive for what you get.  Others I&#x27;ve tried and like better than this:  Crew green mint, Biolage, Nexxus, Paul Mitchell salon.</li>
            <li> I was getting bored with the big bottles of [[ASIN:B000GG0NT6 American Crew Daily Moisturizing Shampoo, 33.8-Ounce Bottle, Package may vary]] i&#x27;d use and decided to try something different.  It&#x27;s expensive, but it smells amazing and seems to do a great job with my dry hair that I barely put any thought into.    It reminds me of getting my hair washed somewhere professionally before a haircut, those same smells.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo. It makes my hair feel healthy and clean. It does slightly reduce flakiness. About making it more shiny and reducing frizz, it hasn&#x27;t helped me in that area all that much.</li>
            <li> This smells very pleasant and shampoo feels mild. But it&#x27;s does not do anything extra ordinary, maybe because it doesn&#x27;t have any of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; stuff in it.  Nice, but not 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Was told about this new product by a friend and wow I was impressed.! I recently grew out my hair and have since been struggling with split ends, lack of body, dryness, etc. and this has brought the luster back! try it out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few months now and love it. It leaves your hair so soft and shinny without weighing it down.I was using a rather expensive organic shampoo before trying Duffy&#x27;s, but Duffy&#x27;s is so much better. My hair has never been so healthy. I&#x27;m ordering some for my daughter because she loved using it at my house on a recent visit. Thanks for the great product, Duffy&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first. I thought that my hair didn&#x27;t feel completely clean. I passed it to my (teen) children who didn&#x27;t like it either. Since I didn&#x27;t want to waste it, I tried it again. This time, I applied it twice and used more. Nice results. I kept on using it and realized that my hair was shinier and that I had stopped losing it in abnormal quantities since using it 4 weeks ago. I suspect that the shampoos I was using before, including the one made to fight hair loss - [[ASIN:B000XTFP0I Nioxin Cleanser, System 2 (Fine/Untreated/Noticeably Thinning ), 33.8 Ounce]]) - contained chemicals that are bad for the hair roots or/and that they wash away entirely the natural oil that the scalp produces. Whatever the explanation is (I am no expert), I will stick to natural shampoos from now on and will try to space out washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/28/12: Losing hair again... I am looking for yet another shampoo. Maybe because it&#x27;s actually not chemical-free.</li>
            <li> My order just came in today and first I was really surprise about its size: too small! After trying out, I feel much better about this product.   I have a hair issue that my hair gets greasy and uncomfortable very quickly after each wash. Many shampoo products does not help but make it even worse. However, this one seem to be the solution for my issue. So far I am feeling much better after I use it this afternoon.  It suppose to be a five-star product based on it quality, however with that price I could only give four, top. If the seller could cut the price a little bit, then I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I was able to get about one month of use from this small bottle.  Overall, I really liked how it made my hair feel and the reduce dryness I was experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will strongly keep in mind for future purchases.  Only con is the price is a little much for other sulfate-free shampoos given the small size of the bottle, but I think it is a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY ADORE this shampoo!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its light and airy, not too much foam or soapiness and washes off very easily and fast with no oiliness. A definite plus that there are no chemicals in this shampoo which i did not realize until i received it- its Paraben, Sulfate, and Phthalate free! But my ultimate favorite thing about this shampoo is the smell...It literally smells like coconut!!! It makes me feel like on i&#x27;m vacation once i close my eyes and lather my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering more and don&#x27;t plan on using anything else for a while! I definitely recommended this if you want something light and extremely refreshing..And if you are in need of a vacation start with this, its definitely cheaper than an airfare ticket!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this was just an issue with my bottle but the information needs to be available. We have been using the beer conditioner for a while and just knew if we added the shampoo to our hair care steps it would be awesome. So when I ordered new conditioner I lso ordered a bottle of the shampoo. There were two issues with the shampoo that we had. One was our hair was left unclean when we used the shampoo. I tried for two days with no luck. Another thing was the cap on the bottle. The shampoo came out of the part where you push down to open it which made it hard to use in general. I did send it back and was given a full refund however, I am scared to try it again. I is awfully high priced for such a small amount to get and not work. It does smell great though and the conditioner is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a mild aroma. It makes my hair look thicker. It does not contain anything that will consition your hair. You must buy a separate conditioner. This is just a shampoo which cleans your hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so so...i really miss the &#x27;body on tap&#x27; shampoo that is now discontinued.  sorry no offense to duffy&#x27;s.  thanks</li>
            <li> I am picky about the shampoos I use and I research the ingredients first to make sure they are natural.  I have a chronic itchy scalp condition and I can tell right away which shampoos are not going to work for me.  This one passes my test.  My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and my hair feels clean without build-up.  It has a strange coconut smell, but I don&#x27;t care what it smells like.  It is expensive for such a small bottle, but worth it.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that beer possesses components that help make or keep hair healthy. This shampoo lathers well, seems to clean my hair, but after 10 applications I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special; certainly nothing to justify the high price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way this smells... but thats about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair was dry and almost plasticy feeling after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He switched back to a drugstore brand he likes, or Woody&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Cleans my hair well.  It does not have paraben or sulfate and phthalates, no artificial colors and is NOT tested on animals.  Wish they made conditioner.</li>
            <li> Got my first bottle of the shampoo in the mail last week and have been very impressed. It&#x27;s been great for my hair (I&#x27;ve found it does a great job of controlling my oilier than normal hair) and it smells great. The sent reminds me a lot of the beach, a mix of coconut oil and beach smell. I love it!</li>
            <li> I went with this shampoo and conditioner because I was looking for something gentle with no added sulfates and a good scent.  Duffy&#x27;s is great all around and covers all those bases.  I must also add that I lived near Seattle for a few years and became a big fan of the Elysian craft beers while I was there, so I was excited to try their hair product as well.  The only negative is the price tag attached to such a small amount of product, but for now I am willing and able to pay it.</li>
            <li> Discovered beer shampoo in a Korean supermarket. The lady said it works great at getting deep and cleaning those with thicker hair types. (Asian, Native American, Asian Indian, Middle&lt;br /&gt;Eastern, etc...) I&#x27;m personally or Asian Indian heritage and I frequently hate my hair for growing so thick as you can only style it within 1-2 weeks of haircuts or with tons of hair product which I hate using however this work wonders for cleaning those heritages with typically thick hair type and for thoroughly cleaning after having to use tons of product to style because of have such think hair. I prefer a certain Australian brand to Duffy&#x27;s but it&#x27;s so rare to find and when you do, costs a fortune to ship a tiny bottle to the US. I LOVE THIS STUFF THOUGH, only Shampoo &amp; Conditioner I use (other than occasionally Head &amp; Shoulders because of how shiny it can leave your hair if you use it once or twice a week after washing with Duffy&#x27;s.)</li>
            <li> Smells like a mixture of vanilla and a dull coconut. I don&#x27;t like coconut but this smell is quite good. Very good shampoo. Cleans really well and leaves a good subtle smell.&lt;br /&gt;2 things I don&#x27;t like, the price and the bottle. It&#x27;s too expensive, even though it is a good shampoo. And the bottle is tiny. The bottle is hard. It&#x27;s kinda hard to squeeze the bottle with soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again if it wasn&#x27;t such a tiny bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I lovvvvvvvvveeeeeeeee this shampoo it smells great sulfate free and I think is making my hair shiny .. I wish they made a bigger one .. I&#x27;m gonna purchase another one soon</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference when switching from a generic shampoo to this guy. It has none of the cheap junk that ruins your hair. Truly it is made from the best ingredient: beer (haha) plus other healthy things. It&#x27;s second great quality is it&#x27;s smell. A subtle, manly odor that I just love. Women compliment me on it often. There are two downsides to this shampoo, however. First it is a tad bit expensive, the relative worth of it is debatable. Secondly, and mainly, it is not a very strong product. It takes a lot of work to get out gels and other products, and, most importantly, it does not fight dandruff (at all). In fact, I think my dandruff got much worse since starting using this shampoo. If dandruff is not a problem for you, I say go for it, for I have really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.. smells wonderful and definitely makes my hair feel more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; (if that makes any sense).. I just ordered their ESB shampoo as well for when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just okay. Claims it&#x27;s sulfate free but I have my doubts as when I use it I sometimes get scalp irritation.  Wish it smelled more like &amp;#34; Body on Tap&amp;#34; used to, but it&#x27;s more of a sweet, almost sickening smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my boyfriend, and he loves it! It smells a little bit like coconuts, and it makes your hair very smooth. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I was given Duffy&#x27;s Brew shampoo and conditioner as a gift and at first was a little skeptical because I had been using the same shampoo and conditioner for years. I am so glad that I tried this stuff out because it does so much good for my hair. After one use my hair felt soft and silky and was manageable not to mention it made it smell great (it&#x27;s scent is unlike any other shampoo or conditioner I&#x27;ve used) After using it for a week I noticed a difference in the luster of my hair and after about a month I think that my hair has become a lot less brittle! I love this stuff and I&#x27;ve even given it to friends with different hair types and they can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff either!</li>
            <li> You have to try this product if you like natural products.  I just used it and I can&#x27;t believe how good my hair feels.  The smell is outstanding and it doesn&#x27;t take very much to lather up you hair.  This is a must buy for people concerned with the chemicals we are bathing with on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> When I got the envelope it was leaking out of the corners.  I opened it and the lid was unscrewed, and even though it was also wrapped in a clear plastic bag it was all over the place.  It smelled good, but there was no way to salvage it so I threw it away.  I don&#x27;t plan to buy it again, but the product seemed like it had potential.  I filed a shipping complaint with Amazon but never received a response, so I took it as a loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I&#x27;m using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap, the liquid kind, and it works well.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about getting this since it had great reviews but I have no idea how it did. I was using nexus and wanted to try something new. It was a terrible decision my hair went from being soft and silky to being unmanageable I&#x27;m constantly finding tons of hair in the tub and brush. I used to brush my hair once in the morning and it was great all day now a few minutes later its tangled again. My hair isn&#x27;t soft and doesn&#x27;t have volume to it or anything. I would save your money and buy something else. The only positive thing I&#x27;d say is it smelled nice.</li>
            <li> First time I got this on Amazon, the price here is cheaper then on their website. Regardless, I been using this for about 2 months and its amazing. Seriously, I have fine/dry hair and this product gave it volume and a beautiful shine. I have to note for men, women love the smell of this thing. I like it myself but women seem to love it. I get complemented on it about once a week, which is 1 more a week then before... haha Anyway, if you&#x27;re debating on getting this because of the price( also the bottle isn&#x27;t the biggest ), I can assure you I&#x27;ve bought Shampoos twice as much as this that didn&#x27;t even get near this products results. Not sure if it works on all hair types but I think giving this a try is a great idea, A+!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s- I know it&#x27;s beer Shampoo but ummmm ya don&#x27;t drink it... haha</li>
