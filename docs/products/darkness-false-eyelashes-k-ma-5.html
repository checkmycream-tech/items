            <li>I love these lashes.  </li>
            <li>Many suggested this brand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve become my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have extremely short lashes and these blend in perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love them and will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li>They fit my eyes perfectly and are much lighter and more comfortable than others I have worn.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount to make your eyes look stunning!</li>
            <li>I just wash the first pair and restick it in the tray; the tray has super strong glue that the ends of the lashes stick very well onto, so they retain their curve shape perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Personally it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for, but it would be perfect for someone with lighter eyelashes who want that nice natural look.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan and will continue with this brand of lashes.</li>
            <li>These kma5&#x27;s are perfect for everyday, and evenings out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 3-10-13:</li>
            <li>cheap drugstore lashes)</li>
            <li>They blend in nicely with my real lashes and make my eyes look bright-eyed and &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>They look so natural and cute my friend that they where my real eyeleshes lol</li>
            <li>i loved it, looks so natural, feels so comfortable,&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are very natural looking and very cute.</li>
            <li>love it so much!</li>
            <li>I tried many of the popular brands like Ardell, Red Cherry, etc.  </li>
            <li>I was honestly surprised at how nice they look on.</li>
            <li>they are very natural looking and very easy to apply too.</li>
            <li>Luckily there is YouTube.  </li>
            <li>These are my new favorite falsies.</li>
            <li>It is so pretty!</li>
            <li>these lashes are great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>but i wanted to have flare to my lashes and still look quite natrual and it most defintely did ,so if natural is what your going for with a flare</li>
            <li>No cutting the eyelashes anymore.  </li>
            <li>They also look more natural.  </li>
            <li>These arrived yesterday, super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>I thought that my lashes weren&#x27;t set right.</li>
            <li>i already have nice long lashes</li>
            <li>Still I like these better than American lashes, because the don&#x27;t lose their curl when I wash them.  </li>
            <li>is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several variety of Darkness Eyelashes, but this one takes the cake!! :)</li>
            <li>Love this brand will definitely buy from this brand again.</li>
            <li>I really like these!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already bought them twice and will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>Very recommended!</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>I think I have tried several types and these are the easiest to put on and looks natural and really nice on.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel very heavy on your eyes too, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>she said she knows my real eye lashes but what I was using really looked real.</li>
            <li>they stand really really close to me..</li>
            <li>but I just gave them to my 13 year old daughter for fun.</li>
            <li>but they really are.</li>
            <li>Other than that I guess they are ok</li>
            <li>I used my own cheap glue because it was already open, but these come with black and clear glue.</li>
            <li>These are great for cheap asian false lashes!</li>
            <li>At first glance, these eyelashes don&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;d be natural looking</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re beautiful and give fullness plus added length without looking fake.</li>
            <li>I like these more than the K-ma 4 (which are half strips).</li>
            <li>I will try different style next time! :)</li>
            <li>So, needless to say, I love these and will purchase more of this brand.</li>
            <li>They can be tricky to apply if you&#x27;re new to this sort of thing like me, but they look beautiful once they&#x27;re on and won&#x27;t attract the wrong sort of attention.</li>
            <li>Also, the strip is nice and black making mistakes look smaller than they really are.      </li>
            <li>My real lashes stick easily with the yellow glue on ( don&#x27;t use the white one</li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite lashes, they last long, and they look very very natural on my eyes.</li>
            <li>These in particular look fairly natural.</li>
            <li>In reality, they look very natural once you put them on.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking falsies.</li>
            <li>She said she wondered how my I got my eyelashes so pretty and thought it was because I brushed them out and curled them.</li>
            <li>These, and many other Darkness lashes are the only lashes I can pop on without any fuss, no trimming involved.</li>
            <li>Best false eyelashes ever!!!</li>
            <li>They are very durable too as I have really been rough with these things trying to get them cleaned of with moist towelettes, and both pairs are still like new.</li>
            <li>So natural that my mom didn&#x27;t even know I had them on until I told her</li>
            <li>These lashes are natural looking and works well for the almond shaped eyes.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a more subtle look then I recommend going with these.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend these to anyone going for either a natural girl-next-door look or something for fiery (depending on how you do your make-up)!</li>
            <li>It looks natural and my face looks different after wearing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wished the directions in general but specially, those ones about the two little tubes where in english, but since there is a tutorial on these in youtube, actually there is no problem.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear false eyelashes all the time, so I haven&#x27;t worn these in forever, but they really are better than all the other brands I&#x27;ve tried from beauty stores and drug stores.</li>
            <li>The only thing i will do is trim the inside corner just a little, and that is just a personal preference, i don&#x27;t like have a full eyelash all the way across, i always trim them to about 3/4 of the length.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another lash, except for when I&#x27;m going for a darker, more dramatic look.</li>
            <li>Not too much lash and not too little.</li>

            <li> Not too much lash and not too little.</li>
            <li> I love these false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> The band is very thin on these (though not the thinnest, it is thinner than most of what you&#x27;ll find at the drug store).</li>
            <li> , Sephora and other brand name lashes and none of them were as natural looking at these ones.  </li>
            <li> I cut mine down, but these looked very natural on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to false lashes and so far I had gotten complement of it looking natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and have small eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am a beginner when it comes to false lashes and these were so easy to use, it wasn&#x27;t as hard as I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of $$ on Makeup Forever</li>
            <li> they look dramatic in the box, but are really work-friendly.</li>
            <li> Since I have small Asian like monolid eyes</li>
            <li> These are not over-the-top like some falsies that just give it away immediately that you&#x27;re wearing fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I naturally have relatively thick eyelashes, but sometimes I like a little boost.</li>
            <li> They look very natural, not too long that they look like I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> While I would never call false eyelashes &#x27;natural looking&#x27;</li>
            <li> I HATE false eyelashes that are bluntly cut (like Red Cherry and most - but not all-  </li>
            <li> Even my sis-in-law who only asked me if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes coz</li>

            <li> Love these lashes.  Glad I found them.</li>
            <li> i already have nice long lashes but i wanted to have flare to my lashes and still look quite natrual and it most defintely did ,so if natural is what your going for with a flare then this your product.and came in time.</li>
            <li> The lashes themselves are beautiful but I wish it had a thinner band.</li>
            <li> Okay, so they look a bit frightening.  In reality, they look very natural once you put them on.  Dab a bit of mascara on the tips and pow!  Hey, beautiful!  I&#x27;ll admit, they took a bit of getting used to.  Still I like these better than American lashes, because the don&#x27;t lose their curl when I wash them.  Also, the strip is nice and black making mistakes look smaller than they really are.      -The Mrs.</li>
            <li> the quality is very nice and they&#x27;re exactly what I was looking for.  great price and very fast shipment.</li>
            <li> this is the second time i order this. So far this is my favorite lashes, they last long, and they look very very natural on my eyes. it gives my eyes a different look, but no one could tell that im wearing them untill they stand really really close to me..lol.</li>
            <li> These r just the best eyelashes there is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several variety of Darkness Eyelashes, but this one takes the cake!! :)</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite falsies. I can&#x27;t believe how beautiful and light they look on, and how durable. I can wash them and they&#x27;re still good to go. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another lash, except for when I&#x27;m going for a darker, more dramatic look. These kma5&#x27;s are perfect for everyday, and evenings out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 3-10-13: It&#x27;s almost been 2 years now and I STILL have these and STILL love them! You get 2 pairs in the package and I haven&#x27;t even used the second pair yet! I just wash the first pair and restick it in the tray; the tray has super strong glue that the ends of the lashes stick very well onto, so they retain their curve shape perfectly. If you were wondering about the durability of these lashes, they last for years! ^_^</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t like them, it&#x27;s that I never wore false lashes before and it felt horrible. I&#x27;m guessing it would take some getting used to but I just gave them to my 13 year old daughter for fun. Other than that I guess they are ok but then again I have nothing to compare them to.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best, and most comfortable eye lashes I have ever worn. While I would never call false eyelashes &#x27;natural looking&#x27; these are not overly dramatic for daytime. They fit my eyes perfectly and are much lighter and more comfortable than others I have worn. The band is very thin on these (though not the thinnest, it is thinner than most of what you&#x27;ll find at the drug store). Likewise - the lashes are properly tapered! I HATE false eyelashes that are bluntly cut (like Red Cherry and most - but not all-  cheap drugstore lashes) because I think they look extra fake. These are awesome. I used my own cheap glue because it was already open, but these come with black and clear glue. Love this brand will definitely buy from this brand again.</li>
            <li> Looks really natural when put on, so if you are looking for longer lashes then this may not be the  best one to buy.  If you are looking for a more subtle look then I recommend going with these.  They are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> works perfectly on my eyes, best eyelashes ever. love it so much! I will try different style next time! :)</li>
            <li> These arrived yesterday, super fast shipping!  I am wearing them today and i love them.  They look very natural, not too long that they look like I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes.  The only thing i will do is trim the inside corner just a little, and that is just a personal preference, i don&#x27;t like have a full eyelash all the way across, i always trim them to about 3/4 of the length.  Great product!  i will purchase again when i need to.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes.  I&#x27;m African American and have small eyes.  I was about to give up on finding fake eyelashes.  They were always too big.  Too fake looking.  I tried many of the popular brands like Ardell, Red Cherry, etc.  They looked horrible on me.  Luckily there is YouTube.  I watch all the  beauty gurus.  Since I have small Asian like monolid eyes I had a eureka moment and decided to see what the Asian beauty gurus use when they want to put on fake eyelashes.  Many suggested this brand.  So off too Amazon I went to order them.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  These fit perfect.  No cutting the eyelashes anymore.  They also look more natural.  Love these!</li>
            <li> Reusable. It included the glue as well. I&#x27;m new to false lashes and so far I had gotten complement of it looking natural. Even my sis-in-law who only asked me if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes coz she said she knows my real eye lashes but what I was using really looked real. She is thinking of buying one.</li>
            <li> They hurt the corner of my eyes. Also, these lashes doesnt flare upwards but actually goes downwards... So weird. I have to curl them and stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like these! The glue is great, too. I cut mine down, but these looked very natural on me. So natural that my mom didn&#x27;t even know I had them on until I told her I thought that my lashes weren&#x27;t set right. She said she wondered how my I got my eyelashes so pretty and thought it was because I brushed them out and curled them. So, needless to say, I love these and will purchase more of this brand. It comes with two tubes of glue, too, which is great. I don&#x27;t wear false eyelashes all the time, so I haven&#x27;t worn these in forever, but they really are better than all the other brands I&#x27;ve tried from beauty stores and drug stores.</li>
            <li> Good for beginners I think I have tried several types and these are the easiest to put on and looks natural and really nice on.</li>
            <li> Best false eyelashes ever!!!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! They blend in nicely with my real lashes and make my eyes look bright-eyed and &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;. The have a lovely feel to them which translates well when you&#x27;re wearing them! Included are two sample things of glue that work well so you don&#x27;t even have to buy your own! Not overly priced, shipped on time, includes free samples, and look beautiful! I definitely recommend these to anyone going for either a natural girl-next-door look or something for fiery (depending on how you do your make-up)! I will buy from this seller again too! Perfect purchase!</li>
            <li> I naturally have relatively thick eyelashes, but sometimes I like a little boost. These are very natural looking and very cute. Personally it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for, but it would be perfect for someone with lighter eyelashes who want that nice natural look.</li>
            <li> At first glance, these eyelashes don&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;d be natural looking but they really are. They&#x27;re beautiful and give fullness plus added length without looking fake. I was honestly surprised at how nice they look on. They&#x27;ve become my favorite. I&#x27;ve already bought them twice and will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> The flares at the ends are very sexy. These lashes are natural looking and works well for the almond shaped eyes. I like these more than the K-ma 4 (which are half strips).</li>
            <li> It is so pretty! My real lashes stick easily with the yellow glue on ( don&#x27;t use the white one, it&#x27;s not sticky enough). It is so easy to use. It looks natural and my face looks different after wearing it.</li>
            <li> Great lashes! I am a beginner when it comes to false lashes and these were so easy to use, it wasn&#x27;t as hard as I expected. They look great on and lasted all day. I am a huge fan and will continue with this brand of lashes. They look great and are a breeze to use.</li>
            <li> These are great for cheap asian false lashes! I&#x27;ve wished the directions in general but specially, those ones about the two little tubes where in english, but since there is a tutorial on these in youtube, actually there is no problem. Very recommended!</li>
            <li> I have monolids (also called hooded eyes) so applying false eyelashes can be tricky. These, and many other Darkness lashes are the only lashes I can pop on without any fuss, no trimming involved. These in particular look fairly natural.</li>
            <li> i loved it, looks so natural, feels so comfortable,&lt;br /&gt;dont be scared. they look much smaller and nicer when you actually see them.&lt;br /&gt;just try and you will see what i&#x27;m talking about</li>
            <li> These are not over-the-top like some falsies that just give it away immediately that you&#x27;re wearing fake eyelashes. They can be tricky to apply if you&#x27;re new to this sort of thing like me, but they look beautiful once they&#x27;re on and won&#x27;t attract the wrong sort of attention. You can apply mascara to them or not, they look great either way. They are very durable too as I have really been rough with these things trying to get them cleaned of with moist towelettes, and both pairs are still like new.</li>
            <li> So pretty. Not too much lash and not too little. Just the right amount to make your eyes look stunning!</li>
            <li> Very natural looking falsies. I have extremely short lashes and these blend in perfectly. I don&#x27;t recommend the glue that comes with it or using mascara to blend these into your lashes.</li>
            <li> the yellow-capped glue is the best. these lashes are great for everyday use. they look dramatic in the box, but are really work-friendly.</li>
            <li> They look so natural and cute my friend that they where my real eyeleshes lol</li>
            <li> I love these false eyelashes! they are very natural looking and very easy to apply too. It didn&#x27;t feel very heavy on your eyes too, which is a good thing. I will continue to purchase this in the future</li>
            <li> These are the best lashes I&#x27;ve tried so far.  I&#x27;ve spent lots of $$ on Makeup Forever, Sephora and other brand name lashes and none of them were as natural looking at these ones.  They enhance my lashes without looking too fake.  Love them and will buy more for sure.</li>
