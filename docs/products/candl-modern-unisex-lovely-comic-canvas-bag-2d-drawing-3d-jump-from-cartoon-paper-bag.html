            <li>Really cute purse, but the chemical smell is really strong.</li>
            <li>Product quality is very good and is spacious enough to carry your stuff even a book.</li>
            <li>This is a good product but the oder was too much for me, I gave mine away.</li>
            <li>problem is that the smell of chemicals is so strong that it makes the product unusable.</li>

            <li>If you need to carry a huge amount of stuff</li>

            <li>I can still fit quite a bit of stuff inside even though it&#x27;s slim.</li>

            <li>Looked exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li>Of course they had an original Jump from Paper at most likely $100 or so.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 different syles for me and my 2 teenage daughters and they are all great.</li>
            <li>I first saw one shown in Elle fashion magazine being carried by someone in the artsy crowd.  </li>
            <li>Exactly the size it said.</li>
            <li>It holds much more than it looks like it would, for a flat bag is it quite roomy!</li>
            <li>Its a very playful design.</li>
            <li>LOOKS JUST LIKE A CARTOON FOR REAL.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy canvas material.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t put much in it, but it&#x27;s novel</li>
            <li>and I always get comments on how much other people love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not TOP quality, but it&#x27;s a cute bag!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get more pieces like the back pack or tiny tote.&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of space inside but enough for I pad, folders, wallet and stuffs.</li>
            <li>Her 15 year old son asked her &amp;#34;And</li>
            <li>I mean for it not being authentic</li>
            <li>It came flat, no creases in it, and I didn&#x27;t really notice a chemical smell.</li>

            <li> big bag! doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of space inside but enough for I pad, folders, wallet and stuffs. looks great though</li>
            <li> Honestly nothing fits comfortable and it stated unraveling the day I got it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with service and item.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite bag. I receive so many compliments for it! It holds much more than it looks like it would, for a flat bag is it quite roomy!</li>
            <li> Really cute purse, but the chemical smell is really strong. I&#x27;ve had he purse for a couple months and it&#x27;s still pretty strong.</li>
            <li> Great my daughter love it</li>
            <li> I mean for it not being authentic it&#x27;s okay but the in side it okay , it a bit to stif  but it&#x27;s not a original from jump from paper</li>
            <li> The quality is okay for the price I got and the item looks like the pictured showed. Colors matched as well.</li>
            <li> Its a very playful design. You cant overfill and have the bag loose shape or the cartoon effect wont work. Its a thin bag.</li>
            <li> Looks just as pictured, actually much larger than I thought it would be. I use it to carry a spare set of clothes, it&#x27;s too big for me to use as a purse. It came flat, no creases in it, and I didn&#x27;t really notice a chemical smell. Maybe a faint odor, but nothing I had to air out or anything.</li>
            <li> the item I received didnt look like the one pictured at all.</li>
            <li> FOLKS STOP MY WIFE EVERYDAY ALL DAY ASKING HER ABOUT THIS PURSE. LOOKS JUST LIKE A CARTOON FOR REAL. NO BS. WE PLAN ON BUYING EVERY KIND. SUPER DOPE.</li>
            <li> This bag is just fun!  I first saw one shown in Elle fashion magazine being carried by someone in the artsy crowd.  Of course they had an original Jump from Paper at most likely $100 or so. I am happy with my $16 knock off. Just hang it outside to air out a couple of days because of a chemical smell and it does ship from China, so it took awhile.  But I am really happy with it, bought one in blue for my girlfriend. Her 15 year old son asked her &amp;#34;And why do you want to carry Marge Simpsons purse?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I wish the opening was a litle deeper, not just a slot type</li>
            <li> Super cute bag. Exactly the size it said. I get complements all the time on this bag!</li>
            <li> This is a good product but the oder was too much for me, I gave mine away. This came to me folded in half and it was really hard to make it look flat again.</li>
            <li> The threading on the bag came out as soon as my wift opened it. This was one of her bday presents...so embarrassing!!!</li>
            <li> problem is that the smell of chemicals is so strong that it makes the product unusable. I have tried everything and whatever they put in it for shipping from china kills the deal...unfortunately I bought several and I am stuck with them all....</li>
            <li> I love this bag!  I&#x27;ll start with that.  It holds everything I need to carry with me on a daily basis and I always get comments on how much other people love it.  If you need to carry a huge amount of stuff this isn&#x27;t the bag for you though.</li>
            <li> Omg It&#x27;s just too cute I love it, don&#x27;t have too much more to say I just luv it omg</li>
            <li> Looked exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li> Very cool bag! Very sturdy canvas material. I get stopped everywhere I go!! I can still fit quite a bit of stuff inside even though it&#x27;s slim.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. I bought 3 different syles for me and my 2 teenage daughters and they are all great. Well made and shipped quickly. I wish I had ordered more for gifts. Everyone who sees them loves them.</li>
            <li> Got it today it&#x27;s really cute looks well made</li>
            <li> very nice bag it come fusing your eye and quality Very very Good not very strong ، shipping almost in two weeks or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry about any mistakes in my spilling and thanks for you</li>
            <li> Product quality is very good and is spacious enough to carry your stuff even a book.</li>
            <li> I love it! You can&#x27;t put much in it, but it&#x27;s novel and I probably won&#x27;t use it enough to wear it out. It&#x27;s not TOP quality, but it&#x27;s a cute bag! (and it only cost 14 bucks so I&#x27;m not expecting much, lol). Can&#x27;t wait to get more pieces like the back pack or tiny tote.&amp;#60;3</li>
