            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I will say though that I like the feel of the cream on my hands much better than the lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>It is OK, but I still prefer Glysomed cream.</li>
            <li>Product works excellent for dry itchy skin</li>
            <li>Excellent cream for dry, scaly skin.  </li>
            <li>It meets the need just fine and arrived as promised.</li>
            <li>Smooth heels are easy with this cream.  </li>
            <li>Originally prescribed for me by my dermatologist.</li>

            <li>Now that it&#x27;s over the counter and no longer a prescription, this was the first time getting it commercially.  </li>
            <li>If you apply this lotion after using an electric callous remover, your heels will stay soft for days!</li>
            <li>and when I think of all the money I have spent on products did not work, this is truly inexpensive because it works and it works quickly.</li>
            <li>The thin skin on the back of my hands stays in much better shape with regular use of the product.</li>
            <li>While I use this primarily for dry, cracked fingers, particularly right at the fingernail, I&#x27;ve discovered that, at least for me, ANY small wound heals faster when this lotion is applied.</li>

            <li> very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;The tube is very stiff which makes it difficult to squeeze out the last of the cream.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and still love it.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC! If you have dry scaly hands, this will fix that up after only one application. I would recommend this to anyone. For years when it got to be 60 degrees outside my hands would begin to get the little tiny splits or cracks in them which are really painful.This cream stopped it all. AQs soon as I began using it I have never had a problem again.    One may think it is expensive but it goes a long way and when I think of all the money I have spent on products did not work, this is truly inexpensive because it works and it works quickly. Don&#x27;t even have to use it every day.  I will say though that I like the feel of the cream on my hands much better than the lotion. Recommend very hiughly!</li>
            <li> Works ok, but no better than Amlactin</li>
            <li> Good product for dry skin issues...</li>

            <li> Great merchandise, great transaction</li>
            <li> While I use this primarily for dry, cracked fingers, particularly right at the fingernail, I&#x27;ve discovered that, at least for me, ANY small wound heals faster when this lotion is applied. It&#x27;s also the ONLY remedy for chigger &amp;#34;bites&amp;#34; that works for me. (Chiggers don&#x27;t bite. They dissolve skin cells with an enzyme that many people, including me, are sensitive to and allergic) The thin skin on the back of my hands stays in much better shape with regular use of the product. If you apply this lotion after using an electric callous remover, your heels will stay soft for days!</li>
            <li> Works great. I am happy to have found a source.</li>
            <li> Product works excellent for dry itchy skin</li>
            <li> Helps relieve severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth heels are easy with this cream.  It is miraculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m diabetic and this helps my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this item. It is the best moisturizer ever.</li>

            <li> Excellent cream for dry, scaly skin.  Really helps.</li>
            <li> Post said 2 pack, only 1 in each box.</li>
            <li> This was suggested by a dermatologist. It is OK, but I still prefer Glysomed cream.</li>
            <li> I use this year round, love it!</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt.  Order was correct.  Product was in perfect condition.  Will be ordering again</li>

            <li> Amazing product wife very happy with results ,I recomended item</li>
            <li> This is the over-the-counter version of the prescription Hac-Hydrin 12% Cream.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is wonderful for very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;The tube is very stiff which makes it difficult to squeeze out the last of the cream.</li>

            <li> The cream is wonderful, doing the job it was made to perform.</li>
