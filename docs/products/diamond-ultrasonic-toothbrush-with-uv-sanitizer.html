            <li>I&#x27;ve had this item for over two years and has worked flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>Put that money towards a good name brand toothbrush!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very happy.</li>
            <li>My Bling Diamond is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>my dentist and my hygienist have commented on how excellent my teeth have gotten with regards to lower plaque buildup, healthier gums and the whitening</li>
            <li>It has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>She could not believe how great my mouth looked!</li>
            <li>and it continues to work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this unit.</li>
            <li>Very good, makes me brush longer, that what my dentist will like.</li>
            <li>It did a great job removing plaque.</li>
            <li>but it was a great price.</li>
            <li>Everything is still working great and</li>
            <li>Sonicare has a 2 year warranty and have great customer service.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush for about a year, then it gradually deteriorated.</li>
            <li>My gums look great.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely happy with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>

            <li>UV sanitizer, GREAT.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s important to note that you CANNOT purchase replacement heads at any retail store!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned an electric toothbrush before, but this one does seem like very good quality, way more than I thought it was gonna be after reading the reviews on here!</li>
            <li>Great, son was very pleased</li>
            <li>Worked good for one year</li>
            <li>I used this this toothbrush for a year and loved it, but then when I ordered replacement heads which came in a three pack, they all literally disintegrated within two weeks.  </li>
            <li>It was so good that I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li>It takes good care of my teeth, between the teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a good toothbrush for 2 years now.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be as good as my Sonicare was.  </li>
            <li>(a Groupon I believe), so I&#x27;d say that is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>I used it for over a month and loved it.  </li>
            <li>My very favorite part of the Dazzle Pro is that every 30 seconds it pauses so that I&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush still works great and has kept my teeth very clean</li>
            <li>Healthy!</li>
            <li>I got this tooth brush as my first ultrasonic toothbrush and it works great!</li>
            <li>The UV light works great.</li>
            <li>The UV light sanitizer is also a great feature to have with this brush.</li>
            <li>Unlike most of the reviews, I have had a good experience.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t live in a perfect world so some buyers are dissatisfied with this brand and its product(s).</li>
            <li>but I contacted the company and they took good care of me -- the staff seems to really care about delivery great customer service.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it everything worked great.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope not, so far it has been a very good brush.</li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>There are much better options out there....</li>
            <li>Much better options on the market.</li>
            <li>I bought this through Groupon, but wish I had researched it better.</li>
            <li>I really love my Dazzle Pro toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My favorite setting is medium with intervals.</li>
            <li>that you have to replace the top of the toothbrush after each brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush now for over 2 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>And the chamber that supposedly uses light to sanitize your brush heads does not work at all!  </li>
            <li>my sonicare which I have had for many years and is now wearing out.  </li>
            <li>You can do much better than the Diamond Ultrasonic.</li>
            <li>Also, the contoured design of the Sonicare brush gives a much more thorough cleaning than the Diamond&#x27;s brush.</li>
            <li>We all love this.  </li>
            <li>and they told me they would do nothing because it had been more than 90 days.</li>
            <li>i called them and because i ordered more than 3 months ago</li>
            <li>(I was able to find cheaper heads through Pursonic.)</li>
            <li>It cleans my mouth, and I didn&#x27;t expect it to do any more.</li>
            <li>Considering that I love to drink coffee</li>
            <li>I would not pay more than that for any electric type of toothbrush</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than $25 on it.</li>
            <li>My wife and i love them.</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>I am normally more suspicious about innocuous knockoff products like this from brand names that I&#x27;ve never heard of, but for some reason decided to just go ahead &amp; buy the Groupon when I saw it; DO NOT FALL FOR THIS MISTAKE</li>
            <li>Makes me nervous about purchasing this 4th one, but the 3 we have are excellent and still running strong 18 months later.</li>
            <li>I feel very clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s a pretty good deal for four years.  </li>
            <li>UV light is a great feature and works great, my teeth have been a lot cleaner ever since I started using it, and the timer to switch between sections of teeth is extremely helpful.</li>
            <li>This so-called Dr. Raymond is getting rich by ripping off well-meaning consumers!</li>
            <li>A very cool feature is during the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At $7 to $10 a toothbrush you might think that they would be better than the quality you might get from the free toothbrushes given out at hotels when you forget yours.</li>
            <li>If it was so good, it would be warrantied for much longer.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are of the poorest quality and wear out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was not convinced that I could easily cancel the scheduled reorder easily if I started it.  </li>
            <li>It used to run for 7 days strong, now it is noticeably weaker by day 6.  </li>
            <li>really liked it at first, but it died within a week.</li>
            <li>The two minute timer is a nice option and got me brushing more than I normally would.</li>
            <li>I had used in for about 3 weeks,  seemed to be working fine.</li>
            <li>Everything still works fine.</li>
            <li>charging station works fine, mine has gotten damp plenty of times sitting on the sink and it is still working</li>
            <li>guess I am just extremely lucky then, but at any rate, we love them</li>
            <li>Being so cheap to begin with, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but with Amazon&#x27;s great customer service, I say its worth a try.</li>
            <li>so CHEAPLY made.</li>
            <li>I am not using it, it cleans the brush with an ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>Sanitation  light comes on for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>So basically I got 3 weeks of work from this cheap toothbrush</li>
            <li>I liked my Diamond so much that I went and purchased one for my wife who now loves her as well.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>( the material is cheap and the bristles have irritated the living heck out of my gums.</li>
            <li>should also mention that this product feels really really cheap.</li>
            <li>The UV, which is the primary reason I bought it, stopped working.</li>
            <li>But as far as the Toothbrush is concerned, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>At first this toothbrush worked great, I even replaced my old OralB toothbrush with this.</li>
            <li>I purchased this on July 5, 2013 and had been very satisfied with the brush so far.</li>
            <li>Then I tried to charge this Powerful!</li>
            <li>Original post:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to my Sonicare and loving it!</li>
            <li>After about two months it just wasn&#x27;t getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>After three months I bought the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean toothbrush, and I love it.</li>
            <li>A dentist sometimes uses an ultrasonic device to clean teeth.</li>
            <li>My guess is, with the people that had problems with them, that they did not use and clean them properly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got it for a special price</li>
            <li>Hope I get as lucky as when I bought the original 3.  </li>
            <li>I have had this toothbrush for over a year now, purchased via Amazon Local for a good price.</li>
            <li>so we didn&#x27;t pay anything close to the full price for them.  </li>
            <li>What kind of a great product is this, if it has such a short warranty.  </li>
            <li>Thank god I did not pay full</li>
            <li>I feel for anyone that has bought this thing at full price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gave up on this kid, and called Amazon, explained the issue, they gave me a full credit in about thirty seconds</li>
            <li>and the battery is dead for good!</li>
            <li>It functioned fine for about the first nine months.  </li>
            <li>either I got lucky or</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m lucky mine</li>
            <li>The experience of brushing with this thing after coming from a regular toothbrush was very satisfying.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase, I just likely won&#x27;t replace it at that steep price should anything happen to it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Diamond Ultrasonic for about a year and a half and have been quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased my units I used a Groupon special and each unit was less than $50.00 each; so for the money and performance I am extremely satisfied and have gotten more than my money&#x27;s worth!  </li>
            <li>First, let me say how excited I was to get this toothbrush because I&#x27;ve been wanting an electric toothburh in a while</li>
            <li>Customer service from the website was non existent when trying to order new ones, then I decided it was just foolish to continue using this product when my Phillips Sonicare is far superior</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it because I thought the light bulb had gone out</li>
            <li>However, it would be nice to have a &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button when you need to stop in the middle for some reason.</li>
            <li>Might be worth buying an extended warranty if you are considering this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this product, the 30 second &amp;#34;note&amp;#34;, UV light, removable basket</li>
            <li>However, I called the company directly to see if they could offer any suggestions,and they offered me a great deal on another toothbrush, if I chose to give them another try, either now or in the future.  </li>
            <li>Is a toothbrush with removable heads and a UV sanitation device worth $50?</li>
            <li>I really laugh when referring to it as a &#x27;brush&#x27; since all I do is hold it on my teeth and it does its job.</li>
            <li>only issue now, after I&#x27;ve used up my 6 free brush heads, is that I need to buy more</li>
            <li>In all fairness the toothbrush actually did clean slightly better than my Sonic Care.  </li>
            <li>the company said the warranty period had expired and there was nothing they could do because they had to be fair to their other customers.  </li>
            <li>Conveniently right after the 12 month warranty was up.</li>
            <li>I started using one right away.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t start using it right away - I think it was a month or two before I began using it.  </li>
            <li>Whatever issues they had with it dying they might have fixed, or maybe I just got lucky, but this one has worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>Ultrasound is sound of a pitch that is too high for humans to hear.</li>
            <li>After determining that it was overheating, they sent me a whole new set-up in July of 2012 (including three more brush heads for free!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and purchase from a reputable company.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I highly advise you to stay away from this brush &amp; go with a familiar brand.</li>
            <li>I figure I got good use out of it for about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li>Like the three settings, and especially the case where the brushes get cleansed daily for great hygiene.  </li>
            <li>It just seems really strange that the 3 I purchased can be sooooo great, yet all the others sold apparently suck??  </li>
            <li>I more than got my money&#x27;s worth since I only paid $69.</li>
            <li>It stopped working, after I ordered a new bulb it started working again with the original bulb, but then stopped working again.  </li>
            <li>importantly, my new dentist who has been seeing me every 1-3 months for Invisalign treatment keeps commenting on how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li>Within the first two months they were both falling apart.  </li>
            <li>I chose it because it is much higher rated than the Diamone.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it at first.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with their customer service, in my opinion, they seem more than willing to do whatever is necessary to satisfy their customers.</li>
            <li>Pc of S,..., didn&#x27;t even charge the first time plugin.</li>
            <li>This is the first Amazon review I have ever posted.  </li>
            <li>First electronic brush.</li>
            <li>I am now buying another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thin brush head, soft bristles, the timer, the ultraviolet light cleaner,</li>
            <li>I bought this on a Groupon deal over a year ago, and I wish I had read the reviews here first.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off with a simple toothbrush or spending the money of a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I went to the dentist for the first time in about 10 years</li>
            <li>First the silver paint fell off then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for exactly one week.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is nothing but junk and a waste of good money.  </li>
            <li>No recommendation from me except not to waste your good money.</li>
            <li>Not only did it stop working less then a year of being used, but it also did not do a very good job of cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for a year and a half now and have been very pleased</li>
            <li>This is made just as good as the others if not better (depending on the brand).  </li>
            <li>Tooth brush worked fine for the first several month</li>
            <li>This worked fine for a couple of months and then started to have various problems,</li>
            <li>I was actually trying to purchase some as Christmas gifts but the Groupons has expired and $50 which is what I paid for it would be fine but not $200 plus like the suggested retail price.</li>
            <li>It was working perfectly fine until last night.</li>
            <li>blue light comes on, so I know the power unit does get power, but the brush does not charge.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Bling and they said that it was outside of the warranty period and that they could not replace it (a reputable company would, given that it was unused and new in box).  </li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer was also appreciated.</li>
            <li>and now I found reasonably priced replacement heads.</li>
            <li>, now I have a $50 standard toothbrush, OH, with a removable head that I can sanitize with the UV light built into the dock, that I no longer need because the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t need to be charged.</li>
            <li>As I was getting ready to toss it, I dropped it on the carpet.  </li>
            <li>The only  downside is getting a replacement UV Light.  </li>
            <li>I emailed Bling Dental and they shipped me something to send the toothbrush back to them for free.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to buy 3 for $29.99 from their website (even after receiving 10 free &amp;#34;BLING BUCK$&amp;#34; and bringing the total to $24.94 with shipping).  </li>
            <li>They have much cheaper replacement heads on Amazon, so I&#x27;m going to buy some and give them a try and will update if I find some that are compatible to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I traded my reliable Sonicare brushes (which I used for 3+ years, regularly replacing the brushes as Sonicare suggests) for this cheap toothbrush, thiking it was an equivalent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m editing my review because after 4 years, the UV light finally went out.</li>
            <li>No cavities, ever, so I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s the brush.</li>
            <li>I do really like</li>
            <li>Good thing, it lasted a few months and then the replaceable head broke off (it was always challenging to remove) and the toothbrush stared to have to recharged every few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t last any longer than some grocery store available electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel a whole lot cleaner</li>
            <li>Thanks everybody.</li>
            <li>it has really helped my teeth.  </li>
            <li>and yes i use the gentle setting.</li>
            <li>Diamond is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth, save yourself the headache and look for something else.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that the brush pulsates every thirth second to let you know how far along you are in your 2 minute brush.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a rip off and some creep is getting rich off of us.</li>
            <li>I agree with most of the other posters here.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, when I opened it up, it&#x27;s the EXACT same thing as this Diamond.  </li>
            <li>So if the 8 minutes of blue light miss anything on the dark side of the brush you have an even better bacterial breeding ground than when allowed to dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have not been able to use the UV part for quite some time because of an extremely foul smell coming from it.</li>
            <li>Apparently there have been many customers with the same issues.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty surprised -</li>
            <li>The battery finally died and won&#x27;t take a full charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Some very young, inexperienced guy, the \\&quot;manager\\&quot; called me back from a cell phone that was identified as Samantha Smith and lectured me on how they couldn&#x27;t offer as good a guarantee as SonicCare because they&#x27;re a new company.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are cheaply made, I couldn&#x27;t get more than a few weeks out of one before it started to fray and go flat.</li>
            <li>It worked ok for about less than three months.</li>
            <li>Repeat many times-forget it, throw it away, get a different brand next time!</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly for the UV sanitation.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I can assure you if this product ever made it to retail, then the return/defective rate would be sky high.    </li>
            <li>Love this brush, I&#x27;ve been using the Bling Diamond tooth brush for a little over a month now</li>
            <li>I am thinking about a legal action.</li>
            <li>It was only worth the $50 I paid for it...</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t clean as well as I hoped considering I&#x27;d previously used a Sonicare Ultrasonic toothbrush like many of the other reviewers had.</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush, although I the replacement heads can be a little pricy as you have to buy everything direct from Bling Dental.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT BUY unless you want to have to buy a new one yearly.</li>
            <li>When he called customer service they admitted there are problems with this model and asked him if he would like to buy a new one....</li>
            <li>By the time the new bulb arrived, I was already a couple of days over the 3-month warranty period</li>
            <li>they want me to pay 50 bucks for a new one...</li>
            <li>I got this Diamond thing as a backup for my trusty Sonni simply because I thought this one was cuter (blue light and all).</li>
            <li>The first one broke after 6 months, the second broke after 3 months.</li>
            <li>And when these units burn out I plan to purchase the exact same thing again.</li>
            <li>I normally use soft toothbrushes but these are the softest toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say my teeth are sparkling white yet, but by whole mouth felt a lot cleaner!  </li>
            <li>There was a short in the electronics and in turn created a hot spot.  </li>
            <li>After the first 30 second increment it died.</li>
            <li>My friend and I find that this product works far better than what we used in the past.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is shoddily made of very cheap materials.</li>
            <li>Looking at other reviews I guess I should be lucky that mine still works at all after 2 years.</li>
            <li>You are better off using elbow grease and your own toothbrush instead of this shiny crap.  </li>
            <li>I know that if I continued to use this I would have eventually chipped one of my teeth, so for that reason alone steer clear of this brush.</li>
            <li>My dentist and I have notice considerable improvement to my gum-line since switching to electric,</li>
            <li>my dental hygienist commented that I really have been taking care of my teeth, especially my gums.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this toothbrush directly from Bling Dental Products 15 months ago.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;12 years old and have braces</li>
            <li>And, about 10 months after I bought it, it completely stopped working (it turns on for about 2 seconds</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a complete piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this Bling Diamond Ultrasonic.  </li>
            <li>*** brush begins to act up &amp; refuses to stay set on the mode that I select; instead it cycles through &amp; completely powers off after about 5-10 seconds of brushing.</li>
            <li>the enamel has completely come off my teeth.</li>
            <li>We have only had ours for a few months but both my husband and I love ours.  </li>
            <li>but after a few more weeks it wouldn&#x27;t turn back on.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own this, but the name and description are false and misleading.</li>
            <li>purchased this \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; from Amazon local about ten days ago, and thank God, though I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to read reviews first, I was smart enough to trust Amazon.</li>
            <li>this brush has helped tremendously to keep the staining down.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to have (4) 30 second intervals but now only does 2 or 3 and won&#x27;t come back on for a full minute once it shuts itself off.</li>
            <li>Of course  the paint on the handle is starting to wear, anything that you hold in your hand for an extended amount of time that vibrates with any high frequency will wear out.</li>
            <li>Especially after reading these reviews which according to them I should only have a few more months before I experience what they went through.</li>
            <li>I expected a little more value than that.</li>
            <li>Due to the proprietary (er, cheap) nature of the brush, you cannot use any standard replacement head found at your local Walmart or Target; you have to order it from the mfg.&#x27;s website, of which they charge you a WHOPPING $29.99</li>
            <li>Do I try yet another set of replacement heads, ask for a new toothbrush or ask for my money back???!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s possible that it was a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34;, but i opted for a refund instead of a new one.</li>
            <li>When new it lasts about a week between charges with two people using it if you don&#x27;t put it back on the cradle.</li>
            <li>I emailed the company and they were nice enough to replace BOTH of my broken models.  </li>
            <li>and I can easily buy replacement heads (better quality and less expensive) at just about any drug store or major retailer.</li>
            <li>When I pursued them I got a very young girl who just repeated, \\&quot;We&#x27;ll send you a label, then when we receive the toothbrush back, we&#x27;ll process a replacement.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush w/o major issue for a while now &amp;</li>
            <li>will be going back to my old toothbrush asap!</li>
            <li>I find it hard to believe, but this product in the 3 months I had it, before loosing was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have a cheap Braun electric toothbrush that I have had for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean teeth properly, malfuntions in less than a year, the silver cheapo paint rubbed off after only a month, etc.</li>
            <li>I especially like the soft brush head.</li>
            <li>Pursonic replacement brush heads are apparently a match.</li>
            <li>so glad I read the reviews as my unit has also broken after about 9 months.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company because the handset went out and my only option was to buy a new handset for over $50 when the product its self only cost around $65.</li>
            <li>Last week, I pulled out the second brand new one and started using it...</li>
            <li>It is powerful, yet gentle on my teeth and gums, and the head is small enough to clean tough to reach places in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>so it is hard for me to clean around my braces with a normal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am gentle when removing the toothbrush head, and I dry it thoroughly prior to placing it back on the charger.</li>
            <li>For as much money as these things cost, I surely expected it to last longer.</li>
            <li>then the whole thing went down to pit.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Bling Diamond Power Toothbrush via Groupon last year &amp; have recently started experiencing major functionality issues with the product.</li>
            <li>We have two of these, one older than the other boy from Gropon</li>
            <li>so I spent the $19.99+shipping to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes are way too soft and don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>After a little over a month one of the brushing modes stopped working, and then the whole thing stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Based on other reviews I found a new one on Groupon for $50 - I like it enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li>Perhaps all it did was give me consistency, I love the 2 minute / 30-second cycle on this timer, it really helps unlearn bad</li>
            <li>I have had this for a few months and have noticed a huge decrease in enamel, and no i don&#x27;t brush with a heavy hand</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;I was very happy.</li>
            <li> My Bling Diamond is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> my dentist and my hygienist have commented on how excellent my teeth have gotten with regards to lower plaque buildup, healthier gums and the whitening</li>
            <li> It has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> She could not believe how great my mouth looked!</li>
            <li> and it continues to work perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this unit.</li>
            <li> Very good, makes me brush longer, that what my dentist will like.</li>
            <li> It did a great job removing plaque.</li>
            <li> but it was a great price.</li>
            <li> Everything is still working great and</li>
            <li> Sonicare has a 2 year warranty and have great customer service.  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for about a year, then it gradually deteriorated.</li>
            <li> My gums look great.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely happy with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I works great.</li>
            <li> - LOL)</li>
            <li> All 3 units are still working great.  </li>
            <li> UV sanitizer, GREAT.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li> and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s important to note that you CANNOT purchase replacement heads at any retail store!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an electric toothbrush before, but this one does seem like very good quality, way more than I thought it was gonna be after reading the reviews on here!</li>
            <li> Great, son was very pleased</li>
            <li> Worked good for one year</li>
            <li> I used this this toothbrush for a year and loved it, but then when I ordered replacement heads which came in a three pack, they all literally disintegrated within two weeks.  </li>
            <li> It was so good that I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> It takes good care of my teeth, between the teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a good toothbrush for 2 years now.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be as good as my Sonicare was.  </li>
            <li> (a Groupon I believe), so I&#x27;d say that is a good deal.  </li>
            <li> I used it for over a month and loved it.  </li>
            <li> My very favorite part of the Dazzle Pro is that every 30 seconds it pauses so that I&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush still works great and has kept my teeth very clean</li>
            <li> Healthy!</li>
            <li> I got this tooth brush as my first ultrasonic toothbrush and it works great!</li>
            <li> The UV light works great.</li>
            <li> The UV light sanitizer is also a great feature to have with this brush.</li>
            <li> Unlike most of the reviews, I have had a good experience.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t live in a perfect world so some buyers are dissatisfied with this brand and its product(s).</li>
            <li> but I contacted the company and they took good care of me -- the staff seems to really care about delivery great customer service.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it everything worked great.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hope not, so far it has been a very good brush.</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> There are much better options out there....</li>
            <li> Much better options on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this through Groupon, but wish I had researched it better.</li>
            <li> I really love my Dazzle Pro toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My favorite setting is medium with intervals.</li>
            <li> that you have to replace the top of the toothbrush after each brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush now for over 2 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> And the chamber that supposedly uses light to sanitize your brush heads does not work at all!  </li>
            <li> my sonicare which I have had for many years and is now wearing out.  </li>
            <li> You can do much better than the Diamond Ultrasonic.</li>
            <li> Also, the contoured design of the Sonicare brush gives a much more thorough cleaning than the Diamond&#x27;s brush.</li>
            <li> We all love this.  </li>
            <li> and they told me they would do nothing because it had been more than 90 days.</li>
            <li> i called them and because i ordered more than 3 months ago</li>
            <li> (I was able to find cheaper heads through Pursonic.)</li>
            <li> It cleans my mouth, and I didn&#x27;t expect it to do any more.</li>
            <li> Considering that I love to drink coffee</li>
            <li> I would not pay more than that for any electric type of toothbrush</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than $25 on it.</li>
            <li> My wife and i love them.</li>
            <li> and I am completely satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> I am normally more suspicious about innocuous knockoff products like this from brand names that I&#x27;ve never heard of, but for some reason decided to just go ahead &amp; buy the Groupon when I saw it; DO NOT FALL FOR THIS MISTAKE</li>
            <li> Makes me nervous about purchasing this 4th one, but the 3 we have are excellent and still running strong 18 months later.</li>
            <li> I feel very clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s a pretty good deal for four years.  </li>
            <li> UV light is a great feature and works great, my teeth have been a lot cleaner ever since I started using it, and the timer to switch between sections of teeth is extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> This so-called Dr. Raymond is getting rich by ripping off well-meaning consumers!</li>
            <li> A very cool feature is during the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At $7 to $10 a toothbrush you might think that they would be better than the quality you might get from the free toothbrushes given out at hotels when you forget yours.</li>
            <li> If it was so good, it would be warrantied for much longer.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are of the poorest quality and wear out very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was not convinced that I could easily cancel the scheduled reorder easily if I started it.  </li>
            <li> It used to run for 7 days strong, now it is noticeably weaker by day 6.  </li>
            <li> really liked it at first, but it died within a week.</li>
            <li> The two minute timer is a nice option and got me brushing more than I normally would.</li>
            <li> I had used in for about 3 weeks,  seemed to be working fine.</li>
            <li> Everything still works fine.</li>
            <li> charging station works fine, mine has gotten damp plenty of times sitting on the sink and it is still working</li>
            <li> guess I am just extremely lucky then, but at any rate, we love them</li>
            <li> Being so cheap to begin with, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but with Amazon&#x27;s great customer service, I say its worth a try.</li>
            <li> so CHEAPLY made.</li>
            <li> I am not using it, it cleans the brush with an ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> Sanitation  light comes on for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> So basically I got 3 weeks of work from this cheap toothbrush</li>
            <li> I liked my Diamond so much that I went and purchased one for my wife who now loves her as well.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> ( the material is cheap and the bristles have irritated the living heck out of my gums.</li>
            <li> should also mention that this product feels really really cheap.</li>
            <li> The UV, which is the primary reason I bought it, stopped working.</li>
            <li> But as far as the Toothbrush is concerned, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> At first this toothbrush worked great, I even replaced my old OralB toothbrush with this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on July 5, 2013 and had been very satisfied with the brush so far.</li>
            <li> Then I tried to charge this Powerful!</li>
            <li> Original post:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to my Sonicare and loving it!</li>
            <li> After about two months it just wasn&#x27;t getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> After three months I bought the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean toothbrush, and I love it.</li>
            <li> A dentist sometimes uses an ultrasonic device to clean teeth.</li>
            <li> My guess is, with the people that had problems with them, that they did not use and clean them properly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got it for a special price</li>
            <li> Hope I get as lucky as when I bought the original 3.  </li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for over a year now, purchased via Amazon Local for a good price.</li>
            <li> so we didn&#x27;t pay anything close to the full price for them.  </li>
            <li> What kind of a great product is this, if it has such a short warranty.  </li>
            <li> Thank god I did not pay full</li>
            <li> I feel for anyone that has bought this thing at full price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> gave up on this kid, and called Amazon, explained the issue, they gave me a full credit in about thirty seconds</li>
            <li> and the battery is dead for good!</li>
            <li> It functioned fine for about the first nine months.  </li>
            <li> either I got lucky or</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m lucky mine</li>
            <li> The experience of brushing with this thing after coming from a regular toothbrush was very satisfying.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase, I just likely won&#x27;t replace it at that steep price should anything happen to it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Diamond Ultrasonic for about a year and a half and have been quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased my units I used a Groupon special and each unit was less than $50.00 each; so for the money and performance I am extremely satisfied and have gotten more than my money&#x27;s worth!  </li>
            <li> First, let me say how excited I was to get this toothbrush because I&#x27;ve been wanting an electric toothburh in a while</li>
            <li> Customer service from the website was non existent when trying to order new ones, then I decided it was just foolish to continue using this product when my Phillips Sonicare is far superior</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it because I thought the light bulb had gone out</li>
            <li> However, it would be nice to have a &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button when you need to stop in the middle for some reason.</li>
            <li> Might be worth buying an extended warranty if you are considering this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product, the 30 second &amp;#34;note&amp;#34;, UV light, removable basket</li>
            <li> However, I called the company directly to see if they could offer any suggestions,and they offered me a great deal on another toothbrush, if I chose to give them another try, either now or in the future.  </li>
            <li> Is a toothbrush with removable heads and a UV sanitation device worth $50?</li>
            <li> I really laugh when referring to it as a &#x27;brush&#x27; since all I do is hold it on my teeth and it does its job.</li>
            <li> only issue now, after I&#x27;ve used up my 6 free brush heads, is that I need to buy more</li>
            <li> In all fairness the toothbrush actually did clean slightly better than my Sonic Care.  </li>
            <li> the company said the warranty period had expired and there was nothing they could do because they had to be fair to their other customers.  </li>
            <li> Conveniently right after the 12 month warranty was up.</li>
            <li> I started using one right away.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start using it right away - I think it was a month or two before I began using it.  </li>
            <li> Whatever issues they had with it dying they might have fixed, or maybe I just got lucky, but this one has worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> Ultrasound is sound of a pitch that is too high for humans to hear.</li>
            <li> After determining that it was overheating, they sent me a whole new set-up in July of 2012 (including three more brush heads for free!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and purchase from a reputable company.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I highly advise you to stay away from this brush &amp; go with a familiar brand.</li>
            <li> I figure I got good use out of it for about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Like the three settings, and especially the case where the brushes get cleansed daily for great hygiene.  </li>
            <li> It just seems really strange that the 3 I purchased can be sooooo great, yet all the others sold apparently suck??  </li>
            <li> I more than got my money&#x27;s worth since I only paid $69.</li>
            <li> It stopped working, after I ordered a new bulb it started working again with the original bulb, but then stopped working again.  </li>
            <li> importantly, my new dentist who has been seeing me every 1-3 months for Invisalign treatment keeps commenting on how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li> Within the first two months they were both falling apart.  </li>
            <li> I chose it because it is much higher rated than the Diamone.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it at first.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with their customer service, in my opinion, they seem more than willing to do whatever is necessary to satisfy their customers.</li>
            <li> Pc of S,..., didn&#x27;t even charge the first time plugin.</li>
            <li> This is the first Amazon review I have ever posted.  </li>
            <li> First electronic brush.</li>
            <li> I am now buying another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thin brush head, soft bristles, the timer, the ultraviolet light cleaner,</li>
            <li> I bought this on a Groupon deal over a year ago, and I wish I had read the reviews here first.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off with a simple toothbrush or spending the money of a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist for the first time in about 10 years</li>
            <li> First the silver paint fell off then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for exactly one week.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is nothing but junk and a waste of good money.  </li>
            <li> No recommendation from me except not to waste your good money.</li>
            <li> Not only did it stop working less then a year of being used, but it also did not do a very good job of cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a year and a half now and have been very pleased</li>
            <li> This is made just as good as the others if not better (depending on the brand).  </li>
            <li> Tooth brush worked fine for the first several month</li>
            <li> This worked fine for a couple of months and then started to have various problems,</li>
            <li> I was actually trying to purchase some as Christmas gifts but the Groupons has expired and $50 which is what I paid for it would be fine but not $200 plus like the suggested retail price.</li>
            <li> It was working perfectly fine until last night.</li>
            <li> blue light comes on, so I know the power unit does get power, but the brush does not charge.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Bling and they said that it was outside of the warranty period and that they could not replace it (a reputable company would, given that it was unused and new in box).  </li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer was also appreciated.</li>
            <li> and now I found reasonably priced replacement heads.</li>
            <li> , now I have a $50 standard toothbrush, OH, with a removable head that I can sanitize with the UV light built into the dock, that I no longer need because the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t need to be charged.</li>
            <li> As I was getting ready to toss it, I dropped it on the carpet.  </li>
            <li> The only  downside is getting a replacement UV Light.  </li>
            <li> I emailed Bling Dental and they shipped me something to send the toothbrush back to them for free.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to buy 3 for $29.99 from their website (even after receiving 10 free &amp;#34;BLING BUCK$&amp;#34; and bringing the total to $24.94 with shipping).  </li>
            <li> They have much cheaper replacement heads on Amazon, so I&#x27;m going to buy some and give them a try and will update if I find some that are compatible to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I traded my reliable Sonicare brushes (which I used for 3+ years, regularly replacing the brushes as Sonicare suggests) for this cheap toothbrush, thiking it was an equivalent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m editing my review because after 4 years, the UV light finally went out.</li>
            <li> No cavities, ever, so I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s the brush.</li>
            <li> I do really like</li>
            <li> Good thing, it lasted a few months and then the replaceable head broke off (it was always challenging to remove) and the toothbrush stared to have to recharged every few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last any longer than some grocery store available electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel a whole lot cleaner</li>
            <li> Thanks everybody.</li>
            <li> it has really helped my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and yes i use the gentle setting.</li>
            <li> Diamond is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth, save yourself the headache and look for something else.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that the brush pulsates every thirth second to let you know how far along you are in your 2 minute brush.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a rip off and some creep is getting rich off of us.</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the other posters here.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, when I opened it up, it&#x27;s the EXACT same thing as this Diamond.  </li>
            <li> So if the 8 minutes of blue light miss anything on the dark side of the brush you have an even better bacterial breeding ground than when allowed to dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have not been able to use the UV part for quite some time because of an extremely foul smell coming from it.</li>
            <li> Apparently there have been many customers with the same issues.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty surprised -</li>
            <li> The battery finally died and won&#x27;t take a full charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Some very young, inexperienced guy, the \\&quot;manager\\&quot; called me back from a cell phone that was identified as Samantha Smith and lectured me on how they couldn&#x27;t offer as good a guarantee as SonicCare because they&#x27;re a new company.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are cheaply made, I couldn&#x27;t get more than a few weeks out of one before it started to fray and go flat.</li>
            <li> It worked ok for about less than three months.</li>
            <li> Repeat many times-forget it, throw it away, get a different brand next time!</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for the UV sanitation.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can assure you if this product ever made it to retail, then the return/defective rate would be sky high.    </li>
            <li> Love this brush, I&#x27;ve been using the Bling Diamond tooth brush for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> I am thinking about a legal action.</li>
            <li> It was only worth the $50 I paid for it...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clean as well as I hoped considering I&#x27;d previously used a Sonicare Ultrasonic toothbrush like many of the other reviewers had.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush, although I the replacement heads can be a little pricy as you have to buy everything direct from Bling Dental.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY unless you want to have to buy a new one yearly.</li>
            <li> When he called customer service they admitted there are problems with this model and asked him if he would like to buy a new one....</li>
            <li> By the time the new bulb arrived, I was already a couple of days over the 3-month warranty period</li>
            <li> they want me to pay 50 bucks for a new one...</li>
            <li> I got this Diamond thing as a backup for my trusty Sonni simply because I thought this one was cuter (blue light and all).</li>
            <li> The first one broke after 6 months, the second broke after 3 months.</li>
            <li> And when these units burn out I plan to purchase the exact same thing again.</li>
            <li> I normally use soft toothbrushes but these are the softest toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say my teeth are sparkling white yet, but by whole mouth felt a lot cleaner!  </li>
            <li> There was a short in the electronics and in turn created a hot spot.  </li>
            <li> After the first 30 second increment it died.</li>
            <li> My friend and I find that this product works far better than what we used in the past.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is shoddily made of very cheap materials.</li>
            <li> Looking at other reviews I guess I should be lucky that mine still works at all after 2 years.</li>
            <li> You are better off using elbow grease and your own toothbrush instead of this shiny crap.  </li>
            <li> I know that if I continued to use this I would have eventually chipped one of my teeth, so for that reason alone steer clear of this brush.</li>
            <li> My dentist and I have notice considerable improvement to my gum-line since switching to electric,</li>
            <li> my dental hygienist commented that I really have been taking care of my teeth, especially my gums.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this toothbrush directly from Bling Dental Products 15 months ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;12 years old and have braces</li>
            <li> And, about 10 months after I bought it, it completely stopped working (it turns on for about 2 seconds</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this Bling Diamond Ultrasonic.  </li>
            <li> *** brush begins to act up &amp; refuses to stay set on the mode that I select; instead it cycles through &amp; completely powers off after about 5-10 seconds of brushing.</li>
            <li> the enamel has completely come off my teeth.</li>
            <li> We have only had ours for a few months but both my husband and I love ours.  </li>
            <li> but after a few more weeks it wouldn&#x27;t turn back on.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own this, but the name and description are false and misleading.</li>
            <li> purchased this \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; from Amazon local about ten days ago, and thank God, though I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to read reviews first, I was smart enough to trust Amazon.</li>
            <li> this brush has helped tremendously to keep the staining down.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to have (4) 30 second intervals but now only does 2 or 3 and won&#x27;t come back on for a full minute once it shuts itself off.</li>
            <li> Of course  the paint on the handle is starting to wear, anything that you hold in your hand for an extended amount of time that vibrates with any high frequency will wear out.</li>
            <li> Especially after reading these reviews which according to them I should only have a few more months before I experience what they went through.</li>
            <li> I expected a little more value than that.</li>
            <li> Due to the proprietary (er, cheap) nature of the brush, you cannot use any standard replacement head found at your local Walmart or Target; you have to order it from the mfg.&#x27;s website, of which they charge you a WHOPPING $29.99</li>
            <li> Do I try yet another set of replacement heads, ask for a new toothbrush or ask for my money back???!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s possible that it was a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34;, but i opted for a refund instead of a new one.</li>
            <li> When new it lasts about a week between charges with two people using it if you don&#x27;t put it back on the cradle.</li>
            <li> I emailed the company and they were nice enough to replace BOTH of my broken models.  </li>
            <li> and I can easily buy replacement heads (better quality and less expensive) at just about any drug store or major retailer.</li>
            <li> When I pursued them I got a very young girl who just repeated, \\&quot;We&#x27;ll send you a label, then when we receive the toothbrush back, we&#x27;ll process a replacement.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush w/o major issue for a while now &amp;</li>
            <li> will be going back to my old toothbrush asap!</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe, but this product in the 3 months I had it, before loosing was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have a cheap Braun electric toothbrush that I have had for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean teeth properly, malfuntions in less than a year, the silver cheapo paint rubbed off after only a month, etc.</li>
            <li> I especially like the soft brush head.</li>
            <li> Pursonic replacement brush heads are apparently a match.</li>
            <li> so glad I read the reviews as my unit has also broken after about 9 months.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company because the handset went out and my only option was to buy a new handset for over $50 when the product its self only cost around $65.</li>
            <li> Last week, I pulled out the second brand new one and started using it...</li>
            <li> It is powerful, yet gentle on my teeth and gums, and the head is small enough to clean tough to reach places in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> so it is hard for me to clean around my braces with a normal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am gentle when removing the toothbrush head, and I dry it thoroughly prior to placing it back on the charger.</li>
            <li> For as much money as these things cost, I surely expected it to last longer.</li>
            <li> then the whole thing went down to pit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Bling Diamond Power Toothbrush via Groupon last year &amp; have recently started experiencing major functionality issues with the product.</li>
            <li> We have two of these, one older than the other boy from Gropon</li>
            <li> so I spent the $19.99+shipping to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes are way too soft and don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> After a little over a month one of the brushing modes stopped working, and then the whole thing stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Based on other reviews I found a new one on Groupon for $50 - I like it enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Perhaps all it did was give me consistency, I love the 2 minute / 30-second cycle on this timer, it really helps unlearn bad</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months and have noticed a huge decrease in enamel, and no i don&#x27;t brush with a heavy hand</li>
            <li> The only downside is I&#x27;m not sure how long the UB bulb is actually beneficial in terms of sanitizing the brush heads (my bulb is still working, just not sure how long the light does its job).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I tried to call them to complain, the lines were always busy, and when they returned my call over a day later, of course, I was not available.</li>
            <li> and I can buy a new toothbrush for less than $5!?</li>
            <li> but the ad was not very clear</li>
            <li> I only used it once per day, using a regular toothbrush the other times.  </li>
            <li> This product is nothing special, cleans about as well as a $3 non-electric, and is very likely to fail before you even become friends with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I really liked it</li>
            <li> The motors and lights fail practically out of the box in huge numbers.</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep the toothbrush head tray dry though - you don&#x27;t want water collecting in it and getting nasty - it&#x27;s a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes didn&#x27;t fit and they said I must have ordered the wrong ones.</li>
            <li> lasted as long as it did.</li>
            <li> I kept one in the box for a long time, because I was over it.  </li>
            <li> plus I didn&#x27;t use it everyday because I was still using my Oral B Sonic which is over 5 years old.</li>
            <li> that I don&#x27;t have to guess at how long to brush.</li>
            <li> (Simple math will tell you that&#x27;s roughly $10/brush head;</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are so many negative reviews; granted I got this on a Groupon for less than $100.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely agree that their website is super cheesy</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve owned any other quality electric toothbrush you&#x27;ll know that this thing feel like a fragile toy.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later, same thing.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this through the Amazon local deals and, fortunately, only paid a few bucks for it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little more expensive but actually continue working thus costing less in the long run.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore for longer than a single brushing and sometimes doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I actually floss less since I retired.</li>
            <li> sterilizer is pretty much useless, when the brush heads are kept in there they stay wet until the next use.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later, another crack.  </li>
            <li> I did find that it will go back on and run for the 2 minutes after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> If it pops up as a local deal, don&#x27;t waste the money.  </li>
            <li> The real gripe with the toothbrush resided in the poorly constructed brush head.  </li>
            <li> I should have never bought anything other than Sonicare products.  </li>
            <li> So pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what these other reviewer&#x27;s are talking about.  </li>
            <li> have used it daily for the past 2+ years with no issues.  </li>
            <li> Please save your money and buy any other mainstream electric toothbrush on sale here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was a lot cheaper via Groupon than the other sanitizing units sold at the time.</li>
            <li> Just run some cold water over it or let it cool for a while.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled into buying this product, one look at all the other reviews should tell you plenty.</li>
            <li> It was not used hard as I am the sole user</li>
            <li> I am not a person who brushes my teeth hard and they look like I might have had them for ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was not worth the cost</li>
            <li> So not worth it.</li>
            <li> Already, two heads have cracked and broken completely apart.  </li>
            <li> yea, pretty insane, right?)    </li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of another return down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> and then it shuts down).</li>
            <li> I have used my Diamond for about two years and it and the Sanitizer have never let me down.</li>
            <li> No one at the company would other than saying I could by another!</li>
            <li> It stopped working in less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> I paid less than the posted price at the moment.</li>
            <li> There really should be a class action lawsuit for selling these piles of crap that stop working for no reason at all.</li>
            <li> They then offered me the &amp;#34;opportunity&amp;#34; to buy another one at Black Friday prices.</li>
            <li> I would give them less than 1 star if that was an option.</li>
            <li> Ive had it for almost a year and a half</li>
            <li> I purchased two of the Toothbrushes (Black) about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> their cheesy graphics &amp; advertising; the company is based out of some local dental office in Oregon the last time I checked.</li>
            <li> The brushes are about half as dense as any name brand electric brush.</li>
            <li> Major rip-off.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll get a new Sonicare replacement head if and when this one fails on me.</li>
            <li> Does not clean as well as</li>
            <li> It may stop on the 3rd timed brushing because it is still hot on the base from charging.</li>
            <li> Hands down!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to say since my email inquiry to the company went unanswered.</li>
            <li> and I only had a little bit of plague built up behind my lower front few teeth.</li>
            <li> Product worked well for a few months.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Groupon for about $50 a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> Then I ended up packing it away for a few months.</li>
            <li> - you don&#x27;t want to charge it after every use, you want the battery to be close to dead before charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer and after 3 months is broken.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the time &amp; trouble of dealing with the Diamond Scammers.</li>
            <li> it is dead in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Go spend your money on a name brand device that will work well for years, don&#x27;t waste it on this.</li>
            <li> all of a sudden it wants to crap out on me.</li>
            <li> The office is manned by young casual labor and the phone is some woman&#x27;s cell</li>
            <li> It broke in less than 7 months of purchase!  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, I only just unboxed it last week (having lost track of &amp;#34;mommy&#x27;s infamous gift bin!</li>
            <li> I opened one of them this past week and it was dead.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality, my unit stopped working after less than 20 uses, company did not back it up with a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I contacted Bling Dental Products and was told that it was past the 90 day time frame and was not covered.  </li>
            <li> I called the company and all they could say was that they had that problem in the past</li>
            <li> worth $219!!!!!.This piece of crap wont charge.</li>
            <li> WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money in this crappy product!</li>
            <li> I had a small issue with the battery not taking a charge (which is my reason for 4 stars, rather than 5)</li>
            <li> I can understand things like that fail after several year but one???</li>
            <li> No legitimate company that fully backs the durability &amp; quality of its product will offer a lousy 90-day warranty; and then even that warranty contains so many exclusions that it renders it worthless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately waited too long (to return) til my reliable sonic care toothbrush head needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mailed a letter to the manufacturer to request a replacement and in response I received an email that told me that since it was past the 90 day warranty period, they were not responsible for anything that goes wrong with their product.  </li>
            <li> I refuse to believe I&#x27;m that hard on toothbrushes that I can crack FOUR.  </li>
            <li> am reading a lot of negative reviews on here after looking Amazon for replacement heads.</li>
            <li> but you have to put at least one star on it.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for a year or so now and it sucks.</li>
            <li> I use my Diamond at least twice a-day and always use the Sanitizer after each brushing.</li>
            <li> Wish it was at least recyclable</li>
            <li> I see a lot of really negative reviews here</li>
            <li> For all of you negative review posters, I recommend giving the company the opportunity to address the issue (if you do have one)</li>
            <li> Bad product, Cheap mad</li>
            <li> The base unit and sanitizing tray are difficult to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical due to the poor reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Complete piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> feel bad for my mom who spent this type of money on such a bad product.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush sucks!</li>
            <li> Dont buy this piece of shit, inst worht it!!!</li>
            <li> This is so frustrating.</li>
            <li> but I am trying out another brand of brush heads because I hear they fit on my base and the base still works well.</li>
            <li> Talking about lousy customer service.  </li>
            <li> the worst being that it would only turn on for 30 seconds at a time, then you have to wait 30 secs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Consequently, a failed product.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, you can imagine my disappointment that it was still not working.</li>
            <li> so so so unhappy with the product and the company.</li>
            <li> This item is dangerous.</li>
            <li> My husband bought them thinking that they were Sonicare&#x27;s and we needed to replace ours because one died and we were tired of sharing a base.  </li>
            <li> it was impossible.</li>
            <li> The company has zero customer service and are impossible to reach (wonder why).</li>
            <li> Me bad.</li>
            <li> Badly made.  </li>
            <li> After reading the bad reviews for this product I decided to buy it anyway.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe all these bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t get all the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> Bad KARMA doesn&#x27;t wash off in the bath.</li>
            <li> I am actually shocked by this development.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> S/H for 3 lousy brushes!!</li>
            <li> Please save your money and don&#x27;t buy this crap.  </li>
            <li> I just hate I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before I purchased.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is truly a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor: don&#x27;t buy this crap.</li>
            <li> This product is a piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worst toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever bought..</li>
            <li> Worst electric toothbrush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> They have horrible customer service.</li>

            <li> Piece of junk. Not worth the money. Didn&#x27;t hold a charge after three months. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product through an AmazonLocal deal. It worked for about 18 months then the sonic brush suddenly stopped working. I also had problems off and on with the sanitizer bulb.  It stopped working, after I ordered a new bulb it started working again with the original bulb, but then stopped working again.  I figure I got good use out of it for about a year and a half.  The two minute timer is a nice option and got me brushing more than I normally would. However, it would be nice to have a &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button when you need to stop in the middle for some reason. The base unit and sanitizing tray are difficult to keep clean.  I would have hoped a product like this would last longer, but I guess you get what you pay for. Might be worth buying an extended warranty if you are considering this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for over a year now, purchased via Amazon Local for a good price. My dentist and I have notice considerable improvement to my gum-line since switching to electric, so glad I did. Perhaps all it did was give me consistency, I love the 2 minute / 30-second cycle on this timer, it really helps unlearn bad habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am reading a lot of negative reviews on here after looking Amazon for replacement heads. I am pretty surprised - either I got lucky or these reviews on here are bogus. Either way, I am going to order another set of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I have had a wonderful experience with this product. It did a great job removing plaque. I could actually feel the difference with my tongue. The UV sanitizer was also appreciated.</li>
            <li> Please save your money and don&#x27;t buy this crap.  This toothbrush stops working before you get it out of the box.  You are better off using elbow grease and your own toothbrush instead of this shiny crap.  I would had given it NO stars but you have to put at least one star on it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worst toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever bought.. so CHEAPLY made. Do not buy this junk.. if you were to offer me this diamond ultrasonic brush or a regular toothbrush I&#x27;d pick the latter. Hands down! I&#x27;d pay $15 for this and still feel ripped off. There are much better options out there....</li>
            <li> I bought two of these on Groupon for $49. The first one broke after 6 months, the second broke after 3 months. It worked well while they lasted, though. Much better options on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago using a Groupon. I don&#x27;t remember what I paid but it was a great price. I bought replacement heads somewhere else and thought I would check Amazon now. 4 for $28. How do I beat that? Everything is still working great and my dental hygienist commented that I really have been taking care of my teeth, especially my gums. I actually floss less since I retired. Me bad. I love everything about this product, the 30 second &amp;#34;note&amp;#34;, UV light, removable basket and now I found reasonably priced replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this product. I got it and used it for 13 months before it just stopped working all together. Conveniently right after the 12 month warranty was up. I contacted the company because the handset went out and my only option was to buy a new handset for over $50 when the product its self only cost around $65. DO NOT BUY unless you want to have to buy a new one yearly.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush sucks! It stopped working in less than 6 months. I just hate I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before I purchased. This is definitely a rip off and some creep is getting rich off of us. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS JUNK!</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the other posters here.  I purchased two of the Diamond Ultrasonic Toothbrushes that have the UV Sanitizer through a Groupon deal the middle of last year.  I opened one of them this past week and it was dead.  I contacted Bling Dental Products and was told that it was past the 90 day time frame and was not covered.  Talking about lousy customer service.  They will never have me as a customer ever again.  I should have never bought anything other than Sonicare products.  Sonicare has a 2 year warranty and have great customer service.  You blew it Bling.  What a waste of money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this toothbrush.  I bought my husband and mother each one for Christmas last year.  Within the first two months they were both falling apart.  After one year my husbands would not even power on!  When he called customer service they admitted there are problems with this model and asked him if he would like to buy a new one.... Because I made the purchases over a year ago there was &amp;#34;nothing they could do&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Purchased this toothbrush directly from Bling Dental Products 15 months ago.  Worked good for one year and now it turns on/off, changes settings, won&#x27;t turn off, won&#x27;t turn on, turns on while putting toothpaste on it and the toothpaste flies everywhere.  I called the company and all they could say was that they had that problem in the past and as I have had it over one year, no guarantee. This is a $219 toothbrush!!  Wish I had read these reviews before purchasing. Please, stay away from this product and company.  As they know that they have or had this problem they could have offered a replacement at a discount.</li>
            <li> Read these reviews and HEED them. I got this Diamond thing as a backup for my trusty Sonni simply because I thought this one was cuter (blue light and all). Well, this one died and the Sonni is STILL going. When I buy another electric toothbrush, I&#x27;m going for Sonicare again -- because it WORKS.</li>
            <li> I bought this through Groupon, but wish I had researched it better. Reading the reviews I guess I&#x27;m lucky mine lasted as long as it did. It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore for longer than a single brushing and sometimes doesn&#x27;t work at all. I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> It functioned fine for about the first nine months.  I only used it once per day, using a regular toothbrush the other times.  Now it has stopped working.  Warranty is only 90 days.  Will never purchase another Bling product.</li>
            <li> Ours worked for 3 years before dying. Based on other reviews I found a new one on Groupon for $50 - I like it enough to buy it again. Make sure to keep the toothbrush head tray dry though - you don&#x27;t want water collecting in it and getting nasty - it&#x27;s a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had ours three years now and it still works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically I just bought a HealthPro Sonic Toothbrush Kit for traveling.  I chose it because it is much higher rated than the Diamone.  Sure enough, when I opened it up, it&#x27;s the EXACT same thing as this Diamond.  How can they be rated so differently???</li>
            <li> Product worked well for a few months. Bought replacement heads after which it stopped working. Now I am stuck with 3 replacement heads and no toothbrush! It was not worth the cost and I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for about a year, then it gradually deteriorated. I suspect the rechargeable battery was losing its power since turning it back on after running it was impossible. The battery probably can&#x27;t be replaced...it&#x27;s hard to say since my email inquiry to the company went unanswered. Ordered a Panasonic and am throwing out the Diamond.</li>
            <li> Sounded good.........but a lousey product.  Once they get your email address they are on you almost daily.  Replacement brushes didn&#x27;t fit and they said I must have ordered the wrong ones. I wish I&#x27;d have read the reviews prior to purchase consideration.  They should be out of business with the junk they sell!</li>
            <li> I really love my Dazzle Pro toothbrush. It has three different features of vibration,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;medium, fast,and medium with intervals. My favorite setting is medium with intervals. I am&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 years old and have braces so it is hard for me to clean around my braces with a normal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;toothbrush. My very favorite part of the Dazzle Pro is that every 30 seconds it pauses so that I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;know when it is time to rotate to a different section of my teeth. A very cool feature is during the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;time I am not using it, it cleans the brush with an ultraviolet light. The only thing I would change&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is that you have to replace the top of the toothbrush after each brushing.I would rate this 3.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stars.</li>
            <li> This worked fine for a couple of months and then started to have various problems, the worst being that it would only turn on for 30 seconds at a time, then you have to wait 30 secs. before it will turn on again-and again....So pretty useless. When I tried to call them to complain, the lines were always busy, and when they returned my call over a day later, of course, I was not available. Repeat many times-forget it, throw it away, get a different brand next time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush now for over 2 years and love it.  It is powerful, yet gentle on my teeth and gums, and the head is small enough to clean tough to reach places in my mouth.  The toothbrush has not given me any problems.  I am gentle when removing the toothbrush head, and I dry it thoroughly prior to placing it back on the charger.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Groupon for about $50 a few months ago. It sat in the box for a while. I was already using a Braun electric toothbrush. I was skeptical due to the poor reviews on Amazon. I&#x27;ve been having trouble with bleeding gums. No matter how much I brushed &amp; flossed, when I woke up in the morning &amp; rinsed my mouth out, it was red. My dentist wanted me to go to a periodontist. I started using the Diamond toothbrush. I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it at first. It takes getting used to. I also concentrated on my gums as the directions suggests. Within 2 weeks my bleeding has stopped! I have no bleeding , even when flossing. My gums look great. I am actually shocked by this development. I will never use another toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> I used this this toothbrush for a year and loved it, but then when I ordered replacement heads which came in a three pack, they all literally disintegrated within two weeks.  The company replaced the heads, and we received them last week.  Already, two heads have cracked and broken completely apart.  I don&#x27;t even know what I should ask Bling to do to remedy this situation.  Do I try yet another set of replacement heads, ask for a new toothbrush or ask for my money back???!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a crapshoot.  Ours quite after about 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion it is not in any way comparable to a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I paid less than the posted price at the moment. I am absolutely happy with this toothbrush.  I feel very clean after using it.  I&#x27;ve had it over a year and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Worst electric toothbrush I have ever owned.  And the chamber that supposedly uses light to sanitize your brush heads does not work at all!  Before this I had used Sonicare for over 10 yrs... back to Phillips for me.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is nothing but junk and a waste of good money.  Would never pay $150 for this.  Does not clean as well as my sonicare which I have had for many years and is now wearing out.  Bristles do not vibrate, and my teeth feel grimey when I am done brushing my teeth.  No recommendation from me except not to waste your good money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush by accident through an on-line deal. I though that I was buying a Philips Sonicare toothbrush but the ad was not very clear and instead I got the Diamond Ultrasonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is truly a piece of crap. Not only did it stop working less then a year of being used, but it also did not do a very good job of cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not purchase!!!</li>
            <li> I have had my Bling toothbrush for a couple years and it no longer works like it should. It is supposed to have (4) 30 second intervals but now only does 2 or 3 and won&#x27;t come back on for a full minute once it shuts itself off. For as much money as these things cost, I surely expected it to last longer. I have a cheap Braun electric toothbrush that I have had for at least 5 years. Since my Bling isn&#x27;t working properly, I got the Braun out of the cupboard and plugged it in and guess what?? IT still works!! I should have saved my money and stuck with the cheaper toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> Bought this tooth brush and then it stopped working 6 months later.  Guess what, they know that is going to happen.  That&#x27;s why they only offer a 90 day warranty!  Don&#x27;t buy it!  They tried to sell me another one at a \\&quot;discount.\\&quot;  50 bucks is not a discount for a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what these other reviewer&#x27;s are talking about.  This product is great!  I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year and it&#x27;s awesome.  My teeth have never been cleaner!</li>
            <li> We have only had ours for a few months but both my husband and I love ours.  We got them as a part of a daily deal or something so we didn&#x27;t pay anything close to the full price for them.  My husband bought them thinking that they were Sonicare&#x27;s and we needed to replace ours because one died and we were tired of sharing a base.  I&#x27;ll definitely agree that their website is super cheesy but I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> i ignored the reviews and decided to give this toothbrush a shot. really liked it at first, but it died within a week. would just flash, but nothing else would happen. it&#x27;s possible that it was a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34;, but i opted for a refund instead of a new one. just didn&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of another return down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in short, pay attention to these reviews.</li>
            <li> Complete piece of crap.  I purchased this toothbrush through a voucher program, and a couple of weeks after I received it, I noticed a crack in the bottom of the battery pack.  I figured MAYBE it was the result of me dropping it or something, so ordered another one.  A few weeks later, same thing.  I emailed the company and they were nice enough to replace BOTH of my broken models.  I started using one right away.  A few weeks later, another crack.  I kept one in the box for a long time, because I was over it.  Last week, I pulled out the second brand new one and started using it...then yesterday, I noticed...another crack.  I refuse to believe I&#x27;m that hard on toothbrushes that I can crack FOUR.  Badly made.  I had no problem with performance or the toothbrush itself, just that they would crack every time!!!</li>
            <li> Very good, makes me brush longer, that what my dentist will like.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these units (one for myself and one for a friend) well over a year ago, and they have been working GREAT - no problems what-so-ever!!! I also enrolled in the auto toothbrush head replacement program and my replacement brushes have been delivered every three months just as I asked. My friend and I find that this product works far better than what we used in the past. Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t live in a perfect world so some buyers are dissatisfied with this brand and its product(s). When I purchased my units I used a Groupon special and each unit was less than $50.00 each; so for the money and performance I am extremely satisfied and have gotten more than my money&#x27;s worth!  And when these units burn out I plan to purchase the exact same thing again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on July 5, 2013 and had been very satisfied with the brush so far. I was actually trying to purchase some as Christmas gifts but the Groupons has expired and $50 which is what I paid for it would be fine but not $200 plus like the suggested retail price. Especially after reading these reviews which according to them I should only have a few more months before I experience what they went through. Let&#x27;s hope not, so far it has been a very good brush. It cleans well and I like the sanitizer and the fact that it comes with 3 brush heads so you have spares or can share with your spouse. I will keep my Sonicare which I had no problem with until I replaced the brush head with the Wal-Mart brand, now it sounds like a chain saw so I&#x27;ll get a new Sonicare replacement head if and when this one fails on me.</li>
            <li> Like the three settings, and especially the case where the brushes get cleansed daily for great hygiene.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this a while ago.  Took out of box and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I agree, a piece of junk.  Will buy locally next time.</li>
            <li> Unlike most of the reviews, I have had a good experience. I got mine on groupon for 19.99 and have used it daily for over 2 years now. The UV light works great. Of course  the paint on the handle is starting to wear, anything that you hold in your hand for an extended amount of time that vibrates with any high frequency will wear out. Being so cheap to begin with, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but with Amazon&#x27;s great customer service, I say its worth a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a Groupon coupon. Unfortunately waited too long (to return) til my reliable sonic care toothbrush head needed to be replaced. Then I tried to charge this Powerful! Healthy! Beautiful!  Diamond Bling Ultrasonic toothbrush unit with UV Sanitizer worth $219!!!!!.This piece of crap wont charge. AT ALL.  The indicator lights up for a nano second, but then nothing happens. I am going out today to replace my sonic toothbrush heads. These are reliable</li>
            <li> After reading the bad reviews for this product I decided to buy it anyway. What a mistake! At first this toothbrush worked great, I even replaced my old OralB toothbrush with this. After about two months it just wasn&#x27;t getting my teeth clean. I found myself re-brushing my teeth after the two minute timer went off,and through the day my teeth would just feel dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the heads every month because they don&#x27;t last, they would fray, and some of the bristles would come off and get stuck in my teeth. After three months I bought the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean toothbrush, and I love it.I will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned my lesson, and I&#x27;m going to stick with a brand that works.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Diamond Ultrasonic for about a year and a half and have been quite happy with it.  I purchased it at a reduced price through a Groupon or Amazonlocal deal. My gum disease has halted it&#x27;s progression and I like that the brushheads are sanitized after each use.&lt;br /&gt;I have recently had an issue with my toothbrush turning off after 1 minute of use.  I did find that it will go back on and run for the 2 minutes after a few minutes.  However, I called the company directly to see if they could offer any suggestions,and they offered me a great deal on another toothbrush, if I chose to give them another try, either now or in the future.  It was so good that I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with their customer service, in my opinion, they seem more than willing to do whatever is necessary to satisfy their customers.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two years. I works great. It takes good care of my teeth, between the teeth. I especially like the soft brush head. Now I am looking for deals to buy another one, because the battery gets shorter life.</li>
            <li> Always had a regular toothbrush.  Made the switch after a recommendation from a coworker.  Been happy for over a year!</li>
            <li> Oh my god. This is so frustrating. My mom bought me and my brother one of these and BOTH stopped working after about 8 months.  What a piece of garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad for my mom who spent this type of money on such a bad product.  There really should be a class action lawsuit for selling these piles of crap that stop working for no reason at all.</li>
            <li> Pc of S,..., didn&#x27;t even charge the first time plugin.Cheating Company.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe all these bad reviews.  I&#x27;ve had this item for over two years and has worked flawlessly.  The battery finally died and won&#x27;t take a full charge. Bought it from Groupon and just bought another one. When new it lasts about a week between charges with two people using it if you don&#x27;t put it back on the cradle. Sanitation  light comes on for 2 minutes. Dentist even noticed a difference in my check ups, virtually no plaque.</li>
            <li> I had used in for about 3 weeks,  seemed to be working fine. Then I ended up packing it away for a few months. Pulled it out recently plugged it in to charge and guess what. Won&#x27;t charge. Just doesn&#x27;t work. I have tried everything. So basically I got 3 weeks of work from this cheap toothbrush then it quit working. I got it for a special price but still I paid $70.00. So not worth it. Put that money towards a good name brand toothbrush!! Trust me!!</li>
            <li> 1st of all there is space for 4 toothbrushes and they only supply 3. The toothbrushes are way too soft and don&#x27;t last long at all. I normally use soft toothbrushes but these are the softest toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> Great, son was very pleased</li>
            <li> This is the first Amazon review I have ever posted.  I bought this item through a Groupon promotion in September 2011 for $69.  I stored it unopened and unused, with the intention of gifting it to my daughter for Christmas that year.  Admittedly, I only just unboxed it last week (having lost track of &amp;#34;mommy&#x27;s infamous gift bin! - LOL) Nevertheless, I unpacked it from the packaging and plugged it in so that it would be charged up for her on Christmas day.&lt;br /&gt;The blue light comes on, so I know the power unit does get power, but the brush does not charge.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Bling and they said that it was outside of the warranty period and that they could not replace it (a reputable company would, given that it was unused and new in box).  They then offered me the &amp;#34;opportunity&amp;#34; to buy another one at Black Friday prices. for another $50.  I politely responded that I was unwilling to make another investment in a product that I didn&#x27;t trust.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this.  Spend a little more and purchase from a reputable company.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going  to do... any recommendations, people?</li>
            <li> You can do much better than the Diamond Ultrasonic. The brush started losing charging capability after about 6 months. The brush heads are cheaply made, I couldn&#x27;t get more than a few weeks out of one before it started to fray and go flat. Also, the contoured design of the Sonicare brush gives a much more thorough cleaning than the Diamond&#x27;s brush. Customer service from the website was non existent when trying to order new ones, then I decided it was just foolish to continue using this product when my Phillips Sonicare is far superior and I can easily buy replacement heads (better quality and less expensive) at just about any drug store or major retailer. Diamond is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth, save yourself the headache and look for something else.</li>
            <li> The reason they only give a 90 day warranty is because they know it&#x27;s junk.  I have had this for 8 months and it just quit working.  At about 6 months, it would work intermittently.  It was not used hard as I am the sole user plus I didn&#x27;t use it everyday because I was still using my Oral B Sonic which is over 5 years old. I would never buy anything from this company.</li>
            <li> First electronic brush. Had it for several months before we left it on cruise ship by mistake. Tried my daughters Sonic care, and in my mind there is no comparison. My mouth did not feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nevere left a review. I find it hard to believe, but this product in the 3 months I had it, before loosing was fantastic. I am now buying another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thin brush head, soft bristles, the timer, the ultraviolet light cleaner, all worked as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own this, but the name and description are false and misleading. A dentist sometimes uses an ultrasonic device to clean teeth. This brush is a sonic brush, not an ultrasonic one. Ultrasound is sound of a pitch that is too high for humans to hear. At 30,000 pulses per minute, this brush head vibrates at only 500 times per second or 500 Hz. Humans can hear up to 25,000 Hz or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hype makes me not want this.</li>
            <li> First, let me say how excited I was to get this toothbrush because I&#x27;ve been wanting an electric toothburh in a while and when I saw it on sale and I got it immediately without reading any reviews. It worked ok for about less than three months. After that the UV sanitizer stopped working. I didn&#x27;t think much of it because I thought the light bulb had gone out so I spent the $19.99+shipping to buy a new one. When it arrived, you can imagine my disappointment that it was still not working. By the time the new bulb arrived, I was already a couple of days over the 3-month warranty period so I couldn&#x27;t return it. Within about 6 months of using the brush, the 2-minute timer would stop working and the brush would turn off after 1 minute and you have to push the buton about 15-20 times to have it turn on again. And, about 10 months after I bought it, it completely stopped working (it turns on for about 2 seconds and then it shuts down). It&#x27;s a complete piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Bought this system with a Groupon deal (Thank God!) and paid $50 for it. It was only worth the $50 I paid for it...I bought it and it worked as it said it would. Didn&#x27;t clean as well as I hoped considering I&#x27;d previously used a Sonicare Ultrasonic toothbrush like many of the other reviewers had. But! IT DID WORK AS DESCRIBED...problem is, it stopped working about a month ago (Nov &#x27;13) and I bought it Oct &#x27;12; while the company has a 1-year warranty from the shipping date. So, they won&#x27;t replace the toothbrush that I purchased from them that has now ceased to provide the &amp;#34;ultrasonic&amp;#34; movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now I have a $50 standard toothbrush, OH, with a removable head that I can sanitize with the UV light built into the dock, that I no longer need because the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t need to be charged. Is a toothbrush with removable heads and a UV sanitation device worth $50? NO, I can get a sanitizer for $30 and I can buy a new toothbrush for less than $5!?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, though I wish I HAD!  I&#x27;d sent it back.  I began having problems with it almost immediately.  There are 3 or 4 speeds (you have to push the button and it goes from one speed to another) and mine would automatically go to a lower speed so I had to keep turning it off and back on again.  Then, it began to stop...just stop while brushing.  I could turn it back on but after a few more weeks it wouldn&#x27;t turn back on.  I&#x27;m not going to return it because frankly, I don&#x27;t WANT another one of these pieces of crap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one reviewer stated...  I should have read the reviews.  And I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t!  Next time I will!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for a year or so now and it sucks. I find I still have plaque on my teeth after brushing, and food particles as well if I forget to floss. I have tried different methods changed the settings but I have come to realize the brush is just a piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sterilizer is pretty much useless, when the brush heads are kept in there they stay wet until the next use. So if the 8 minutes of blue light miss anything on the dark side of the brush you have an even better bacterial breeding ground than when allowed to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my last brush head and after that I am going to deal with the $ loss and switch back to a manual brush. or get a philips sonicare</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a week of use.  If it pops up as a local deal, don&#x27;t waste the money.  BTW:  I accidentally got it to work.  As I was getting ready to toss it, I dropped it on the carpet.  It started working again.  You can&#x27;t trust the product.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my daughter two  years ago but it remained unopened until this Christmas when she decided she wanted to use it.  She took it out of the box used it once and that was all she wrote.  Didn&#x27;t work after that and to add insult to injury the company said the warranty period had expired and there was nothing they could do because they had to be fair to their other customers.  Apparently there have been many customers with the same issues.  They did offer me the opportunity to buy another one.  I will never buy another product from this company and would advise others to do the same.  I would give them less than 1 star if that was an option.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is a piece of junk. Had it two months and it broke. 60 day return policy so they obviously knew they had junk</li>
            <li> Bad product, Cheap mad</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews from others and &amp;#34;hearing&amp;#34; their complaints I have to totally disagree with the vast majority of them. My Bling Diamond is an excellent product. I have used my Diamond for about two years and it and the Sanitizer have never let me down. I use my Diamond at least twice a-day and always use the Sanitizer after each brushing. Before my Diamond I had a Jager by Bling for about 1 year during which it always performed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using my Bling toothbruses my dentist and my hygienist have commented on how excellent my teeth have gotten with regards to lower plaque buildup, healthier gums and the whitening it gives my teeth. I really laugh when referring to it as a &#x27;brush&#x27; since all I do is hold it on my teeth and it does its job. I liked my Diamond so much that I went and purchased one for my wife who now loves her as well.  It truly has helped her since she got braces and you have to take extra care of your teeth when wearing braces.  The dentist and hygienist (different hygienist then I have) have commented on how well her teeth have done since she started using her Diamond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I bought this item a while back, but just started to use it recently.  Had trouble with taking off the brush from the very beginning and finally when I pull it off, the brush broke.  Contacted costumer service but their warranty is only for 3 months! What kind of a great product is this, if it has such a short warranty.  If it was so good, it would be warrantied for much longer.  Rip off! Don&#x27;t buy it.  I had to give it 1 star, because no stars is not an option!</li>
            <li> It stopped working after 4 months. I used it 1-2 times per week b/c I got teeth sensitivity then the toothbrush stopped working ...only buzzing. It is a scheme based on advertising. I am thinking about a legal action. Why the system gives a teeth sensitivity??!! I called their customer service. No call back till now. I will post update when they answer my phone message.</li>
            <li> Purchased 3 of these units about 18 months ago on Groupon.  Paid $59 each.  Now $49.  All 3 units are still working great.  UV sanitizer, GREAT.  Had to purchase replacement toothbrushes twice now (which I don&#x27;t like - but you have to do this with any brush) because it works so well / and its longevity.  Would I pay the $219 retail?  NO.  Would I paid $129?  NO.  But for $49 and $59?  Yes.  We all love this.  Especially the sanitizing feature.  This is made just as good as the others if not better (depending on the brand).  I just don&#x27;t get all the bad reviews.  Could I be the only one who received the ONLY 3 that worked, lasted and were made well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I am just extremely lucky then, but at any rate, we love them and I just purchased another one on Groupon today for $49 as a birthday gift.  Hope I get as lucky as when I bought the original 3.  It just seems really strange that the 3 I purchased can be sooooo great, yet all the others sold apparently suck??  Makes me nervous about purchasing this 4th one, but the 3 we have are excellent and still running strong 18 months later.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a Groupon deal over a year ago, and I wish I had read the reviews here first. It doesn&#x27;t clean teeth properly, malfuntions in less than a year, the silver cheapo paint rubbed off after only a month, etc. Wish it was at least recyclable somehow!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an electric toothbrush before, but this one does seem like very good quality, way more than I thought it was gonna be after reading the reviews on here! UV light is a great feature and works great, my teeth have been a lot cleaner ever since I started using it, and the timer to switch between sections of teeth is extremely helpful. I don&#x27;t see this thing breaking anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money in this crappy product! Mine last 8 months and the battery is dead for good! No one at the company would other than saying I could by another!</li>
            <li> I bought this about 1.5 years ago on Groupon. The brush still works great and has kept my teeth very clean but I have not been able to use the UV part for quite some time because of an extremely foul smell coming from it. I asked Bling customer service and they told me they would do nothing because it had been more than 90 days. It was even one of those generic responses that had nothing to do with my message to them and showed that they just send auto responses without even reading what you send them. I replied to their message and was sent another generic response. They have horrible customer service. Thank god I did not pay full price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again but I am trying out another brand of brush heads because I hear they fit on my base and the base still works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a good toothbrush for 2 years now.  I&#x27;m happy with it.  Easy to clean.  It seems to be as good as my Sonicare was.  The only  downside is getting a replacement UV Light.  I can&#x27;t find one (they Bling site is &#x27;out of stock&#x27;), which is why I ended up here looking for one.  But as far as the Toothbrush is concerned, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush before the multitude of reviews you see here.  This is a piece of garbage.  The brushes are of the poorest quality and wear out very quickly.  It costs between $20 and $30 for three of these brushes, depending if you want to lock yourself into a scheduled order.  I was not convinced that I could easily cancel the scheduled reorder easily if I started it.  At $7 to $10 a toothbrush you might think that they would be better than the quality you might get from the free toothbrushes given out at hotels when you forget yours. This is not the case.  The brushes begin flattening out as soon as you use them.  I am not a person who brushes my teeth hard and they look like I might have had them for ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this junk here or when they offer it for peanuts on Groupon. You&#x27;re better off with a simple toothbrush or spending the money of a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I bought this item from Groupon (like everyone else it seems) back in April of 2012.  I didn&#x27;t start using it right away - I think it was a month or two before I began using it.  But when I did begin using it, it was overheating.  I emailed Bling Dental and they shipped me something to send the toothbrush back to them for free.  After determining that it was overheating, they sent me a whole new set-up in July of 2012 (including three more brush heads for free!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it daily for the past 2+ years with no issues.  What I have learned about electronics is that to keep your battery working to it&#x27;s fullest potential, don&#x27;t charge it every day.  I only charge mine after the battery has died and I go weeks between charging.  Same thing as with an iPod or phone batteries - you don&#x27;t want to charge it after every use, you want the battery to be close to dead before charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue now, after I&#x27;ve used up my 6 free brush heads, is that I need to buy more and I don&#x27;t want to buy 3 for $29.99 from their website (even after receiving 10 free &amp;#34;BLING BUCK$&amp;#34; and bringing the total to $24.94 with shipping).  They have much cheaper replacement heads on Amazon, so I&#x27;m going to buy some and give them a try and will update if I find some that are compatible to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Wife bought it for me Christmas 2013, I&#x27;ve used a year with no problem.  The only issue I can see after a year of use is the battery life is starting to taper off.  It used to run for 7 days strong, now it is noticeably weaker by day 6.  Mind you when she bought it, it was from around 50% of what it is going for on here (a Groupon I believe), so I&#x27;d say that is a good deal.  Whatever issues they had with it dying they might have fixed, or maybe I just got lucky, but this one has worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor: don&#x27;t buy this crap. I traded my reliable Sonicare brushes (which I used for 3+ years, regularly replacing the brushes as Sonicare suggests) for this cheap toothbrush, thiking it was an equivalent.  MISTAKE! This toothbrush stopped working 6 months later. Now I won&#x27;t buy their whitening gel either because I don&#x27;t trust this company (and their customer service is non-existent).  This so-called Dr. Raymond is getting rich by ripping off well-meaning consumers!</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer and after 3 months is broken. Dont buy this piece of shit, inst worht it!!! i called them and because i ordered more than 3 months ago they want me to pay 50 bucks for a new one... so so so unhappy with the product and the company.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a year. The company has zero customer service and are impossible to reach (wonder why). Please save your money and buy any other mainstream electric toothbrush on sale here at Amazon. I bought mine through -- of course -- Groupon, and so have no recourse but to toss it in the garbage. Where it belongs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m editing my review because after 4 years, the UV light finally went out. FOUR YEARS! (I was able to find cheaper heads through Pursonic.) I think my total investment on the toothbrush and heads was about $125. I think that&#x27;s a pretty good deal for four years.  Original post: I bought mine about two years ago. Everything still works fine. It cleans my mouth, and I didn&#x27;t expect it to do any more. No cavities, ever, so I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s the brush. I bought it mainly for the UV sanitation. It was a lot cheaper via Groupon than the other sanitizing units sold at the time. I do really like that I don&#x27;t have to guess at how long to brush. I would give it 5 stars if the heads were compatible with anything else. EDIT: Pursonic replacement brush heads are apparently a match. They are cheaper than buying through Bling.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of really negative reviews here so I feel like it is my duty to try and balance it out a bit. I bought this product several years ago with a groupon. I think I paid 50-60 dollars for it. It has worked perfectly. I went to the dentist for the first time in about 10 years and I only had a little bit of plague built up behind my lower front few teeth. So...yeah...works for me.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a year and a half now and have been very pleased w/it.  The product is still in one piece and fully recharges w/in 4 hours lasting appx 3 wk.  Considering that I love to drink coffee this brush has helped tremendously to keep the staining down. In regards to the reviewer who had the diamond head knocking on his teeth, yes this will happen if you dont open the cavity enough to move the toothbrush around to the back side and once ya hit your teeth with the vibration it gives a clue to move the brush.</li>
            <li> I got this tooth brush as my first ultrasonic toothbrush and it works great! I went to the dentist before I started using this product and then I went back to the dentist and she said it was night and day difference! She could not believe how great my mouth looked!</li>
            <li> We have two of these, one older than the other boy from Gropon We have used these for several years with no problems. It may stop on the 3rd timed brushing because it is still hot on the base from charging. Just run some cold water over it or let it cool for a while. We only charge when it needs it not daily.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are so many negative reviews; granted I got this on a Groupon for less than $100. I would not pay more than that for any electric type of toothbrush anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had mine for over a year now and it still works great. Used 2-3x per day for one person. The only downside is I&#x27;m not sure how long the UB bulb is actually beneficial in terms of sanitizing the brush heads (my bulb is still working, just not sure how long the light does its job).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging station works fine, mine has gotten damp plenty of times sitting on the sink and it is still working just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, my new dentist who has been seeing me every 1-3 months for Invisalign treatment keeps commenting on how clean my teeth are. The hygienists literally don&#x27;t have anything to do when they see me. This can only be attributed to changing my style of toothbrush (and making a point of flossing every day consistently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money if you can get one on a coupon/Groupon deal!</li>
            <li> I purchased this through the Amazon local deals and, fortunately, only paid a few bucks for it. Good thing, it lasted a few months and then the replaceable head broke off (it was always challenging to remove) and the toothbrush stared to have to recharged every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it worked well - but it didn&#x27;t last any longer than some grocery store available electric toothbrush. I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than $25 on it.</li>
            <li> Ive had it for almost a year and a half and it continues to work perfectly.  I more than got my money&#x27;s worth since I only paid $69.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of the Toothbrushes (Black) about a year ago.  I had a small issue with the battery not taking a charge (which is my reason for 4 stars, rather than 5) but I contacted the company and they took good care of me -- the staff seems to really care about delivery great customer service.  For all of you negative review posters, I recommend giving the company the opportunity to address the issue (if you do have one) BEFORE you blast the web.  Bad KARMA doesn&#x27;t wash off in the bath.</li>
            <li> Received this product as a Christmas gift.  I used it for over a month and loved it.  The experience of brushing with this thing after coming from a regular toothbrush was very satisfying.  I can&#x27;t say my teeth are sparkling white yet, but by whole mouth felt a lot cleaner!  Battery lasted two weeks with 2 people using it daily.  After a little over a month one of the brushing modes stopped working, and then the whole thing stopped working.  Customer service is sending me a replacement.  I&#x27;ll update this posting if I have any future issues.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these on Groupon about fifteen months ago. My wife and i love them. No problems at all. I would recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product to everyone. My guess is, with the people that had problems with them, that they did not use and clean them properly.&lt;br /&gt;Consequently, a failed product.</li>
            <li> In all fairness the toothbrush actually did clean slightly better than my Sonic Care.  The real gripe with the toothbrush resided in the poorly constructed brush head.  On numerous occasions the plastic side of the brush head would vibrate and hit my back tooth with such force that it would cause tooth pain for several hours.  I know that if I continued to use this I would have eventually chipped one of my teeth, so for that reason alone steer clear of this brush.</li>
            <li> Another piece of junk from Groupon.... This guy should be ashamed coming up with this. Tooth brush worked fine for the first several month then the whole thing went down to pit. First the silver paint fell off then you notice the brush can not hold a charge.... It stopped 20 secs into my brushing and will not turn back on. I can understand things like that fail after several year but one??? Come on now. I expected a little more value than that. Look elsewhere for a tooth brush!</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush 3 months ago and it has puked out.  There was a short in the electronics and in turn created a hot spot.  Burned my wife&#x27;s hand.  Maybe a lawsuit here.  This item is dangerous.</li>
            <li> My wife and I used some of our wedding money to buy this Bling Dental Products brand toothbrush using a Groupon.  It broke in less than 7 months of purchase!  Only the two of us were using it--once in the morning, once at night.  We even read and followed the manufacturer&#x27;s directions for use and followed these instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What went wrong?&lt;br /&gt;--4 months in: stopped holding a charge properly&lt;br /&gt;--6 months in: the metallic paint on the handle of the toothbrush started to chip off&lt;br /&gt;--7 months in: toothbrush would not turn on; button doesn&#x27;t respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mailed a letter to the manufacturer to request a replacement and in response I received an email that told me that since it was past the 90 day warranty period, they were not responsible for anything that goes wrong with their product.  They concluded by telling me to \\&quot;Have a Blingtastic day.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!  Buy a name-brand electric toothbrush instead.  They&#x27;re a little more expensive but actually continue working thus costing less in the long run.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, my unit stopped working after less than 20 uses, company did not back it up with a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, I&#x27;ve been using the Bling Diamond tooth brush for a little over a month now and I am completely satisfied with its performance. My teeth feel a whole lot cleaner and I love the fact that the brush pulsates every thirth second to let you know how far along you are in your 2 minute brush. The UV light sanitizer is also a great feature to have with this brush.</li>
            <li> This product is a piece of crap.  The heads kept disintegrating in my mouth.  When I called customer service they did replace the heads one time.  But the problem kept happening after just one brusing.  They made it seem like it was my fault.  I told them I&#x27;d used Sonicare for 15 years and NEVER had that problem.  They wouldnt refund my money.  Thank god for these reviews.  Do not waste your money on this Bling Diamond Ultrasonic.  Major rip-off.  I&#x27;m back to my Sonicare and loving it!</li>
            <li> so glad I read the reviews as my unit has also broken after about 9 months. Was going to look to replace it but not  now. It&#x27;s too bad because I really liked it but if it&#x27;s going to keep breaking I&#x27;ll find another brand. Thanks everybody.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s no wonder this item has to constantly be marketed &amp; sold through coupon giants like Groupon &amp; LivingSocial because there is no way in hell the product would survive in retail stores. I purchased this Bling Diamond Power Toothbrush via Groupon last year &amp; have recently started experiencing major functionality issues with the product. Now, every time I press the power button (which activates the 3 different brush modes), the piece of s*** brush begins to act up &amp; refuses to stay set on the mode that I select; instead it cycles through &amp; completely powers off after about 5-10 seconds of brushing. I&#x27;ve been using this brush w/o major issue for a while now &amp; all of a sudden it wants to crap out on me. Also, it&#x27;s important to note that you CANNOT purchase replacement heads at any retail store!!! Due to the proprietary (er, cheap) nature of the brush, you cannot use any standard replacement head found at your local Walmart or Target; you have to order it from the mfg.&#x27;s website, of which they charge you a WHOPPING $29.99+ S/H for 3 lousy brushes!! (Simple math will tell you that&#x27;s roughly $10/brush head; yea, pretty insane, right?)    I am normally more suspicious about innocuous knockoff products like this from brand names that I&#x27;ve never heard of, but for some reason decided to just go ahead &amp; buy the Groupon when I saw it; DO NOT FALL FOR THIS MISTAKE THAT I MADE. No legitimate company that fully backs the durability &amp; quality of its product will offer a lousy 90-day warranty; and then even that warranty contains so many exclusions that it renders it worthless. I can assure you if this product ever made it to retail, then the return/defective rate would be sky high.    Stick to the brands you know &amp; that actually back their power toothbrushes with solid warranties: for example, the Oral-B brushes come packaged w/ a 90-Day satisfaction guarantee PLUS a 2-yr warranty. And the replacement heads are affordable &amp; can be found on the go at any discount store. Doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out that this sh!tbrush offered by the Diamond Scammers is a ripoff from the start w/ their cheesy graphics &amp; advertising; the company is based out of some local dental office in Oregon the last time I checked. All in all, I highly advise you to stay away from this brush &amp; go with a familiar brand. Save yourself the time &amp; trouble of dealing with the Diamond Scammers.</li>
            <li> I bought this using a Groupon a while back, I believe the price was in the $50 - $70 range.  I have had this for well over a year without any problems at all.  I love the toothbrush, although I the replacement heads can be a little pricy as you have to buy everything direct from Bling Dental.  If I had to do it again, I would buy this toothbrush again in a heartbeat if I could get it for the Groupon price.  But at $219, I would likely consider looking at competing products - just on price alone.  Hell, I would expect a human being to come with the tootbrush who would brush my teeth for me at that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only electric/electronic toothbrush I have owned and it has really helped my teeth.  I am very satisfied with this purchase, I just likely won&#x27;t replace it at that steep price should anything happen to it.  4 stars as I like the product, taking 1 star off for the amazon price compared to what I paid using Groupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - My girlfriend also bought the toothbrush around the same time and she hasn&#x27;t had any problems with hers either.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 2 years ago because I got a discount via Groupon. When I first got it everything worked great. I could take it on 4-5 day trips without a worry. While it currently still works the battery will not last 1 day. It needs to constantly be on the charger if you want to use it - if I brush my teeth at night and don&#x27;t put it on the charger it is dead in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has had her name brand ultrasonic toothbrush for over 4 years and still takes it on trips without a problem. Looking at other reviews I guess I should be lucky that mine still works at all after 2 years. Go spend your money on a name brand device that will work well for years, don&#x27;t waste it on this.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this unit. It has lasted and lasted and lasted. I&#x27;ve had it for years and the ultra violet sanitizing bulb just went out.</li>
            <li> SWITCHED from the more expensive ultrasonic after years and don&#x27;t like it.I have had this for a few months and have noticed a huge decrease in enamel, and no i don&#x27;t brush with a heavy hand and yes i use the gentle setting. I feel that it has increased sensitivity a LOT and now I have these spots where i need fillings bc the enamel has completely come off my teeth. :**( the material is cheap and the bristles have irritated the living heck out of my gums. will be going back to my old toothbrush asap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for exactly one week. It was working perfectly fine until last night. After the first 30 second increment it died. Pushed the power button and it would turn on for about 2 seconds then just fade out. If this thing wasn&#x27;t being used for brushing it has been sitting on the charger. Bought this with a voucher from Amazon Local deals. I feel for anyone that has bought this thing at full price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention that this product feels really really cheap. If you&#x27;ve owned any other quality electric toothbrush you&#x27;ll know that this thing feel like a fragile toy. What a piece of junk!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is shoddily made of very cheap materials. The brushes are about half as dense as any name brand electric brush. The motors and lights fail practically out of the box in huge numbers. The office is manned by young casual labor and the phone is some woman&#x27;s cell phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; from Amazon local about ten days ago, and thank God, though I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to read reviews first, I was smart enough to trust Amazon. On third use, this toothbrush became a doorstop. The UV, which is the primary reason I bought it, stopped working. The brush motor just buzzed on off on off on off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next day, I emailed the company and heard nothing back. When I pursued them I got a very young girl who just repeated, \\&quot;We&#x27;ll send you a label, then when we receive the toothbrush back, we&#x27;ll process a replacement.\\&quot; They had my money now, and wanted the product sent back. I wanted a refund, not another low grade, offshore, gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some very young, inexperienced guy, the \\&quot;manager\\&quot; called me back from a cell phone that was identified as Samantha Smith and lectured me on how they couldn&#x27;t offer as good a guarantee as SonicCare because they&#x27;re a new company. Actually, I never mentioned SonicCare and have never dealt with them. I&#x27;ve used another name-brand brush that cost about $70 and has worked for, I kid you not, over 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up on this kid, and called Amazon, explained the issue, they gave me a full credit in about thirty seconds and I pitched the Bling thing in the trash. This product is nothing special, cleans about as well as a $3 non-electric, and is very likely to fail before you even become friends with it. Pass on this.</li>
            <li> Name is awfully similar to the Sonicare Diamondclean, no?  Don&#x27;t be fooled into buying this product, one look at all the other reviews should tell you plenty.</li>
