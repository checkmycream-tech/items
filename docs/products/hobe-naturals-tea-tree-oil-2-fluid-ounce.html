            <li>good price.  </li>
            <li>Have not compared but appears to be good quality and working out well for the antiseptic purposes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to relief itchy skin, and it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is a great product for many dermatological purposes.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if the manufacturer thought of adding it.</li>
            <li>has a pleasant, clean smell.</li>
            <li>I am pleased that I chose it over others that were also available but had reviews that were not as good.</li>
            <li>Love tea tree oil for my acne prone skin - prevents and reduces acne!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>and after days my dog was relief and did not scratch any more...</li>
            <li>This was a great price and it really boosts the power and smell of our homemade laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a seperate bottle with a dropper tip, so I could have saved money and bought a better tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>oil is of good quality and works very well on my skin!</li>
            <li>Very good value overall.</li>
            <li>I tried it when I noticed one of my dogs was scratching so much, and I checked it and have kind of rash, and I applied the oil in some areas where was more critic...</li>
            <li>It has a strong, pine-y scent; the oil is very light and gets absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a generous amount of the essential oil and comes nicely packaged in case anyone wanted to get it as a gift.</li>
            <li>The quality great at 100%, however this brand has a more sour smell than other brands of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>and it got better the following day...</li>
            <li>I used to use it many years ago for minor scraps and injuries.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I didn&#x27;t have any patients to speak with actually in my office yesterday.</li>
            <li>I really like the box it comes in and</li>
            <li>No scars, fast healing, and smells &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>Straight natural!!!</li>
            <li>This product is pure and I can tell it is of high quality.  </li>
            <li>The oil itself seems to be a fine product, the packaging is really cute, but is overall a waste of oil and money to not have a drip regulator on it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>4- the bites are completely gone!</li>
            <li>sure not to use to much since only a few drops are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the bottle is dark which is appropriate for an essential oil.</li>
            <li>There are so many different healing remedies, and I first used it to let my nose stud piercing heal, and it healed in a matter of two days (by healing, I mean that dreaded &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; has fully disappeared).</li>
            <li>and I use a plastic pipet that came with old synthetic oil refreshened I no longer purchase anyway.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use tea tree oil, and based on other people&#x27;s description of how it&#x27;s supposed to be, this product fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I use it in grapeseed oil for excema and general skin care.  </li>
            <li>The past weekend, mosquitos decided that I was too sweet to resist, and decided to attack my body to no end.</li>

            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m missing here is a dropper cap.</li>

            <li> It does have a bit of a sour smell to it as some people pointed out, and that scent lingers.  </li>
            <li> so when you try to pour the oil it, of course, pours down the side of the bottle causing a lot of waste.</li>
            <li> Also it smells slightly different from my previous tea tree oil by a different manufacturer (which may or may not be bad).</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what that means other than it&#x27;s a little unpleasant to deal with.</li>
            <li> The other annoying thing is that it doesnt have a dropper tip, so it just pours out everywhere.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This seems to be a good quality oil for a good price. Item arrived quickly, as expected. Very good value overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to purchasing tea tree oil at a retail store. While convenient to have items delivered to the office the bottle had leaked. By the time I got home I was nauseous from breathing tea tree  vapor 4 hours. I had to leave office door open to air out the odor somewhat. Fortunately I didn&#x27;t have any patients to speak with actually in my office yesterday. Yet and still this is a very good oil. Gave 2 stars only because of leakage and having to breathe the fumes all afternoon.</li>
            <li> I really like the box it comes in and the bottle is dark which is appropriate for an essential oil. However, there is not a regulating tip on the bottle, just the bottle opening so when you try to pour the oil it, of course, pours down the side of the bottle causing a lot of waste. Also it smells slightly different from my previous tea tree oil by a different manufacturer (which may or may not be bad). I don&#x27;t doubt that it is essential oil because when I tried to use a plastic orange stick to transfer drops of the oil, it removed the finish on the stick. The oil itself seems to be a fine product, the packaging is really cute, but is overall a waste of oil and money to not have a drip regulator on it.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly, works great... good price.  Have not compared but appears to be good quality and working out well for the antiseptic purposes I needed it for.</li>
            <li> I use in my home made cleaning products.  I wish it had a dropper plug but it works great and I use a plastic pipet that came with old synthetic oil refreshened I no longer purchase anyway.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use tea tree oil, and based on other people&#x27;s description of how it&#x27;s supposed to be, this product fits the bill. It has a strong, pine-y scent; the oil is very light and gets absorbed very quickly. It&#x27;s very concentrated, so a few drops is all you need. It leaves a tingling, cooling sensation that is very nice. I&#x27;ve used it to relief itchy skin, and it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of tea tree oil in home-made skin care products. This is a generous amount of the essential oil and comes nicely packaged in case anyone wanted to get it as a gift. The only thing I&#x27;m missing here is a dropper cap. Would be nice if the manufacturer thought of adding it.</li>
            <li> Great tea tree oil works as it should, but needs to be diluted before use as it is so concentrated.</li>
            <li> Love tea tree oil for my acne prone skin - prevents and reduces acne!&lt;br /&gt;This oil is of good quality and works very well on my skin! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I swear by tea tree oil. There are so many different healing remedies, and I first used it to let my nose stud piercing heal, and it healed in a matter of two days (by healing, I mean that dreaded &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; has fully disappeared). The past weekend, mosquitos decided that I was too sweet to resist, and decided to attack my body to no end. I dabbed tea-tree oil on the bite marks, and the swelling/itching/redness immediately went away. It is now day 4- the bites are completely gone! No scars, fast healing, and smells &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34;. I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it for pimple breakouts, cleaning cuts and in my hair. I love the smell. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great oil and value. The only reason it didnt get five stars is that is has no dropper. This creates wasted oil when you only need a little. Other than that it does a greay variety of jobs for home and health.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is a great product for many dermatological purposes.  This product is pure and I can tell it is of high quality.  I am pleased that I chose it over others that were also available but had reviews that were not as good.</li>
            <li> Great oil!!!!love that it&#x27;s authentic tea tree!!! Straight natural!!!</li>
            <li> I have used tea oil on the recommendation of a dear friend.  I used to use it many years ago for minor scraps and injuries. And, somehow, over time, I just got away from it.  Something simple like I just ran out and forgot to pick it up on my next trip to the store.  I am so renewed with tea oil and all of its uses.</li>
            <li> I am using it for different skin issues and I have noticed it works !&lt;br /&gt;also have a lot of other uses you can find them searching in internet.&lt;br /&gt;also I tried it when I noticed one of my dogs was scratching so much, and I checked it and have kind of rash, and I applied the oil in some areas where was more critic... and it got better the following day... and after days my dog was relief and did not scratch any more... I check and she was healed.</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil on my scalp (to relieve symptoms of psoriasis) and on my face (in a blend with other oils for the oil cleansing method). I chose this product because of the amount of oil you get for the price. The quality great at 100%, however this brand has a more sour smell than other brands of tea tree oil. I don&#x27;t know what that means other than it&#x27;s a little unpleasant to deal with. Overall though, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great brand,all natural,great price.i will order again</li>
            <li> This was a great price and it really boosts the power and smell of our homemade laundry detergent. It&#x27;s also great for our baby safe bug spray!</li>
            <li> GREAT product for EVERYTHING! I use it on my scars, acne and even my dogs when they get scrapes. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it works for what I wanted it to.  I use it in grapeseed oil for excema and general skin care.  It does have a bit of a sour smell to it as some people pointed out, and that scent lingers.  The other annoying thing is that it doesnt have a dropper tip, so it just pours out everywhere.  Very messy. I had to buy a seperate bottle with a dropper tip, so I could have saved money and bought a better tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Bought the product to put a few drops in my bath for my mild psoriasis and it has worked very well to fight off the spots that started to pop up when it started getting cold out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure not to use to much since only a few drops are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also has a pleasant, clean smell.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my household uses! Exactly what I expected</li>
