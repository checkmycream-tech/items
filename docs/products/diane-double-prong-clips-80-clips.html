            <li>Love these!  </li>
            <li>Amazing price for what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li>I bought these clips because I just started getting into making my own U-Part wigs.</li>
            <li>The packaging tape on the box was nicely taped and secured</li>
            <li>Very Strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li>for me, I love these because I love vintage pin curls and these get the job done well!</li>
            <li>But they are ok</li>
            <li>Buy it you going to love it.</li>
            <li>Perfect and a much better price than any I found locally.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>and they work lovely.</li>
            <li>and I like that it comes in so many.  </li>
            <li>Even though I only used 2, I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic price for them as well!</li>
            <li>Kind of cheaply made.</li>
            <li>and since there are so many</li>
            <li>They are made out of a good quality and each clip holds up a reasonable amount of hair for its size.</li>
            <li>Many of these clips are easy to bend and aren&#x27;t sturdy at all, but these are definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Not that these are easy to find in any event.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use with one hand.</li>
            <li>Received this item very quickly.</li>
            <li>To top it off the plastic piece is bright blue.  </li>
            <li>Great for holding up my magnetic rollers, along with hairnet or for style-setting, such as pin curls or waves.</li>
            <li>I use these clips for pin curls and to secure rollers when doing a set.</li>
            <li>These are smooth and serviceable clips that don&#x27;t catch or pull the hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product, arrived as schedule and it holds good, lost of clips for such a low price!</li>
            <li>Each one is around 1-1.5 inches long and clamp great.</li>
            <li>I use them for my clients roller sets, and it is always good to have extra on hand.</li>
            <li>Clips not bad really hold better then</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, product as described</li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon had them because we could not find them in any store, and we looked in a lot of places.</li>
            <li>Both top and bottom &#x27;prongs&#x27; are completely open, so you can pin your curls easily.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>and price.i recommend it specially if you like to make your own roller or dry your hair by piece.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as the normal brand that I use.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel or look cheap and the price is decent.</li>
            <li>so it is very easy to open and close.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what Lorraine Massey suggests in her book [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl: The Handbook]].  </li>
            <li>but they sure do work the same.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast !</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>, I should have picked a larger clip, but they are perfect if you want small curls</li>
            <li>These are good small clips.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>Snags too much of my hair</li>
            <li>they hold my locs very well, none came rusted.</li>
            <li>generous quantity, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love these clips because they&#x27;re extremely sturdy.</li>
            <li>I usually sleep in them overnight and the curls come out amazing.</li>
            <li>highly recommneded.&lt;br /&gt;Curly girl routine is from the Curly Girl Book from Lorraine Massey.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I use these clips for making felt hair clips, and they are sturdy and high quality.  </li>
            <li>Super for the old pin curls that are coming back in.</li>
            <li>I use these with the curlygirl method of pinning up just a bit on the top of my head to keep my curls from falling flat while they dry.  </li>
            <li>We used them in a drama production and our cast was fairly large but I only needed to buy one pack for all of us.</li>
            <li>they are ok, hard to cover them with ribbon because of the size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: I really like these clips and their a lot cheaper than my local beauty supply</li>
            <li>Looks like they will be very durable for daily use.</li>
            <li>Not quite the same as the old ones we had form our parents</li>
            <li>these are NOT long enough to make waves, though, just so you know, you need about 4 inch ones for that.</li>

            <li> I have long thick hair and two of these clips over a curl will hold very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I use them on the ends of my curly hair after washing to add weight and stretch my curls as they dry.</li>
            <li> Did the job as expected!</li>
            <li> any other clips I used</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I wish if it came in black or other color because it is a bit embarrassing when I have to answer the door while I have these on.  </li>
            <li> I wish these had been slightly longer.</li>
            <li> Hold tight.</li>
            <li> a ton of clips for a little money.  </li>

            <li> Not as firm as I though they would be.</li>
            <li> I proceeded to count the clips and found that it was missing 8 clips.</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as others that I&#x27;ve perchased previously in the past.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and its hard to keep it pinned in place.</li>
            <li> but they are a little small</li>
            <li> so not sure how 8 clips could have slipped out of the box.</li>

            <li> Not as firm as I though they would be. they are ok, hard to cover them with ribbon because of the size. But they are ok</li>
            <li> Good quality clips. I use them on the ends of my curly hair after washing to add weight and stretch my curls as they dry. It&#x27;s weird, but it works. That&#x27;s why I need a lot of them. The packaging is sturdy and reusable, so I keep the clips in there.</li>
            <li> I like it it works perfectly and it a good size and price.i recommend it specially if you like to make your own roller or dry your hair by piece. Buy it you going to love it.</li>
            <li> It does not leave any marks after leaving on for a while using the rollers.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love these! Excellent quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> I found this clips to be on the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; side.  They are made w/ plastic pins despite the description stating that they are nickle plated steel.  To top it off the plastic piece is bright blue.  Not a big deal if you are pinning curls in hair temporarily however not attractive if you are using them to make hair clips w/ ribbon for little girls.</li>
            <li> Great for holding up my magnetic rollers, along with hairnet or for style-setting, such as pin curls or waves.</li>
            <li> I bought these clips because I just started getting into making my own U-Part wigs. For this particular wig I was making I needed small prong clips to hold my curls and these were perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 80 clips&lt;br /&gt;Holds curls in place with no problem&lt;br /&gt;Small and perfect for pin curls&lt;br /&gt;Does not slide&lt;br /&gt;Comes inside a packaging that you store your clips once your done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I really like these clips and their a lot cheaper than my local beauty supply</li>

            <li> I love these. I use them for both pin curls and marcell/fingerwaves and they work lovely. The quantity for the price is great as well.</li>
            <li> Great and not so easy to find anymore!</li>
            <li> I bought these clips for pin curls and they work perfectly. I have long thick hair and two of these clips over a curl will hold very sturdy. I usually sleep in them overnight and the curls come out amazing. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I bought this to lift the roots of my hair while air-drying my curly hair.  This is exactly what Lorraine Massey suggests in her book [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl: The Handbook]].  My only complaint is I wish if it came in black or other color because it is a bit embarrassing when I have to answer the door while I have these on.  Otherwise, works great and I like that it comes in so many.  Unlike the photo, mine came in a plastic container so it is very easy to open and close.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived as schedule and it holds good, lost of clips for such a low price! you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about these. They serve their purpose well. They don&#x27;t feel or look cheap and the price is decent.</li>
            <li> Just what i was looking for. Believe me there is enough clips in the box! Easy to use with one hand.</li>
            <li> Snags too much of my hair</li>
            <li> they hold my locs very well, none came rusted. will buy again if needed</li>

            <li> Not quite the same as the old ones we had form our parents but they sure do work the same.  Luckily Amazon had them because we could not find them in any store, and we looked in a lot of places.</li>
            <li> for me, I love these because I love vintage pin curls and these get the job done well! no kins or frizzy hair! these are NOT long enough to make waves, though, just so you know, you need about 4 inch ones for that.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast ! Good Quality Clips. Hold tight. Perfect Size. Exactly what I was looking for. I use them for my Locs .</li>

            <li> I use these for my pin curls… They work great! And not to mention this box is all you need to pin curl your entire head. I can also sleep with these clips and my hair. A must-have for vintage styles.</li>
            <li> I wish these had been slightly longer. But they did the job.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Both top and bottom &#x27;prongs&#x27; are completely open, so you can pin your curls easily.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Clips not bad really hold better then any other clips I used</li>
            <li> I use these in my Curly routine. I\\&quot;m still learning where and how to properly use these in my hair. but they are wonderful. and you get a ton of them for the price. highly recommneded.&lt;br /&gt;Curly girl routine is from the Curly Girl Book from Lorraine Massey.&lt;br /&gt; They explain why you need these. These clips do not get caught in your hair either. They are perfect!</li>
            <li> I use these clips for making felt hair clips, and they are sturdy and high quality.  This is a fantastic price for them as well!</li>
            <li> Kind of cheaply made. Not as strong as the normal brand that I use.</li>
            <li> You get a ton of these for the price and they hold well. I used them to do a 1920&#x27;s style hairdo and they worked great!</li>
            <li> Always loved these clips!</li>
            <li> Great quality, sturdy, which is good.  Many of these clips are easy to bend and aren&#x27;t sturdy at all, but these are definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> shipment on time, product as described.</li>
            <li> perfect for loc retwisting</li>
            <li> Received this item very quickly. Product seems made of good quality and not flimsy like others I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated this product 5 starts except when I opened the box it arrived in, the package for the clips were open and the clips were scattered all over the bottom of the box. I proceeded to count the clips and found that it was missing 8 clips. The packaging tape on the box was nicely taped and secured so not sure how 8 clips could have slipped out of the box.</li>
            <li> Perfect clip for my craft projects, perfect price. Looks like they will be very durable for daily use. Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I bought these to clip up my curls when I curl my hair but they are a little small, I should have picked a larger clip, but they are perfect if you want small curls - cause then you&#x27;d have to use smaller sections.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with 80 clips!</li>
            <li> These are good small clips. I use them after I curl my hair. I clip the curl close to my scalp to save it while I finish hair, make-up, and getting dressed. I also use when the clips on my rollers don&#x27;t hold everything.</li>
            <li> I love these clips because they&#x27;re extremely sturdy. I have thick, long hair and its hard to keep it pinned in place. I use these clips for pin curls and to secure rollers when doing a set.</li>
            <li> a ton of clips for a little money.  I use these with the curlygirl method of pinning up just a bit on the top of my head to keep my curls from falling flat while they dry.  These work great and since there are so many I have them in whatever bathroom I walk in to.  Very Strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for what you&#x27;re paying for. We used them in a drama production and our cast was fairly large but I only needed to buy one pack for all of us. They are made out of a good quality and each clip holds up a reasonable amount of hair for its size.</li>
            <li> great product definately would buy again</li>
            <li> These are smooth and serviceable clips that don&#x27;t catch or pull the hair.  They work perfectly for pin curls or clipping plastic rollers in place.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product.</li>
            <li> These are the best for setting my curls. They are sturdy and hold a ton of hair.</li>
            <li> These work just like they should. They are very handy and I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li> I love these clips, I found for the price they were a great buy. I use them for my clients roller sets, and it is always good to have extra on hand. Worth the money</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as others that I&#x27;ve perchased previously in the past. I should have bought it at the store</li>
