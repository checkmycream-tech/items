            <li>Those seemed pricy - higher cost and smaller bottle.  </li>

            <li> Lavender, Tea Tree and Eucalyptus are stronger scents in general so just a few drops is needed in my diffuser in order to smell them in the room.</li>
            <li> Expected the scent to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> but when I smelled, then, it was NOTHING like I expected it to be,</li>
            <li> and I did use less.  </li>
            <li> I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> I use this to spray down my chicken coop</li>

            <li> I was really exited when I got my package but when I smelled, then, it was NOTHING like I expected it to be, I wanted to return it but it said I couldn&#x27;t.  Oh well, maybe I can find some use for them later on.</li>
            <li> Large quantity. Works well in my Kinps Â® 500ml Ultrasonic Aroma Essential Oil Diffuser.</li>
            <li> Good, but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.  Expected the scent to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I love NOW brand. I use these alot -especially lavender so Its a great deal for me. Very happy</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent quality. Will order again</li>
            <li> I have been using essential oils for a while so I knew what to expect from them.  I ordered this set because it was the best value for the money that I could find anywhere.  I am totally satisfied with my order!</li>
            <li> Good oils but the lavender was opened and most of the bottle was spilt.</li>
            <li> Love them. Great price for essential oils.</li>
            <li> I am not an EO expert by any means, but I feel like this brand is a very good value.  I have tried one of the brands (popular in the MLM marketing) but wasn&#x27;t all that impressed.  Those seemed pricy - higher cost and smaller bottle.  That brand did seem to be a stronger concentration and I did use less.  I guess it all depends what you want to use them for.  I don&#x27;t ever ingest EO.  Mostly I diffuse.  I dilute in carrier oil for allergies, headaches and upset stomach.  This brand seems to be giving me what I expect.  Buyer beware I guess...if it seems too good then it probably is false.  Personally, I like NOW and Plant Therapy brands best.  Tons more that I haven&#x27;t tried yet, that&#x27;s just my opinion.  Paying more isn&#x27;t always guaranteeing better...</li>
            <li> Love it I use this to spray down my chicken coop and it smells wonderful</li>
