            <li>Great product I would recommend.</li>
            <li>This is great when you are over 50 like me.  </li>
            <li>Loved this.  </li>
            <li>Still good</li>
            <li>This certainly is the best cleansear.</li>
            <li>Gives you face a great clean, tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>It is mild, does a good job at removing makeup without drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this face wash because of the tingling feeling after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>I love the smell (fresh and mild), the texture (foam!), the tingly sensation, and how clean and happy my face feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>I am 51 and love how this cleans without drying, and my skin feels so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>It is a light foaming soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping after a month of using this, my face will almost be blemish free.</li>
            <li>Wish it were still available.</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin</li>
            <li>and it works fine; however, sometimes it burns my eyes if I use too much foam.</li>
            <li>I used to use acne cleansers that would make my skin feel really tight and flaky, but this is perfect; it washes away oil and makeup while still leaving my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have pretty normal skin kinda oily in some spots but mostly normaly</li>
            <li>This face wash is pretty good too, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like some face wash&#x27;s do.  </li>
            <li>It feels refreshing and doesn&#x27;t sting (and I have pretty sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>It lasts quite long and it smells nice (fresh - mint smell).</li>
            <li>No other cleanser has been able to do that for me.....</li>
            <li>Apparently, this is a discontinued product, so I was thankful to be able to find it.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Aveeno&#x27;s daily cleanser, but by chance, I chose this product to see if it was any better.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that I tend to use more of the product than Aveeno&#x27;s version, even though they are the same size.      </li>
            <li>i love this product it keeps my skin clean and clear without paying the hefty dermatologist price cant find  it locally though</li>
            <li>Would certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>Would have bought several bottles if available.  </li>
            <li>It is so much value and so much to offer all in one bottle.  </li>
            <li>After washing, my face feels very refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it four stars only because I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in texture or appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I find this hard to find in the stores sometimes, so I am glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this cleanser for any skin type.</li>
            <li>Using it is refreshing, and the after washing, my skin isn&#x27;t dried out.  </li>
            <li>I also love this product because just using a little bit every morning, this one bottle has lasted almost a year!</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time while visiting family and my teenage nieces were using this product.</li>
            <li>I was purchasing at my local store, but after I stopped being able to find it, I had to track it down on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin type and sometimes sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m an adult, I still suffer from acne forming around the areas around my jawbone.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, they changed the name of this product (Detoxifying rather than Revitalizing) as well as the package coloring and design (blue/ rather than green/purple), and started charging more for pretty much the same thing.</li>
            <li>Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Cleanser which does it all, leaving face freshly clean, not too tight or dry and</li>
            <li>Do not dry out the skin, I use almost three years.</li>
            <li>My skin is not dry the next morning.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have pretty normal skin kinda oily in some spots but mostly normaly but when I used this wash I started getting cystic acne it&#x27;s so horrible I&#x27;m 20 and I&#x27;ve never had this before using the wash when I switched back to neutrogena it went away thank god this wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> Apparently, this is a discontinued product, so I was thankful to be able to find it.  Would have bought several bottles if available.  Why is it discontinued?  It is mild, does a good job at removing makeup without drying out my skin.  Don&#x27;t know what I will do when this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding a face wash that would ship to an APO address but they shipped this one.  So thats always a plus!  This face wash is pretty good too, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like some face wash&#x27;s do.  I would recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time while visiting family and my teenage nieces were using this product. I am 51 and love how this cleans without drying, and my skin feels so smooth afterwards. I also love this product because just using a little bit every morning, this one bottle has lasted almost a year! So great value and great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It is a light foaming soap.  It takes off my eye makeup with one use unlike some others I have tried.  I find this hard to find in the stores sometimes, so I am glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I had used this for a few weeks. It leaves a burning sensation on the skin, probably because it has eucalyptus extracts. It left my skin dry and my acne breakouts seem to have increased after using it.</li>
            <li> This foam is awesome!  I have super oily skin but this foam is a perfect combination of a cleanser and moisturizer.  I can remove my make up with it and remove the dirt from my skin.  My skin is not dry the next morning.  I will definitely be purchasing this product, from the same seller, again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the brands sold in the pharmacy and I was never satisfied with any. This certainly is the best cleansear. Do not dry out the skin, I use almost three years. But this is hard to find in pharmacies lately. Great product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a week and I love it. I used to use acne cleansers that would make my skin feel really tight and flaky, but this is perfect; it washes away oil and makeup while still leaving my skin soft. It feels refreshing and doesn&#x27;t sting (and I have pretty sensitive skin). Also, I&#x27;ve noticed  fewer breakouts and I no longer have the cluster of zits under my chin like I used to even while using acne cleansers. I&#x27;m hoping after a month of using this, my face will almost be blemish free. Try this for a few weeks and see if you like it, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Revitalizing Self-Foaming Cleanser Women by Biore, 6.7 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Biore this was a excellent deal.it is a very good cleaner for your face.like the foam it tingles when u put it on your face.the only reason why i gave this a 4 star because there were no caps for these bottles and when i took it out the pkg  2 bottles were leaking got all over my hands..............oher then that the product was good.please put caps on this product so there isnt a mess thanksssss</li>
            <li> i love this product it keeps my skin clean and clear without paying the hefty dermatologist price cant find  it locally though</li>
            <li> My skin is sometimes oily and sometimes dry. This is the only cleanser that works well with my skin. And believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial cleansers! I had to find it on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it at any of my local stores anymore. I would highly recommend this cleanser for any skin type.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It is so much value and so much to offer all in one bottle.  Would certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin type and sometimes sensitive skin. This cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my face. After washing, my face feels very refreshed. I used it to remove my eye make up and it works fine; however, sometimes it burns my eyes if I use too much foam. It lasts quite long and it smells nice (fresh - mint smell).</li>
            <li> This is great when you are over 50 like me.  It cleans, tighten the pores and your face glows after cleansing.</li>
            <li> The first review was overly negative, so I had to write in my experience.   Although I&#x27;m an adult, I still suffer from acne forming around the areas around my jawbone.  I used to use Aveeno&#x27;s daily cleanser, but by chance, I chose this product to see if it was any better.  Indeed it is!  I used it for a month, and had way fewer breakouts.  Using it is refreshing, and the after washing, my skin isn&#x27;t dried out.  It&#x27;s even cheaper than Aveeno&#x27;s so that&#x27;s a plus.      Cons:  My skin felt a little more oily than usual after a few hours of using the product, but I think it&#x27;s because of ingredients don&#x27;t dry your skin out.  Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that I tend to use more of the product than Aveeno&#x27;s version, even though they are the same size.      Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Loved this.  Wish it were still available.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash because of the tingling feeling after I wash my face.  I was purchasing at my local store, but after I stopped being able to find it, I had to track it down on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great scent and does wonders keeping my oily skin in check - ALL DAY!  Seriously.  All. Day.  No other cleanser has been able to do that for me.....</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash. I love the smell (fresh and mild), the texture (foam!), the tingly sensation, and how clean and happy my face feels afterwards. Unfortunately, they changed the name of this product (Detoxifying rather than Revitalizing) as well as the package coloring and design (blue/ rather than green/purple), and started charging more for pretty much the same thing. That was annoying, but I could could deal with it. Now I&#x27;m finding less and less stores carrying the updated version and on my last drugstore search, I had to get a different face wash. Now I am breaking out! I think I&#x27;m going to have to stockpile from Amazon like it&#x27;s Y2K or something...</li>
            <li> Gives you face a great clean, tingly feeling. I&#x27;d give it four stars only because I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in texture or appearance of my skin. Still good and I prefer it to Clinique&#x27;s facial cleansers and other drugstore options i.e. Clearasil, Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Cleanser which does it all, leaving face freshly clean, not too tight or dry and not oily(I have combination skin)</li>
