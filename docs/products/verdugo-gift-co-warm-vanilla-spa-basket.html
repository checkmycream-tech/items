            <li>This is ok, I love the smell and it was a gift from my hubby so that makes me love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know she will love it....</li>

            <li>i love it ...</li>

            <li>I still have it because I&#x27;m trying to save it up for rainy days. :)</li>
            <li>I love vanilla products.</li>
            <li>but for the price it would be better to put it towards some bath salts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice gift basket for this time of year and for the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful basket set to get for someone you want to make feel special!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a friend and it was neatly packaged and had a good amount of fun products to enjoy.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift, and much to my delight she loved it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon, have made you my new best friend</li>
            <li>Easy to see everything in package</li>
            <li>Thank you for making her birthday special :)</li>
            <li>She totally loves this basket and was excited about it when she received it!The price of this basket was very fair</li>
            <li>So, vanilla is one of the greatest scents on the planet, and the company got it down to a T.</li>
            <li>the price and shipping was fine.</li>
            <li>I bought it to give as a gift, but after looking at it, decided to keep it for our guest bathroom because it looked cheap.</li>
            <li>The gift was amazing came in a timel fashion wasn&#x27;t expecting this much stuff</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, globs of glue holding the presentation to a recycled foam filler.</li>
            <li>Great present for a raffle or girl party</li>
            <li>There was glue all over everything to keep it in place, but not the normal kind that easily peels off when you pull it.</li>
            <li>sent as a gift, never saw, but recipient enjoyed it very much</li>
            <li>She called me right away and told me she liked it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was her birthday and my goal was to make her feel special and pampered.</li>
            <li>The spicy vanilla, it isn&#x27;t really &#x27;spicy&#x27;, more on the vanilla side.  </li>
            <li>basket is 3/4 full of styrofoam and all the items sit on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only gave it four stars because I have no way of knowing whether I would have loved it or not.  </li>
            <li>Very nice gift basket, it was bigger than expected and came packed nicely in a durable box</li>
            <li>Nice end of year teacher present.</li>
            <li>A little pricey for what you get, but good quality.</li>
            <li>Not as nice as expected.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s still using it today just because it comes with so much stuff!</li>
            <li>Finding out they both love vanilla was a big help.</li>
            <li>pretty cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Bath and Body Works gift basket is really pretty.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Favorite part of this package is the small tin with grainy vanilla paste, wow what a great audience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also like to note this is very overpriced.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my Mom for Christmas - I really am considering tossing it and picking up something</li>
            <li>the presentation was awesome a lil disappointing</li>
            <li>This was a gift so can&#x27;t say much about it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic... if you can get it to last.</li>
            <li>, the shipping was fast, it arrived when it said it would</li>
            <li>Worth the price and worth the extra money for the gift wrapping!</li>
            <li>I would not have paid more than $15 after seeing it, I would have gone to the mall shops and got something bigger that would last longer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying this if you want her relaxed.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells nice, but the smell doesnt last, and the other products have no scent at all.</li>
            <li>Most of the bath stuff hardly smelled after a few seconds, but the lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>I feel this is only worth about $20.</li>
            <li>Cheap globs of glue and stirifoam stuck to everything not worth the money</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>This product was pretty low quality.</li>
            <li>However, most of it was propped up with styrofoam and everything was excessively glued to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all pretty or a nice gift after you remove the fake cardboard packing in the bottom of the basket.</li>
            <li>My wife is chemical sensitive and it is gentle enough for her.  </li>
            <li>When I went in to check on my wife&#x27;s drink, I noticed the water was clear</li>
            <li>It really is that simple, I purchased this as a Mother&#x27;s Day Gift, and the only bone I could possibly pick with this was over the delivery.  </li>
            <li>this was super small, like travel/trial sized items, there is nothing eco about it, it is all chemically made in China</li>
            <li>I will definitely order again in the near future!</li>
            <li>The basket comes half stuffed with packing material and the small bottles on top of it.</li>

            <li> I will definitely order again in the near future!</li>
            <li> The basket comes half stuffed with packing material and the small bottles on top of it.</li>
            <li> a standard tub size I added the entire bag of bath scent crystals (it seems like a 1 time use only, there was hardly anything in the bag).</li>
            <li> The only issue is the glue used to stick everything together which seems typical.</li>
            <li> and it was undetectable less than 10 minutes later.</li>
            <li> Wondering what to get a 13 and 15 yr old was hard.</li>
            <li> Just what I expectEd.</li>
            <li> The product itself is just not of the expected quality based on the description given.</li>
            <li> The other day she had put on some of the lotion.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this basket is the amount of plastic wrap and the number of layers of said wrap involved.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s likely the body wash will be useless as well.</li>
            <li> It hardly had any scent going on</li>
            <li> The effect was hardly noticeable but again, no</li>
            <li> Take away all the packaging and unusable fluff, and you have a couple bottles of mediocre products.</li>
            <li> and I recieved it late</li>
            <li> She said they did, and all they did was fizz from the ball like it was slowly leaking gasses-- nothing else.</li>

            <li> Bought this basket for a friend. She loved it!</li>
            <li> packaged well. Just what I expectEd.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, and much to my delight she loved it. Highly recommend buying this if you want her relaxed.</li>
            <li> Take away all the packaging and unusable fluff, and you have a couple bottles of mediocre products. It&#x27;s not at all pretty or a nice gift after you remove the fake cardboard packing in the bottom of the basket. I bought it to give as a gift, but after looking at it, decided to keep it for our guest bathroom because it looked cheap. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it or buy it again.</li>
            <li> Really loving this product(s).  My wife is chemical sensitive and it is gentle enough for her.  The spicy vanilla, it isn&#x27;t really &#x27;spicy&#x27;, more on the vanilla side.  My only complaint about this basket is the amount of plastic wrap and the number of layers of said wrap involved.  Perhaps that is necessary to keep the presentation in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favorite part of this package is the small tin with grainy vanilla paste, wow what a great audience.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, she loved it.</li>
            <li> Not as nice as expected.</li>
            <li> Gift for someone else, my mom also got it for someone, too, so it must be good.</li>
            <li> sent as a gift, never saw, but recipient enjoyed it very much</li>
            <li> Cheap globs of glue and stirifoam stuck to everything not worth the money</li>
            <li> i got this for my mom for a Mother&#x27;s Day present and she absolutely loved it! It has all the essentials for a good bath gift !</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift to my friend. She loved it! She said it looked great in her bathroom! Very happy!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my friend for her birthday!&lt;br /&gt;And she just loved it! No complaints at all! 5 stars</li>
            <li> excellent sizes, fragrances, and basket</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a modern-day present and it was a bit. She&#x27;s still using it today just because it comes with so much stuff! It&#x27;s a great value and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> both grand-daughters loved it! Finding out they both love vanilla was a big help. Wondering what to get a 13 and 15 yr old was hard. So glad I found this gift basket.  Exceptional price and fragrance.  Thanks Amazon, have made you my new best friend</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend and it was neatly packaged and had a good amount of fun products to enjoy.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to be donated for a rafel for an autism speaks show. although it cost more money than it brought in atleast I know that it did bring in some.</li>
            <li> I thought i was buying from bath and body shop, i do not know this name and hope the person receiving this gift likes it</li>
            <li> This is ok, I love the smell and it was a gift from my hubby so that makes me love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this was super small, like travel/trial sized items, there is nothing eco about it, it is all chemically made in China so the name can be misleading.  The basket comes half stuffed with packing material and the small bottles on top of it. The smell was nice adn yummy but this really only lasted one bath time for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to note this is very overpriced. I would not have paid more than $15 after seeing it, I would have gone to the mall shops and got something bigger that would last longer. But the smell was nice.</li>
            <li> My step mom texted and said she loved it! Thank you for making her birthday special :) good job people</li>
            <li> Came quickly was as described daughter happy</li>
            <li> The gift was amazing came in a timel fashion wasn&#x27;t expecting this much stuff In here. Giving this to my wife for Christmas I know she will love it....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and the recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Daughter ,she was absolutely satisfied and received wonderful use form all the products. Good choice.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my Mom for Christmas - I really am considering tossing it and picking up something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basket is 3/4 full of styrofoam and all the items sit on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is smaller than appears in the photo.  The basket looks pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t hear from the party I gave it too, but it did get there on the day stay said it would, thank you</li>
            <li> perfect, quick and a great gift. Thank you. The only issue is the glue used to stick everything together which seems typical.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, globs of glue holding the presentation to a recycled foam filler. This products quality is not aligned with the price piont.. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> the presentation was awesome a lil disappointing the gift card didn&#x27;t come but my girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> Sister loves it.  Was a gift.  Arrived on time.  Packaged nicely.  Smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Therefore, I loved it!  It really is that simple, I purchased this as a Mother&#x27;s Day Gift, and the only bone I could possibly pick with this was over the delivery.  I was under the impression that it would have been delivered by Friday, at the latest, and it did not arrive till Tuesday...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the end of the world, but it would have been nice for her to get it BEFORE the day.....  Note to self, send it more than a week in advance even for prime....</li>
            <li> this was a gift too but no comment from the person, so I don&#x27;t know!</li>
            <li> gave as a gift...everyone is happy</li>
            <li> My mom really enjoyed it. I had it shipped to her. She called me right away and told me she liked it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get to see the actual package, but I also got it with the gift wrap.</li>
            <li> Daughter in law was very happy with this product</li>
            <li> This was a gift so can&#x27;t say much about it.  The recipient seemed pleased.</li>
            <li> This product was pretty low quality. The lotion smells nice, but the smell doesnt last, and the other products have no scent at all. The packaging was also really poorly done. There was glue all over everything to keep it in place, but not the normal kind that easily peels off when you pull it.</li>
            <li> package arrived on time and wife loved it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  I only gave it four stars because I have no way of knowing whether I would have loved it or not.  She said she liked it.</li>
            <li> Good quality, but over-priced. I feel this is only worth about $20.</li>
            <li> Very nice gift set i love it ...</li>
            <li> I got this for a gift.  It is a nice size &amp; has modern look, and will be perfect to give as an appreciation gift!</li>
            <li> Delivers fast in a great package. Easy to see everything in package and it was affordable. Great present for a raffle or girl party</li>
            <li> Very nice gift basket, it was bigger than expected and came packed nicely in a durable box</li>
            <li> i gave this as a gift and my friend loved it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this myself but ordered it as a gift in which the person who got it loved it. I did see it when it arrived and looked like a really nice collection of items.</li>
            <li> This Bath and Body Works gift basket is really pretty.  The vanilla scent is beautiful. The bamboo basket includes body lotion,shower gel, bath fizzers and exfoliators.  There&#x27;s even a nylon body wash scrubber.  It&#x27;s a very nice gift basket for this time of year and for the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my wife for mother&#x27;s day and I recieved it late but she loved it and the price and shipping was fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this gift set as a gift for a friend - she absolutely loved it.  I would purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Nice end of year teacher present.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for what you get, but good quality.</li>
            <li> So, vanilla is one of the greatest scents on the planet, and the company got it down to a T. The smell is fantastic... if you can get it to last. Most of the bath stuff hardly smelled after a few seconds, but the lotion is amazing. I still have it because I&#x27;m trying to save it up for rainy days. :)</li>
            <li> Fabelous mother loved it smelled wonderful. Arrived quickly with everything u need for a great bath sponges and all you need to wash with included</li>
            <li> The vendor shipped as promised. Not too impressed with the product rec&#x27;d. I love vanilla products. This one fell short.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my wife. The presentation was very nice. However, most of it was propped up with styrofoam and everything was excessively glued to it. The other day she had put on some of the lotion. It hardly had any scent going on and it was undetectable less than 10 minutes later. Tonight I ran a bath for my wife so she can have some time to a drink, relax, and I&#x27;m making dinner and looking after the 3 kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a standard tub size I added the entire bag of bath scent crystals (it seems like a 1 time use only, there was hardly anything in the bag). There was no vanilla smell to the water, the room, or any indication that it was actually scented. I set aside two bath fizzers to be added. The directions only call for one, but to make up for the lack of scent I figure two might help. When I went in to check on my wife&#x27;s drink, I noticed the water was clear so I asked if she added the fizzers or not. She said they did, and all they did was fizz from the ball like it was slowly leaking gasses-- nothing else. The effect was hardly noticeable but again, no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this has been a severe disappointment. Fortunately, she&#x27;s more happy with the thought and plan around it.. but for the price it would be better to put it towards some bath salts. It&#x27;s likely the body wash will be useless as well. Everything is made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were zero issues with the seller, shipment times, etc. The product itself is just not of the expected quality based on the description given.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful basket set to get for someone you want to make feel special! I ordered this for good friend of mine. It was her birthday and my goal was to make her feel special and pampered. She totally loves this basket and was excited about it when she received it!The price of this basket was very fair, the shipping was fast, it arrived when it said it would and everything was in tact when it arrived! I even had this item gift wrapped and from what I was told, it was beautifully wrapped and packaged well. It really is such a wonderful basket of goodies, the scent is delightful and all of the extras really know how to make one feel pampered. Glad I chose this as a birthday gift! I will definitely order again in the near future! Worth the price and worth the extra money for the gift wrapping!</li>
