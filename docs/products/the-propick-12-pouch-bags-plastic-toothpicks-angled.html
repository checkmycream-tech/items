            <li>Finally went thru them all and went to get more.</li>
            <li>They hold up better than the wooden ones or the brush picks.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>she is right on the new ones</li>

            <li>These are not as heavy as the plastic toothpicks that used to be available.  </li>
            <li>The old style where firmer that these are</li>
            <li>I hate it when a good company goes cheap.  </li>
            <li>they ever go back on how they use to make them I would buy again otherwise these new ones are junk.</li>
            <li>When they arrived I discovered that they are now made of a different plastic and are a little bigger and not as smooth as they used to be, and they don&#x27;t work for me anymore.</li>
            <li>Armonds, please go back to your old formulations and manufacturing process.  </li>

            <li> Armonds, please go back to your old formulations and manufacturing process.  </li>
            <li> I feel they owe me a refund on the grounds that they changed the product without mentioning that they&#x27;re &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;, or some other clue that they&#x27;re not the same.  </li>
            <li> They are so soft now, they will hardly remove anything from your teeth without folding over.</li>
            <li> are super weak and all have a small sliver of plastic from the mold coming out of the side of them which I cut off so it doesn&#x27;t cut my lip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Years ago they were thinner and harder</li>
            <li> But they aren&#x27;t as narrow as the white plastic ones that Walmart used to carry.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful product and impossible to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using using these for years and didn&#x27;t relise how bad they are now until just now when I found a pack of the old ones that are solid plastic and actually fit in between your teeth with out cutting your gums.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you can&#x27;t floss, these little jewels do the job.  </li>
            <li> we found a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem was</li>
            <li> but I was never able to communicate with anyone at Armond&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> These toothpicks r hard to find</li>
            <li> I still floss at least once a day</li>
            <li> This current product is by far  the worst quality they have ever produced.  </li>
            <li> For my teeth the Propicks are too thick to get between teeth.</li>
            <li> The picks now bend when you use them and are so thick you can&#x27;t get inbetween your teeth!  </li>
            <li> I read the other review about the bad quality of the picks now and ordered anyways.  </li>
            <li> Just need to find another place to get them; Armonds was a sloppy Company to work &amp;#34;with&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This new order of picks are terrible.  </li>
            <li> Useless in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> they have changed the toothpicks I have been buying for years and these ones are terrible they break in half when used I wrote company to see if they changed but never heard from them .</li>
            <li> I wanted these pix soooo bad.</li>
            <li> Really, really disappointed.</li>
            <li> The product has changed to a flimsy, horribly produced product.  </li>

            <li> I read the other review about the bad quality of the picks now and ordered anyways.  He / she is right on the new ones are super weak and all have a small sliver of plastic from the mold coming out of the side of them which I cut off so it doesn&#x27;t cut my lip.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using using these for years and didn&#x27;t relise how bad they are now until just now when I found a pack of the old ones that are solid plastic and actually fit in between your teeth with out cutting your gums.&lt;br /&gt;If they ever go back on how they use to make them I would buy again otherwise these new ones are junk.</li>
            <li> I love these toothpicks. I have been using these for years. Instead of flossing during the day after eating...I use one of these toothpicks and it cleans my teeth as if I had flossed. I still floss at least once a day but I use these during the day. They do not break off in your teeth like wooden toothpicks can tend to do. I highly recommend these toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Efficient packaging and timeliness met.  Not as sturdy as products bought in store; however, meet the same expectations for cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful product and impossible to find in stores.  The plastic is well constructed, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Good pics but not the quality of ones we found a few years ago. These are not as stiff as the other ones but still work great</li>
            <li> I have been buying and using Armonds ProPicks for about 10 years. Over the years the product has changed several times.  This current product is by far  the worst quality they have ever produced.  Years ago they were thinner and harder then they are now.  They were very effective and a great product.  Now, they are thicker and softer. They are so soft now, they will hardly remove anything from your teeth without folding over. Useless in my opinion.  Armonds, please go back to your old formulations and manufacturing process.  The solid white product was much better.</li>
            <li> These formerly wonderful toothpicks aren&#x27;t what they used to be.  They used to be slimmer and smoother, and they fit perfectly and silkily in the tight spaces between my teeth.  I ordered a twelve pack because I&#x27;ve used them for years and loved them.  When they arrived I discovered that they are now made of a different plastic and are a little bigger and not as smooth as they used to be, and they don&#x27;t work for me anymore. When I tried to return the unopened eleven packages, Armond&#x27;s refused on the grounds that they&#x27;re a health item and they can&#x27;t be restocked.  If the first ones I bought had been like these, I would have not bought them again. I feel they owe me a refund on the grounds that they changed the product without mentioning that they&#x27;re &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;, or some other clue that they&#x27;re not the same.  &amp;#34;New and Improved&amp;#34; would have been a red flag.  I&#x27;ll chalk it up to experience, and be glad they don&#x27;t cost more than they do.  I expect more from a fine old American company, which is what they say they are.</li>
            <li> WalMart used to sell these but, for whatever reason their corporate minds devised, stopped selling them about three years ago. I have been looking for them ever since. I am so glad I found them!!</li>
            <li> great tooth picks,really does the job</li>
            <li> The best plastic tooth pick offered.  I can make one last all day.</li>
            <li> I looked for them on the internet and found them after looking at all grocery stores in 3 cities, I use them all the time and are the best tooth picks any where. I have used them for years and all of a sudden no one carried them in local grocery stores any where.</li>
            <li> they have changed the toothpicks I have been buying for years and these ones are terrible they break in half when used I wrote company to see if they changed but never heard from them . I would never order again.</li>
            <li> these have always ways worked best for me. can&#x27;t always find them in the store. It&#x27;s nice to be able to go on line and find what you want.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase from Armonds Mfg.  I tried all over town to purchase these picks but no one had them.  Of course, good old Amazon did and I now have enough to do for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came in good order and shipping was timely.  Consider me a happy purchaser.</li>
            <li> First purchased 2 boxes in WalMart a cpl years ago. Finally went thru them all and went to get more. Could not find these in any stores.</li>
            <li> My husband is never without these propicks. they are so much better than wood tooth picks. It&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like new package</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used ProPicks for years and loved them.  This new order of picks are terrible.  The product has changed to a flimsy, horribly produced product.  The picks now bend when you use them and are so thick you can&#x27;t get inbetween your teeth!  What good is that??  I hate it when a good company goes cheap.  I&#x27;m really thinking about sending them all back for a refund.  Really, really disappointed.</li>
            <li> great product that I could no longer find in the store.  arrived as promised -great packaging</li>
            <li> The best toothpick I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love these things but they have a defect now, that didn&#x27;t used to be there.  Some of these will just shatter when you bend them.  I spend a lot of time with one in my mouth and generally destroy them by chewing them up, but the shattering is very concerning and I always check for it before putting in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Found these several years ago and a store.  However, they aren&#x27;t sold in my stores.  I found them online and love them.  Ordered some for friends also.</li>
            <li> These are not as heavy as the plastic toothpicks that used to be available.  However, they do work and the price is good.</li>
            <li> have used these for years and always get a glowing report from my dentist on what a great job I do flossing!</li>
            <li> These are the only kinds of tooth picks my uncle likes.  Was so great to find them.</li>
            <li> These toothpicks r hard to find so when I found them online I jumped at the chance. They hold up better than the wooden ones or the brush picks. My husband has them everywhere. Both vehicles, at work, etc.</li>
            <li> I wanted these pix soooo bad. But they aren&#x27;t as narrow as the white plastic ones that Walmart used to carry. For my teeth the Propicks are too thick to get between teeth.These are nylon, not plastic.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use and easy on the gums.  Nicely packaged for portability and convenience.  When you can&#x27;t floss, these little jewels do the job.  I must point out, I ordered these  a year or so ago from the manufacture.  When they never arrived I filed a claim with my credit card company who took care of the charge.  Not sure what the problem was but I was never able to communicate with anyone at Armond&#x27;s.  When I saw these on Amazon I tried again and to my satisfaction things went very smooth.  Recommendation: Only buy through Amazon</li>
            <li> Great. Can&#x27;t find them in the market.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I wanted.  Just need to find another place to get them; Armonds was a sloppy Company to work &amp;#34;with&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted....Thanks</li>
            <li> The old style where firmer that these are and I prefer the firmness.</li>
