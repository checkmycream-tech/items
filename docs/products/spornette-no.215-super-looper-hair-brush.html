            <li>Wigs aren&#x27;t cheap, so I was so happy to have smooth looking wigs without breaking the fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>Such a great brush!</li>
            <li>When I had my hair long it was perfect for getting rid of tangles and bringing out the volume without ruining curls.</li>
            <li>This brush is great for my extensions and also for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes it super easy to comb through my my extensions and not tear them out!</li>
            <li>glides easily through hair.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>When this brush came in, it smelled strongly of factory.</li>
            <li>Not unbearably strong</li>
            <li>So I went to my favorite one-stop retailer, Amazon, and found the Super Looper brush;</li>
            <li>No pulling, just smooth brushing.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t pull out any hairs from the wig and make it smooth, not frizzy.</li>
            <li>The bristles do not pull on the hair and keeps edges of hair smooth</li>
            <li>It keep it all tangle free and neat as a pin.  </li>
            <li>Great brush overall!</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of this brush-that it won&#x27;t damage the wig fiber-but so far, I can&#x27;t use it alone.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig brush for my first set of wigs and i have to say, it was a good choice.</li>
            <li>I have extensions and it works perfectly, it doesn&#x27;t pull out as much hair as a normal brush, but it still detangles very well.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should do :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on my wig and worth the price.</li>
            <li>For example, right now I am sporting a short and sassy layered pixie style and this brush is great for bringing out feather detail.</li>
            <li>It had this plastic smell, it was really strong right when I opened it.</li>
            <li>I bought the Spornette Super Looper Hair Brush to comb out my wigs.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush to anyone. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing because I have extensions it goes right through my extensions and barely pulls a lot of hair!!!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m highly satisfied!</li>
            <li>I thought I would never be able to comb my hair from scalp to ends while wearing 6 month extensions, but this little brush was amazing.</li>
            <li>Because of the price and the reviews, I was expecting something a little more spectacular.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing the magic is in the loops which allow the hair to flow through versus a regular brush/comb which, for lack of a better phrase, tears through the hair, forcing it a certain way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This brush works really well to smooth out the hair and remove knots without shredding or pulling the hair out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still going to work with it, but at this point, I don&#x27;t know how useful it is.</li>
            <li>but well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This brush lets you brush right through the extensions without cause damage and it does not hurt.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very gentle on the wigs.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on extensions and wigs.</li>
            <li>Dude, it&#x27;s way better than using your regular hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>First off this brush is for hair extensions, wigs or hair pieces.</li>
            <li>and I definitely recommend. :-)</li>
            <li>My hair stopped falling after the first use.</li>
            <li>funny name</li>
            <li>This is my first time owning a looper brush</li>
            <li>In addition the brush is the perfect size, not too big but not too small either.</li>
            <li>Maybe this brush is good for short wigs but all of my wigs are long and it does absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>This brush works like a dream with absolutely minimal hair loss :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>Amazed at how well and gentle this brush functions.</li>
            <li>If you try to use a regular brush, the first time you try it, it will snag and either rip it out or feel like its pulling it out!!</li>
            <li>Very useful for making synthetic hair last.</li>
            <li>I bought it based on previous reviews and am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>feels like a normal brush when used on extensions, works well for us!</li>
            <li>I put it through some pretty cheap extensions and wigs and it went through smoothly with very little pulling!</li>
            <li>The true test will come once I have changed my style a couple of times but for right now, I feel as if I spent twice the money for what I already have in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>The special bristles don&#x27;t rip out fibers like regular brushes do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a little, but it&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
            <li>It was money well spent as the brush easily removed the tangles without breaking the wig fibers.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I honestly dont know how I would have brushed down to my scalp.</li>
            <li>I bought three brushes trying to find one that did not snag on my new keratin hair extensions.</li>
            <li>After going out of my way to find the perfect brush for my wigs, I have to say I am sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li>It brushes through easily and with little fallout.</li>
            <li>after having owned this brush for a few months, it is now my Go-To and gets a full 5 stars!</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that this brush makes a big difference in small ways.</li>
            <li>but if you went near it you would get a whif of it.</li>
            <li>very gentle with minimal pulling.</li>
            <li>First of all, you have to press much harder with this brush to get it to go through.</li>
            <li>And if you have to do a major wig de-tangling, this ain&#x27;t gonna cut it at all.</li>
            <li>It is in fact only a little better than a wide toothed comb.</li>
            <li>Kind of difficult to remove all the hair from the brush though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried it with the particular hair style that I am sporting right now (a shoulder lengthed bob) and I can admit that it pulls a lot less than my other combs/brushes, therefore reducing the amount of shedding.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t snag on knots as i images other brushes would and the loops are pretty sturdy so it will hopefully last a long time.</li>

            <li> The true test will come once I have changed my style a couple of times but for right now, I feel as if I spent twice the money for what I already have in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> The special bristles don&#x27;t rip out fibers like regular brushes do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a little, but it&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
            <li> It was money well spent as the brush easily removed the tangles without breaking the wig fibers.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I honestly dont know how I would have brushed down to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought three brushes trying to find one that did not snag on my new keratin hair extensions.</li>
            <li> After going out of my way to find the perfect brush for my wigs, I have to say I am sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It brushes through easily and with little fallout.</li>
            <li> after having owned this brush for a few months, it is now my Go-To and gets a full 5 stars!</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that this brush makes a big difference in small ways.</li>
            <li> but if you went near it you would get a whif of it.</li>
            <li> very gentle with minimal pulling.</li>
            <li> First of all, you have to press much harder with this brush to get it to go through.</li>
            <li> And if you have to do a major wig de-tangling, this ain&#x27;t gonna cut it at all.</li>
            <li> It is in fact only a little better than a wide toothed comb.</li>
            <li> Kind of difficult to remove all the hair from the brush though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it with the particular hair style that I am sporting right now (a shoulder lengthed bob) and I can admit that it pulls a lot less than my other combs/brushes, therefore reducing the amount of shedding.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t snag on knots as i images other brushes would and the loops are pretty sturdy so it will hopefully last a long time.</li>
            <li> This brush works well if you have small knots, but if your hair is really tangled, you might need to use a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing I have rocked a couple of different hairstyles, long and short</li>
            <li> Really like this brush add it doesn&#x27;t pull my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; when i brush so hard with standard hair brushes.</li>
            <li> A must for long hair extensions.  </li>
            <li> It does not brush through my long wigs at all.</li>
            <li> Because the loops are so big and round its enabling the brus JJ from actually grasping and brushing through the strands of hair.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about a brush.</li>
            <li> It reduces static cling which my natural hair has very badly.</li>
            <li> and I notice this brush doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair like other brushes.</li>
            <li> Other wig brushes I&#x27;ve used pull the tracks out and have lots of hair in the brush when Im done.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase lace, human hair wigs.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a long wig I wear during chemotherapy treatment, because the paddle brush that came with it was too small.  </li>
            <li> The loops are so loose and weak that this brush is not strong enough to comb thru the silkiest of hair texture.</li>
            <li> This brush is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I have had a few friends undergo cancer treatment and will be recommending this to them as well.</li>
            <li> I just got hair extensions, I use this brush everyday since then.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money trust me.</li>
            <li> I bought a long hair piece that looks dramatic but tends to get matted after wearing for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, but it will cost more than I paid for it to return it.</li>
            <li> The loops are very firm.</li>
            <li> However, NONE of them made it past the spot where the extension is attached to my hair…massive failure for ALL of the brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush is so weak that it doesnt even comb through the wig.</li>
            <li> Keep my hair untangled without disturbing the extensions.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive for a hair brush</li>
            <li> This brush is worthless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Great Hair brush. I bought it because i bought hair extensions and it is recommended not to use a regular brush on them.&lt;br /&gt;It works great, very gentle on hair.&lt;br /&gt;I even started using it on my hair. I have very fine hair (almost baby hair) and I notice this brush doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair like other brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought the micro loop extensions and trust me when I say this is the ONLY brush you can use on them! If you try to use a regular brush, the first time you try it, it will snag and either rip it out or feel like its pulling it out!! This brush lets you brush right through the extensions without cause damage and it does not hurt. Buying this brush will be the best thing you spend money on when buy extensions. This is a must have!!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful with my hair and extensions that I have in right now.  Never feel it get caught in tangles and smooths out my hair great.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She says its the best brush she has ever had. That is saying a lot coming from her.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in both the regular size and purse size.  A must for long hair extensions.  No pulling, just smooth brushing.</li>
            <li> This brush works like a dream with absolutely minimal hair loss :) I put it through some pretty cheap extensions and wigs and it went through smoothly with very little pulling!</li>
            <li> Great for getting out tangles.  glides easily through hair.</li>
            <li> This is great for my extensions. I have the keratin infused extensions. It doesn&#x27;t pull my extensions.</li>
            <li> A good brush. Sturdy, well made and works well on my synthetic wigs. A good buy.</li>
            <li> I love the brush it works good and it is easy to use. I would say it&#x27;s great to have.</li>
            <li> Good wig brush.  Use it on all my cosplay wings.</li>
            <li> This brush is a waste of money and time. The loops are so loose and weak that this brush is not strong enough to comb thru the silkiest of hair texture. Because the loops are so big and round its enabling the brus JJ from actually grasping and brushing through the strands of hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for getting the tangles out of my wig. It&#x27;s a good size and it&#x27;s gentle. Shipping was great!</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of this brush-that it won&#x27;t damage the wig fiber-but so far, I can&#x27;t use it alone. I still have to use my $2 wig steel pin brush from the beauty supply store. First of all, you have to press much harder with this brush to get it to go through. And if you have to do a major wig de-tangling, this ain&#x27;t gonna cut it at all. I thought maybe I could use this just as a daily brush to use for upkeep, but even then, I find I still have to use the wig steel brush to get through the tangles. I&#x27;m still going to work with it, but at this point, I don&#x27;t know how useful it is.</li>
            <li> One of the best loop brushes in the market. The loops are very firm.</li>
            <li> I have just begun cosplaying and plan to use this often. I bought it based on previous reviews and am very pleased so far. It arrived in a sealed plastic in very good condition and it does not tear out the hair on my wig so far. Which I like. I have had a few friends undergo cancer treatment and will be recommending this to them as well.</li>
            <li> feels like a normal brush when used on extensions, works well for us!</li>
            <li> When this brush came in, it smelled strongly of factory. It had this plastic smell, it was really strong right when I opened it. Not unbearably strong but if you went near it you would get a whif of it. It eventully went away. This brush works well if you have small knots, but if your hair is really tangled, you might need to use a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known that wig brushes existed years ago.  Dude, it&#x27;s way better than using your regular hairbrush.  It won&#x27;t pull out any hairs from the wig and make it smooth, not frizzy.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for my extensions and also for my natural hair.  It reduces static cling which my natural hair has very badly.</li>
            <li> I have Mane Maxx extensions. This loop brush is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for smoothing and detangling without compromising the bonds.</li>
            <li> I bought the Spornette Super Looper Hair Brush to comb out my wigs. It was an Amazon Add-On item, but I am so glad I elected to add this item to my order. It was money well spent as the brush easily removed the tangles without breaking the wig fibers. Wigs aren&#x27;t cheap, so I was so happy to have smooth looking wigs without breaking the fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MR</li>
            <li> Im so happy I got this brush. It is amazing on wigs, even curly ones! It brushes through easily and with little fallout. Other wig brushes I&#x27;ve used pull the tracks out and have lots of hair in the brush when Im done. This one is awesome!</li>
            <li> If you wear a weave and wigs this is the best brush. The bristles do not pull on the hair and keeps edges of hair smooth</li>
            <li> It detangles with ease, and the brush fits in most of my purses. The bristles are very gentle on the wigs.</li>
            <li> This Super Looper brush is perfect for both my hair and beard.  It keep it all tangle free and neat as a pin.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Best brush for getting out tangles in matted extensions. Love it.</li>
            <li> Really like this brush add it doesn&#x27;t pull my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; when i brush so hard with standard hair brushes.</li>
            <li> First off this brush is for hair extensions, wigs or hair pieces. It isn&#x27;t pulling my extensions out, the loops by pass the bonds as it should. The loops bend so they don&#x27;t rip them out. Would I advise someone without extensions or hair pieces to buy this.. no but if you have them its perfect!</li>
            <li> I just got hair extensions, I use this brush everyday since then. Keep my hair untangled without disturbing the extensions. Great brush!!!</li>
            <li> works great for my wigs and my extensions. very gentle with minimal pulling. excellent for de-tangling. i use this brush daily.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on extensions and wigs. Kind of difficult to remove all the hair from the brush though. Great brush overall!</li>
            <li> As of right now, I just received the product, the brush looks great. I can&#x27;t speak for its durability but if you see no edits on this review then you can know that is brush is spectacular.</li>
            <li> Best brush for my fused extensions doesn&#x27;t pull but gives me the feeling of brushing my scalp and no other brushes i have used have been able to do that.</li>
            <li> Great brush for my extensions.  It doesn&#x27;t catch the fusion ends and doesn&#x27;t pull.  It brushes evenly.</li>
            <li> Maybe this brush is good for short wigs but all of my wigs are long and it does absolutely nothing for me. It does not brush through my long wigs at all. After going out of my way to find the perfect brush for my wigs, I have to say I am sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for hair extensions, wigs, or hair weaves.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush! Perfect for maintaining synthetic and human hair.</li>
            <li> I dont know why or how this brush doesnt pull my hair extensions out, I have I tip micro-links. Its amazing, I honestly dont know how I would have brushed down to my scalp. So so happy I bought this!</li>
            <li> Amazed at how well and gentle this brush functions. The price was great and I have no issues with the brush.</li>
            <li> Great value!  Love it.</li>
            <li> Because of the price and the reviews, I was expecting something a little more spectacular. It is in fact only a little better than a wide toothed comb. I&#x27;ve only tried it with the particular hair style that I am sporting right now (a shoulder lengthed bob) and I can admit that it pulls a lot less than my other combs/brushes, therefore reducing the amount of shedding. The true test will come once I have changed my style a couple of times but for right now, I feel as if I spent twice the money for what I already have in my cabinet. Updates will come later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Sep 14, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after having owned this brush for a few months, it is now my Go-To and gets a full 5 stars! Since purchasing I have rocked a couple of different hairstyles, long and short and I can honestly say that this brush makes a big difference in small ways. For example, right now I am sporting a short and sassy layered pixie style and this brush is great for bringing out feather detail. When I had my hair long it was perfect for getting rid of tangles and bringing out the volume without ruining curls. I&#x27;m guessing the magic is in the loops which allow the hair to flow through versus a regular brush/comb which, for lack of a better phrase, tears through the hair, forcing it a certain way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now a fan and I definitely recommend. :-)</li>
            <li> Very useful for making synthetic hair last. The special bristles don&#x27;t rip out fibers like regular brushes do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as a regular brush</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing because I have extensions it goes right through my extensions and barely pulls a lot of hair!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig brush to help with detangling my wig. It is ok. It does not work any differently than the brush I was already using on my wigs.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig brush for my first set of wigs and i have to say, it was a good choice. It doesn&#x27;t snag on knots as i images other brushes would and the loops are pretty sturdy so it will hopefully last a long time.</li>
            <li> This brush works well on synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a little, but it&#x27;s a good brush. It&#x27;s easy on my wig and worth the price. I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> My wigs look &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; when I use this brush. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. I usually purchase lace, human hair wigs.</li>
            <li> I thought I would never be able to comb my hair from scalp to ends while wearing 6 month extensions, but this little brush was amazing. I can brush my hair however I please and it won&#x27;t snag the extensions!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.  Not much to say about a brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a long wig I wear during chemotherapy treatment, because the paddle brush that came with it was too small.  The bristles don&#x27;t get past the first 2 layers of hair. Very disappointed, but it will cost more than I paid for it to return it.</li>
            <li> It does what it says. My hair stopped falling after the first use. I was very happy with the results.  I always decide what items to buy depending on the reviews customers send in. So yes go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought three brushes trying to find one that did not snag on my new keratin hair extensions. All of the three--supposedly--were designed to be used on extensions. However, NONE of them made it past the spot where the extension is attached to my hair…massive failure for ALL of the brushes! So I went to my favorite one-stop retailer, Amazon, and found the Super Looper brush; funny name but it works fantastically...no snags, no tangles. This brush is a keeper and I am so happy that I bought it. It is a bit expensive for a hair brush but well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This is my first time owning a looper brush so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect or how well it would work to untangle my hair extensions, but I&#x27;m very happy with this brush. It untangled great and it didn&#x27;t break or pull the hair off! it&#x27;s the perfect size to get a lot of hair but it&#x27;s not bulky. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome hairbrush if you have extensions! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I read about this brush in a magazine last month and wanted to try it out because it had such favorable reviews. I have extensions and it works perfectly, it doesn&#x27;t pull out as much hair as a normal brush, but it still detangles very well. In addition the brush is the perfect size, not too big but not too small either.</li>
            <li> Makes it super easy to comb through my my extensions and not tear them out! I&#x27;m so glad I bought this brush</li>
            <li> Perfect Brush for my wigs as well as my natural hair, Doesn&#x27;t pull hair out!  Thank You,</li>
            <li> great for hair extensions</li>
            <li> love it.  easy on the hair, feels nice on the scalp.  good for extensions too.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should do :)</li>
            <li> Works well with my wig.</li>
            <li> This brush is worthless. Wouldnt give it any starts, but that wasn&#x27; t an option. This brush is so weak that it doesnt even comb through the wig. It said wig brush which its not. Dont waste your money trust me.</li>
            <li> Such a great brush! I have 2 synthetic wigs and this brush helps with the tangles! I&#x27;m so glad I bought this brush! No issues with the seller or shipping. Overall I&#x27;m highly satisfied! I would highly recommend this brush to anyone. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I bought a long hair piece that looks dramatic but tends to get matted after wearing for a few hours. This brush works really well to smooth out the hair and remove knots without shredding or pulling the hair out.</li>
