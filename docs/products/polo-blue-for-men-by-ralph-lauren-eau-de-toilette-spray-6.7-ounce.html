            <li>Son-in-law and Husband love the scent!</li>
            <li>His favorite cologne!</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li>The large volume container and spray are the perfect combination for my needs.</li>
            <li>Best price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Since August is his birth month, it kind of reminds me of him and his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Great gift for my older nephew!  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Yes, Polo Blue, was a wonderful gift to my husband for his birthday.</li>
            <li>Best cologne out there and woman love it, been wearing it for 5+ years and haven&#x27;t found anything that smells better or grabs the attention of woman more than the smell of Polo Blue!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite summer cologne.</li>
            <li>Love it and so does my girlfriend :)</li>
            <li>But after around 10 minutes, the &#x27;sweetness&#x27; wore off and reduced to a citrus musky scent that I fell in love with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Interestingly, this scent is not overpowering like so many colognes on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Combined, the two scents make for a wonderful citrus aromatic woodsy scent that simply put smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>on the fence about this scent, give out a chance and let it mix with some of your n favorite scents.</li>
            <li>i was expecting more...</li>
            <li>She can tell the difference between the original scent and the cheaper knockoffs that are sometimes available at a good discount from stands and on the internet.</li>
            <li>Great Christmas gift for my adult son!</li>
            <li>Excellent for its original purpose as well as for providing relief for minor skin wounds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cologne for years and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like a lot of colognes</li>
            <li>Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li>I have found that this scent mixes wonderfully with Tommy Hilfigers &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; scent that was released a few years back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>tried this one next and liked it even more.</li>
            <li>I gave this Ralph Lauren Eau de Toilette Spray Polo Blue to my ex-husband on one of his birthdays and he loved it.</li>
            <li>I love amazon they live up to what they say</li>
            <li>At this point I rarely purchase their product.  </li>
            <li>I would love to give one of my favorite colognes a 5 star rating, and I would, but the price is too high for such a rating.  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend spending such a high price to smell good.  </li>
            <li>very good scenty last long time at work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular fragance for a good number of years; the one I bought here lasts an hour or so (it could be less if weather is humid), then it&#x27;s all gone.  </li>
            <li>If the price was reasonable however, I would make it my one and only, paying homage, therefore in turn giving even more money to the Ralph Lauren company.  </li>
            <li>I tried the green one first liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I get more compliments wearing this than any other cologne I wear.  </li>
            <li>Although I admit different batches may smell slightly different, the fact that such a strong fragance goes away so quickly is what leads to believe this is not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>The product fit well - as expected</li>
            <li>It is not as powerful as regular eu-de cologne.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s weak, though I would say it&#x27;s great when mixed with another</li>
            <li>More compliments on this (Polo Blue) than any other.....</li>
            <li>have combined polo blue with many other scents as I fancy myself a cologne connoisseur.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my Brother and it arrived early to his delight!  </li>
            <li>smells good but scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as polo green...</li>
            <li>Surprised of the size and the smell</li>
            <li>Polo Blue eu-de cologne natural spray.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;To love anything is to risk having your heart wrung and broken.</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t take the risk, the alternative is worse, for people who hoard love shrivel and die on the inside.\\&quot; ~ C. S. Lewis ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>

            <li> Very nice perfume. A classic choice that never lets me down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular fragance for a good number of years; the one I bought here lasts an hour or so (it could be less if weather is humid), then it&#x27;s all gone.  Plus, when just applied, it doesn&#x27;t quite smell the same as the one you would buy in an airport duty-free shop. Although I admit different batches may smell slightly different, the fact that such a strong fragance goes away so quickly is what leads to believe this is not the real deal.  I would not recommend this to anyone, hence one star.</li>
            <li> Polo Blue for Men by Ralph Lauren Eau-de-toilette spray in the 6.7 oz bottle was ordered by me as a birhtday gift for my son, who uses it all of the time.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband as a gift. He loves Polo Blue.  It smells fantastic!  Love It!!</li>
            <li> Yes, Polo Blue, was a wonderful gift to my husband for his birthday.</li>
            <li> Super impressed with size.  Such a value!!</li>

            <li> We have been using this perfume since 2011. It&#x27;s one of the best perfume among my family. Thank you for letting us experience and have the good pricing and the authenticity.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bottle by mistake.  This bottle was less expensive and without looking at the detail I ordered this.  Polo Blue eu-de cologne natural spray.  I suppose naturaly spray has very little, if any, fragrance.  It is not as powerful as regular eu-de cologne.  It&#x27;s like using plain alchohol.  I plan to order regular eu-de cologne spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an acquired taste, either you like it or you don&#x27;t. Good price for this product. Happy wife, happy life...........</li>
            <li> My wife loves the aroma.  She can tell the difference between the original scent and the cheaper knockoffs that are sometimes available at a good discount from stands and on the internet.</li>
            <li> Best cologne out there and woman love it, been wearing it for 5+ years and haven&#x27;t found anything that smells better or grabs the attention of woman more than the smell of Polo Blue!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for years and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like a lot of colognes have, which I like.</li>

            <li> Great gift for my older nephew!  Smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I should have paid closer attention to the reviews- this product goes on nice with a good fragrance. However, within minutes the fragrance disappears. Others cannot smell it either. I will not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> NICE FRANGANCE AND EXCELLENT PRICE</li>
            <li> Son-in-law and Husband love the scent!</li>
            <li> very good scenty last long time at work</li>

If the price was reasonable however, I would make it my one and only, paying homage, therefore in turn giving even more money to the Ralph Lauren company.  At this point I rarely purchase their product.  But Amazon continues to be competitive in pricing of the overpriced water.</li>
            <li> I admit when I smelled from the bottle I thought this scent wasn&#x27;t for me. But after around 10 minutes, the &#x27;sweetness&#x27; wore off and reduced to a citrus musky scent that I fell in love with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, this scent is not overpowering like so many colognes on the market.

            <li> Envio y entrega en el tiempo estipulado , todo perfecto</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when wearing this!</li>
            <li> I have to give this a one star due to this having all the signs of a counterfeit. The serial numbers between the box &amp; the bottle do not match. The cap on the bottle do not have the RL and the fragrance only lasts a short time possible diluted.</li>
            <li> loss of smell after short time not like norm polo</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Brother and it arrived early to his delight!  What a gorgeous bottle and product!</li>
            <li> Great Christmas gift for my adult son! His favorite cologne!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son.  I bought two bottles because I thought my other son would like some, but he did not.  I found that cologne cannot be returned because it is a flammable liquid.</li>
