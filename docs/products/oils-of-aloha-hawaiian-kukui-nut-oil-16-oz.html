            <li>Great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>This Kukui Oil is great: light, quick absorbing, not greasy, etc.  </li>
            <li>we first seen this in Hawaii, he tried it and liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My previous experiences with amazon has been excellent.  </li>
            <li>Zits will either go away or pop up then heal more quickly if I use this oil when the zit starts to form.  </li>
            <li>I went with the Free Shipping company thinking I save $2.00&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This morning she is almost itch free.</li>
            <li>I get the unscented and mix it 50/50 with my favorite lotion (blended in my hand immediately before applying) right after drying off from a shower.</li>
            <li>I would be very happy if this could be placed into a small spray bottle.</li>
            <li>THIS IS REALLY GREAT FOR DRY, BURNT OR ITCHY SKIN.  </li>
            <li>Great for sunburns and dry skin problems.</li>
            <li>It is the best oil I have ever used have only used about three months, minimizes lines, and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it in a large bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure and not diluted like many  nut oils on the market.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I had asked the company if I can use it against stretch marks while pregnant</li>
            <li>This product does not leave a greats residue and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>Both of these people said it contained Retinyl Palmitate, which has been found to be harmful to pregnant women.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quickly absorb into the skin and does not get on your clothes</li>
            <li>It is the absolute best thing for taking the sting out of sunburn, I have used it on many different rashes when prescription meds didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve used it in my hair when it gets overly dry.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that I would have bought MORE of it in Hawaii!</li>
            <li>It helps moisterize but is an emollient so if you are very dry follow up with a good moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed with no smell.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil in the 4 ounce size thinking it safe &amp; natural.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to get it on the mainland and is about the same price as on Oahu.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin to start, perhaps a bit dry.</li>
            <li>I was told that the original Kukui Oil is much darker in color from Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>No other moisturizer is needed and my face feels silky smooth!</li>
            <li>great restoration oil for heavily  sun exposed skin!</li>
            <li>Its pure, and has some close to miraculous properties!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize an oil could be as light and fast absorbing as kukui nut oil.  </li>
            <li>This oil is the most perfect product for tough dry skin that was ever discovered by man.  </li>
            <li>Amazon delivered it very fast.</li>
            <li>It has many, many studies proving that it accelerates &amp; causes skin cancer, advanced tumors &amp; legions, human reproductive toxicant, Restricted in cosmetics (in Canada), evidence of carcinogenicity, studies show tumor formation at very low dose on skin &amp; lips, &amp; scores an 8 out of 10 for high hazard on cosmeticsdatabase.com.</li>
            <li>Your skin actually absorbs the oil so you will see a difference (unlike most lotions that are made with petroleum-based products that won&#x27;t absorb into the skin).  </li>
            <li>My only recommendation is to make sure you wash your hands after applying the oil as it will discolor clothing over time.</li>
            <li>will buy more from same seller (Oils of Aloha).</li>
            <li>Enjoy the natural benefits of this product.  </li>
            <li>We bought our first bottle in Hawaii</li>
            <li>I tried Amazon for another bottle and found the exact replacement.  </li>
            <li>I put it on, lightly after showering and arms are almost clear. . . .  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal!  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my feet if they are getting too rough or for anyone who has any kind of fungal rash on their feet.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I first received a bottle of kukui oil as a gift from a friend who visited the Hawaiian islands.</li>
            <li>I love that I can buy it in a larger bottle and without having to book a flight across the Pacific.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a small bottle when I was in Hawaii and it is so wonderful, that I had to have another one, this time a big bottle.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this product until I actually read the ingredients - contains Retinyl Palmitate that causes cancer.</li>
            <li>after testing kukui oil in Hawaii, ordered to large bottles through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry skin and sun burns and will make your skin really soft if used daily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic for all kinds of burns, especially from a stove.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizing is an absolute must.</li>
            <li>it really helped my husband&#x27;s skin problems.  </li>
            <li>This is why I ordered it, because I thought my skin would look like hers after using the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>I wait a few minutes to make sure the oil has absorbed before placing my foundation onto my face.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and slightly shiny but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The 3rd ingredient is Retinyl Palmitate...which is vitamin A &amp; sounds innocent enough but do your research!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using kukui nut oil for years for dry skin, possible eczema (I had it when I was young and might have had a slight case more recently) and whenever I needed a good moisturizer, having bought my first bottle in Hawaii while on vacation, but this year, I found a new use.</li>
            <li>Spent too much time snorkeling and come home with a bright red back.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend its usage.</li>
            <li>As with other things Hawaiian, this natural product of the Islands will leave sensual shades of refreshing sensation on everything it touches.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products and the either clogged my pores or left me still feeling dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>One in fragrance free, the other (16oz) in tropical breeze.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smooth the dry crack of weathered skin, it also will remove the pain of a severe sunburn within 2 days and the redness within 4.  </li>
            <li>mentioned in another review, be careful of putting the oil in contact with clothes, especially whites because it can make a light stain.  </li>
            <li>We use this for my 4month 2 week old son as its gentle enough.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product does not cause my skin any discomfort.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just careful putting it on, even that is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, addicted after living on the islands, but this price seems a bit high.</li>
            <li>As I was rubbing it into my skin, the scabs that had been hard and dry and catching, started to painlessly float off as I rubbed the oil in.  </li>
            <li>great stuff but its nearly impossible for one person to go through 16 ounces of this stuff before the product reaches its shelf life.</li>
            <li>Wow, big price increase.  </li>
            <li>When my skin is very dry in winter months, I use it after a shower before toweling off then pat dry - much like the Neutrogena sesame body oil.</li>

            <li> great stuff but its nearly impossible for one person to go through 16 ounces of this stuff before the product reaches its shelf life.</li>
            <li> Wow, big price increase.  </li>
            <li> When my skin is very dry in winter months, I use it after a shower before toweling off then pat dry - much like the Neutrogena sesame body oil.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on after the shower then wear a robe while I get ready.  </li>
            <li> I am using two drops, mixed with a few drops of water, applying directly to my face!</li>
            <li> All natural, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and a little goes a long, long way!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Then pat dry just like putting Johnson&#x27;s on a baby.  </li>
            <li> I ALSO GAVE SOME TO MY DAUGHTER TO USE ON HER INFANTS SCALP FOR DRY SKIN.  </li>
            <li> He put this in his hair after a shower and it keeps his head from being so dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> Last night I Rubbed her down with Kukui nut Oil.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and it works wonders as no other product has done in the past.</li>
            <li> Put it on after a shower but while still damp to wet.  </li>
            <li> Keeps the skin moist to the feel, but not really oily or damp, but rather</li>
            <li> This oil also helps heal cases of extreme dryness resulting in a raised, itchy area.  </li>
            <li> I use the tropical breeze after shower on my skin--same deal--no other moisturizer needed.  </li>
            <li> No additives,like other brands of kukui oil.</li>
            <li> This is our alternative remedy for diaper rash, dry skin, little scrapes and scratches and sore, inflamed gums from teething.  </li>
            <li> But this product ( Oils of Aloha) did make my skin little less dry,</li>
            <li> so very little goes a long ways.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I FIRST PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT IN HAWAII ON THE BIG ISLAND WHEN I SUFFERED A BAD SUNBURN.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but really helps itchy skin.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can say is that it can stain clothes</li>
            <li> Was not sure if it was allergies, dry skin or some sort of mites.</li>
            <li> I live in Michigan, where we get some cold, dry winters.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I put a small amount on my face as the winter weather makes my skin drier than usual.</li>
            <li> This coming from a person who has been a die hard Cetaphil user for the past 15+ years.</li>
            <li> It does not have a negative affect after my makeup has been finished.  </li>
            <li> My husband has psoriasis bad and his head is the major issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but less expensive here than purchasing in Hawaii!</li>
            <li> but the fact it was false advertising.  </li>
            <li> Just a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> While walking out along a lava field, pocket beach coastline on vacation in Hawaii, I took a nasty fall which resulted in a compound fracture of my big toe and a really bad case of lava rash aka road rash.</li>
            <li> gave this product five stars as I have nothing bad to say about it.  </li>
            <li> It boggles my mind to see the two one star reviews that say the ingredients are bad.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> and they said yes - which really outraged me!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Spent too much time snorkeling and come home with a bright red back.  Used this and my back never peeled!</li>
            <li> I discovered Kukui Oil when in Hawaii several years ago.  I use it along with a good body cream to fight dry skin and find it very effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for years.  It&#x27;s fantastic for all kinds of burns, especially from a stove.  Applied immediately it can take away the pain and promote healing.  I only wish I would&#x27;ve had it for my radiation burns!  It is great for skin issues!  I have dry skin.  Zits will either go away or pop up then heal more quickly if I use this oil when the zit starts to form.  This oil also helps heal cases of extreme dryness resulting in a raised, itchy area.  It helps moisterize but is an emollient so if you are very dry follow up with a good moisturizing cream.  Also, my dad uses this oil for the blackheads he had on his cheekbones and says it&#x27;s the only stuff that works.&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in another review, be careful of putting the oil in contact with clothes, especially whites because it can make a light stain.  I put this on at night or I wipe off excess oil before dressing.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and I use it twice daily. It leaves your skin silky without an oily residue. I have eczema and it works wonders as no other product has done in the past. I recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for anyone with any dry skin issues.  It is quickly absorbed with no smell.</li>
            <li> Love kukui nut oil!  It&#x27;s great for dry skin and sun burns and will make your skin really soft if used daily.  Your skin actually absorbs the oil so you will see a difference (unlike most lotions that are made with petroleum-based products that won&#x27;t absorb into the skin).  I usually put it on after the shower then wear a robe while I get ready.  Like most oils, a downside to this is it can stain clothes which is why I wear the robe after applying...haven&#x27;t had an issue with oil stains on my clothes yet.  I definitely recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years!  I used to buy it everytime we went to Hawaii and now I&#x27;m happy to be able to buy it from amazon on-line.  This works great as a mousturizer.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products and the either clogged my pores or left me still feeling dry and itchy.  Not so with this product; it&#x27;s great!  My only recommendation is to make sure you wash your hands after applying the oil as it will discolor clothing over time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize an oil could be as light and fast absorbing as kukui nut oil.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but less expensive here than purchasing in Hawaii!</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this product until I actually read the ingredients - contains Retinyl Palmitate that causes cancer. I had asked the company if I can use it against stretch marks while pregnant and they said yes - which really outraged me!!!! How can they keep quiet when it is a question about pregnancy? Why would you put that in a product from Hawaii from all places??? Extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> THIS IS REALLY GREAT FOR DRY, BURNT OR ITCHY SKIN.  IT GOES ON LIKE OIL BUT DOESN&#x27;T FEEL GREASY.</li>
            <li> This Kukui Oil is great: light, quick absorbing, not greasy, etc.  Very pleasant.  A wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more from same seller (Oils of Aloha).</li>
            <li> I bought this oil in the 4 ounce size thinking it safe &amp; natural. My first clue should have been that there are no ingredients listed here &amp; a good reason why! The 3rd ingredient is Retinyl Palmitate...which is vitamin A &amp; sounds innocent enough but do your research! It has many, many studies proving that it accelerates &amp; causes skin cancer, advanced tumors &amp; legions, human reproductive toxicant, Restricted in cosmetics (in Canada), evidence of carcinogenicity, studies show tumor formation at very low dose on skin &amp; lips, &amp; scores an 8 out of 10 for high hazard on cosmeticsdatabase.com.</li>
            <li> Just returned from Hawaii yesterday with my two bottles of this oil.  One in fragrance free, the other (16oz) in tropical breeze. (Smells like eucalyptus). My only wish is that I would have bought MORE of it in Hawaii! I paid 17.00 for the 16oz bottle in Hawaii, and here on amazon it is 48.00! Wow, big price increase.  It works really well.  I have pretty good skin to start, perhaps a bit dry. I am using two drops, mixed with a few drops of water, applying directly to my face! No other moisturizer is needed and my face feels silky smooth! Not kidding! My makeup seems to be going on smoother too. This coming from a person who has been a die hard Cetaphil user for the past 15+ years. I use the tropical breeze after shower on my skin--same deal--no other moisturizer needed.  I live in Michigan, where we get some cold, dry winters.  Moisturizing is an absolute must. Every day.  Enjoy the natural benefits of this product.  I will be giving as gifts!</li>
            <li> after testing kukui oil in Hawaii, ordered to large bottles through Amazon.  Love it.  Highly recommend its usage.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave a greats residue and absorbs quickly into the skin. My skin does feel more supple. It does remind me of mineral oil but without the scent.  I would recommend this kukui nut oil to every skin type. I wait a few minutes to make sure the oil has absorbed before placing my foundation onto my face. Yes, I put a small amount on my face as the winter weather makes my skin drier than usual. It does not have a negative affect after my makeup has been finished.  I would be very happy if this could be placed into a small spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using kukui nut oil for years for dry skin, possible eczema (I had it when I was young and might have had a slight case more recently) and whenever I needed a good moisturizer, having bought my first bottle in Hawaii while on vacation, but this year, I found a new use. While walking out along a lava field, pocket beach coastline on vacation in Hawaii, I took a nasty fall which resulted in a compound fracture of my big toe and a really bad case of lava rash aka road rash. As the scabs formed, I continued to use the antibiotic ointment that the hospital prescribed, but the scabs never softened. When I got home, I remembered my kukui nut oil. As I was rubbing it into my skin, the scabs that had been hard and dry and catching, started to painlessly float off as I rubbed the oil in.  Yet another use for this wonderful product, proving once again that the Hawaiian kings were right to bring the tree with them.</li>
            <li> This is WONDERFUL lotion. Great for sunburns and dry skin problems. Soaks in quickly. Soothing. No additives,like other brands of kukui oil. Glad to find it in a large bottle.</li>
            <li> The web page which showed the oil, said  &amp;#34;FREE SHIPPING&#x27; but $6.+ were added for regular shipping which brought the item to $60+.  Oils of Aloha had the item for $48.00 plus $8.00  for shipping. I went with the Free Shipping company thinking I save $2.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so.  it is not the $2.00 mind you but the fact it was false advertising.  I gave it ONE STAR  only because it was shipped promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous experiences with amazon has been excellent.  This was not....</li>
            <li> We bought our first bottle in Hawaii it really helped my husband&#x27;s skin problems.  I tried Amazon for another bottle and found the exact replacement.  It&#x27;s expensive but really helps itchy skin.</li>
            <li> This oil is the most perfect product for tough dry skin that was ever discovered by man.  Not only does it smooth the dry crack of weathered skin, it also will remove the pain of a severe sunburn within 2 days and the redness within 4.  This is it&#x27;s best use.  If you are fair skinned, buy this and never worry about leathered skin again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, gentle on the skin.  Put it on after a shower but while still damp to wet.  Then pat dry just like putting Johnson&#x27;s on a baby.  We use this for my 4month 2 week old son as its gentle enough.  Keeps the skin moist to the feel, but not really oily or damp, but rather smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is scented and non-scented.  The scented does take a bit getting used to.  Not really sure at first but it grows on you.  If you buy it in Hawaii then it takes you back there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product five stars as I have nothing bad to say about it.  However if you open the bottle it comes in, it not leak proof around the pouring area.  If you travel with it.  Either put some in another container find a way to seal it as it can leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a really great product which we will purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It boggles my mind to see the two one star reviews that say the ingredients are bad. Both of these people said it contained Retinyl Palmitate, which has been found to be harmful to pregnant women. It in fact, contains Ascorbyl Palmitate which is vitamin C.</li>
            <li> Just a little disappointed.  Lapita N&#x27;yongo and I are the same age, and I thought my skin would look like hers... This is why I ordered it, because I thought my skin would look like hers after using the whole bottle.  I was told that the original Kukui Oil is much darker in color from Hawaii.  But this product ( Oils of Aloha) did make my skin little less dry,</li>
            <li> This kukuinut oil seems to be helping to control my psoriasis.  I put it on, lightly after showering and arms are almost clear. . . .  good stuff.</li>
            <li> It is the best oil I have ever used have only used about three months, minimizes lines, and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> great stuff but its nearly impossible for one person to go through 16 ounces of this stuff before the product reaches its shelf life. get a smaller size unless sharing</li>
            <li> I discovered this oil while living on Maui years ago. It was recommended to me to treat stinging flea bites. Now back in Phoenix it is an excelkent moisturizer. Used it on scars after Breast Cancer surgery. The scars healed beautifully. Just recently my pitbull was scratching constantly. She had no fleas. Was not sure if it was allergies, dry skin or some sort of mites. I tried everything. Last night I Rubbed her down with Kukui nut Oil. This morning she is almost itch free. I wish I had known about this oil when my sister had radiation burns from cancer treatments! Its pure, and has some close to miraculous properties!</li>
            <li> This is our alternative remedy for diaper rash, dry skin, little scrapes and scratches and sore, inflamed gums from teething.  All natural, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and a little goes a long, long way!</li>
            <li> I FIRST PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT IN HAWAII ON THE BIG ISLAND WHEN I SUFFERED A BAD SUNBURN.  I WENT TO THE GIFT SHOP FOR SOME ALO VERA AND THE CLERK TALKED ME INTO BUYING KUKUI OIL FOR MY BURN.  MY ENTIRE BACK AND SHOULDERS WERE ITCHING SOMETHING AWFULL BUT WITH JUST ONE APPLICATION, IT WAS GONE AND THE BURN WAS GONE WITH NO FLAKING. I ALSO GAVE SOME TO MY DAUGHTER TO USE ON HER INFANTS SCALP FOR DRY SKIN.  IT WORKS.  !!!! AND IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!  Not blended with any sunflower or almond oils like those Alba products which include a miniscule amount of kukui nut oil.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I found this oil when our tour guide in Hawaii suggested it and I just love it. It has so many uses. It is the absolute best thing for taking the sting out of sunburn, I have used it on many different rashes when prescription meds didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve used it in my hair when it gets overly dry. I also use it on my feet if they are getting too rough or for anyone who has any kind of fungal rash on their feet. Also good for an all over body lotion. The only negative I can say is that it can stain clothes but I&#x27;m just careful putting it on, even that is worth it to me. There is nothing like it.</li>
            <li> Great product, It has no cents added and works great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> great restoration oil for heavily  sun exposed skin! An excellent product from Hawaii</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, addicted after living on the islands, but this price seems a bit high.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> As with other things Hawaiian, this natural product of the Islands will leave sensual shades of refreshing sensation on everything it touches. I prefer the unscented version; use it liberally before &amp; after sun exposure. Absorbed nicely by the skin, quickly turning dryness to delightful and satin.</li>
            <li> I first received a bottle of kukui oil as a gift from a friend who visited the Hawaiian islands. It is perfect for sunburns and sensitive skin. It is light weight, natural, and smells great! I love that I can buy it in a larger bottle and without having to book a flight across the Pacific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil does tend to &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; around the cap, so I&#x27;d recommend rinsing the bottle after use to keep it from getting sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I get the unscented and mix it 50/50 with my favorite lotion (blended in my hand immediately before applying) right after drying off from a shower. It works well with any lotion and gives an extra amount of moisture. Goes on smooth and slightly shiny but absorbs quickly. When my skin is very dry in winter months, I use it after a shower before toweling off then pat dry - much like the Neutrogena sesame body oil. It&#x27;s nice to get it on the mainland and is about the same price as on Oahu. Great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome . Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price  so very little goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used on face and body it&#x27;s quickly absorb into the skin and does not get on your clothes</li>
            <li> My husband has psoriasis bad and his head is the major issue. He put this in his hair after a shower and it keeps his head from being so dry in the winter. Make sure you protect your pillow will a towel as this is oil. we first seen this in Hawaii, he tried it and liked it.</li>
            <li> Just okay. Nothing to write about.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It&#x27;s pure and not diluted like many  nut oils on the market. I have sensitive skin and this product does not cause my skin any discomfort. I use it daily after my shower. I by this for my mom as well.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Been using daily for 20+ yrs after discovering in Hawaii to treat a sun burn. Have great hydrated soft skin...complimented by many.</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle when I was in Hawaii and it is so wonderful, that I had to have another one, this time a big bottle. Amazon delivered it very fast.</li>
