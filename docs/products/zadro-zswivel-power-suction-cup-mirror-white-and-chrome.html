            <li>Love!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite &amp;#34;applying make- up mirror&amp;#34; ever!</li>
            <li>when I first opened it however I am finding that it is actually a perfect size for me.</li>
            <li>need it for eye drops, works great, easy on and off.</li>
            <li>This has good suction, good magnification, looks fairly nice, easy to remove if we wanted to.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite large with wonderful lighting.</li>
            <li>Sticks securely, and is a great size.</li>
            <li>Perfect amount of magnification, and it really stays on the surface it is stuck to.  </li>
            <li>nice swivel and face not distorted.</li>
            <li>It is a nice looking mirror and it adheres well.</li>
            <li>The mirror swivels easily, and provides a good view.</li>
            <li>The mirror was securely packaged and arrived in good shape.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it sticks out a bit that way I don&#x27;t need to lean in so far and the fact that you can adjust the angle is awesome.</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to be adjust tilt</li>
            <li>So far the best magnifying mirror I ever had.</li>
            <li>The tilt option is great and that it adheres to my medicine cabinet mirror at the right height for me.</li>
            <li>very secure.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li>Since I regularly use a 2.50 correction reading glasses, it is wonderful to be able to see my eyelashes once again instead of just waving a mascara wand and hoping to catch something.  </li>
            <li>However, the stronger the mirror&#x27;s magnification, the greater the distortion and the closer</li>
            <li>I use this mirror many times a day.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is adjustable.  </li>
            <li>This is more of a woman&#x27;s make-up mirror.  </li>
            <li>Love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Okay, 46 &amp;#60;grumble&amp;#62;.</li>
            <li>I can see more wrinkles and pores than I may not want to see.</li>
            <li>Causes it to stick out more than an inch from the wall.</li>
            <li>Requires good lighting to be useful.</li>
            <li>Good product, stuck to the window like it should, but the magnification was higher than what I needed to do my makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but it fogs up too easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It adheres to another mirror easily and stays put.  </li>
            <li>I am able to easily clean this, and it&#x27;s pefect for putting on make up or washing my face.</li>
            <li>Easy to attach to the mirror</li>
            <li>Suction is really strong and doesn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>The suction cup is strong.</li>
            <li>I cannot get over how many people say that these mirrors are &amp;#34;distorted&amp;#34; because they don&#x27;t realize that in order to magnify it the image will appear that way until you hit the sweet spot on the mirror that fits your vision.</li>
            <li>The mirror is very easy to move from one place to another, and being able to adjust the angle is really helpful as well.  </li>
            <li>Product works fine and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>The suction cup allows both hand to be free.  </li>
            <li>If this mirror were available in these strengths, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Securely clamps to my mirror...</li>
            <li>Solidly, well made, and well designed, it has great optics.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is great, bit the suction cup to affix it to the wall is big and bulky.</li>
            <li>Using this in RV, so the portability was important to me.  </li>
            <li>The mount is quite secure.</li>
            <li>and they would stay fog free until I was through showering.  </li>
            <li>Stays put on a clean, smooth surface.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband needed to do a more accurate shave.</li>
            <li>The suction cup is super strong and you can&#x27;t beat the price for this well manufactured item.</li>
            <li>Super easy to mount</li>
            <li>Not a flaw in the product, I just should have done more research as far as what would have worked better for me.</li>
            <li>So far, it is performing nicely.</li>
            <li>Overall a good value.</li>
            <li>strong suction cup perfectly holds the mirrorin place and easy to take it down with a simple twist.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Therefore, having this magnifying mirror has help me tremendously when applying make up.  </li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon has refunded me for this defective product.</li>
            <li>I was startled by a surprising explosive sound coming from the other room.</li>
            <li>It holds perfectly to the bathroom mirror, the suction is strong, it the right size to apply makeup, it is just right for poor eyesight.</li>
            <li>As I found this suction cup of excellent quality, even the best design will fail if vacuum in the cup weakens or completely disappears.</li>
            <li>Looks kind of cool mounted on regular mirror.</li>
            <li>It has strong suction and stays on my bathroom mirror very well.</li>
            <li>Very surprised and pleased by this.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>This product is a really good idea however the mirror is magnified too much and when you move the mirror more than 8 inches away from you the image is turned upside down.</li>
            <li>Clear, love the tilt, love the way it &amp;#34;juts&amp;#34; out from where you have mounted it (in my case on another mirror) which allows you to see without leaning so far forward.</li>
            <li>Worth buying</li>
            <li>useful tool.</li>
            <li>Quality ball joint allows smooth adjustment of angle in all directions, at the same time firmly supporting weight of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;-  Elegant powered suction cup.</li>
            <li>Works great, it sticks to mirror very tightly.</li>
            <li>I have a small handheld mirror that magnifies x10 and works great.  </li>
            <li>The magnification is just right and the image is very clear and distortion free.</li>
            <li>Great Visual Aid for anyone needing extra closeness to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li>The mount is super strong and likely would never let go.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Has a much better suction than just a standard suction cup.  </li>
            <li>Turn mount counter clockwise first if needed.  </li>
            <li>As one begin to age eye sight tend to be the first thing to go.  </li>
            <li>Its lifespan was short and it was an okay mirror while it lasted</li>
            <li>Just returned from a six weeks trip with MANY different surfaces ..</li>
            <li>many different angles</li>
            <li>The mirror is magnified enough for me to apply makeup easily.</li>
            <li>With my older eyes this was a much needed aid for all things pertaining to the face!  </li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>10X magnification is just too much</li>
            <li>Pores very visible at about 12&amp;#34;-18&amp;#34; away.</li>
            <li>I needed a mirror that I could step away from and see my whole face, but this one requires you to be very close or it&#x27;s blurry.</li>
            <li>This sticks very well to my bathroom tile.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Sticks very well to our bathroom mirror and the flexibility is a plus.</li>
            <li>Great for makeup, not too big, not too small, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is so user friendly and facilitates the process of grooming as it extends from the surface it&#x27;s applied to, especially in situations where you have lean over a vanity chest get closer to the mirror.</li>
            <li>This would be a better shaving mirror with less magnification.</li>
            <li>Contemporary, the pivot stand lets you suction mount it, or use it as a stand.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>The magnification is to high for my purposes and it has no fog prevention technology.  </li>
            <li>Use it daily and well worth the $$</li>
            <li>I used to think only mirrors with lights were worth it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s got very clear magnification</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m old!).  </li>
            <li>All in all, well made...just NOT for old eyes!</li>
            <li>This mirror holds firmly but also removes easily when done using.</li>
            <li>Good, clear mirror with a strong suction base.  </li>
            <li>Wow, it holds tight, tilts to catch the light, and brings the mirror closer without having to lean close to the cabinet.  </li>
            <li>and I have to be just a couple of inches away from the mirror to see clearly.  </li>
            <li>And then you can clearly see your skull</li>
            <li>Gave it to my 22 year old granddaughter (she wears contacts or glasses)</li>
            <li>Wow I no longer leave the house with mascara under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 57 year old woman and this mirror is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li>It will be used in the bathroom, attached to the large flat mirror hanging over the sink.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Just the right size (not too big or too small), extends from medicine cabinet mirror just the right distance, quality suction device.  </li>
            <li>New user can check connection much earlier to confirm that proper method was used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for two days and have used it at home on my mirror and taken it to the gym to place it on their full-length mirror.  </li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t fallen off my bathroom mirror in the 2 months I have had it and actually had trouble taking it down to clean the mirror.</li>
            <li>warning about suction cups: when surfing Web in search of good mirror, I found on several occassions complains on bad mirrors which crashed, because they fell off the walls.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but it fogs up too easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>

            <li> I cannot get over how many people say that these mirrors are &amp;#34;distorted&amp;#34; because they don&#x27;t realize that in order to magnify it the image will appear that way until you hit the sweet spot on the mirror that fits your vision.</li>
            <li> The mirror is very easy to move from one place to another, and being able to adjust the angle is really helpful as well.  </li>
            <li> Product works fine and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The suction cup allows both hand to be free.  </li>

            <li> Overall a good value.</li>
            <li> strong suction cup perfectly holds the mirrorin place and easy to take it down with a simple twist.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Therefore, having this magnifying mirror has help me tremendously when applying make up.  </li>

            <li> It holds perfectly to the bathroom mirror, the suction is strong, it the right size to apply makeup, it is just right for poor eyesight.</li>
            <li> As I found this suction cup of excellent quality, even the best design will fail if vacuum in the cup weakens or completely disappears.</li>
            <li> Looks kind of cool mounted on regular mirror.</li>
            <li> It has strong suction and stays on my bathroom mirror very well.</li>
            <li> Very surprised and pleased by this.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li> This product is a really good idea however the mirror is magnified too much and when you move the mirror more than 8 inches away from you the image is turned upside down.</li>
            <li> Clear, love the tilt, love the way it &amp;#34;juts&amp;#34; out from where you have mounted it (in my case on another mirror) which allows you to see without leaning so far forward.</li>
            <li> Worth buying</li>
            <li> useful tool.</li>
            <li> Quality ball joint allows smooth adjustment of angle in all directions, at the same time firmly supporting weight of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;-  Elegant powered suction cup.</li>
            <li> Works great, it sticks to mirror very tightly.</li>
            <li> I have a small handheld mirror that magnifies x10 and works great.  </li>
            <li> The magnification is just right and the image is very clear and distortion free.</li>
            <li> Great Visual Aid for anyone needing extra closeness to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li> The mount is super strong and likely would never let go.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Has a much better suction than just a standard suction cup.  </li>
            <li> Turn mount counter clockwise first if needed.  </li>
            <li> As one begin to age eye sight tend to be the first thing to go.  </li>
            <li> Its lifespan was short and it was an okay mirror while it lasted</li>
            <li> Just returned from a six weeks trip with MANY different surfaces ..</li>
            <li> many different angles</li>
            <li> The mirror is magnified enough for me to apply makeup easily.</li>
            <li> With my older eyes this was a much needed aid for all things pertaining to the face!  </li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> 10X magnification is just too much</li>
            <li> Pores very visible at about 12&amp;#34;-18&amp;#34; away.</li>
            <li> I needed a mirror that I could step away from and see my whole face, but this one requires you to be very close or it&#x27;s blurry.</li>
            <li> This sticks very well to my bathroom tile.  </li>
            <li> but I really like this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Sticks very well to our bathroom mirror and the flexibility is a plus.</li>
            <li> Great for makeup, not too big, not too small, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is so user friendly and facilitates the process of grooming as it extends from the surface it&#x27;s applied to, especially in situations where you have lean over a vanity chest get closer to the mirror.</li>
            <li> This would be a better shaving mirror with less magnification.</li>
            <li> Contemporary, the pivot stand lets you suction mount it, or use it as a stand.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> The magnification is to high for my purposes and it has no fog prevention technology.  </li>
            <li> Use it daily and well worth the $$</li>
            <li> I used to think only mirrors with lights were worth it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s got very clear magnification</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m old!).  </li>
            <li> All in all, well made...just NOT for old eyes!</li>
            <li> This mirror holds firmly but also removes easily when done using.</li>
            <li> Good, clear mirror with a strong suction base.  </li>
            <li> Wow, it holds tight, tilts to catch the light, and brings the mirror closer without having to lean close to the cabinet.  </li>
            <li> and I have to be just a couple of inches away from the mirror to see clearly.  </li>
            <li> And then you can clearly see your skull</li>
            <li> Gave it to my 22 year old granddaughter (she wears contacts or glasses)</li>
            <li> Wow I no longer leave the house with mascara under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 57 year old woman and this mirror is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> It will be used in the bathroom, attached to the large flat mirror hanging over the sink.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Just the right size (not too big or too small), extends from medicine cabinet mirror just the right distance, quality suction device.  </li>
            <li> New user can check connection much earlier to confirm that proper method was used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two days and have used it at home on my mirror and taken it to the gym to place it on their full-length mirror.  </li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t fallen off my bathroom mirror in the 2 months I have had it and actually had trouble taking it down to clean the mirror.</li>
            <li> warning about suction cups: when surfing Web in search of good mirror, I found on several occassions complains on bad mirrors which crashed, because they fell off the walls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a magnifying mirror that is the right size and that does what you need.</li>
            <li> , I now carry a flat card (i.e. credit card, gift card, etc.)</li>
            <li> What I discovered was a mess of glass shards and this 4 month old mirror lying on the ground.</li>
            <li> I made a little &amp;#34;safety tether&amp;#34; out of clear fishing line and ran it around the edge of the medicine cabinet, and then taped the tether to the interior of it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised as long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> The magnification is not clear or x10.  </li>
            <li> negative reviews I read had mainly to do with the suction cup losing its hold over time, causing the mirror to fall and break.</li>
            <li> My shower is extremely small and I find this mirror sticks out a bit too far.  </li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Elegant because avoiding ugly levers, the suction is achieved by turning the ring, which is a part of the base.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> Stick this to a window on a sunny day, and you wont miss a single eyebrow or anything else that needs to be tweezed!!  </li>
            <li> I will be buying another for the other side.</li>
            <li> So I got her 2 more---one to use now and the other just in case the one broke.</li>
            <li> I had no problem figuring out how to attach it to my regular mirror (find right spot and screw down base) for when I need to see my face close up for mascara and plucking brows and such.</li>
            <li> Then press on and turn clockwise - locks and sticks on hard until you turn it back</li>
            <li> I love that this has a swivel base</li>
            <li> Be careful as the mirror fell off the shower wall and shattered!!</li>
            <li> The suction device is very efficient unlike some others I have used in the past which were difficult at times to apply to any given surface.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I need to occasionally move the mirror and to do that you need to twist the base (simple) and then grab this tiny little rubber tab to break the suction.</li>
            <li> Doe.s not stay up, fell off the wall and broke within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When securing suction cup to the glass, I use saliva as a sealant and re-attach cup every few months.</li>
            <li> The suction had failed and the mirror had fallen about 5ft from its previous home attached to another, larger bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> I usually take it along with me when I travel.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I need to see my face this close up</li>
            <li> This makes it a not very good product for MY purposes.  </li>
            <li> I brought it despite the rather awkward suction cup on the back!  </li>
            <li> Personally, I think those that said it fell and broke or wouldn&#x27;t stick, was user error as they didn&#x27;t tighten the base.</li>
            <li> I am not saying that it&#x27;s a bad product, just not useful to me.</li>
            <li> I could angle it just ANY direction necessary to catch whatever bad lighting I had in whatever bathroom we had (Europe)!  </li>
            <li> I was having difficulty doing this until I examined the base and saw that I needed to turn the base counterclockwise first, to &amp;#34;unlock&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Difficult to change position on mirror.</li>
            <li> It remains somewhat difficult to see into, but I&#x27;m keeping it anyway as I get by with it.  </li>
            <li> Awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I merely found a convenient spot to stick it into in the luggage and away we went!  </li>
            <li> Installation tip: the instructions say to push the suction cup onto the surface and then turn the base clockwise to lock it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really works well. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This mirror is so user friendly and facilitates the process of grooming as it extends from the surface it&#x27;s applied to, especially in situations where you have lean over a vanity chest get closer to the mirror.The suction device is very efficient unlike some others I have used in the past which were difficult at times to apply to any given surface. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for myself but the magnification was too low (I&#x27;m old!).  Gave it to my 22 year old granddaughter (she wears contacts or glasses) and she LOVES it.  Just the right size (not too big or too small), extends from medicine cabinet mirror just the right distance, quality suction device.  All in all, well made...just NOT for old eyes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just perfect - I already love it. Installation tip: the instructions say to push the suction cup onto the surface and then turn the base clockwise to lock it. I was having difficulty doing this until I examined the base and saw that I needed to turn the base counterclockwise first, to &amp;#34;unlock&amp;#34; it, before applying it to the medicine cabinet. Once that was done, it applied and locked into place quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative reviews I read had mainly to do with the suction cup losing its hold over time, causing the mirror to fall and break. I made a little &amp;#34;safety tether&amp;#34; out of clear fishing line and ran it around the edge of the medicine cabinet, and then taped the tether to the interior of it. Problem solved.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed.  The suction cup allows both hand to be free.  The only improvement would be to make it lighted.</li>
            <li> Great mirror. I had no problem figuring out how to attach it to my regular mirror (find right spot and screw down base) for when I need to see my face close up for mascara and plucking brows and such. Personally, I think those that said it fell and broke or wouldn&#x27;t stick, was user error as they didn&#x27;t tighten the base. I think it was a good buy. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful device. My husband bought me a Vanity Girl makeup mirror. (Great product). It&#x27;s quite large with wonderful lighting. However, I&#x27;m not in my twenties and I placed this on the mirror for the application of my eye makeup. I will be buying another for the other side. Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great. I cannot get over how many people say that these mirrors are &amp;#34;distorted&amp;#34; because they don&#x27;t realize that in order to magnify it the image will appear that way until you hit the sweet spot on the mirror that fits your vision.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised as long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> just what i was looking for. 10x and  traveable.</li>
            <li> This is FABULOUS!!  The mirror is very easy to move from one place to another, and being able to adjust the angle is really helpful as well.  Stick this to a window on a sunny day, and you wont miss a single eyebrow or anything else that needs to be tweezed!!  :)</li>
            <li> Love my mirror!  The suction cup is super strong and you can&#x27;t beat the price for this well manufactured item. The only improvement would be to add lights.</li>
            <li> It fell apart after two months. I tried contacting the manufacturer and they referred me to Amazon.</li>
            <li> The best magnifying mirror I&#x27;ve ever bought !!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted. Couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> Love!  Suction is really strong and doesn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> This product is great I&#x27;ve looked for a mirror to attach to the big bathroom mirror. I&#x27;ve never run across a swivel mirror that works so well  and your hands are free  excellent product</li>
            <li> This has good suction, good magnification, looks fairly nice, easy to remove if we wanted to.  I would get it again.</li>
            <li> Handy - the 360 degree swivel is great.  Stays put on a clean, smooth surface. Optical quality is good.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Zadro Z&#x27;swivel mirror.  The mirror is magnified enough for me to apply makeup easily. The mirror swivels easily, and provides a good view. The mirror was securely packaged and arrived in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a magnifying mirror that is the right size and that does what you need. This one is great for mounting on your bathroom mirror.  I wish it had a protective travel case!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two days and have used it at home on my mirror and taken it to the gym to place it on their full-length mirror.  I love that this has a swivel base and I can both move it around AND that it extends out from the wall a bit.  The twist-on suction holds so well, I now carry a flat card (i.e. credit card, gift card, etc.) so I can pry up the tab to release it after twisting off to release the suction.  I wear mid-length fingernails and this may not be a problem if your nails are very short.  Since I regularly use a 2.50 correction reading glasses, it is wonderful to be able to see my eyelashes once again instead of just waving a mascara wand and hoping to catch something.  However, the stronger the mirror&#x27;s magnification, the greater the distortion and the closer you must be to focus.  10X magnification is just too much and I have to be just a couple of inches away from the mirror to see clearly.  A 6X - 8X magnification would probably be ideal.  If this mirror were available in these strengths, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works great, it sticks to mirror very tightly.</li>
            <li> I use this mirror many times a day.  Suction works great as does swivel.  No issues, only wish I had gotten it sooner!</li>
            <li> I did read where some reviewers had an issue with this item staying stuck to the mirror but if you take the time to read the instructions it works great.  Has a much better suction than just a standard suction cup.  I would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband needed to do a more accurate shave. Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is my favorite &amp;#34;applying make- up mirror&amp;#34; ever! Clear, love the tilt, love the way it &amp;#34;juts&amp;#34; out from where you have mounted it (in my case on another mirror) which allows you to see without leaning so far forward.</li>
            <li> Wow, it holds tight, tilts to catch the light, and brings the mirror closer without having to lean close to the cabinet.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great Visual Aid for anyone needing extra closeness to apply makeup.  Love the fact that it is adjustable.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Doe.s not stay up, fell off the wall and broke within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> Suction cup works great. The magnification is perfect.  Use it daily and well worth the $$</li>
            <li> Product works fine and arrived on time. Would do business with Zadro again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it works so well.  It adheres to another mirror easily and stays put.  Great product that works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product so I can cut the back of my head with trimmers (completing the line-up). This product is a really good idea however the mirror is magnified too much and when you move the mirror more than 8 inches away from you the image is turned upside down.</li>
            <li> This mirror is not as advertised.  I have a small handheld mirror that magnifies x10 and works great.  I wanted something bigger and it sticking to the vanity mirror was a plus.  The magnification is not clear or x10.  Will be returning.</li>
            <li> I used to think only mirrors with lights were worth it.  I now beleive this is the best mirror availalbe.  Perfect amount of magnification, and it really stays on the surface it is stuck to.  I am able to easily clean this, and it&#x27;s pefect for putting on make up or washing my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to rate this product with stars.  I am a guy who need a replacement shaving mirror for the shower.  This is more of a woman&#x27;s make-up mirror.  The magnification is to high for my purposes and it has no fog prevention technology.  This makes it a not very good product for MY purposes.  I am not saying that it&#x27;s a bad product, just not useful to me.</li>
            <li> Securely clamps to my mirror... Turn mount counter clockwise first if needed.  Then press on and turn clockwise - locks and sticks on hard until you turn it back counter clockwise- very secure.  Pores very visible at about 12&amp;#34;-18&amp;#34; away.</li>
            <li> This is the best mirror ever!  It holds perfectly to the bathroom mirror, the suction is strong, it the right size to apply makeup, it is just right for poor eyesight.</li>
            <li> Wow I no longer leave the house with mascara under my eyes. It&#x27;s been up for two months and never loosened or fell. Love this mirror.  I like that it sticks out a bit that way I don&#x27;t need to lean in so far and the fact that you can adjust the angle is awesome.</li>
            <li> Stays on like nothing else. This is a great magnifying mirror. Just bought our second one. The suction cup is strong. After putting it on the larger mirror in our bathroom it doesn&#x27;t come off even when cleaning or trying to yank it off.</li>
            <li> Good product, stuck to the window like it should, but the magnification was higher than what I needed to do my makeup. I needed a mirror that I could step away from and see my whole face, but this one requires you to be very close or it&#x27;s blurry. Not a flaw in the product, I just should have done more research as far as what would have worked better for me.</li>
            <li> Suction is very good and the magnification makes it easy to do a nice, neat job.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mirror.  As one begin to age eye sight tend to be the first thing to go.  Therefore, having this magnifying mirror has help me tremendously when applying make up.  I usually take it along with me when I travel.  A must have if your eye sight has changed.</li>
            <li> Awkward to use. Difficult to change position on mirror.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror and perfect for my 45 year old eyes. Okay, 46 &amp;#60;grumble&amp;#62;. The magnification is just right and the image is very clear and distortion free. The mount is super strong and likely would never let go. My only complaint is that I need to occasionally move the mirror and to do that you need to twist the base (simple) and then grab this tiny little rubber tab to break the suction. Why on earth the tab is soooooo tiny I will never know. It needs to be easier to grab and pull. Everything else is perfect, but that damn tab!!</li>
            <li> I was startled by a surprising explosive sound coming from the other room. What I discovered was a mess of glass shards and this 4 month old mirror lying on the ground. The suction had failed and the mirror had fallen about 5ft from its previous home attached to another, larger bathroom mirror. Its lifespan was short and it was an okay mirror while it lasted but now it resides in a brown paper bag, soon to be retired to a landfill somewhere. Luckily Amazon has refunded me for this defective product.</li>
            <li> Sticks securely, and is a great size.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This sticks very well to my bathroom tile.  I move the position around every morning and it has not come off since I put it there. Good magnification for someone who wears reading glasses.  I wear +250 and this mirror is perfect. You can adjust it to your needs by how close you get to it as well.</li>
            <li> Not for men shaving!  You have to put your face in the mirror for it to come in focus. And then you can clearly see your skull but you cannot shave because you cannot move because you are all up in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Not sure I need to see my face this close up but I really like this mirror.  The tilt option is great and that it adheres to my medicine cabinet mirror at the right height for me.</li>
            <li> Solidly, well made, and well designed, it has great optics.  I can see more wrinkles and pores than I may not want to see.</li>
            <li> Great suction mirror.  Perfect size..nice swivel and face not distorted.</li>
            <li> The mirror is great, bit the suction cup to affix it to the wall is big and bulky. Causes it to stick out more than an inch from the wall.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I though and it took a while to get it to stuck to the mirrored wall I have but the I must have done something because it latched on and is still there. Like all magnifying mirrors you have to be close to it to see your face but I think that it works well and at a fraction of the price of the ones I saw at Bed Bath and Beyond (even with the 20% off coupon).</li>
            <li> I used this mirror for a couple of days and it worked great.  Nice to be able to be adjust tilt so you get the best light.&lt;br /&gt;But then it popped off the mirror in the middle of the day, and I cannot get it to have suction again.  Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still going to work with it as the mirror is good.</li>
            <li> THIS MIRROR IS  JUST WONDERFUL!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, WONDERFUL!  Just returned from a six weeks trip with MANY different surfaces .. may different lighting situations .. many different angles necessary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this mirror specifically for this trip not having a clue how it would function over time.  Was I happy I brought it despite the rather awkward suction cup on the back!  I merely found a convenient spot to stick it into in the luggage and away we went!  I just LOVED this mirror!  I could angle it just ANY direction necessary to catch whatever bad lighting I had in whatever bathroom we had (Europe)!  It was just great!  I will never travel again without it!</li>
            <li> This is great, but I see things I would rather not!</li>
            <li> Loved this mirror! Worth buying</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t fallen off my bathroom mirror in the 2 months I have had it and actually had trouble taking it down to clean the mirror. Very surprised and pleased by this.</li>
            <li> Awesome mirror! Sticks very well to our bathroom mirror and the flexibility is a plus.</li>
            <li> My husband can now put his contacts on. I can see where the eyeliner goes.  It is a nice looking mirror and it adheres well.</li>
            <li> Appears to be as advertised.  Using this in RV, so the portability was important to me.  So far, it is performing nicely.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas and the one broke. So I got her 2 more---one to use now and the other just in case the one broke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 57 year old woman and this mirror is a lifesaver. Super easy to mount, I can actually put on my eye make up now with no mistakes and it&#x27;s got very clear magnification</li>
            <li> Looks kind of cool mounted on regular mirror. The mount is quite secure. This would be a better shaving mirror with less magnification. Requires good lighting to be useful. Overall a good value.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!  This mirror holds firmly but also removes easily when done using. It is excellent quality!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I got this for my shower.  It&#x27;s OK, but it fogs up too easily.  With my former mirrors I&#x27;ve always had to put soap on them, then rinse  them off and they would stay fog free until I was through showering.  With this mirror the soap thing doesn&#x27;t work as well.  It remains somewhat difficult to see into, but I&#x27;m keeping it anyway as I get by with it.  On the plus side, the suction cup is excellent and easy to maneuver.  My shower is extremely small and I find this mirror sticks out a bit too far.  I tend to whack it while showering and drying off--just hope I don&#x27;t knock it off the wall.</li>
            <li> So far the best magnifying mirror I ever had. It will be used in the bathroom, attached to the large flat mirror hanging over the sink.&lt;br /&gt;What I like the most:&lt;br /&gt;-  Quality optics which means undistorted and evenly focused picture&lt;br /&gt;-  Quality ball joint allows smooth adjustment of angle in all directions, at the same time firmly supporting weight of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;-  Elegant powered suction cup. Elegant because avoiding ugly levers, the suction is achieved by turning the ring, which is a part of the base.&lt;br /&gt;Here warning about suction cups: when surfing Web in search of good mirror, I found on several occassions complains on bad mirrors which crashed, because they fell off the walls. As I found this suction cup of excellent quality, even the best design will fail if vacuum in the cup weakens or completely disappears. Porosity of the wall is the prime problem. When securing suction cup to the glass, I use saliva as a sealant and re-attach cup every few months. New user can check connection much earlier to confirm that proper method was used.</li>
            <li> need it for eye drops, works great, easy on and off. would get another if need be ever. good mag</li>
            <li> Wife writing. This mirror is perfect. Great for makeup, not too big, not too small, exactly what I wanted. Contemporary, the pivot stand lets you suction mount it, or use it as a stand. I have it in my powder room and it is perfect for checking make up without looking like a makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> strong suction cup perfectly holds the mirrorin place and easy to take it down with a simple twist.&lt;br /&gt;Very useful tool.</li>
            <li> Be careful as the mirror fell off the shower wall and shattered!!</li>
            <li> Good, clear mirror with a strong suction base.  My son uses it to look at his teeth while he&#x27;s learning how to brush properly.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.  It has strong suction and stays on my bathroom mirror very well. It was a little smaller than I expected when I first opened it however I am finding that it is actually a perfect size for me.</li>
            <li> With my older eyes this was a much needed aid for all things pertaining to the face!  Great for travel too.  Easy to attach to the mirror and it hasn&#x27;t fallen yet!</li>
