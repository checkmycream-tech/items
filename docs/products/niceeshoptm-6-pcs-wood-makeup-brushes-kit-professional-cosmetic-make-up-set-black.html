            <li>When I ordered these I was looking forward to cheap throw away brushes..  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy these until they are no longer available...</li>
            <li>Soft and good angles to the brushes.</li>
            <li>I loved it and it came to my house unexpected but made my day.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price, i love the middle one brush...</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s okay, its exactly as what it is in the photo.</li>

            <li>They are soft and look nice.</li>

            <li>The size of the brushes are very small but the quality of them are excellent.</li>

            <li>Get some super glue with your purchase.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>

            <li>I love my new make-up brushes.</li>
            <li>Nice for the price I really only use one or two out of this set</li>
            <li>well worth the price ðŸ˜Œ</li>
            <li>For 50 cents a brush, they are definitely worth picking up in my opinion.</li>
            <li>but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would say these are well worth it if you want to start out using makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>This set looks really nice in actual and I have no complaints about it.</li>
            <li>They are soft but firm so the eyeshadow goes where you want it to, excellent control.</li>
            <li>All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li>dont clean very well though.</li>
            <li>There are pretty tiny but so cute I love how soft they areâœ¨ there like travel size</li>
            <li>These makeup brushes are okay for someone just starting to use makeup like my granddaughters.</li>
            <li>On first use the bristles fell and some even stayed on my face with my make up</li>
            <li>This brush set looks exactly as shown too.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used each one but only 2 out of the 5 actually work pretty good</li>
            <li>Very nice quality, a bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>I rated it 4 stars because the brushes are smaller but other than that they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>Good for the small amount I paid</li>
            <li>They are super soft and the brushes don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Very light but shorter than I expected.</li>
            <li>they kind of scratch and hurt a little</li>
            <li>I would absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast tho</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much quality for just $2.99</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pick up a whole lot of pigment, but you can work with them</li>
            <li>I did feel the brushes and they felt very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>I threw all of my old brushes out after I tried all of these out and decided that they&#x27;re the right ones for me.</li>
            <li>there pretty small, average length but good cheap eye brushes</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just soft &amp; firm enough to be a great brush set....</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t as soft or fluffy as higher-end brushes, but they pick up a decent amount of pigment and are surprisingly durable so far.</li>
            <li>These are a decent set of brushes to me.</li>
            <li>Seriously, not even one hair has fallen out of any of the brushes.</li>
            <li>Shipping was free and faster than expected.  </li>
            <li>soft and very well made</li>
            <li>They are soft too and apply make up really well.</li>
            <li>I finally found something worth it.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at the quality of these brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>Also, they came in about 3 weks early!</li>
            <li>If your looking for soft bristles, try another set.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and the bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out at all.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft &amp; no, the brushes don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>So soft for the skin</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and applies makeup well.</li>
            <li>however I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li>These brushes are surprisingly high quality, given the low cost.</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>worth the little amount they cost ðŸŒ¸âœ¨</li>
            <li>so I was presently surprised with these (finally) arrived.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay quality but the brushes are a little too firm for me.</li>
            <li>This was suppose to be a 6 piece set but only 5 came their not long term brushes.</li>

            <li> This was suppose to be a 6 piece set but only 5 came their not long term brushes.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it takes a while to clean but using a little dishwashing liquid definitely helps.</li>
            <li> They are a bit on the small side in my opinion, but not so much so that it bothers me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think they will last long though.</li>
            <li> but it mainly focus on the nose. :/</li>
            <li> Bristles were soft but firm if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> the brushes are small and thin to top it off.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I&#x27;m pretty rough when washing them and they aren&#x27;t stiff or bent oddly after a washing.</li>
            <li> Very soft but kinda small.</li>
            <li> They pick up pigment better than my expensive brushes!</li>
            <li> They are really soft and I did not expect the brushes to be small.</li>
            <li> I use one for applying a yellow powder under my eyes for the dark circles I was born with.</li>
            <li> Not high quality</li>
            <li> i review alot of items from other companies</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that the tips are black.</li>
            <li> But they came in little plastic things.</li>
            <li> these little makeup brushes ppl think they r mac brushes...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little too stiff for my liking.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re stiff.</li>
            <li> yes the handle is a little small</li>
            <li> I like that they are so compact that you can keep them in your purse or small makeup bag.</li>

            <li> These makeup brushes are okay for someone just starting to use makeup like my granddaughters. Don&#x27;t think they will last long though.</li>
            <li> Can be recycled once used. Leaves little carbon footprint behind and helps keep the earth cleaner. Each brush is endowed with great brush-endings and solid body made of wood.</li>
            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> Nice for the price I really only use one or two out of this set</li>
            <li> These are great! They are smaller than I thought that would be, but that&#x27;s not too big of a deal. They look nice, and work even better. I would absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good quality (for the price) well worth the price ðŸ˜Œ</li>
            <li> IM INLOVE WHITH THEM ALL... THEY ARE JUST PERFECT </li>
            <li> This was a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!! On first use the bristles fell and some even stayed on my face with my make up don&#x27;t waste your time the brushes are small and thin to top it off. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! Shipping was fast tho maybe I had bad luck with the set but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> These brushes are surprisingly high quality, given the low cost. They haven&#x27;t shedded at all, and they apply makeup quite nicely. They are a bit on the small side in my opinion, but not so much so that it bothers me. For 50 cents a brush, they are definitely worth picking up in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Good material for a great price, I would buy it again, nothing wrong with my product.</li>
            <li> They didnt come in a case for me. I don&#x27;t know if it was supposed too. But they came in little plastic things. They are really soft and I did not expect the brushes to be small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking 12 years.</li>
            <li> These fell apart when I opened them. Get some super glue with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing so far. Soft and good angles to the brushes.</li>
            <li> These are GREAT! I didn&#x27;t expect much quality for just $2.99 so I was presently surprised with these (finally) arrived. It took longer to get here because they came from another country but it was well worth the wait. I don&#x27;t mind that the tips are black. That might be bothersome to some people but not to me. These are perfect for any kind of powder application....I use one for applying a yellow powder under my eyes for the dark circles I was born with. They&#x27;re just soft &amp; firm enough to be a great brush set....and there are different shapes so everything you&#x27;d need is here.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes there are eazy to use</li>
            <li> There are pretty tiny but so cute I love how soft they areâœ¨ there like travel size I love them there worth the little amount they cost ðŸŒ¸âœ¨</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Has all the necessary sizes.</li>
            <li> They are ok. The bristles are a little too stiff for my liking. If your looking for soft bristles, try another set.</li>
            <li> I love my new make-up brushes. I really am happy that I bought this set. They&#x27;re soft and the bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out at all. I threw all of my old brushes out after I tried all of these out and decided that they&#x27;re the right ones for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay quality but the brushes are a little too firm for me. They don&#x27;t pick up a whole lot of pigment, but you can work with them</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I expected. 6 brushes. Not high quality but you get what you pay for. Just took a while to ship.</li>
            <li> Nice set!! The brushes are soft &amp; no, the brushes don&#x27;t fall off. This brush set looks exactly as shown too. I would buy this again in the future!(:</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than expected...good sturdy brushes. Bristles were soft but firm if that makes sense.Great for travel</li>
            <li> Not great quality but cheap and acceptable.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super handy esp when traveling. The bristles are soft and not the cheap kind. I love that they feel like they are not going to break anytime soon. I love these brushes and overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> These brushes are AMAZING for the price. Super soft and work perfectly for my daily makeup routines. :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice and good quality for the money! Shipping was free and faster than expected.  Overall, very very happy!</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes, great purchase.</li>
            <li> Very soft but kinda small. But, honestly they work just fine and don&#x27;t shred which is a must. Great for price and for no the go.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, a bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> So soft for the skin but it mainly focus on the nose. :/</li>
            <li> love all the brushes no complaints</li>
            <li> Nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;They dont clean very well though.</li>
            <li> it matched the photo it just looked larger but there pretty small, average length but good cheap eye brushes</li>
            <li> They picked up eyeshadow just fine, they are so soft and I love the size of them...</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the quality of these brushes for the price. I bought them with the thought of giving them to my niece for play, but after examining them, I decided to keep them in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Very soft and very well made</li>
            <li> This was suppose to be a 6 piece set but only 5 came their not long term brushes. I&#x27;ve used each one but only 2 out of the 5 actually work pretty good the others I&#x27;ve just been using as blenders. Good for the small amount I paid</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t pick up any product.</li>
            <li> their good for the price... they kind of scratch and hurt a little but like I said their good for the price</li>
            <li> Excellent Brushes!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I rated it 4 stars because the brushes are smaller but other than that they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> These are a decent set of brushes to me. They haven&#x27;t shed and it&#x27;s been around 4 months since I&#x27;ve had them. Admittedly I&#x27;m pretty rough when washing them and they aren&#x27;t stiff or bent oddly after a washing. They are soft too and apply make up really well.</li>
            <li> I have recieved these brushes about a week ago and i am very impressed. Not a single bristle has fell off, they pick up shadows very nicely, and overall are just fantastic! Also, they came in about 3 weks early! Definitely would purchase from here again!</li>
            <li> The shipping was pretty quick but the brush quality isn&#x27;t the greatest. They&#x27;re stiff.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend. I wish it didn&#x27;t take 2 weeks to get it. My friend said she loved them! She told me they work great and she would order it again. I did feel the brushes and they felt very sturdy. I like that they are so compact that you can keep them in your purse or small makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Good price and quality !</li>
            <li> Product perfect, shipping very very slow, plus side free shipping though</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY AND THEY ARE  THE CORRECT SIZE NOT MINITURE</li>
            <li> Great quality I love these brushes</li>
            <li> Very light but shorter than I expected. The brush is soft and applies makeup well. The only complaint is that it takes a while to clean but using a little dishwashing liquid definitely helps.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as soft or fluffy as higher-end brushes, but they pick up a decent amount of pigment and are surprisingly durable so far. They&#x27;re a good size as well, not mini-brushes. They arrived a bit before the estimated shipping time, which is a plus. However, one of my brushes arrived with some of the fibers sticking way out. They wouldn&#x27;t pull out, which is a good sign, but I did have to trim them. Otherwise, I would say these are well worth it if you want to start out using makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I really like these little makeup brushes ppl think they r mac brushes...</li>
            <li> The size of the brushes are very small but the quality of them are excellent.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes. All different sizes.</li>
            <li> This is it! I finally found something worth it. This set looks really nice in actual and I have no complaints about it. Nice one!</li>
            <li> These are bigger than they appear and are excellent quality.  Seriously, not even one hair has fallen out of any of the brushes. They are soft but firm so the eyeshadow goes where you want it to, excellent control. This is such an awesome price too.</li>
            <li> They where broken when they arrived</li>
            <li> I loved it and it came to my house unexpected but made my day.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes &amp; the cost, didn&#x27;t love the time it took to receive them.</li>
            <li> Love these! Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best brushes I have purchased so far from amazon. They are super soft and the brushes don&#x27;t shed. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> shorter handle than i thought but do love.</li>

            <li> love them yes the handle is a little small but they&#x27;re great brushes to me</li>
            <li> When I ordered these I was looking forward to cheap throw away brushes..  however I was pleasantly surprised.  Actually amazed... these brushes are such a great quality that I have ordered more.. I will continue to buy these until they are no longer available... the bristles are so soft. They pick up pigment better than my expensive brushes! I love these!!!!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price, i love the middle one brush...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, its exactly as what it is in the photo.</li>
