            <li>that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is great because the handle is slick so hair won&#x27;t get caught on it, but won&#x27;t slide out of your hands.  </li>

            <li>and it certainly is.  </li>

            <li>I have very wavy hair</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and comfortable in my small hand.</li>
            <li>I have curly/tangled/frizzy hair, and this brush really leaves my hair very soft!</li>
            <li>and this is gentle on my delicate, fine hair which is so important when you use heat.</li>
            <li>The heat seems to intensify the odor.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will diminish over time, but so far, it&#x27;s pretty repulsive.</li>
            <li>I wet it a little bit before using it just so my hair doesn&#x27;t fly up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Feels good in hand and seems to be a nice brush but has these little rubber nubs mixed in among the regular bristles that seem to make it more difficult to use if you have any snarls</li>

            <li>I sure this will last a long time.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a sturdy little brush and really works well on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I used to really have to pull through some big staticy knots in her hair but now hair time is much easier.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair (right below my shoulder blades)</li>
            <li>I have a long hair and gets tangle all the time, this works for me very well!</li>
            <li>It glides through your hair and is soft on the scalp.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s so soft on my curly hair</li>
            <li>This one is 5.5 stars - it definitely works magic on my curly hair into tame submission.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this brush to anyone with long straight hair.</li>
            <li>No other brush has ever done this before.</li>
            <li>Large and constructed as expected for conair.</li>
            <li>When wet, this brushes straight through.</li>
            <li>The bristles might be a little stiff for some folks with a more sensitive head</li>
            <li>Having used another John Frieda hair tool in the past, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and the price was right.</li>

            <li> I desperately needed a new brush because the rubber &amp;#34;pad&amp;#34; in my old one was starting to pop out of the holding area if I ever encountered a tangle or brushed my hair when wet.</li>
            <li> So I decide to get a new one Was just desapointed that they put sticker with the product name on back side that very hard to take off</li>
            <li> My only gripe about this is the bristles bend a little and water gets stuck inside the brush and can grow mold.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get the same look as when you section off hair and use a round brush, but I don&#x27;t always have the time to do my hair</li>
            <li> It works when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> Works well, glides through wet hair without tangling.</li>
            <li> However the packaging got crushed in the box</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t even use my other brushes anymore.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers-</li>
            <li> So its not pretty anymore</li>
            <li> Helps to make my hair dry even faster (which is a feat since I have long thick hair).</li>
            <li> To my surprise- absolutely no static even though it&#x27;s cold and super dry here.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to come down my hair when putting it up.</li>
            <li> John Frieda never lets ANY curly-haired lady down...</li>
            <li> As with all brushes, collects lint over time and the little massage balls on the ends come off.</li>
            <li> The weight of the brush is a little heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not comfortable to use</li>
            <li> The brushes with comfort or soft plastic grips are terrible for long hair because the hair sticks to the soft plastic/grip parts and gets pulled and snapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little bit hard for my liking.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was on its last legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They usually make brushing my hair easier, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Has not lost any bristles and I have hair way past my waist to deal with.</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> It seems decent hair brushes are outrageously expensive but this wasn&#x27;t bad at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even worse if you try to use it while blow-drying your hair.</li>
            <li> Awful.... it feels strange combing through my hair and the bristles melted down easily/</li>
            <li> This brush has weird bristles that seem to grip my hair and rip it out of my head.</li>
            <li> Bad design.</li>
            <li> The brush seems like it is well made, but it smells horrible, like a mix between a bonfire and rubber.</li>

            <li> Great brush at a great price.  Does not tear or cause frizz.  Easy to handle and comfortable in my small hand.</li>
            <li> Some of the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; came bent and the brush had scratches on it. Kinda makes me wonder if my thick hair will destroy it quickly. It serves it&#x27;s purpose, though, so it&#x27;s fine. Probably wouldn&#x27;t order this again.</li>
            <li> Great brush. As with all brushes, collects lint over time and the little massage balls on the ends come off.</li>
            <li> I love using paddle brushing for quickly straight blow drying long hair.  You won&#x27;t get the same look as when you section off hair and use a round brush, but I don&#x27;t always have the time to do my hair that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is great because the handle is slick so hair won&#x27;t get caught on it, but won&#x27;t slide out of your hands.  The brushes with comfort or soft plastic grips are terrible for long hair because the hair sticks to the soft plastic/grip parts and gets pulled and snapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has absolutely no areas that catch or stick to hair making this a great long hair brush.  I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Blow drying my hair it&#x27;s so easy and quick now with this brush.</li>
            <li> I desperately needed a new brush because the rubber &amp;#34;pad&amp;#34; in my old one was starting to pop out of the holding area if I ever encountered a tangle or brushed my hair when wet. Needless to say, it was on its last legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at various options on Amazon and came across this one. Having used another John Frieda hair tool in the past, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and the price was right. It seems decent hair brushes are outrageously expensive but this wasn&#x27;t bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very sleek looking and easy to handle. I have long hair (right below my shoulder blades) that&#x27;s wavy but somewhat fine. I typically straighten my hair though and it worked great. When it arrived I immediately brushed my hair with it which I had straightened. To my surprise- absolutely no static even though it&#x27;s cold and super dry here. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using it for about a week and love it. It works when my hair is wet. The bristles might be a little stiff for some folks with a more sensitive head but I love that it&#x27;s not overly flexible. It&#x27;s great at getting minor tangles out without damaging and keeps hair smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best $7 I&#x27;ve spent in a while! I&#x27;m thinking of buying another one to keep at the office.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat masculine, which was nice. The brush is cushioned and comfortable. Great for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Fits in your hand well, has a hook to hand if you wanted to, bristles don&#x27;t&#x27; hurt scalp, and they seem like they will last. Nice weight and size to work on my fine, yet full head of hair! Much better than what I was finding at Target or Ulta!</li>
            <li> This brush feels really good but it creates static. I wet it a little bit before using it just so my hair doesn&#x27;t fly up. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this hairbrush. It made my hair smoother and it did not have as much static. I have to straighten my hair and this brush made it seem like I didn&#x27;t spend as much time doing this.</li>
            <li> This paddle brush is good for using to dry my hair straight.  The bristles are a little bit hard for my liking.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  My hair is shiny!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this brush; so gentle on tangles especially when hair is wet. Won&#x27;t even use my other brushes anymore. Great for thick hair- highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Large and constructed as expected for conair.</li>
            <li> Awful.... it feels strange combing through my hair and the bristles melted down easily/quickly while blowdrying my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to come down my hair when putting it up. I also use this to blow dry my hair to later flat iron it. My only gripe about this is the bristles bend a little and water gets stuck inside the brush and can grow mold. Yes I use this in the shower occasionally. I had to shake the heck out of this thing and squeeze the air paddle a million times to take the water out. It deranged well and doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Feels good in hand and seems to be a nice brush but has these little rubber nubs mixed in among the regular bristles that seem to make it more difficult to use if you have any snarls</li>
            <li> I wanted something one piece construction but couldn&#x27;t find one that looked strong enough, so I got this two piece construction. And it is STRONG to my surprise. And I know it&#x27;ll take a LOT of abuse and hold strong. Worth buying.</li>
            <li> I love it! Im writting because I like to go by reviews to buy my products. I have a long hair and gets tangle all the time, this works for me very well! Good quality, it arrived fast!</li>
            <li> It really goes through my hair smoothly. It doesn&#x27;t produce frizz and does not pull at my hair or knot up my hair.</li>
            <li> I got this brush as an add on item with my John Frieda iron,  I absolutely love it,  I decided instead of using it on myself I would take it to my salon and use it on clients and get their feedback.  They love the way it feels,  the way it makes the hair look.  I love the lightness of it and the ease of maneuverability when I use it.  Great for all types of hair.  I am getting more for both personal and professional use; ) recommend this highly! !</li>
            <li> First time buying a paddle brush.  I really really like it.  I can blow dry my bob in 3 minutes.  Would buy again.  I sure this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My favorite love it tames my hair and detAngles it</li>
            <li> I love this brush. My 4y/o daughter ALWAYS complains when I comb/brush her hair. She thinks this brush is &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; because it rarely hurts.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed something to get me to free super saving shipping and I have to say it was a good buy.  It&#x27;s a sturdy little brush and really works well on my fine hair.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to pull or tug and it really does smooth everything out.  It&#x27;s a good product that does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much bigger and not as soft as I expected. I used to have a conair brush with a soft handle, and I expected the same from this but it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just not comfortable to use and I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite paddle brush.  My daughter also uses it.  It works great on long hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush.  Light weight.  Easy to grip.  Great for tangled hair.  Does not pull or snag. Very nice price.</li>
            <li> This brush lasts! I&#x27;ve had countless number of brushes break in my daughters tiny curled rough mixed hair. When wet, this brushes straight through.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles bent within a month of use. No other brush has ever done this before. I have medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> This really does help keep the fly aways under control and I am very happy with it so far :)</li>
            <li> I have very wavy hair and this works incredibly well at taming my bangs.</li>
            <li> This brush feels amazing!  Keeps my hair from frizzing and it feels like a head massage when brushing!  I agree with the other reviewers- this is a brush to buy!</li>
            <li> This brush has weird bristles that seem to grip my hair and rip it out of my head. Some of the bristles are flexible and rubbery. I have really long hair, and I love paddle brushes. They usually make brushing my hair easier, but not this one. Bad design. Even my husband with short hair hates this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved john freida products and so i was very pleased to find this brush, its the best ive had so far when it comes to a paddle style and i wouldnt reccommend anything else.</li>
            <li> I love this hairbrush! I brushed my hair for 10 minutes tonight because it felt so good! My hair is happy now.</li>
            <li> Really great brush with good quality.</li>
            <li> Helps to make my hair dry even faster (which is a feat since I have long thick hair). Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> NIce brush. Easy to handle. Keeps my hair smooth without static. Even looks nice on the dresser. Has not lost any bristles and I have hair way past my waist to deal with. I brush my hair more frequently because I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Great brush for long straight hair!!  I love John Frieda brushes, they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that someone could fall in love with a brush... but I did with this one. It is great for detangling and straightening with a blow dryer. It glides through your hair and is soft on the scalp. I have curly hair that I straighten and this is gentle on my delicate, fine hair which is so important when you use heat. Would definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> The brush seems like it is well made, but it smells horrible, like a mix between a bonfire and rubber. There are a few rubbery bristles mixed amongst the metal tines that I assume are responsible for the stink. I bought this intending to keep in my gym bag to use after working out, and it made my entire bag smell as well as the entire vicinity of my locker. It&#x27;s even worse if you try to use it while blow-drying your hair. The heat seems to intensify the odor.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will diminish over time, but so far, it&#x27;s pretty repulsive.</li>
            <li> i bought this brush for my 5 year daughter who has very long hair and hates when I brush it.  I was hoping the brush would be friendlier to her hair then the current brush we have and it certainly is.  My daughter says it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m brushing her hair.  I used to really have to pull through some big staticy knots in her hair but now hair time is much easier.  I recommend this brush to anyone with long straight hair.</li>
            <li> Works well, glides through wet hair without tangling. I would recommend. The brush is light weight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It is really nice and sturdy...I have really long hair and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;I have heard about paddle brushes but never got around to buy one until now....&lt;br /&gt;I think it even massages my head too! It feels nice....</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of brushes before and this one is my absolute favorite!  I have curly/tangled/frizzy hair, and this brush really leaves my hair very soft!</li>
            <li> Received it on yesterday, The brush is really awesome for someone like me having the long thick volume hair.</li>
            <li> I have a growing collection of Frizz Ease brushes.  This one is 5.5 stars - it definitely works magic on my curly hair into tame submission.  Sold on the tourmaline features!</li>
            <li> nice brush for blow drying!</li>
            <li> I had the same style brush but it become a bit old and not pretty look So I decide to get a new one Was just desapointed that they put sticker with the product name on back side that very hard to take off So its not pretty anymore</li>
            <li> John Frieda never lets ANY curly-haired lady down... and this brush is no exception. I love this for detangling my curly 3C hair. It works SUPER fast, faster than my wide tooth combs. The look of the brush is elegant and sophisticated, too! So worth it and the awesome price.</li>
            <li> Nice Big Brush with sporadic soft rubber bristles. Kind of like a head massage. Retractable hook for easy hanging.</li>
            <li> This brush works great, but has a peculiar rubber-like smell. If you have a sensitive nose I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush! Guy with curly &amp; wavey hair I pull it up every morning do work and wear a hat. Wet my temple and ear area for fly away control and Walla presto perfect comfy brush.</li>
            <li> My new favorite brush...</li>
            <li> I bought two brushes, one of which I gave to my cousin. The paddle is big which I love and it untangles my hair perfectly. I like how there are rubber bristles in between. However the packaging got crushed in the box And stratched. The weight of the brush is a little heavy but i am getting used to it.</li>
            <li> Loving  Brushing  My Hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft on my curly hair</li>
