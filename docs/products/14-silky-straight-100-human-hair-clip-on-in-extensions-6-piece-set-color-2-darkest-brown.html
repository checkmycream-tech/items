            <li>I am also glad I took another reviewers advice &amp; bought 2 packs.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I found this product.</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried curling them yet but straightening them they look great and make my hair look much fuller and longer</li>
            <li>Love this product ....</li>

            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>and im going to order more</li>
            <li>all around love it</li>

            <li>&gt; I just love how easily the pieces clip in and stay secure....</li>
            <li>clipped in easily to my hair.</li>
            <li>They also were not knotting easily.</li>
            <li>They are extremely easy to put in.</li>
            <li>Also when just quickly straightening the hair puts off a burned plastic smell!</li>
            <li>The hair was decent quality and the clips were nice.</li>
            <li>Was excited to get them.</li>
            <li>It matches my hair perfect, which I was a little worried about when ordering for hair extensions for the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sending it back and searching again for a more suitable color match</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear them much any more since my hair has grown out a bit.</li>
            <li>Still for around $40 for a full set of hair extensions</li>
            <li>thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Hi, I liked the product, it&#x60;s look like human hair...</li>
            <li>My BF made fun of me because he hates all fakes stuff</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t returned them because they&#x27;re not even worth the time.</li>
            <li>The top by where the clip were sewn in would not even stay straight against my head, so they were very noticeable</li>
            <li>These extensions matched my hair color perfectly but were extremely thin for my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this set because the price was right.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that they do tend to tangle but a comb or a brush solves that problem very easily.</li>
            <li>great value for such a wonderful answer on a bad hair day ...</li>
            <li>they are soft really soft blends nicely.</li>
            <li>I definately recommend this product to anyone who has thin hair like me :) even though it did have some stands of gray in it, it looks really good.</li>
            <li>shipping was very fast....</li>
            <li>First, I was going to go to a shop &amp; pay their rediculous prices.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the quality for the price, however there was just not enough volume to natural blend with my hair (which is shoulder length).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much, much cheaper than Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>im sending them back and not buying any more.</li>
            <li>is the exact color of my hair</li>
            <li>:) Definitely buying from here again.</li>
            <li>so they didn&#x27;t look right while straight.  </li>
            <li>The other girls both have thin hair with lots of layers and these extensions blend beautifully with their own hair.</li>
            <li>Hope that these issues can be fixed for your customers because as of right now I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing from elizawigs again!</li>
            <li>The clip part is good except the clip isn&#x27;t long enough to cover the clip in part</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so cheap that the attachments that held the clips won&#x27;t even bend enough to follow a straight hair line.  </li>
            <li>They stay in very well</li>
            <li>but it really looks like my hair.</li>
            <li>She received them for her birthday and said that although I orderd the color 2 the hair is much lighter.</li>
            <li>They also curl and straighten just like real hair</li>
            <li>I really like the fast service I got with this product..</li>
            <li>1 pack would never do unless you really have no hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>She has really put them through a lot too.</li>
            <li>they match real well with my hair color</li>
            <li>almost everyone thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>They went straight into the trash because they wouldn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>They came fast.</li>
            <li>They were very noticeable when I placed them in my hair.</li>
            <li>very silky.</li>
            <li>The extentions feel so real.</li>
            <li>Even with 2 packs, it just didn&#x27;t equal the volume of my original hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a second set today to help supplement the original set I purchased...</li>
            <li>very silky and high quality hair.</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth trying since they were so cheap, but it was just a waste.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how fast i recieved these.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how fast I received mine.</li>
            <li>Although they are thin they are good for the money.</li>
            <li>I read previous reviews, some said gray hair and how they knot easily.</li>
            <li>The hair itself seemed fine but instead of dark brown</li>
            <li>(they go on sale pretty often), sewed an extra layer onto the hair... which worked out and was still cheaper than buying clip ins from sally</li>
            <li>This product is awesome for people with thin very little hair like me.</li>
            <li>Get complete extensions for&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once they were all clipped in place, the bottoms of the extensions look very scraggly since there just wasn&#x27;t enough hair.</li>
            <li>The top of the clip was too thick to stay clipped into my hair.</li>
            <li>they are not as thick as I thought they would have been, but I love them.</li>
            <li>The extentions are really fine hair quality, I have thick hair and mainly wanted these for length.  </li>
            <li>They did not blend well at all with my higher end extensions previously bought at Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and really I wouldn&#x27;t consider it thick, just average.</li>
            <li>Also the color was significantly lighter than my natural hair (a dark brown), but that&#x27;s nothing a little hair dye won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>Not a whole lot of hair if you have thick hair, buy two for sure.</li>
            <li>they&#x60;re a few but thanks anyway...!</li>
            <li>The color was completely off, and it was super thin.</li>
            <li>You can pay $30 dollars for two packs and then carefully take the clips off the first set and sew/glue them onto the other set or just wear both sets.</li>

            <li> they match real well with my hair color</li>
            <li> almost everyone thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> They went straight into the trash because they wouldn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> They came fast.</li>
            <li> They were very noticeable when I placed them in my hair.</li>
            <li> very silky.</li>
            <li> The extentions feel so real.</li>
            <li> Even with 2 packs, it just didn&#x27;t equal the volume of my original hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a second set today to help supplement the original set I purchased...</li>
            <li> very silky and high quality hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it was worth trying since they were so cheap, but it was just a waste.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how fast i recieved these.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how fast I received mine.</li>
            <li> Although they are thin they are good for the money.</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews, some said gray hair and how they knot easily.</li>
            <li> The hair itself seemed fine but instead of dark brown</li>
            <li> (they go on sale pretty often), sewed an extra layer onto the hair... which worked out and was still cheaper than buying clip ins from sally</li>
            <li> This product is awesome for people with thin very little hair like me.</li>
            <li> Get complete extensions for&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once they were all clipped in place, the bottoms of the extensions look very scraggly since there just wasn&#x27;t enough hair.</li>
            <li> The top of the clip was too thick to stay clipped into my hair.</li>
            <li> they are not as thick as I thought they would have been, but I love them.</li>
            <li> The extentions are really fine hair quality, I have thick hair and mainly wanted these for length.  </li>
            <li> They did not blend well at all with my higher end extensions previously bought at Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine, and really I wouldn&#x27;t consider it thick, just average.</li>
            <li> Also the color was significantly lighter than my natural hair (a dark brown), but that&#x27;s nothing a little hair dye won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot of hair if you have thick hair, buy two for sure.</li>
            <li> they&#x60;re a few but thanks anyway...!</li>
            <li> The color was completely off, and it was super thin.</li>
            <li> You can pay $30 dollars for two packs and then carefully take the clips off the first set and sew/glue them onto the other set or just wear both sets.</li>
            <li> Quality seems okay, very thin and when brushed I&#x27;m finding strands of hair coming out too.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the #2 color that came was too light and reddish for my hair.  </li>
            <li> But since they are human hair I guess that is expected.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found several strands of hair that are thick coarse and clearly synthetic</li>
            <li> I bought these as fillers due to not having enough extensions already.  </li>
            <li> half my clips have come out after only wearing them 3times!</li>
            <li> Easily clips in and blends well with thin hair, I recommend buying 12 pieces if your hair is thick.</li>
            <li> Comes in an envelope so be careful when opening it.</li>
            <li> They were thinner than expected.</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker and a bit harder to hide</li>
            <li> They were not at all what i expected.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 sets of these extensions 1 for me and 2 for other people</li>
            <li> One set should work for people with thin to normal hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this hair for my sister because she actually makes her own hair clips and they look awful.</li>
            <li> got dark brown</li>
            <li> They suck, Tottaly not worth it.</li>
            <li> The hair itself was of average quality.</li>
            <li> I have thick short hair.</li>
            <li> and I received them 3 days before expected!!</li>
            <li> wish they were a slight bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I dyed them black with a 3 dolor hair dye and for one set it was about 3/4 of a bottle.</li>
            <li> but i had to order another pack just so i can fill in some spots i want them to look a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars becuase of the thinness and I have found a few gray hairs in it.</li>
            <li> Do you seriously want to pay 100-300 in other extensions?</li>
            <li> I actually bought 2 sets because they are a bit on the thin side and my hair is thick.</li>
            <li> it also is veryy short and wrong color.</li>
            <li> The hair is thin - not much there.  </li>
            <li> This was a bit creepy for me since it was real human hair</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t dull, or too shiny.</li>
            <li> They are hard to match your hair color online.  </li>
            <li> The color matches my hair( which is usually a hard task.)</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs, my hair is thick</li>
            <li> Because I have shorter thick hair</li>
            <li> so usually I don&#x27;t mind if hair extensions are a little thin, but these were too thin to be usable and were very poor quality.</li>
            <li> It looks terrible right now as I have no style.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that they are so thin.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Way to THIN, gray hairs in them, and the clip came apart from the hair strip</li>
            <li> and I was worried they would be too thin, after a bit of styling they look presentable.</li>
            <li> About a year ago, I got tired of my hair &amp; had it all chopped off.</li>
            <li> I browse on Amazon for my Kindle books &amp; game downloads.</li>
            <li> is thin wish i would of got two packs.</li>
            <li> The ends of these extensions are really thin and stringy, which I wouldnt mind the faded layer to the ends look, however, regardless of how I clipped them in my hair</li>
            <li> I bought them and after realizing they were too thin, went to sally and bought matching hair sew in extensions on sale</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> cause it feels and looks fake.</li>
            <li> There was nothing really wrong with these clip in</li>
            <li> cause it was the wrong color I ordered.</li>
            <li> i thought they would look bad</li>
            <li> im sooo regretful noww :(</li>
            <li> These extension were especially thin towards the ends.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are the best ones I have ever brought. They match perfectly. They stay in very well they have never fell out</li>
            <li> i love these they are almost perfect for my fine hair but i had to order another pack just so i can fill in some spots i want them to look a little thicker. they are soft really soft blends nicely. i thought they would look bad but it really looks like my hair. wish they were a slight bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair for my sister because she actually makes her own hair clips and they look awful.She received them for her birthday and said that although I orderd the color 2 the hair is much lighter.But she was very happy with the quality and the length.All in all she is happy with the hair and I&#x27;m happy shes not wearing those tacky extensions she makes herself!!</li>
            <li> The hair was decent quality and the clips were nice. Unfortunately the #2 color that came was too light and reddish for my hair.  The customer service was great though!  I sent back the extensions with a hair sample and they tried to match my color but could not find a set that matched so they happily refunded me.</li>
            <li> clipped in easily to my hair. got dark brown and it was a perfect color match. very silky and high quality hair. good price as well</li>
            <li> This product is awesome for people with thin very little hair like me. The extensions are soft and look and feel awesome. Fats shipping got here a couple of days earlier. I would recommend this to everyone if u have more abundant thicker hair order 2 sets! :)</li>
            <li> HORRRIBBLE has gray hair and does not match hair. it also is veryy short and wrong color. trust me dnt buy it, does not work and im sooo regretful noww :( and they also dnt give you ALL your money back when yoou send backk!!!!</li>
            <li> Way to THIN, gray hairs in them, and the clip came apart from the hair strip.. I do not recommend these. They suck, Tottaly not worth it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my extensions! They&#x27;re so easy to put in and they matched perfectly to my hair! I love them!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs, my hair is thick so i would need it I absolutly love thiss brandd(: I cant wait for it too come</li>
            <li> Easily clips in and blends well with thin hair, I recommend buying 12 pieces if your hair is thick. Good price compared to the $80-$100 ones. Comes in an envelope so be careful when opening it.</li>
            <li> I purchased one set of these before reading reviews. I have very thick hair and I was worried they would be too thin, after a bit of styling they look presentable. I dyed them black with a 3 dolor hair dye and for one set it was about 3/4 of a bottle. It came out beautifully. They aren&#x27;t dull, or too shiny. Although they are thin they are good for the money. Do you seriously want to pay 100-300 in other extensions? You can pay $30 dollars for two packs and then carefully take the clips off the first set and sew/glue them onto the other set or just wear both sets. Also with \\&quot;the gray hair\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t see any at all! But since they are human hair I guess that is expected. Just pluck them out or dye them. It&#x27;s simple. Get complete extensions for&lt;br /&gt;$30 + $3 (dye) + your time. So like 35 dollars? That&#x27;s a good deal when the next best are $80</li>
            <li> These are excellent and very affordable extensions. I read previous reviews, some said gray hair and how they knot easily. Mine were perfect, no color except the brown I ordered. They also were not knotting easily. I wore them all day yesterday and fell in LOVE. They also curl and straighten just like real hair and I received them 3 days before expected!!</li>
            <li> Hi, I liked the product, it&#x60;s look like human hair...I did hope more hairs they&#x60;re a few but thanks anyway...!</li>
            <li> Just buy two sets and your hair no matter the length because mine is short it looks and feels great</li>
            <li> I and my hair dresser were very impressed with the pieces it colored up perfect and they filled in nicely.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this</li>
            <li> The extentions are really fine hair quality, I have thick hair and mainly wanted these for length.  I would have probably needed to buy like two more sets for it too even look nice.  In some of the strands there were also some white hairs.  I wouldn&#x27;t order this brand again.</li>
            <li> The hair is thin - not much there.  Nothing like what I thought.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money - I would not purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I really like the fast service I got with this product..It matches my hair perfect, which I was a little worried about when ordering for hair extensions for the first time. Looks great straight or curled and for the price, I don&#x27;t think I could of gotten a better deal. I am happy with my purchase. :)</li>
            <li> About a year ago, I got tired of my hair &amp; had it all chopped off. It was great for a while but 6 months later, I wanted my hair back so I&#x27;ve been growing it out. It looks terrible right now as I have no style. As a fashionista, I HAD to come up with a solution. What to do... hair expensions! First, I was going to go to a shop &amp; pay their rediculous prices. I browse on Amazon for my Kindle books &amp; game downloads. I just so happened to come across some hair! I bought this set because the price was right. I&#x27;ve never done extensions on myself before but I watched enough YouTube videos that I felt like an ol&#x27; pro.They are extremely easy to put in. I am also glad I took another reviewers advice &amp; bought 2 packs. 1 pack would never do unless you really have no hair. Even with 2 packs, it just didn&#x27;t equal the volume of my original hair. It still looked great! My BF made fun of me because he hates all fakes stuff but what does he know??!! I wear it to church, to work &amp; to parties &amp; get tons of compliments on my &amp;#34;new hair&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t wear them much any more since my hair has grown out a bit. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> She has really put them through a lot too. She puts the heat on them she has dyed them and they still look good. She loves them. It was a great mom purchase!</li>
            <li> THESE CLIPS ARE AWESOME! they match real well with my hair color (PERFECTLY IF I MAY ADD) and almost everyone thought it was my real hair. I definately recommend this product to anyone who has thin hair like me :) even though it did have some stands of gray in it, it looks really good. (I didnt give it a 5 star because it doesn&#x27;t straighten as i would like it to, but i still love them!)</li>
            <li> Did not feel like human hair as it was described.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I found this product. Nicely done! All 6 pieces are silky and great cut. Buy it!!!! For sure!!!!</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever! Was excited to get them. Quality seems okay, very thin and when brushed I&#x27;m finding strands of hair coming out too. I&#x27;ve ordered the same product from another distributor cause 6 pieces just isn&#x27;t enough for thicker hair (it doesn&#x27;t blend well with only 6 pieces). The clip part is good except the clip isn&#x27;t long enough to cover the clip in part therefore I&#x27;ve been having issues with the clip in part flipping up and showing through my hair! Also its supposed to be 100% real human hair but I&#x27;ve found several strands of hair that are thick coarse and clearly synthetic cause it feels and looks fake. Also when just quickly straightening the hair puts off a burned plastic smell! Hope that these issues can be fixed for your customers because as of right now I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing from elizawigs again!</li>
            <li> The color was completely off, and it was super thin. Will never order from this place again.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and decided to give these a shot for around $20. I received them 2 weeks after I placed the order. I was very pleased with the quality for the price, however there was just not enough volume to natural blend with my hair (which is shoulder length). Once they were all clipped in place, the bottoms of the extensions look very scraggly since there just wasn&#x27;t enough hair. Also the color was significantly lighter than my natural hair (a dark brown), but that&#x27;s nothing a little hair dye won&#x27;t fix. I&#x27;ve ordered a second set today to help supplement the original set I purchased... Still for around $40 for a full set of hair extensions it&#x27;s much, much cheaper than Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter, she loves them, they are easy to work with &amp; she can do it herself!  thank you</li>
            <li> shipping was very fast.... got the happy and was very happy hair is thin wish i would of got two packs. but oh well. the hair do curl so thats a plus!!color match well with my hair. will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how fast i recieved these. ordered the end of last week recieved following monday. I have thick short hair. They were thinner than expected. Because I have shorter thick hair the end look strangly. I think if I bought more or they were thicker it would look better. But these will do for now. Thankyou.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews before buying these. I had short hair (almost shoulder length).  My hair is fine, and really I wouldn&#x27;t consider it thick, just average. The ends of these extensions are really thin and stringy, which I wouldnt mind the faded layer to the ends look, however, regardless of how I clipped them in my hair you could still see where my hair ended and the extensions began. My hair stuck through the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOOO... I bought them and after realizing they were too thin, went to sally and bought matching hair sew in extensions on sale (they go on sale pretty often), sewed an extra layer onto the hair... which worked out and was still cheaper than buying clip ins from sally</li>
            <li> Hair is so thin and looks cheap</li>
            <li> I said these were o.k. because there was a lot of hair in the clips but also lots of gray hairs, and even one blue hair.  im sending them back and not buying any more.</li>
            <li> The hair itself seemed fine but instead of dark brown the hair was quite reddish. I&#x27;m sending it back and searching again for a more suitable color match</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t match my hair texture</li>
            <li> These extension were especially thin towards the ends.  They&#x27;re so cheap that the attachments that held the clips won&#x27;t even bend enough to follow a straight hair line.  They are shaped into a U that won&#x27;t properly straighten out.  I bought these as fillers due to not having enough extensions already.  They did not blend well at all with my higher end extensions previously bought at Sally&#x27;s.  I also tried to dye them with hair dye, but they didn&#x27;t change any color.  I haven&#x27;t returned them because they&#x27;re not even worth the time.</li>
            <li> There was nothing really wrong with these clip in but I had to send them back cause it was the wrong color I ordered. It was nice when I opened the package and a good texture. It took a while for it to ship back when I returned it but the seller sent me an email saying that I would soon get a credit when it did get to them which I liked</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product for the price. I haven&#x27;t tried curling them yet but straightening them they look great and make my hair look much fuller and longer</li>
            <li> This hair is double wefted, which means it&#x27;s like two pieces are sewn together. The top of the clip was too thick to stay clipped into my hair. I never got to use these extensions. They went straight into the trash because they wouldn&#x27;t stay. The hair itself was of average quality.</li>
            <li> The hair is very good quality, it was way to red though..i dyed it \\&quot;darkest brown\\&quot; and the hair handled the dye very well and impressed with how well it straightens..ALTHOUGH..half my clips have come out after only wearing them 3times!</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 sets of these extensions 1 for me and 2 for other people and I love them! The other girls both have thin hair with lots of layers and these extensions blend beautifully with their own hair. My hair is thicker and a bit harder to hide so I should have bought the 8 piece rather than the 6 but the hair is beautiful otherwise.</li>
            <li> This was a bit creepy for me since it was real human hair but my daughter loved and thats all that matters so four stars it gets...</li>
            <li> thank you very much! they are not as thick as I thought they would have been, but I love them.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how fast I received mine. The quality of hair is great! I would recommended this to everyone...</li>
            <li> Love this product ....this hair looks and feels like my own ~&lt;br /&gt; I just love how easily the pieces clip in and stay secure....great value for such a wonderful answer on a bad hair day ... woohoo!</li>
            <li> These were silky and shiny.  They went in my hair good with the clips.  They came fast. The only bad thing is that they are so thin.  I have very thick hair so they didn&#x27;t look right while straight.  When I curled them they were better because it blended with my hair better.  They are hard to match your hair color online.  They are good quality though</li>
            <li> They were not at all what i expected. Very cheaply made. The top by where the clip were sewn in would not even stay straight against my head, so they were very noticeable no matter how i put them. I sent them back</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot of hair if you have thick hair, buy two for sure. Over all good quality hair!</li>
            <li> These extensions matched my hair color perfectly but were extremely thin for my hair. They were very noticeable when I placed them in my hair. To fix this problem, I cut out the clips and doubled up the extensions to make them thicker. I then sewed them together and reattached the clips. Now they look great! The price is great on these but you&#x27;ll probably need several sets. And for the additional work required, I would recommend buying the hair and making a custom set of extensions yourself.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair so usually I don&#x27;t mind if hair extensions are a little thin, but these were too thin to be usable and were very poor quality. I thought it was worth trying since they were so cheap, but it was just a waste.</li>
            <li> is the exact color of my hair i love it. very silky. no complaints at all and im going to order more</li>
            <li> I actually bought 2 sets because they are a bit on the thin side and my hair is thick. One set should work for people with thin to normal hair.  They curl, wave, and straighten great. I gave 4 stars becuase of the thinness and I have found a few gray hairs in it. It also does&#x27;nt shed a lot. But for the price, it is great!!! :) Definitely buying from here again.</li>
            <li> The extentions feel so real. The color matches my hair( which is usually a hard task.) Only problem is that they do tend to tangle but a comb or a brush solves that problem very easily. all around love it</li>
