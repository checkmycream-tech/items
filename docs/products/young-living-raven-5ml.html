            <li> I did not have a good experience. It came timely. But the inside the top of the bottle was flattened. Not representative of Young Living bottles. I pulled it off easily and there was half a bottle only.&lt;br /&gt;Money was refunded. Buyer beware!</li>

            <li> This is a must for respitory colds.  It has helped mine the past week.  I just open the bottle and keep it on my desk @ work.  I can smell it the whole time and it opens up my sinus&#x27;.  Also mixed it w/ unscented lotion and rubbed on my chest and neck.</li>
