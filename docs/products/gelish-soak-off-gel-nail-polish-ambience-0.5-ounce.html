            <li>I love this color but it doesn&#x27;t look like the swatch shown at all.  </li>
            <li>I love Gelish products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a manicurist but find it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Would be great for a wedding day,or somebody who needs to have simple nail color for work.</li>
            <li>Looks great with french manicure.</li>
            <li>This color is great for the nail bed when do a french set.  </li>
            <li>Looks like you accidentally got glitter on your clean nails.</li>
            <li>Gelish products are definitely the best when it comes to lasting the longest.</li>
            <li>I love to have a little bit of shimmer on my french manicures and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for simple, everyday elegant look.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty color and shimmers in the light.</li>
            <li>This is a nice sheer shimmery polish.</li>
            <li>However, you can see right through 2 coats of this polish.</li>
            <li>Great light pink color, I use it under french manicure at times.</li>
            <li>It works okay over french tip, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>It is really pretty.</li>
            <li>i have not been able to go back to the salon for fear of infection.</li>
            <li>I really like this color!</li>
            <li>I actually like to use Glamour Queen better since it&#x27;s opaque color covers nail imperfections.</li>
            <li>It has a hint of pink, a hint of sparkle, and looks great with Snow Bunny tips (creamy white).  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product at a local beauty supply store, thinking it would be a nice light sparkly pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shimmer pale pink that&#x27;s great to use for french manicures.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too dark and it looks great over the sleek white.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty light pink color with metallic flecks.</li>
            <li>It stays on very well for me</li>
            <li>very disapointing product</li>
            <li>The picture shown looks more like another color called \\&quot;Pink Smoothie\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Might be nice as a top layer over other colors to give a little sparkle and shine, but does nothing by itself.</li>
            <li>This pink is so light it is transparent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a very glittered clear.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a nice sparkly pink, this is not the color for you - it is pretty much clear with some pink sparkles.</li>
            <li>The Gelish system really is terrific, but this particular polish is really a translucent glaze with flecks of glitter.</li>
            <li>I have many other colors which last around two weeks that I purchased directly from manufacture.</li>
            <li>The small amount of glitter looks nice on the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; part of a French Manicure.</li>
            <li>It is a sheer pink with sparkles and is best used for french manicures or a flat color to give it a little bit of a shimmer.  </li>
            <li>I was searching for a nice base color for French manicures, and I&#x27;m glad I went with Gelish Ambiance!  </li>
            <li>You can nearly read through it.</li>
            <li>I would give it 2-3 stars as a stand-alone color, but since it is very pretty over other pinks and purples, I am giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Soft and transparent color with pinkish shade and sparkle accent.</li>
            <li>It must have been old or something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to keep a manicure for at least 3 weeks....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very subtle, but I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not a sparkle lover when it comes to nail polish, but the sparkles in Ambiance are small enough that it just gives it more of a shine than full-on bling that you&#x27;d get from June Bride, etc.</li>
            <li>I used two coats of Ambiance which provided just the right amount of pink.  </li>
            <li>so sorry i bought the whole thing including the light</li>
            <li>What I found out is that this is a VERY sheer color, almost no pink to it except the sparkles.</li>

            <li> The color is a nude/barely pink with a touch of glitter.  </li>

            <li> with a bit of sparkle.  had to order this separate due to colors included in kit were not my type....</li>
            <li> It wears on average of 2-2 1/2 weeks.</li>

            <li> It has a nice soft base pink color with very subtle sparkles in the pink color base.  </li>
            <li> i was not impressed with this product, it isn&#x27;t near as thick as the stuff used by the nail salon</li>

            <li> This pink is so light it is transparent. You can nearly read through it. It has a little bit of sparkle and to me is too young and babyish. Might be nice as a top layer over other colors to give a little sparkle and shine, but does nothing by itself. Looks like you accidentally got glitter on your clean nails.</li>
            <li> Lovely color, pictures are deceptive as to the how the color appears on the nail. Bottle shows a darker pink. It is a sheer pink with pearl flecks. It is a basic and conservative. Would be great for a wedding day,or somebody who needs to have simple nail color for work.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is perfect for french manicures!  It has a nice soft base pink color with very subtle sparkles in the pink color base.  It wears on average of 2-2 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Very pretty light pink color with metallic flecks. However, you can see right through 2 coats of this polish. Didn&#x27;t like that.</li>

            <li> I love the Harmony Gelish line.  It stays on very well for me &amp; I do it myself.  I&#x27;m not a manicurist but find it easy to use.  The Ambience color is a very subtle, natural color with only a very small amount of sparkle so subtlety is what you want, this is a great color.</li>
            <li> It is really pretty. It is definitely sheer with a lot of sparkles. It is very subtle, but pretty. I wear it when I want something neutral.</li>
            <li> Love the color of this gel....lots of sparkles but still remain neutral. I would definitely recommend it to family and friends.</li>

            <li> I love the feel of the polish, but I hate the color. It&#x27;s basically a very glittered clear. Will buy more Gelish, but not this color again.</li>
            <li> i was not impressed with this product, it isn&#x27;t near as thick as the stuff used by the nail salon so my nails broke when the product starting chipping. i had been going to the nail salon and the polish lasted for 3 weeks. this one didn&#x27;t last even one before the edges started to fry which is when i started picking at it and then it ruined my nailbed. i have not been able to go back to the salon for fear of infection. very disapointing product so sorry i bought the whole thing including the light cause i&#x27;m out 90 bucks</li>
            <li> ....with a bit of sparkle.  had to order this separate due to colors included in kit were not my type....this one is good</li>
            <li> I love gellish products but I thought this would be pinker. It is actually clear with a touch if faint glitter.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Thankfully I like see-through polish. This color has the barest pink blush with lots of very small sparkles. Looks great with french manicure. If you want heavy color saturation, don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> Soft and transparent color with pinkish shade and sparkle accent. The sparkling particles are really small. Perfect for simple, everyday elegant look.</li>
            <li> I love this color but it doesn&#x27;t look like the swatch shown at all.  It is a sheer pink with sparkles and is best used for french manicures or a flat color to give it a little bit of a shimmer.

            <li> This polished peeled off in a day to days of application. I have many other colors which last around two weeks that I purchased directly from manufacture. It must have been old or something.</li>
            <li> I really like this color! It&#x27;s a nice shimmer pale pink that&#x27;s great to use for french manicures. I&#x27;ve also used it as a topper to creamy pinks for a shimmery effect.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sheer shimmery polish. I actually like to use Glamour Queen better since it&#x27;s opaque color covers nail imperfections. But what&#x27;s really nice is using 1 coat of each, topping Glamour Queen with Ambience getting the best of both worlds. Opaque natural color with a little shimmer.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish products.  This color is great for the nail bed when do a french set.  I&#x27;ve been able to keep a manicure for at least 3 weeks....outgrowth gets bad, but it never chips.  I really like the strength that gel polish gives to my naturally weak nails.  I would recommend this product again and again!</li>
            <li> Great light pink color, I use it under french manicure at times. It is a pretty color and shimmers in the light.</li>
            <li> A natural see through look with a hint of sparkle, perfect! Just enough to say you made an effort without making a dramatic statement.</li>
