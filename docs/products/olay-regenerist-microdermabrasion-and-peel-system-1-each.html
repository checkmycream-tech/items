            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Meaningful</li>
            <li>Will keep trying to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li>Three things needed in order to have beautiful, clear and glowing skin:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and so cost effective compared to getting a facial!</li>
            <li>I like to use it once or twice a week and have obtained great results so far.</li>
            <li>The Microdermabrasion is a bright orange color, and you can feel the fine crystals in them when rubbing your face in a gentle circular motion.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fantastic when I add this to my routine.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face smooth</li>
            <li>per week use prevents clogged pours and keeps your face baby smooth.</li>
            <li>Because this particular product works best for me, and I have been using Olay for several years</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, nothing is quite this same consistency and it does an amazing job on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels super smooth after using this.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, more vibrant, and balanced.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer of Olay Beauty Products.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time today and noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft, glowing, clean and my skin looked healthy.</li>
            <li>Definitely part of my routine now and will continue to love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and it always leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as describe on the box.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and delivered as promised.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with and gentle enough for my skin.</li>
            <li>You continue to use gentle circular motions on your face for about a minute.</li>
            <li>I have nice skin, just a bit of uneven skintone.</li>
            <li>still think it&#x27;s a decent product-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It was very leathery while it healed, then flaked off (I had to use a lot of moisturizer and not let people get too near).  </li>
            <li>The first two uses (7 days apart) left my skin feeling very soft and smooth, but no visible difference.&lt;br /&gt;The third use (7 days later) tore up my skin and it took a week to recover.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to smooth the skin by taking away the dead skin cells, even out the skin from blemishes/post acne, and/or just to pamper the face.</li>
            <li>was about as smooth as the previous 2 applications.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One of the few products of this type--super fine crystals--in this price range.</li>
            <li>I struggle with acne and I&#x27;m 35, so I use this to keep my skin looking young and staying unplugged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 65 and always get compliments on my skin that I don&#x27;t look that old...</li>
            <li>The way you know whether or not something really works it to go without it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for this product in my local CVS stores and it has vanished.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to all sensitive skin types</li>
            <li>The warmth was alarming at first, but once I used this product a couple of times I found that this was normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find from personal experience that this line of product works very well, especially with continued use!</li>
            <li>My skin broke out a little in the first week but after three weeks my skin is the clearest it&#x27;s been in a while.  </li>
            <li>It helps clear my complexion and minimize minor irregularities.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one drawback is being bad for the environment, which I think about every time I use it but can&#x27;t find anything near as effective.</li>

            <li> Great for the complexion</li>
            <li> Works  great. Good service</li>
            <li> The first two uses (7 days apart) left my skin feeling very soft and smooth, but no visible difference.&lt;br /&gt;The third use (7 days later) tore up my skin and it took a week to recover.  It was very leathery while it healed, then flaked off (I had to use a lot of moisturizer and not let people get too near).  Granted when all was said and done it was about as smooth as the previous 2 applications.&lt;br /&gt;I partly blame myself for being a little over-zealous in the scrub portion and taking too long on the activator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think it&#x27;s a decent product- just don&#x27;t get distracted and rub too hard/long or leave the activator on too long.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I look 10 years younger with each use.  Mustn&#x27;t use more than 2X week, or skin flakes and dries.  One of the few products of this type--super fine crystals--in this price range.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, more vibrant, and balanced. Awesome stuff! Definitely part of my routine now and will continue to love it</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I was having trouble with acne and uneven skin tone, but this kit cleared it away almost immediately. I like to use it once or twice a week and have obtained great results so far. My skin looks fantastic when I add this to my routine. The scrub is lovely and smells faintly of orange, which is pleasing. The peel does foam and does become very warm on my face. The warmth was alarming at first, but once I used this product a couple of times I found that this was normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints would have to be with the packaging. I don&#x27;t like having to reach my hand into a jar for the scrub--I would prefer a pump or bottle.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face smooth</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and seems effective in smoothing the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, nothing is quite this same consistency and it does an amazing job on my skin. I struggle with acne and I&#x27;m 35, so I use this to keep my skin looking young and staying unplugged. It&#x27;s one drawback is being bad for the environment, which I think about every time I use it but can&#x27;t find anything near as effective. Still looking...using this for now. But I really do think it does the best job.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve used it for years and it always leaves my skin soft and smooth. I&#x27;m 65 and always get compliments on my skin that I don&#x27;t look that old...supposedly, I look ten years younger....always nice to hear, but I think using this product has something to do with it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out a little in the first week but after three weeks my skin is the clearest it&#x27;s been in a while.  My skin feels super smooth after using this. It&#x27;s great and so cost effective compared to getting a facial!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. 2 x per week use prevents clogged pours and keeps your face baby smooth.</li>
            <li> The way you know whether or not something really works it to go without it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for this product in my local CVS stores and it has vanished. My skin looks horrible. My face looks like a chocolate chip cookie. Three things needed in order to have beautiful, clear and glowing skin:&lt;br /&gt;1. ProActiv&lt;br /&gt;2. Meaningful Beauty&lt;br /&gt;3. Oil of Olay Microdermabrasion Kit&lt;br /&gt;Guaranteed!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is a great product for my skin type.  Would recommend it to all sensitive skin types</li>
            <li> I tried the Murad System and it did nothing for me. I have nice skin, just a bit of uneven skintone. I used this product for the first time today and noticed a HUGE difference. My skin was soft, glowing, clean and my skin looked healthy.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with and gentle enough for my skin. It helps clear my complexion and minimize minor irregularities.  My skin glows after use.  It&#x27;s easy and smells nice.  Even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey, it&#x27;s less than other products I&#x27;ve checked out and it works!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I really like this product. Did not get the&amp;#34; white foaming&amp;#34; when I applied step 2. Will keep trying to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer of Olay Beauty Products. I find from personal experience that this line of product works very well, especially with continued use! I bought this particular product from Olay because I wanted to rejuvenate, even out the surface of my skin from past acne, blemishes and blotchy areas on my face without having to use harsh chemicals, Or visiting the doctor. This product is exactly as describe on the box. It is very light weight (on the face) and smells very good! The Microdermabrasion is a bright orange color, and you can feel the fine crystals in them when rubbing your face in a gentle circular motion. After adding the Microdermabrasion, you add the Peel treatment. The treatment foams just a little, giving a tingly sensation to your face. You continue to use gentle circular motions on your face for about a minute. It is my personal preference to leave the treatment on my face for a few minutes, then rise it off. As mentioned before, with continued use of any beauty product anyone can gain the benefits they are looking for. Because this particular product works best for me, and I have been using Olay for several years I have not had no damaging affects at all, from any of the Olay products. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to smooth the skin by taking away the dead skin cells, even out the skin from blemishes/post acne, and/or just to pamper the face.</li>
            <li> Does it take away wrinkles? I don&#x27;t know, but it takes away fine lines and makes my skin feel awesome, worth more than what you pay for it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Good product and came on time.</li>
