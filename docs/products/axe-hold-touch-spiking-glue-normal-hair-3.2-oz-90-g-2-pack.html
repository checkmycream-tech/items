            <li>Washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>- the product works great especially if you like the more relaxed, but in control of your hair look.</li>
            <li>Hair has normal feel, smells good.</li>
            <li>They all seem to be pretty good so far</li>

            <li>thanks YOu</li>
            <li>Not only that, but you, or that special someone, can run their fingers through your hair and not experience &amp;#34;sticky/greasy hands/fingers&amp;#34; as is with most other hair products of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my favorites hair products that I was lucky enough to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I feel Set wet gel is far better then this.</li>
            <li>When the movie was released, Axe was giving away samples of this particular Touch Spiking Glue for Normal Hair...at the movie theatre.  </li>

            <li>In fact, I have received a few compliments on the light scent from this hair product.</li>
            <li>Unique product for fine hair but difficult to find.</li>
            <li>Over the last couple years, I found it more and more difficult to find this product!</li>
            <li>amazon make it easy for us overseas to get items that are hard to get over here.  </li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t offered where I live anymore, making online my only hope.</li>
            <li>A little dab of this stuff after I have dried my hair, and voila, style stays put the whole day and the women don&#x27;t mind it too much.</li>

            <li> It holds like glue but doesn&#x27;t stay sticky for long.  </li>
            <li> It is, however, very glue like an thus hard to apply to completely dry hair.</li>
            <li> You can put it on wet or dry hair for different looks.</li>
            <li> used sparingly on wet hair then blow dry.</li>
            <li> : I usually keep my hair quite short (think military&amp;#34;ish&amp;#34; style hair cut).</li>
            <li> You can make it as stiff or less stiffness as you want.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend if you want that slightly or heavily spiked look.</li>
            <li> Too bad you can only get it online these days.</li>
            <li> I just ordered 8 of these since they&#x27;re being discontinued and my girlfriend thinks i&#x27;ve gone a little crazy..</li>

            <li> Axe is making some pretty good products, I reccomend the products I use. They all seem to be pretty good so far</li>
            <li> Curly hair in humid climate.  Best gel/glue, etc... I&#x27;ve used. Not stiff, hair looks natural without frizz. Hair has normal feel, smells good.</li>
            <li> bought this cause amazon make it easy for us overseas to get items that are hard to get over here.  this is the stuff my husband uses and been looking for it.  he loves it</li>
            <li> Works great for me. Smells nice and holds well.  You can put it on wet or dry hair for different looks. Washes out easy.</li>
            <li> The product is very good and hold my hair in place the way i want it.... a strong long lasting hold.</li>
            <li> Great product for short hair, women&#x27;s short hair.  It is not greasy or guey.  You can make it as stiff or less stiffness as you want.  Washes out easily.  Love, love , love it.  Would recommend if you want that slightly or heavily spiked look.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.  Too bad you can only get it online these days.</li>
            <li> I used this product while traveling through Kuwait on to my deployment location and it held up from the tents, during the C130 flight, and even on the ground. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> love this stuff - it took me a long time to find a product that i actually like (i used to have tons of different gels/sprays/pomade/etc) but this one is the best. I just ordered 8 of these since they&#x27;re being discontinued and my girlfriend thinks i&#x27;ve gone a little crazy..</li>
            <li> When the movie was released, Axe was giving away samples of this particular Touch Spiking Glue for Normal Hair...at the movie theatre.  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in the stores, so good ol&#x27; reliable Amazon came through for me - yet once again.  I don&#x27;t know why I even both going to any retail store any more.  OBTW - the product works great especially if you like the more relaxed, but in control of your hair look.</li>
            <li> This is my hair product of choice.  It holds like glue but doesn&#x27;t stay sticky for long.  I won&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> Provides hold without stiffness or greasiness.</li>
            <li> Great strong hold   Way over priced , the price jumped 3x what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> son loves this product.  great price. repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> Shipment came fast! great product! would recommend buying this!</li>
            <li> great product and price.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites hair products that I was lucky enough to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this specific product over the years at local stores such as Walgreens, Walmart, etc. Over the last couple years, I found it more and more difficult to find this product! Thankfully, we have places such as Amazon where we can get a hold of product(s) no longer offered in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nitty Gritty: I usually keep my hair quite short (think military&amp;#34;ish&amp;#34; style hair cut). A little dab of this stuff after I have dried my hair, and voila, style stays put the whole day and the women don&#x27;t mind it too much. In fact, I have received a few compliments on the light scent from this hair product. Not only that, but you, or that special someone, can run their fingers through your hair and not experience &amp;#34;sticky/greasy hands/fingers&amp;#34; as is with most other hair products of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I hope Axe never truly does away with this hair product as I don&#x27;t like having to sample hair products to find the next one that works with my hair.</li>
            <li> I only use this gel, it is the best for me.  BUt hey, you may have different results.  thanks YOu</li>
            <li> Like always, Axe spiking glue works great. It is, however, very glue like an thus hard to apply to completely dry hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Been using for approx 6 mo. now &amp; could not be more impressed with this hair product! Good Luck with your purchase :)</li>
            <li> Very good for VOLUME  used sparingly on wet hair then blow dry. Unique product for fine hair but difficult to find. Amazon has it!</li>
            <li> It stays on hair like a glue and it is sticky... I feel Set wet gel is far better then this.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t offered where I live anymore, making online my only hope. That, combined with saving a few bucks in the process, was too good a deal to avoid. Nothing works the way Axe glue works.</li>
