    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I even used it for my knuckle hair- works great!</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Just use a oil-free moisturizer after and you are good to go!</li>
            <li>It works great, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go--</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>For a good 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>but I would wonder how good it is for your skin  </li>
            <li>I would say it works best on light colored hair, may not be as effective on darker growth.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the service too.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these things!</li>
            <li>The Hair Off Face Buffer arrived fast and was packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li>This product does not remove hair effectively.</li>
            <li>how cheap it is, its a good deal.</li>
            <li>First, the buffer top is easy to hold and shaped perfectly for ease of use.</li>
            <li>I found this product easy and effective with no burn of the skin.</li>
            <li>I Love this product.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to get rid of/minimize the lovely &#x27;blonde-beard&#x27; that I just noticed on my 30th b-day.  </li>
            <li>Overall I was very happy with the product, price and results.</li>
            <li>like I said, I have stubborn hair, but it&#x27;s almost smooth!).     </li>
            <li>Just use a bit of OTC hydrocortisone cream (no longer than 2 days!), and you&#x27;ll feel better.</li>
            <li>There must be some magical formula to make it work??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>This product works well to remove most hair.</li>
            <li>The buffer is ok to use when you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found the product listed&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more do I need to say?  </li>
            <li>So I was hoping this would work to help me cope better with that.</li>
            <li>The more you rub over and over the more irritated your skin gets.</li>
            <li>I also love that it leaves my skin feeling so smooth.  </li>
            <li>but i wonder if a better one is available</li>
            <li>THis is a great product because it is not time sensitive and it is not a chemical.  </li>
            <li>Fast service - good product.  </li>
            <li>By the end of a week, you should have most of the hair &#x27;sheared&#x27; off and the good news is that, unlike shaving, regrowth has a tapered, fine end and won&#x27;t feel &#x27;thicker&#x27; (like after shaving as a razor cuts the hairs with a beveled edge, making them feel courser); just re-treat the area about once a week, gently, and you&#x27;ll remain smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li>The strips are like very mild sandpaper.</li>
            <li>And honestly when you get the product and look at it my first though was &#x27;how does this thing remove hair at all&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t look like it would at all.</li>
            <li>When I look in the mirror the skin seems fine</li>
            <li>and I am hair free.</li>
            <li>A couple &amp;#34;zit&amp;#34; like bumps too.&lt;br /&gt;But, now that the irritation is over, its smooth and quite</li>
            <li>This product is great for somebody with blonde or very fine hair that isn&#x27;t laser sensitive and/or is too dense for electrolysis.</li>
            <li>The Hair Off Face Buffer was a good price, and I figured I would give it a try knowing it was low cost.</li>
            <li>Use right after shower or put warm wash cloth over area first so area is softened and prepped first.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to do this after a shower, and to not expect to get ALL the hair on the first go!</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD AND LASTS AT LEAST 5 DAYS</li>
            <li>Every time I used it, I developed redness and stinging and most of my hair did not even come off.</li>
            <li>Like many women I have a light coat of hair above my lip that is never noticed by anyone but myself.</li>
            <li>The drawbacks are the itchiness and irritation for 3 days, but its worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>I used it right away.</li>
            <li>So yes, I am happy as a clam with my little buffer!</li>
            <li>sure is cheaper than buying the whole new kit for like $8.</li>
            <li>I find it best to pull the skin taut or tight, blow air in cheeks like a balloon or tilt  head back to stretch the neck skin.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and tried this product after a nice long hot shower.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a clean dry face first, then buff.</li>
            <li>I have read many good reviews about this product but to be honest, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li>It does make the skin tingle, especially after the very first use, but consequent uses it&#x27;s very mild.  </li>
            <li>Also for anyone that is interested and may not know, refills for the buffer can be purchased through the online manufacturer.</li>
            <li>and then again the next day during the week, this seems to work better than trying to get it all done in one shot.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>So, its not quite perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing it, and continuously for a good 5-10 minutes, the hair definitely came off my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;There was a lot of irritation however.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s absolutely painless (</li>
            <li>I have very stubborn hair on my sideburn area that won&#x27;t even really come off well with wax strips.</li>
            <li>But decided to use it anyway as a exfoliater even though I don&#x27;t have that much hair on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes too much effort to remove the hair in my leg.</li>
            <li>yeah, it smooths the skin but doesn&#x27;t do much for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and It gently</li>
            <li>and how much damage you are doing to it by using this.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the folks who gave positive reviews need new glasses.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I was not sure it would work at all.</li>
            <li>They are simple, quick, and discreet.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend giving the Hair Off Face Buffer a try.</li>
            <li>Left my skin irritated when buffing with any useful pressure.</li>
            <li>I went to get some swisspers exfoliating pads (now those things work) and saw this thing for 3 bucks right next to it.</li>
            <li>I rubbed the hell out of a spot right above my lip and then used the rest to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I have very tiny and light hair on my upper lip, yet it did not get all the hair out</li>
            <li>I can only get the buffer to work by using lotion first.</li>
            <li>I gently use it on my upper lip and the hair just disappears...</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this product worked for me.  </li>
            <li>.. natural paper</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>The money-back guarantee is moot for this product, considering you have to mail back the \\&quot;unused portion,\\&quot; which will cost almost as much as the product itself.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it takes a bit more rubbing and it will leave your skin red, so you have to do it before bedtime or when you aren&#x27;t going out for a few hours.</li>
            <li>I think the good reviews must be fake</li>
            <li>I originally posted this a little over a year ago and everything I said still stands</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and blonde, but I get some dark brown hairs every now and then on the upper lip-</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and my hair is not coarse.</li>
            <li>It works really well for coarse thick hair on your face, buffs it right away.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions exactly, but the only results I saw were dry flakes of skin above my upper lip for the next couple of days (even though I do exfoliate regularly).</li>
            <li>And I have to say that it really does work (and my hair is dark and course).</li>
            <li>And right after I wet my face and dried it with a pad it started burning like crazy and left the brightest red circle right on the spot above my lip where I rubbed it the most.</li>

            <li> I had been shaving for some time and developed bumps and dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Who would have guessed that such a simple item would work, without irritation, without chemicals, without shaving (I mean, come on - what woman really WANTS to shave her face -</li>
            <li> I want to get as many people as possible involved from ordering from manufacturer, I&#x27;m afraid if they ever stop making these</li>
            <li> all it was was a pink piece of paper with sticky stuff on the back.</li>
            <li> I suppose this means I rubbed for too long, but none of the hair had come off, so how was I supposed to know?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on dry skin, on after-the-shower skin and either way,</li>
            <li> It does leave the skin a little red and irritated but no more so than after laser hair removal or electrolysis, without the high price.</li>
            <li> ANY LONGER because it caused a patch of skin above my lip to turn dark.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t pick a single hair of you face!</li>
            <li> Just tried this wearing a white t-shirt and the shirt was covered in little hairs.</li>
            <li> I thought the sticky/adhesive side was the side to stick the pink strip on the purple tool.</li>
            <li> Be careful, this product will rub off your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The company should probably be sued for selling a piece of plain pink paper as a &#x27;hair remover&#x27; that gives you nothing but a big ass</li>
            <li> Tip, if you become red and irritated, you&#x27;ve buffed too hard or long.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you have extremely tough and concrete skin, but otherwise you will experience burning and redness for 2 days.</li>
            <li> When I realized it had done this I quit using the buffer but so far the skin is still dark which is worse than before because it makes it look as if you have dark hair above your lip even though there is none.</li>
            <li> After reading other responses, I now use the buffer after&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At least I only wasted a few bucks on the facial buffer instead of 10-15 on the other one.</li>
            <li> Have no clue what to use to get the redness down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that ends up buying things in hope they will work, they get let down.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this product, but for such a low price, I figured why not give it a try.</li>
            <li> But dries out the skin, making later use difficult (due to rough skin)</li>
            <li> It was the biggest waste of money.</li>

            <li> But on my face, I felt it is too harsh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, for a piece of plastic and a few rough-out stickers, this should cost $2 max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All I have to do now is use it once per week for just a few minutes</li>
            <li> Honestly they all smell terrible and very few work.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As a woman of Italian and Cuban descent, I know a thing or two about facial hair. I LOVE these things! They are simple, quick, and discreet. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Think sandpaper ...thats all it is.  I think the good reviews must be fake, I was an idiot</li>
            <li> ***FYI***** I Love this product. It works really well for coarse thick hair on your face, buffs it right away. Just make sure you have a clean dry face first, then buff. Also for anyone that is interested and may not know, refills for the buffer can be purchased through the online manufacturer. ccaindustries.com. You get 6 refill pads in a pack for $4.19!!!! sure is cheaper than buying the whole new kit for like $8. Just keep the purple buffer and order the refills!!!! I want to get as many people as possible involved from ordering from manufacturer, I&#x27;m afraid if they ever stop making these I don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;ll do without them!!!!</li>
            <li> this is a waste of money! it doesn&#x27;t pick a single hair of you face! it irritates the skin on your face, and leave all the hair in place.. go for a waxing or buy a hair off cream or smething else, this doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this product, but for such a low price, I figured why not give it a try. And I have to say that it really does work (and my hair is dark and course). I gently use it on my upper lip and the hair just disappears...and it&#x27;s absolutely painless (though I do agree with the previous reviewer that if you rub too hard, it can irritate your skin)! I only have to use it for a couple minutes about once a week and I&#x27;m good to go--no more dreading the monthly trips to the salon for incredibly painful waxing. Definitely try it out!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this product worked for me.  I have very sensitive skin and have blonde hair.  I was looking for something to get rid of/minimize the lovely &#x27;blonde-beard&#x27; that I just noticed on my 30th b-day.  It works great, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now.  I would say it works best on light colored hair, may not be as effective on darker growth.  It does make the skin tingle, especially after the very first use, but consequent uses it&#x27;s very mild.  I use it once and then again the next day during the week, this seems to work better than trying to get it all done in one shot.  Overall I was very happy with the product, price and results.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD AND LASTS AT LEAST 5 DAYS</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased this item. It doesn&#x27;t work. It was the biggest waste of money. no matter what I did, it didn&#x27;t take off any hair. I recommend not to waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, painless and it works! My hair is fine and blonde, but I get some dark brown hairs every now and then on the upper lip- You just take this thing and rub it in tiny circles and the hair comes off! Sometimes it takes a bit more rubbing and it will leave your skin red, so you have to do it before bedtime or when you aren&#x27;t going out for a few hours. But you will wake up the next day with no hair! It won&#x27;t work for eyebrow hair because that is too thick- I even used it for my knuckle hair- works great! Just use a oil-free moisturizer after and you are good to go!</li>
            <li> I picked this up on a whim, figuring it was another gimmick. IT WORKS! I have very stubborn hair on my sideburn area that won&#x27;t even really come off well with wax strips. I tried this and voila - hair is practically gone (note I said \\&quot;practically\\&quot; - like I said, I have stubborn hair, but it&#x27;s almost smooth!).     Who would have guessed that such a simple item would work, without irritation, without chemicals, without shaving (I mean, come on - what woman really WANTS to shave her face - even if it doesn&#x27;t grow in thicker, it somehow feels WRONG).    So yes, I am happy as a clam with my little buffer!</li>
            <li> This thing cost 3 bucks at walmart. I went to get some swisspers exfoliating pads (now those things work) and saw this thing for 3 bucks right next to it. I thought it was just another exfoliating thing... didn&#x27;t know it was for hair removal. But decided to use it anyway as a exfoliater even though I don&#x27;t have that much hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should&#x27;ve kept my 3 bucks and saved me a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont know if I used the wrong side or not... it never tells you which side to use. Common sense I thought the sticky/adhesive side was the side to stick the pink strip on the purple tool. It didn&#x27;t look like it was gonna work... all it was was a pink piece of paper with sticky stuff on the back. I rubbed the hell out of a spot right above my lip and then used the rest to exfoliate. And right after I wet my face and dried it with a pad it started burning like crazy and left the brightest red circle right on the spot above my lip where I rubbed it the most. The rest of my face blew up red too and now I&#x27;m sitting here with itchy red rashy skin covered in avocado and olive oil.  Have no clue what to use to get the redness down so I&#x27;m trying anything natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a rash on your face get  this.. if not leave this crap alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company should probably be sued for selling a piece of plain pink paper as a &#x27;hair remover&#x27; that gives you nothing but a big ass rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge clue.. no ingredients on the box but says its natural..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pssh.. natural paper</li>
            <li> This product is great for somebody with blonde or very fine hair that isn&#x27;t laser sensitive and/or is too dense for electrolysis. The trick is to do this after a shower, and to not expect to get ALL the hair on the first go! Use it for about 60 seconds/area, then wait two days, then repeat. By the end of a week, you should have most of the hair &#x27;sheared&#x27; off and the good news is that, unlike shaving, regrowth has a tapered, fine end and won&#x27;t feel &#x27;thicker&#x27; (like after shaving as a razor cuts the hairs with a beveled edge, making them feel courser); just re-treat the area about once a week, gently, and you&#x27;ll remain smooth and hairless. Tip, if you become red and irritated, you&#x27;ve buffed too hard or long. Just use a bit of OTC hydrocortisone cream (no longer than 2 days!), and you&#x27;ll feel better.</li>
            <li> I have read many good reviews about this product but to be honest, I was disappointed. I have not reordered it since. It takes too much effort to remove the hair in my leg. But on my face, I felt it is too harsh.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Very pleased with the service too.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my hair is not coarse. I have been unhappy with creams, waxes etc. I found this product easy and effective with no burn of the skin.</li>
            <li> I can only get the buffer to work by using lotion first. Be careful, this product will rub off your skin. It does get the job done without the pain of waxing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 5 years. I was beyond the plucking stage. I wasn&#x27;t going to shave....took a look at my Mom....no way.   Works Great! This is my alternative to everything else that I can afford to do.   I had been buying it at Walmart. Now they don&#x27;t always have it so I have been buying online for about the last six months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on dry skin, on after-the-shower skin and either way, yeah, it smooths the skin but doesn&#x27;t do much for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hm... There must be some magical formula to make it work??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, for a piece of plastic and a few rough-out stickers, this should cost $2 max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure I can recommend this. No, I can&#x27;t. If it was foolproof then yes, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> This does not do anything like what is claimed. It just hurts your skin and does not get rid of the hair at all. I have very tiny and light hair on my upper lip, yet it did not get all the hair out and I ended up with a sore lip with rashes for two days. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This item is the easiest one I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it solely on my face, mostly upper lip and it does work. I&#x27;m so glad I found it. I&#x27;ll definitely reorder the buffer pads when I run out.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and tried this product after a nice long hot shower.  No results at all.  I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the folks who gave positive reviews need new glasses.  I used as directed and did not see any hair coming off.  It basically is supposed to work like sand papering your skin.  But with moderate pressure (did not want to totally irritate my skin) in both clockwise and counter clockwise directions, I was not removing any hair.  Bogus product.</li>
            <li> This product works well to remove most hair. However, all this buffer does is remove a layer of skin which is incredibly painful if you have sensitive skin. Every time I used it, I developed redness and stinging and most of my hair did not even come off. I would recommend this product if you have extremely tough and concrete skin, but otherwise you will experience burning and redness for 2 days.</li>
            <li> The Hair Off Face Buffer was a good price, and I figured I would give it a try knowing it was low cost. I didn&#x27;t want an unpleasant cream of removal gel. Honestly they all smell terrible and very few work. Like many women I have a light coat of hair above my lip that is never noticed by anyone but myself. I also have two hairs under my chin that grow in now and again. I hate those because they are noticed by others. The Hair Off Face Buffer arrived fast and was packaged perfectly. I used it right away. First, the buffer top is easy to hold and shaped perfectly for ease of use. The buffer pad is smoother than I ever thought it would be. Honestly I was not sure it would work at all. To my surprise, it did work. It worked to remove both the upper lip hair and the two stubborn hairs beneath my chin. The hair stayed away for over a week. All I have to do now is use it once per week for just a few minutes and I am hair free. I also love that it leaves my skin feeling so smooth.  I have never experienced any irritation from use. I do highly recommend giving the Hair Off Face Buffer a try.</li>
            <li> not what I wanted to remove hair from ears and face (male)</li>
            <li> I had been shaving for some time and developed bumps and dark spots on my face. Just tried this wearing a white t-shirt and the shirt was covered in little hairs. I find it best to pull the skin taut or tight, blow air in cheeks like a balloon or tilt  head back to stretch the neck skin. It does leave the skin a little red and irritated but no more so than after laser hair removal or electrolysis, without the high price. I follow the treatment with coconut oil to soothe and heal. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> good but i wonder if a better one is available</li>
            <li> The buffer is ok to use when you are in a hurry. Discrete and does not tear your skin.</li>
            <li> This product does not remove hair effectively.I had to keep rubbing it and it caused irritation and redness on my face.It also made the area look darker making it obvious that i did do something there.Please do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Left my skin irritated when buffing with any useful pressure. Otherwise, didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> After reading other responses, I now use the buffer after&lt;br /&gt;I shower or bath.  I use it on my face and It gently&lt;br /&gt;takes hair away.  I&#x27;m so glad I found the product listed&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions exactly, but the only results I saw were dry flakes of skin above my upper lip for the next couple of days (even though I do exfoliate regularly). I suppose this means I rubbed for too long, but none of the hair had come off, so how was I supposed to know? The money-back guarantee is moot for this product, considering you have to mail back the \\&quot;unused portion,\\&quot; which will cost almost as much as the product itself. At least I only wasted a few bucks on the facial buffer instead of 10-15 on the other one.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the Hair Off Eyebrow Shapers, so when I saw this product from the same brand I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it... that was a mistake.  Try as I might, the \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; on the sides of my face, upper lip, and chin didn&#x27;t disappear.  I threw the remainder of the product away in disgust.  I guess it&#x27;s back to waxing... &#x3D;oP</li>
            <li> This product truly works in keeping off the hair.  Would recommend to any of those ladies who suffer from those unwanted whiskers.</li>
            <li> So, its not quite perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing it, and continuously for a good 5-10 minutes, the hair definitely came off my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;There was a lot of irritation however. For a good 2-3 days. A couple &amp;#34;zit&amp;#34; like bumps too.&lt;br /&gt;But, now that the irritation is over, its smooth and quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For how cheap it is, its a good deal. The drawbacks are the itchiness and irritation for 3 days, but its worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> THis is a great product because it is not time sensitive and it is not a chemical.  I have been using this for over a year now and I am very happy with it.  THere are some drawbacks:  if you rub too hard, you can cause irritation; depending on your hair growth, you may need to use everyday.</li>
            <li> Somewhat works. But dries out the skin, making later use difficult (due to rough skin)</li>
            <li> absolutely terrible.  the product did NOTHING for me ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I ended up throwing it away. It was useless.</li>
            <li> Fast service - good product.  What more do I need to say?  It is exactly what I wanted and I would recommend this product and seller.  Use right after shower or put warm wash cloth over area first so area is softened and prepped first.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that ends up buying things in hope they will work, they get let down. I have unwanted facial hair, some peach fuzz, some very coarse black hairs that I&#x27;m sick of plucking, ect. So I was hoping this would work to help me cope better with that. It wouldn&#x27;t even start to remove the fuzz off my face! And didn&#x27;t do anything to the coarse hair either, it just irritated my face. And honestly when you get the product and look at it my first though was &#x27;how does this thing remove hair at all&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t look like it would at all.</li>
            <li> Nope, just sandpaper.  I could have gotten the same thing out of my husband&#x27;s garage!</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to rate this? Does it work? Yes it does BUT... you have to keep going over and over clockwise/counter till it does the job. The more you rub over and over the more irritated your skin gets. It did not make my upper lip red but I would wonder how good it is for your skin  and how much damage you are doing to it by using this. When I look in the mirror the skin seems fine but it is irritated and does burn when I put lotion or even aloe vera gel. The strips are like very mild sandpaper. The instructions tell you not to go out into the sun for 24 hours after or to use any toner for a day afterwards as well. I did not put toner but Anything I put did burn. Also, I did not purchase this from amazon and my box looked different ( same product though).  ***Update*** I originally posted this a little over a year ago and everything I said still stands BUT...I WILL NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ANY LONGER because it caused a patch of skin above my lip to turn dark. When I realized it had done this I quit using the buffer but so far the skin is still dark which is worse than before because it makes it look as if you have dark hair above your lip even though there is none. I hope this is not permanent. :(</li>
