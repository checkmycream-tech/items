            <li>THEY ARE LOVING</li>
            <li>Everything is included for you to do your own at home gel polish.</li>
            <li>MY AUNT BOUGHT HER OWN GEL NAIL KIT</li>
            <li>I do not think it is recommended anymore, but I kind of do this; I just do a three step buff, with a $2.00 drug store nail</li>
            <li>I liked the packaging</li>
            <li>We are all loving it.</li>
            <li>It takes some time and patience to do, so don&#x27;t order this if you aren&#x27;t blessed with time or patience for this kind of thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handy (pun intended?</li>
            <li>Aparently, b/c this item has hazardous materials, Amazon will not replace or refund me for it.  </li>
            <li>This kit has enabled me to do my own gel nails with salon quality look and staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve preferred white...but honestly that&#x27;s just me being picky...</li>
            <li>Nonreturnable because it is considered hazardous material.  </li>
            <li>and they turn out just as nice as the salons.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND for beautiful nails!</li>
            <li>Great kit for the holidays to someone special to you.</li>
            <li>Then I seal it all with a full coat of Brilliance (the top coat) and I am good for another week or so!</li>
            <li>Then I seal it all with a full coat of Brilliance (the top coat) and I am good for another week or so!</li>
            <li>To remove the gel polishes, there is a great tool  that quickly removed the softened polish.</li>
            <li>Does a great job and quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Kit is VERY easy to use if you have experience with Gel</li>
            <li>very easy to follow instructions and use.  </li>
            <li>They turned out great the very first time I did them.  </li>
            <li>The nail polish just dripped right off!!!</li>
            <li>She has used it once so far and said it did a great job of drying the shellac polish!  </li>
            <li>Though not truly a professional kit, it produces excellent results.</li>
            <li>Now I am able to do my own no chip manicure at home.</li>
            <li>If it does then the polish is more apt to come off sooner.</li>
            <li>and it fixed it perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It looks beautiful and I don&#x27;t have to spend much at all!</li>
            <li>So, I was very excited to get my own kit.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>The light works great and isn&#x27;t cheaply made or flimsy.</li>
            <li>Not only can I take off my own polish (which can range from 8-12 dollars at the salon...and the bottle to do it at home is under $7), but the convenience of sitting at home with a coffee and music while doing my nails is priceless!  </li>
            <li>Great for first day....</li>
            <li>The review from Ereader in Pleaston,CA is very accurate.</li>
            <li>Every step is very important.</li>
            <li>The prep cleanser is just rubbing alcohol which is also very cheap at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>This kit works great, is easy to use, and the result is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind, if you are not that good at painting your own finger nails, it will not magically make you better, but the quality of the equipment is awesome.</li>
            <li>You have to use 2 coats of the color to make sure there is no bleeding through.  </li>
            <li>then again the salon does it faster and better</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Regular polish always chips for me within a day, but I was really impressed with gel polish.</li>
            <li>I am learning more each time I do it.</li>
            <li>Just wish it was packaged with more care.</li>
            <li>PEDIS AND 10 MORE FOR THE MANIS.  </li>
            <li>I love the set and the LED dryer</li>
            <li>after many research.. please use sun block on your hands.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments from people!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHERS FOR SURE.</li>
            <li>There are only 3 LED&#x27;s in this lamp, I was concerned, before I bought it, but it cures perfectly and in 30 to 45 seconds per layer.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you this is the best one to get if you are just starting out.</li>
            <li>Contains most of the things you need both to put LED UV polish on and to take it off.  </li>
            <li>I suggest doing it once a week after they get a bit more grown out</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on my nails</li>
            <li>Make sure you buff your nails, and do not paint the product on your skin.</li>
            <li>I was spending $30 plus tip on top for a no chip manicure until I found this kit.</li>
            <li>i was able to become quicker at it.</li>
            <li>i love it..............</li>
            <li>The 45 second lamp is great!</li>
            <li>I had sooo many compliments on them, and when they hear I did it myself, they wanna know what I used</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>The colors tend to be more transparent than the color they appear to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But most of the time they don&#x27;t I just don&#x27;t like the &#x27;grown out&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It works but dries out my fingers and cuticles more than I would like</li>
            <li>Great product I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Better than any manicure I&#x27;ve paid for.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get some more colors and get all festive and junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will have more than paid for itself in two &#x27;visits.&#x27;</li>
            <li>(interesting as they were the ones to ship it out to me).  </li>
            <li>: The quality is excellent as the color lasts me a solid two weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this manicure kit</li>
            <li>: I watched a lot of youtube videos to get a better idea about how to use this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, love it and will save a TON of money.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I bought, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is much better than OPI&#x27;s $17 each.</li>
            <li>I love the turnout, i would give it 5/5 stars</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and watched a couple of YouTube videos to make sure I applied the gel correctly.  </li>
            <li>I just repainted color on the two nails, cured, and repainted top coat, cured, and used Purify</li>
            <li>The OPI polish on top of the gel lasted for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND SAID THEY ARE BETTER LOOKING NOW</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>thought is came with more.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but can be a better value elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Hope you find this review helpful and enjoy your nail designs! :)</li>
            <li>Red Carpet was the cheapest of all of them and Amazon has the best price by</li>
            <li>Ok as a starter kit</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;re better off buying components seperate.</li>
            <li>so far so good!  </li>
            <li>They could look better, but that&#x27;s only because I am out of practice and didn&#x27;t use any guides, but, aside from my own lack of expertise in this area, I am as happy as I could be, and I will get better with practice.</li>
            <li>The one included chips a lot more easily than gel should.</li>
            <li>Very clean and easy to use...</li>
            <li>very cool is that you can do the uv with your computer, so you dont have to move on a place with electricity............</li>
            <li>FOR THE POLISH TO DRY... LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 2: The SensatioNAIL gel polish system is wonderful too[[ASIN:B0087P9PB0 sensationail by nailene starter kit in pink chiffon]].</li>
            <li>Her nails always look fabulous :)</li>
            <li>A note to users: you can easily patch a nail and it looks 80-100% like the original job, so touchup is easy!  </li>
            <li>So far everything is going great.</li>
            <li>10 days is awesome though compared to other polish</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t do all fingers at once finish four, then finish the thumbs, then finish the other four I found this to be the best plan.  </li>

            <li>When I remove this product, my nails are still as strong as they were before the product was put on.  </li>

            <li>so I&#x27;m going to try just backfilling since the company says that is fine and that you just have to go through the steps</li>
            <li>and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty good at painting my own nails so this was not very hard for me.  </li>
            <li>and she loves the product very much and has told everyone about it !!</li>
            <li>After a little practice, works awesome!  </li>
            <li>The remover is just acetone which you can buy at target for $4 for a HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li>but now the light won&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li>and it will not cure until you put your nails under the LED light dryer.  </li>
            <li>That is because there is a built in timer in the light to keep it on either 30 or 45 seconds-according to the instruction manual.  </li>
            <li>EVEN MORE FUN WITHOUT THE WAIT OF 30  MIN</li>
            <li>These just take seconds to do, but are important to remove oils so the polish sticks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Short Description: LED ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT KIT WITH ESSENTIALS FOR GEL COATING.&lt;br /&gt;Visual</li>
            <li>I do wish the light fit all 5 fingers</li>
            <li>Such a great buy.</li>
            <li>love it, worth the money and time.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was the quality of the polish or the light?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy I upgraded to the 45 second lamp.</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit, used it about 10 times, and the LED light quit working.</li>
            <li>When you are wiping them with &#x27;purify&#x27; you have to keep rubbing it until it literally squeaks which tells you it&#x27;s smooth &amp; no longer tacky.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous</li>
            <li>The gel/polish spilled all over the LED light structure.</li>
            <li>so you can do this by your computer instead on the floor or somewhere not so comfortable.</li>
            <li>I think that the light was damaged in some way.  </li>
            <li>LED light (</li>
            <li>Power for the LED Light:</li>
            <li>My kit came with the portable LED light and did not come with batteries or power cord to power the lights.</li>
            <li>portable light</li>
            <li>if someone else does it for you, finish is completely smooth though</li>
            <li>THE LED LIGHT WOULD STING MY FINGER</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit at Ulta and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I have tried Sally Hansen, and this is a far superior product.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s time for a touch up just buff them and add another manicure right on top.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s time for a touch up just buff them and add another manicure right on top.</li>
            <li>just right maybe i need to practice more.</li>
            <li>The manicure kit allowed for a pretty manicure with a very smooth glossy finish.</li>
            <li>The product itself arrived quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>For your first time I recommend getting a light color, it&#x27;s more forgiving.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not crazy pricey compared to a good normal polish from Essie or OPI.</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>No more having a perfect manicure for all of 5 hours until they chip when I do dishes or wash my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more having a perfect manicure for all of 5 hours until they chip when I do dishes or wash my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited when I could just do clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And now I&#x27;m actually *excited</li>
            <li>I am extremely excited about this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so excited about this product and would recommend it everyone.  </li>
            <li>have found that I need to make sure I have a good 20 minutes or so to do all the steps properly on both hands, and to make sure that I don&#x27;t rush, and that I have a steady hand.</li>
            <li>I clean the brush on gauze or a paper towel to minimize contaminating the clean-up solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just something so elegant about a nice french manicure.</li>
            <li>Okay, so far I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I orderd this through Amazon.com because this product qualified for free super saver shipping.  </li>
            <li>The pre/post clean is just alcohol.</li>
            <li>Very professional looking manicure at a nice price.</li>
            <li>The instructions are very simple and straight forward which is great and easy.</li>
            <li>One thing that you really need to watch for is clean your hands thoroughly and make sure you do each step as described, or else your nail polish will start peeling.</li>
            <li>It is hard to get off, I had the best luck soaking my nails in a bowl of  polish remover for about 10 minutes, then using a orange stick to scrap it</li>
            <li>Otherwise, expect the color to peel within a week (which is fine by me for the right color).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t vouch for how long it lasts (I just tried it today) but it looks amazing!</li>
            <li>One reason why I like thos product so much is that in a short amount of time I have beautiful looking nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The item arrived one day later from the estimated arrival day but in good condition.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that it takes forever to remove nail polish, but it may be a good thing.</li>
            <li>Works very well, and came with a free polish!</li>
            <li>They lasted a full 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, I would not pay full price for this system, if you can find it 1/2 price</li>
            <li>I got for her birthday after she borrowed same unit from a friend and loved it.</li>
            <li>I used gelish nail polish and it works just as good as the red carpet manicure brand!</li>
            <li>: I can&#x27;t say enough about how gorgeous this kit makes my nails look.</li>
            <li>might as well just use regular good quality polish.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER had nice nails unless I went to get them professionally done....</li>
            <li>Lasts about 10 days, more if your hands aren&#x27;t in much water.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t look as good but same quality.</li>
            <li>but I make sure I apply my prep &amp; structure very well.</li>
            <li>The light isn’t as strong, so if you have a plug or a certain USB that works faster than others use that one.</li>
            <li>A+ shopping experience; top quality product; super fast service.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and saves so much money!  </li>
            <li>(their old) instructions recommend roughing up the top surface of the nail, with a fine emery board.</li>
            <li>The light color (camera shy) in the kit is very light, pretty much a sheer color - perfect for me as I am in the Army and can&#x27;t wear bright colors.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was delivered on time and the kit works great.</li>
            <li>Used also with other gel polishes with great success!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>What I wasn&#x27;t impressed with was the job the manicurist did - my nails were very splotchy and uneven, with hard-as-rock drips in places.</li>
            <li>This light works far better than the portable version, and I like the auto shut off -so</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>For less than 1 month worth of gel manis you can own your own kit &amp; do it yourself at home.</li>
            <li>The button which turns the lamp/timer on and off stopped working and the light was significantly more dim than it had been.</li>
            <li>but luckily I got my kit at Ulta</li>
            <li>but luckily I got my kit at Ulta</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two weeks, I ended up painting two coats of OPI color and OPI top coat on top of the gel in order to hide the nail growth and because I felt like using a different color.  </li>
            <li>and I am actually okay with that since it is still better than regular nail polish and cheaper than going to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took me a couple tries to make sure the nail was clean of cotton fiber (if you use cotton balls), to perfect my strokes with the brush , and to get the dry time right.</li>
            <li>and  are highly recommended but cost much more.  </li>
            <li>It takes all of about 15-20 minutes and you are out the door - no dry time - I love it!</li>
            <li>First day out with my new manicure 3 people commented on how nice my nails looked.  </li>
            <li>Is easy to use even if you are not a professional you can use and will have nice results.</li>
            <li>The first week of May I attempted to do my nails and two of the three bulbs would not come on in the led light.</li>
            <li>Dark colors take 4 coats but look great.</li>
            <li>The light kinda feels like it burns your hands at first too.</li>
            <li>It stays shiny and strong for a whole week.</li>
            <li>VERY GLOSSY NAILS  and quite strong too.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if you can give yourself an okay manicure with regular polish, you can do this and get long lasting beautiful results.</li>
            <li>but I also know that just painting my nails doesn&#x27;t really work anymore because it chips off too easily</li>
            <li>Fast and easy</li>
            <li>Amazon did fully refund my money since it was sold through Amazon and thanks to Amazon for making it a easy return.</li>
            <li>(The first three manicures taught me this!).  </li>
            <li>I also purchased Red Carpet Manicure Gems and Jewels and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I find these micro layers work best and unlike regular polish all dry &amp; cure</li>
            <li>The kit travels nicely and when we are on vacation for 3-4 weeks I can  touch up or back fill quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little gel kit for 1st time users.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all my friends, family and total strangers who ask how my nails look so nice!</li>
            <li>Haha) that the LED light automatically shuts off at 45 seconds.</li>
            <li>totally worth the effort and initial expense as I will save lots of money and have amazing looking nails</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have done 3 manicures with it so far and trust me when I say that you will get better in time.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was kind enough to do a price adjustment since it hadn&#x27;t shipped yet.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Better distribution, available at local stores, Walmarts &amp; CVS/Longs drug stores in my area carry it).</li>
            <li>You do want to take it off prior to putting it under the magical blue light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good product.</li>
            <li>I love gel manicures and used to frequent a salon on a twice-monthly basis to have my nails done.</li>
            <li>product is TOTALLY worth the money.</li>
            <li>I first purchased the kit because paying at the salon was becoming too much</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s always fun</li>
            <li>There are others kits that offere a more professional approach</li>
            <li>(but again was time consuming but worth it for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving all my extra money!!!!</li>
            <li>As long as you have a steady hand, you will love this product!!</li>
            <li>It was quite easy to learn how to use this and the results are very professional looking!</li>
            <li>other than that, super easy!!</li>
            <li>I was so impressed I bought 2 other shades made by Red Carpet.  </li>
            <li>(if you get the right person).</li>
            <li>You need to follow every step by step to get this right or</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m right handed, so</li>
            <li>In fact, my daughter does her own nails and gets a better result than she sometimes has in the past at the salon.  </li>
            <li>instructions are very clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>process was so simple and the instructions were very easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>This kit has been used heavily for nearly a year now and the light still works great.  </li>
            <li>So I stuck them back under the light for another 45 second session, wiped them again with &#x27;purify&#x27; &amp; I was good.</li>
            <li>Reallllly bright, I usually try to use sun block on my hands and throw a little washcloth over it as it&#x27;s curing so that I&#x27;m not blinded by the bright light.</li>
            <li>but I should have paid a little more and purchased better quality</li>
            <li>The manicures are long lasting and the results are beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is very reasonable price and dramatically saves time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And make sure they cover each other evenly and that the light hits all parts of the nail.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on this before buying it and was still a little worried, even though the majority of the reviews were good.</li>
            <li>Having this kit has saved me so much money, not to mention all the compliments I have gotten from people asking me where I get my nails done!</li>
            <li>FIRST TIME TOOK ME 10 MIN TO DO MY DAUGHTERS</li>
            <li>I love all the variety of colors Red Carpet has.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>I love my red carpet nail polish!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li>First..</li>
            <li>pretty nails.  </li>
            <li>I found it much cheaper here on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>They do not get hot.</li>
            <li>I am going to save so much money!</li>
            <li>they have been lasting longer and they to not chip for the most part.</li>
            <li>The polishes last a long time and look really great.</li>
            <li>This kit saves me soo much time and money!  </li>
            <li>A real money saver!</li>
            <li>I love the Red Carpet Manicure Starter Kit!!  </li>
            <li>The end result is great though, and this has paid for itself when I think about how much I would&#x27;ve spent by now on professional manicures.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was just me and</li>
            <li>I love Red Carpet Manicure!</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with nail shellac.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE french manicures with the kit!</li>
            <li>LOVE MY RED CARPET MANICURE PRO KIT.</li>
            <li>LOVE MY RED CARPET MANICURE PRO KIT.</li>
            <li>This kit is everything you need to make those pretty gel nails.</li>
            <li>Great price for everything that comes in the kit, and the polish is a deep red and very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Purchased it a while ago, just got around to using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I always do my thumbs first, start to finish, then each hand seperatly, start to finish.  </li>
            <li>Hoping I get better help from the manufacturer - still waiting to hear back from their customer service.</li>
            <li>Pays for itself in first use.</li>
            <li>really!  </li>
            <li>but I would rather have more colors and rebuy one that I use a lot than only have 2 or 3 from OPI.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did my first manicur in &amp;#34;Candid Moment&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the better vendors.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and tips exactly</li>
            <li>It is a sophisticated red with a pretty shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Shell out the money now...and SAVE in the future! :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to regular ole nail polish application this will save you time...if you are accustomed to putting on more than one coat of polish.  </li>
            <li>My polish lasts about 3 wks just for the simple fact that I&#x27;ve never had a color on for more than 3 wks.</li>
            <li>I am ashamed of how much money I used to spend on getting my nails done!</li>
            <li>She has used it a few times and her nail looks good.</li>
            <li>OR my new trick of just buffing the surface of the nail and painting over it again paying special attention to the chipped region.</li>
            <li>OR my new trick of just buffing the surface of the nail and painting over it again paying special attention to the chipped region.</li>
            <li>I am glad I used a light color for my first try because I notice little mistakes I made, but they are not noticible to everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The light is really handy and works very well I especially like the 45 second timer</li>
            <li>Long lasting, easy to apply, and easy to remove!  </li>
            <li>I bought the pro kit with plug in LED light (the more expensive kit offers a better quality light than the starter with much quicker curing time.)</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t return this product due to hazardous materials, but thanks Amazon for giving me a refund on this item.  </li>
            <li>: It requires longer curing times than the professional light and can only fit four fingers at a time requiring me to do 3 separate curing phases for each step of the process.</li>
            <li>I can go longer but do not like the grow-out pattern; I can and do put regular nail polish (clear top coat on top) to put a freshen tip to cuticle shine on about a week in; regular polish stays on so long on top of this stuff.</li>
            <li>and then the four left fingers completely from prep to top coat before doing my right hand.  </li>
            <li>The polish with the kit is a nice red and everything else works as it is supposed to just make sure you use thin coats and use the UV light between</li>
            <li>Love the Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 Starter Kit, highly recommend it for anyone not wanting to spend $60 every time to get their nails done at a salon.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and lasting!</li>
            <li>ITS VERY SIMPLE AND EASY.  </li>
            <li>By then my nails had grown and it was time to be redone, and again such an easy process.  </li>
            <li>first noticed that that cord did not even fit properly in the lamp.</li>
            <li>My nails would be like paper when the wraps were removed and took about a year to grow back strong.  </li>
            <li>As long as you only put two coats of color on, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>removal with pure acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with large hands.</li>
            <li>The first couple times I did it, being a newbie it took me a good couple hours because you have to be careful not to get the stuff on your skin or it will make the entire nail peal off.</li>
            <li>The first few times of doing my own nails did not turn out very well.  </li>
            <li>So happy I decided to buy it on Black Friday when it was only 39.99!  </li>
            <li>I would say the light may be worth your money, it is nice that the polish dry&#x27;s hard and super fast.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best purchase I have made in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled as I&#x27;m not exactly rich but really wanted this.</li>
            <li>It is hard to give a good rating for something that lasted 4 times.  </li>
            <li>In conclusion, this kit worksexactly as stated and the additional polishes are much cheaper than competitor brands.</li>
            <li>The lamp is 6 watts and uses LED Ultra Violet (UV) lights and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>but my uv light worked for only a week and then broke</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to replace supplies but are all available either locally or on amazon.</li>
            <li>so you are ready for the process when it does arrive.  </li>
            <li>i dont must go to the nail center and stay more then 1 houer.</li>
            <li>so it is very misleading.</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Up date, after using this product a few more times and tweaking my technique,I still have not gotten my manicure to last any more the 4 or 5 days, not the 2 weeks as they claim.</li>
            <li>and RCM has really helped my nails grow longer.  </li>
            <li>(very annoying).&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>It pays for itself after a couple of uses, I would highly recommend (and I did!)</li>
            <li>I got this item and same as everyone else it had leaked inside the pacakge and was all over the light.  </li>
            <li>The prep one was broke when I got it, but the others work really well.</li>
            <li>very fussy to use....</li>
            <li>The UV light is spacious enough for 4 fingers/hand (do thumbs separately) and 5 toes and has a built in timer.  </li>
            <li>Two thin coats gave great coverage.  </li>
            <li>If you like having a gel manicure, but do not want to pay for the salon, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product and that&#x27;s coming from someone who is very picky.</li>
            <li>very professional.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color (red) polish that is supplied is a nice red.  </li>
            <li>so I might also purchase a better LED lamp in the near future.  </li>
            <li>Thin coats are key and try not to go all the way to your nail bed for best adhesion.  </li>
            <li>some of the negative reviews worry you, just know that if you follow the directions (which also means purchasing any needed supplies that don&#x27;t come with the kit, like lint-free nail pads and a really good buffer), you will &amp;#34;love&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m in a job now where I have occasion to meet vendors, etc, and I need to look more professional on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>The products are unique and go on a little different from regular nail polish or acrylics; so each time you do it, you&#x27;ll probably get better and better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I repaired both chips with the original products for each hand and it was freaky; both hands still experienced the exact same wear (I am ambidextrous, so my nails usually wear the same, but I did not expect it in this case with</li>
            <li>Im no professional, but this was so easy.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit more time consuming but it is so much easier not smudging one hand while working on the other.</li>
            <li>(I have also used this for traditional nail polish and it significantly shortens that drying process</li>
            <li>I am so excited to finally have an at home gel mani kit.</li>
            <li>im not sure, but aside from that i love it!</li>
            <li>SURE YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS VERY CAREFULLY</li>
            <li>&quot; is the same prep and clean dehydrant you can buy at Ulta or Sally&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>I also use this brush to clean up the French manicure, to get clean lines on the white polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful to let the regular polish dry for a bit before the top coat</li>
            <li>This kit is easy to use, although the process of doing your own gel manicure is a bit tedious and time consuming.</li>
            <li>This one is a bright red polish with red glitter pieces suspended in the red.  </li>
            <li>Red Carpet colors are very light, they require multiple coats which can be time</li>
            <li>Soo easy for the at home manicure and inexperienced person.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that some of the colors for sale are too sheer which means you end up putting too many coats on causing it to peel.</li>
            <li>three different times with different colors and love it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to open the colors to know what they actually look</li>
            <li>Decent product</li>
            <li>The only thing I need to do is give my cuticles more attention before starting my nails.  </li>
            <li>It turned out very pretty (especially since I chose it for Christmas week)</li>
            <li>I finally buckled down and bought this last month, and I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>HIGH GLOSS &#x3D;</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anybody</li>
            <li>This kit too had high reviews and includes everything you will need.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this system.  </li>
            <li>She initially wasn&#x27;t very impressed due to the small size, and we contemplated returning it.</li>
            <li>Oh and I love the little train case it comes with.</li>
            <li>One would think that splurging for the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; set would give you a light big enough for your whole hand, but its not the end of the world.</li>
            <li>So far I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>If applied correctly (the key is to apply very sparingly!), it lasts for around 2 weeks and looks exactly like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>For the price, it should throw in a few more colors.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind being patient for a few minutes and you want to save tons of money by being able to do this at home instead of going to a salon, then I suggest you buy this kit.</li>
            <li>I definitely got the right one and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>have used other gel nail colors with this product and it has worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used three different color so far and am extraordinarily happen with the results.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li>Then 2 to 3 light coats of white (White Hot) on the nail tips (until I get the white color opaqueness I like), cure each white coat for 45 seconds, then the top coat (Brilliance) and the last cure for 45 seconds.</li>
            <li>when I painted my right hand and then did the final step Purify, I messed up two of the nails somewhere in the process but didn&#x27;t realize until I wiped them at the end.  </li>
            <li>They have grown super long and are the strongest they have been.  </li>
            <li>It is a very light, sheer pink.</li>
            <li>but after using this polish for a month they have grown out and are actually looking decent for the first time in a lot of years.</li>
            <li>I also use the light on other polishes that need to &#x27;cure&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This is annoying and will most likely cause me to purchase a professional LED light that can fit an entire hand and will cure more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that may be I am a little more sensitive than some.</li>
            <li>but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>They switched my lamp, no questions asked for a brand new one</li>
            <li>They switched my lamp, no questions asked for a brand new one</li>
            <li>She plans on trying lots of new colors.  </li>
            <li>so that may be the test so far after 5 days of wear it still looks salon new!</li>
            <li>Easy, though slightly time consuming.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would add to this package is to buy the protective white gloves for when you have your hands under the LED light.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it just 4 stars is because you can only fit your fingers in, you have to do your thumb seperately</li>
            <li>This sure beats the 90 dollars at the nail salon I was spending for acrylics, and my nails are much healthier, and I can do this at home, anytime (usually late at night while listening to the news).  </li>
            <li>Essentially, the edges have to be smooth to stick properly.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t as happy with 133 Only in Hollywood just because it took three thin coats (and probably could have used a 4th</li>
            <li>This leaves the polishes (only red color in lit) and UV light.</li>
            <li>I got my first gel manicure just recently, when I was going to an event.</li>
            <li>I did my first gel manicure last night.  </li>
            <li>I bought this first for $79, then saw that it went on sale for $69 two days later.  </li>
            <li>: I bought this exact same system months ago at Ulta.</li>
            <li>The results were NOT as stellar as Red Carpet&#x27;s polish.  </li>
            <li>I apply a french manicure, then a week or 10 days later I do some buffing, touching up, and a back fill which takes about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I painted my left thumb first</li>
            <li>AND WOW!</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions carefully if you want the true salon look.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They look great for usually two weeks (and I take long hot baths every other day)!</li>
            <li>Also the LED light is an improvement over UV lights and takes much less time to cure between applications.</li>
            <li>Red Carpet Reddy (a true Red polish)&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li>I read the directions carefully, followed them to the T and my very first home gel manicure</li>
            <li>Not sure, but IMO it wasn&#x27;t worth it to take a chance in case something isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>It was hard, made my nails stronger (while applied - they were weaker and more brittle once I took the polish off, but that&#x27;s also true of regular nail polish for me) and lasted a week before starting to peel.</li>
            <li>it is not difficult to do, of course the first time it is not perfect, but i must say i learnd very quick..................</li>
            <li>I did find the LED light in this package a little stronger than the one at the nail salon</li>
            <li>I was a little worried by the fact that sometimes my fingers burned when I put them under the uv light.</li>
            <li>more thing to note is that the nails colors are a little deceiving from the outside of the bottle.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have the other version this cures my nails in a quick amount time and couldn&#x27;t image waiting 2 mintues for my nails to cure each time.</li>
            <li>Comes with a bottle of removed (100% acetone nail polish removed), a bottle of &amp;#34;purify&amp;#34; (isopropyl alcohol - just use some rubbing alcohol when it runs out), a bright red gel polish, a gel base coat, a gel top coat, some cuticle oil, a little prep bottle, and of course the UV light.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be daunted or scared at doing it alone, these instructions are really simple, clear and laid out so that you absolutely understand each step and what to do.</li>
            <li>Came with everything I needed and clear instructions.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this Red Carpet Kit.</li>
            <li>I was really suprised that my manicure was lasting three weeks at a time with NO peeling or color issues.</li>
            <li>Also do one hand at a time, go through 4 fingers, complete them and then do thumbs.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this kit early April and never got a chance to use it.</li>
            <li>If there is too much liquid, knock it off back into the bottle.</li>
            <li>★Option to use USB or directly into outlet..</li>
            <li>: None so far, if anything come up I will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Follow all directions as listed in the instruction booklet and your manicure will come out looking professional.</li>
            <li>One other thing I found out is that you can add other polish (non gel) on top and take it off normally</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had gel nails done at a professional nail salon and that has never happened.</li>
            <li>I have only had it on for a few hours, but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>but it does take me several hours (2) to do whole manicure.</li>
            <li>Professional OR portable-</li>
            <li>My kit came with a portable, but the kit appears to have been upgraded to now include the professional light)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>light is only big enough for 4 fingers.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and you will have professional looking nails without the expense of the salon.</li>
            <li>The two nails that I messed up on and fixed weren&#x27;t even the one that chipped after 4 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only unwrap the nail that you are ready to scrape so</li>
            <li>have used two polishes so far.  </li>
            <li>Seems minor, but it really is a big time saver (two kids, a hubby, dog and full time</li>
            <li>Also I recommend purchasing this at ULTA using their weekly coupons (sometimes 20% off, other times $10 or $3.50 off) because they allow you to return this product within 60 days at full refund, if you didn&#x27;t find it useful or for any other reasons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rough on my nails, but it lasted easily a week without chipping, two weeks with minor chips + beginning to outgrow.  </li>
            <li>it is the same price without the coupons as other top brands such as OPI and Essie.</li>
            <li>coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who say it doesn&#x27;t work are not really doing it right.  </li>
            <li>Using the RedCarpet LED light I put SensatioNail on one hand and RedCarpet on the other (I do French manicures, so</li>
            <li>My right hand polish has only been lasting about 10 days and the left hand a lot longer since I don&#x27;t use it as my main hand.</li>
            <li>The gel product goes on like a very thick nail polish and is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>They look the same to me and last/wear the exact same on my nails.</li>
            <li>I used it not less than 3 minutes ago.</li>
            <li>My daughter bought it at Ulta and paid double the price I paid for the exact same kit!!</li>
            <li>I use other brands of polish for other colors , they need to make more color choices.</li>
            <li>Sure the polish might seem a little thicker then a single manicure</li>
            <li>Sure the polish might seem a little thicker then a single manicure</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all my friends, family and total strangers who ask how my nails look so nice!persevered.</li>
            <li>used to paint my nails all the time in high school and younger; used to like to do designs (stripes and what not) before there were appliques in every store.</li>
            <li>So I dug out a similar power cord that did fit into the light, unfortunately this also did not work.  </li>
            <li>Also, the dc cord that came in the box is too small for the pin of the light...</li>
            <li>and she really loves the gel as she does not have to do her nails every few days, more like every few weeks now.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical about buying my own system, and after reading countless reviews, I decided I definitely wanted an LED light (rather than UV).  </li>
            <li>While setting this up I realized that the power cord does not fit into the light, its too big!!  </li>
            <li>After several days of intense research I decided on The Red Carpet kit.  </li>
            <li>Altough my first attempt was pretty thick</li>
            <li>thing I will say though is there is a major inconsistency in price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this kit before spending a lot of money on any of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>general</li>
            <li>My first time around was a bit rough but last time I painted both my nails and toe nails in 30 minutes and they look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>The polishes are in a very small bottle and the UV light is too small to fit your entire hand.</li>
            <li>The polish is quick to put on (compared to regular polish that has to dry between each coat) and last TWO weeks (where as I couldn&#x27;t get regular polish to last 2 days).</li>
            <li>Some people complain that it chips or peels and it has done that to me once because I didn&#x27;t apply it properly due to being lazy and thinking that it would be okay.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed in the least.</li>
            <li>My nail polish would dry hard after last step using the Brilliance top coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came with Red Carpet Red (obviously), so I bought white as well and went with the classic French tips.</li>
            <li>It didnt take near as long as I thought it would, it does take some time to keep it off the skin.  </li>
            <li>It takes the first time to learn how to apply not so heavy, and she has it mastered.</li>
            <li>I used to polish my nails and then sit on the couch waiting for them to dry, thinking about all the things I&#x27;d rather be doing and how nail polish was clearly a tool of the patriarchy.</li>
            <li>I was going to go to a salon this weekend, but I really didn&#x27;t feel like laying down the cash for something that I was going to have to go back for repeatedly...</li>
            <li>I usually discover tiny chips in the polish on my right hand after about a week.</li>
            <li>I usually discover tiny chips in the polish on my right hand after about a week.</li>
            <li>After reading tons of reviews I had no idea what I was getting into, but now that I got it home and tried it for myself I have to admit this little kit really rocks.</li>
            <li>they last at least two weeks for me and even more, if I don&#x27;t mind a little wear showing after that, but I usually change it after two weeks, so I am not bored with the same color.</li>

            <li> Everything is included for you to do your own at home gel polish.</li>
            <li> MY AUNT BOUGHT HER OWN GEL NAIL KIT</li>
            <li> I do not think it is recommended anymore, but I kind of do this; I just do a three step buff, with a $2.00 drug store nail</li>
            <li> I liked the packaging</li>
            <li> We are all loving it.</li>
            <li> It takes some time and patience to do, so don&#x27;t order this if you aren&#x27;t blessed with time or patience for this kind of thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handy (pun intended?</li>
            <li> Aparently, b/c this item has hazardous materials, Amazon will not replace or refund me for it.  </li>
            <li> This kit has enabled me to do my own gel nails with salon quality look and staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve preferred white...but honestly that&#x27;s just me being picky...</li>
            <li> Nonreturnable because it is considered hazardous material.  </li>
            <li> and they turn out just as nice as the salons.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND for beautiful nails!</li>
            <li> Great kit for the holidays to someone special to you.</li>
            <li> Then I seal it all with a full coat of Brilliance (the top coat) and I am good for another week or so!</li>
            <li> Then I seal it all with a full coat of Brilliance (the top coat) and I am good for another week or so!</li>
            <li> To remove the gel polishes, there is a great tool  that quickly removed the softened polish.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Kit is VERY easy to use if you have experience with Gel</li>
            <li> very easy to follow instructions and use.  </li>
            <li> They turned out great the very first time I did them.  </li>
            <li> The nail polish just dripped right off!!!</li>
            <li> She has used it once so far and said it did a great job of drying the shellac polish!  </li>
            <li> Though not truly a professional kit, it produces excellent results.</li>
            <li> Now I am able to do my own no chip manicure at home.</li>
            <li> If it does then the polish is more apt to come off sooner.</li>
            <li> and it fixed it perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It looks beautiful and I don&#x27;t have to spend much at all!</li>
            <li> So, I was very excited to get my own kit.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> The light works great and isn&#x27;t cheaply made or flimsy.</li>
            <li> Not only can I take off my own polish (which can range from 8-12 dollars at the salon...and the bottle to do it at home is under $7), but the convenience of sitting at home with a coffee and music while doing my nails is priceless!  </li>
            <li> Great for first day....</li>
            <li> The review from Ereader in Pleaston,CA is very accurate.</li>
            <li> Every step is very important.</li>
            <li> The prep cleanser is just rubbing alcohol which is also very cheap at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> This kit works great, is easy to use, and the result is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind, if you are not that good at painting your own finger nails, it will not magically make you better, but the quality of the equipment is awesome.</li>
            <li> You have to use 2 coats of the color to make sure there is no bleeding through.  </li>
            <li> then again the salon does it faster and better</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Regular polish always chips for me within a day, but I was really impressed with gel polish.</li>
            <li> I am learning more each time I do it.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was packaged with more care.</li>
            <li> PEDIS AND 10 MORE FOR THE MANIS.  </li>
            <li> I love the set and the LED dryer</li>
            <li> after many research.. please use sun block on your hands.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments from people!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHERS FOR SURE.</li>
            <li> There are only 3 LED&#x27;s in this lamp, I was concerned, before I bought it, but it cures perfectly and in 30 to 45 seconds per layer.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you this is the best one to get if you are just starting out.</li>
            <li> Contains most of the things you need both to put LED UV polish on and to take it off.  </li>
            <li> I suggest doing it once a week after they get a bit more grown out</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments on my nails</li>
            <li> Make sure you buff your nails, and do not paint the product on your skin.</li>
            <li> I was spending $30 plus tip on top for a no chip manicure until I found this kit.</li>
            <li> i was able to become quicker at it.</li>
            <li> i love it..............</li>
            <li> The 45 second lamp is great!</li>
            <li> I had sooo many compliments on them, and when they hear I did it myself, they wanna know what I used</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> The colors tend to be more transparent than the color they appear to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But most of the time they don&#x27;t I just don&#x27;t like the &#x27;grown out&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It works but dries out my fingers and cuticles more than I would like</li>
            <li> Great product I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Better than any manicure I&#x27;ve paid for.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get some more colors and get all festive and junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will have more than paid for itself in two &#x27;visits.&#x27;</li>
            <li> (interesting as they were the ones to ship it out to me).  </li>
            <li> : The quality is excellent as the color lasts me a solid two weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this manicure kit</li>
            <li> : I watched a lot of youtube videos to get a better idea about how to use this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, love it and will save a TON of money.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I bought, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is much better than OPI&#x27;s $17 each.</li>
            <li> I love the turnout, i would give it 5/5 stars</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and watched a couple of YouTube videos to make sure I applied the gel correctly.  </li>
            <li> I just repainted color on the two nails, cured, and repainted top coat, cured, and used Purify</li>
            <li> The OPI polish on top of the gel lasted for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND SAID THEY ARE BETTER LOOKING NOW</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> thought is came with more.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> but can be a better value elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Hope you find this review helpful and enjoy your nail designs! :)</li>
            <li> Red Carpet was the cheapest of all of them and Amazon has the best price by</li>
            <li> Ok as a starter kit</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;re better off buying components seperate.</li>
            <li> so far so good!  </li>
            <li> They could look better, but that&#x27;s only because I am out of practice and didn&#x27;t use any guides, but, aside from my own lack of expertise in this area, I am as happy as I could be, and I will get better with practice.</li>
            <li> The one included chips a lot more easily than gel should.</li>
            <li> Very clean and easy to use...</li>
            <li> very cool is that you can do the uv with your computer, so you dont have to move on a place with electricity............</li>
            <li> FOR THE POLISH TO DRY... LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 2: The SensatioNAIL gel polish system is wonderful too[[ASIN:B0087P9PB0 sensationail by nailene starter kit in pink chiffon]].</li>
            <li> Her nails always look fabulous :)</li>
            <li> A note to users: you can easily patch a nail and it looks 80-100% like the original job, so touchup is easy!  </li>
            <li> So far everything is going great.</li>
            <li> 10 days is awesome though compared to other polish</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t do all fingers at once finish four, then finish the thumbs, then finish the other four I found this to be the best plan.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect for a new &amp; busy mom. :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li> Easy to use if you read and follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy instructions, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The gel manicure lasts two weeks, easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> but the gel peels off so easy.  </li>
            <li> Just follow the kit directions for any easy manicure.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> The cord could be easily purchased but we had two batteries on hand to use</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> So easy for her to use.</li>
            <li> My first manicure turned out great and lasted 4 weeks before I got the first chip on one nail.  </li>
            <li> Removal using this method was easy and did not damage the nails</li>
            <li> ITS AN EASY KIT TO USE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li> A good manicure will make them look more professional....</li>
            <li> My nails are as strong with a gel manicure as they were when I used to have them wrapped.</li>
            <li> When I remove this product, my nails are still as strong as they were before the product was put on.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly in a shrink wrapped box with a strong gel polish coming from the box.</li>
            <li> You get professional quality nails in the comfort of your own home!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and quick too!  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have beautiful nails that last 2+ weeks!</li>
            <li> and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to try just backfilling since the company says that is fine and that you just have to go through the steps</li>
            <li> and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty good at painting my own nails so this was not very hard for me.  </li>
            <li> and she loves the product very much and has told everyone about it !!</li>
            <li> After a little practice, works awesome!  </li>
            <li> The remover is just acetone which you can buy at target for $4 for a HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li> but now the light won&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> and it will not cure until you put your nails under the LED light dryer.  </li>
            <li> That is because there is a built in timer in the light to keep it on either 30 or 45 seconds-according to the instruction manual.  </li>
            <li> EVEN MORE FUN WITHOUT THE WAIT OF 30  MIN</li>
            <li> These just take seconds to do, but are important to remove oils so the polish sticks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Short Description: LED ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT KIT WITH ESSENTIALS FOR GEL COATING.&lt;br /&gt;Visual</li>
            <li> I do wish the light fit all 5 fingers</li>
            <li> Such a great buy.</li>
            <li> love it, worth the money and time.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was the quality of the polish or the light?</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy I upgraded to the 45 second lamp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit, used it about 10 times, and the LED light quit working.</li>
            <li> When you are wiping them with &#x27;purify&#x27; you have to keep rubbing it until it literally squeaks which tells you it&#x27;s smooth &amp; no longer tacky.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fabulous</li>
            <li> The gel/polish spilled all over the LED light structure.</li>
            <li> so you can do this by your computer instead on the floor or somewhere not so comfortable.</li>
            <li> I think that the light was damaged in some way.  </li>
            <li> LED light (</li>
            <li> Power for the LED Light:</li>
            <li> My kit came with the portable LED light and did not come with batteries or power cord to power the lights.</li>
            <li> portable light</li>
            <li> if someone else does it for you, finish is completely smooth though</li>
            <li> THE LED LIGHT WOULD STING MY FINGER</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit at Ulta and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have tried Sally Hansen, and this is a far superior product.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s time for a touch up just buff them and add another manicure right on top.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s time for a touch up just buff them and add another manicure right on top.</li>
            <li> just right maybe i need to practice more.</li>
            <li> The manicure kit allowed for a pretty manicure with a very smooth glossy finish.</li>
            <li> The product itself arrived quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> For your first time I recommend getting a light color, it&#x27;s more forgiving.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not crazy pricey compared to a good normal polish from Essie or OPI.</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> No more having a perfect manicure for all of 5 hours until they chip when I do dishes or wash my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more having a perfect manicure for all of 5 hours until they chip when I do dishes or wash my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited when I could just do clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And now I&#x27;m actually *excited</li>
            <li> I am extremely excited about this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so excited about this product and would recommend it everyone.  </li>
            <li> have found that I need to make sure I have a good 20 minutes or so to do all the steps properly on both hands, and to make sure that I don&#x27;t rush, and that I have a steady hand.</li>
            <li> I clean the brush on gauze or a paper towel to minimize contaminating the clean-up solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just something so elegant about a nice french manicure.</li>
            <li> Okay, so far I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I orderd this through Amazon.com because this product qualified for free super saver shipping.  </li>
            <li> The pre/post clean is just alcohol.</li>
            <li> Very professional looking manicure at a nice price.</li>
            <li> The instructions are very simple and straight forward which is great and easy.</li>
            <li> One thing that you really need to watch for is clean your hands thoroughly and make sure you do each step as described, or else your nail polish will start peeling.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get off, I had the best luck soaking my nails in a bowl of  polish remover for about 10 minutes, then using a orange stick to scrap it</li>
            <li> Otherwise, expect the color to peel within a week (which is fine by me for the right color).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for how long it lasts (I just tried it today) but it looks amazing!</li>
            <li> One reason why I like thos product so much is that in a short amount of time I have beautiful looking nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The item arrived one day later from the estimated arrival day but in good condition.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it takes forever to remove nail polish, but it may be a good thing.</li>
            <li> Works very well, and came with a free polish!</li>
            <li> They lasted a full 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, I would not pay full price for this system, if you can find it 1/2 price</li>
            <li> I got for her birthday after she borrowed same unit from a friend and loved it.</li>
            <li> I used gelish nail polish and it works just as good as the red carpet manicure brand!</li>
            <li> : I can&#x27;t say enough about how gorgeous this kit makes my nails look.</li>
            <li> might as well just use regular good quality polish.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had nice nails unless I went to get them professionally done....</li>
            <li> Lasts about 10 days, more if your hands aren&#x27;t in much water.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t look as good but same quality.</li>
            <li> but I make sure I apply my prep &amp; structure very well.</li>
            <li> The light isn’t as strong, so if you have a plug or a certain USB that works faster than others use that one.</li>
            <li> A+ shopping experience; top quality product; super fast service.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and saves so much money!  </li>
            <li> (their old) instructions recommend roughing up the top surface of the nail, with a fine emery board.</li>
            <li> The light color (camera shy) in the kit is very light, pretty much a sheer color - perfect for me as I am in the Army and can&#x27;t wear bright colors.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was delivered on time and the kit works great.</li>
            <li> Used also with other gel polishes with great success!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> What I wasn&#x27;t impressed with was the job the manicurist did - my nails were very splotchy and uneven, with hard-as-rock drips in places.</li>
            <li> This light works far better than the portable version, and I like the auto shut off -so</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> For less than 1 month worth of gel manis you can own your own kit &amp; do it yourself at home.</li>
            <li> The button which turns the lamp/timer on and off stopped working and the light was significantly more dim than it had been.</li>
            <li> but luckily I got my kit at Ulta</li>
            <li> but luckily I got my kit at Ulta</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks, I ended up painting two coats of OPI color and OPI top coat on top of the gel in order to hide the nail growth and because I felt like using a different color.  </li>
            <li> and I am actually okay with that since it is still better than regular nail polish and cheaper than going to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took me a couple tries to make sure the nail was clean of cotton fiber (if you use cotton balls), to perfect my strokes with the brush , and to get the dry time right.</li>
            <li> and  are highly recommended but cost much more.  </li>
            <li> It takes all of about 15-20 minutes and you are out the door - no dry time - I love it!</li>
            <li> First day out with my new manicure 3 people commented on how nice my nails looked.  </li>
            <li> Is easy to use even if you are not a professional you can use and will have nice results.</li>
            <li> The first week of May I attempted to do my nails and two of the three bulbs would not come on in the led light.</li>
            <li> Dark colors take 4 coats but look great.</li>
            <li> The light kinda feels like it burns your hands at first too.</li>
            <li> It stays shiny and strong for a whole week.</li>
            <li> VERY GLOSSY NAILS  and quite strong too.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if you can give yourself an okay manicure with regular polish, you can do this and get long lasting beautiful results.</li>
            <li> but I also know that just painting my nails doesn&#x27;t really work anymore because it chips off too easily</li>
            <li> Fast and easy</li>
            <li> Amazon did fully refund my money since it was sold through Amazon and thanks to Amazon for making it a easy return.</li>
            <li> (The first three manicures taught me this!).  </li>
            <li> I also purchased Red Carpet Manicure Gems and Jewels and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I find these micro layers work best and unlike regular polish all dry &amp; cure</li>
            <li> The kit travels nicely and when we are on vacation for 3-4 weeks I can  touch up or back fill quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little gel kit for 1st time users.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all my friends, family and total strangers who ask how my nails look so nice!</li>
            <li> Haha) that the LED light automatically shuts off at 45 seconds.</li>
            <li> totally worth the effort and initial expense as I will save lots of money and have amazing looking nails</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have done 3 manicures with it so far and trust me when I say that you will get better in time.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was kind enough to do a price adjustment since it hadn&#x27;t shipped yet.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Better distribution, available at local stores, Walmarts &amp; CVS/Longs drug stores in my area carry it).</li>
            <li> You do want to take it off prior to putting it under the magical blue light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good product.</li>
            <li> I love gel manicures and used to frequent a salon on a twice-monthly basis to have my nails done.</li>
            <li> product is TOTALLY worth the money.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the kit because paying at the salon was becoming too much</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s always fun</li>
            <li> There are others kits that offere a more professional approach</li>
            <li> (but again was time consuming but worth it for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving all my extra money!!!!</li>
            <li> As long as you have a steady hand, you will love this product!!</li>
            <li> It was quite easy to learn how to use this and the results are very professional looking!</li>
            <li> other than that, super easy!!</li>
            <li> I was so impressed I bought 2 other shades made by Red Carpet.  </li>
            <li> (if you get the right person).</li>
            <li> You need to follow every step by step to get this right or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m right handed, so</li>
            <li> In fact, my daughter does her own nails and gets a better result than she sometimes has in the past at the salon.  </li>
            <li> instructions are very clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> process was so simple and the instructions were very easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> This kit has been used heavily for nearly a year now and the light still works great.  </li>
            <li> So I stuck them back under the light for another 45 second session, wiped them again with &#x27;purify&#x27; &amp; I was good.</li>
            <li> Reallllly bright, I usually try to use sun block on my hands and throw a little washcloth over it as it&#x27;s curing so that I&#x27;m not blinded by the bright light.</li>
            <li> but I should have paid a little more and purchased better quality</li>
            <li> The manicures are long lasting and the results are beautiful.</li>
            <li> It is very reasonable price and dramatically saves time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And make sure they cover each other evenly and that the light hits all parts of the nail.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this before buying it and was still a little worried, even though the majority of the reviews were good.</li>
            <li> Having this kit has saved me so much money, not to mention all the compliments I have gotten from people asking me where I get my nails done!</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME TOOK ME 10 MIN TO DO MY DAUGHTERS</li>
            <li> I love all the variety of colors Red Carpet has.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> I love my red carpet nail polish!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> First..</li>
            <li> pretty nails.  </li>
            <li> I found it much cheaper here on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> They do not get hot.</li>
            <li> I am going to save so much money!</li>
            <li> they have been lasting longer and they to not chip for the most part.</li>
            <li> The polishes last a long time and look really great.</li>
            <li> This kit saves me soo much time and money!  </li>
            <li> A real money saver!</li>
            <li> I love the Red Carpet Manicure Starter Kit!!  </li>
            <li> The end result is great though, and this has paid for itself when I think about how much I would&#x27;ve spent by now on professional manicures.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was just me and</li>
            <li> I love Red Carpet Manicure!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with nail shellac.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE french manicures with the kit!</li>
            <li> LOVE MY RED CARPET MANICURE PRO KIT.</li>
            <li> LOVE MY RED CARPET MANICURE PRO KIT.</li>
            <li> This kit is everything you need to make those pretty gel nails.</li>
            <li> Great price for everything that comes in the kit, and the polish is a deep red and very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Purchased it a while ago, just got around to using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I always do my thumbs first, start to finish, then each hand seperatly, start to finish.  </li>
            <li> Hoping I get better help from the manufacturer - still waiting to hear back from their customer service.</li>
            <li> Pays for itself in first use.</li>
            <li> really!  </li>
            <li> but I would rather have more colors and rebuy one that I use a lot than only have 2 or 3 from OPI.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did my first manicur in &amp;#34;Candid Moment&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the better vendors.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and tips exactly</li>
            <li> It is a sophisticated red with a pretty shimmer.  </li>
            <li> Shell out the money now...and SAVE in the future! :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to regular ole nail polish application this will save you time...if you are accustomed to putting on more than one coat of polish.  </li>
            <li> My polish lasts about 3 wks just for the simple fact that I&#x27;ve never had a color on for more than 3 wks.</li>
            <li> I am ashamed of how much money I used to spend on getting my nails done!</li>
            <li> She has used it a few times and her nail looks good.</li>
            <li> OR my new trick of just buffing the surface of the nail and painting over it again paying special attention to the chipped region.</li>
            <li> OR my new trick of just buffing the surface of the nail and painting over it again paying special attention to the chipped region.</li>
            <li> I am glad I used a light color for my first try because I notice little mistakes I made, but they are not noticible to everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The light is really handy and works very well I especially like the 45 second timer</li>
            <li> Long lasting, easy to apply, and easy to remove!  </li>
            <li> I bought the pro kit with plug in LED light (the more expensive kit offers a better quality light than the starter with much quicker curing time.)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t return this product due to hazardous materials, but thanks Amazon for giving me a refund on this item.  </li>
            <li> : It requires longer curing times than the professional light and can only fit four fingers at a time requiring me to do 3 separate curing phases for each step of the process.</li>
            <li> I can go longer but do not like the grow-out pattern; I can and do put regular nail polish (clear top coat on top) to put a freshen tip to cuticle shine on about a week in; regular polish stays on so long on top of this stuff.</li>
            <li> and then the four left fingers completely from prep to top coat before doing my right hand.  </li>
            <li> The polish with the kit is a nice red and everything else works as it is supposed to just make sure you use thin coats and use the UV light between</li>
            <li> Love the Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 Starter Kit, highly recommend it for anyone not wanting to spend $60 every time to get their nails done at a salon.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and lasting!</li>
            <li> ITS VERY SIMPLE AND EASY.  </li>
            <li> By then my nails had grown and it was time to be redone, and again such an easy process.  </li>
            <li> first noticed that that cord did not even fit properly in the lamp.</li>
            <li> My nails would be like paper when the wraps were removed and took about a year to grow back strong.  </li>
            <li> As long as you only put two coats of color on, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> removal with pure acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with large hands.</li>
            <li> The first couple times I did it, being a newbie it took me a good couple hours because you have to be careful not to get the stuff on your skin or it will make the entire nail peal off.</li>
            <li> The first few times of doing my own nails did not turn out very well.  </li>
            <li> So happy I decided to buy it on Black Friday when it was only 39.99!  </li>
            <li> I would say the light may be worth your money, it is nice that the polish dry&#x27;s hard and super fast.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best purchase I have made in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled as I&#x27;m not exactly rich but really wanted this.</li>
            <li> It is hard to give a good rating for something that lasted 4 times.  </li>
            <li> In conclusion, this kit worksexactly as stated and the additional polishes are much cheaper than competitor brands.</li>
            <li> The lamp is 6 watts and uses LED Ultra Violet (UV) lights and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> but my uv light worked for only a week and then broke</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to replace supplies but are all available either locally or on amazon.</li>
            <li> so you are ready for the process when it does arrive.  </li>
            <li> i dont must go to the nail center and stay more then 1 houer.</li>
            <li> so it is very misleading.</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Up date, after using this product a few more times and tweaking my technique,I still have not gotten my manicure to last any more the 4 or 5 days, not the 2 weeks as they claim.</li>
            <li> and RCM has really helped my nails grow longer.  </li>
            <li> (very annoying).&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> It pays for itself after a couple of uses, I would highly recommend (and I did!)</li>
            <li> I got this item and same as everyone else it had leaked inside the pacakge and was all over the light.  </li>
            <li> The prep one was broke when I got it, but the others work really well.</li>
            <li> very fussy to use....</li>
            <li> The UV light is spacious enough for 4 fingers/hand (do thumbs separately) and 5 toes and has a built in timer.  </li>
            <li> Two thin coats gave great coverage.  </li>
            <li> If you like having a gel manicure, but do not want to pay for the salon, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product and that&#x27;s coming from someone who is very picky.</li>
            <li> very professional.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color (red) polish that is supplied is a nice red.  </li>
            <li> so I might also purchase a better LED lamp in the near future.  </li>
            <li> Thin coats are key and try not to go all the way to your nail bed for best adhesion.  </li>
            <li> some of the negative reviews worry you, just know that if you follow the directions (which also means purchasing any needed supplies that don&#x27;t come with the kit, like lint-free nail pads and a really good buffer), you will &amp;#34;love&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m in a job now where I have occasion to meet vendors, etc, and I need to look more professional on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> The products are unique and go on a little different from regular nail polish or acrylics; so each time you do it, you&#x27;ll probably get better and better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I repaired both chips with the original products for each hand and it was freaky; both hands still experienced the exact same wear (I am ambidextrous, so my nails usually wear the same, but I did not expect it in this case with</li>
            <li> Im no professional, but this was so easy.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit more time consuming but it is so much easier not smudging one hand while working on the other.</li>
            <li> (I have also used this for traditional nail polish and it significantly shortens that drying process</li>
            <li> I am so excited to finally have an at home gel mani kit.</li>
            <li> im not sure, but aside from that i love it!</li>
            <li> SURE YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS VERY CAREFULLY</li>
            <li> &quot; is the same prep and clean dehydrant you can buy at Ulta or Sally&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> I also use this brush to clean up the French manicure, to get clean lines on the white polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful to let the regular polish dry for a bit before the top coat</li>
            <li> This kit is easy to use, although the process of doing your own gel manicure is a bit tedious and time consuming.</li>
            <li> This one is a bright red polish with red glitter pieces suspended in the red.  </li>
            <li> Red Carpet colors are very light, they require multiple coats which can be time</li>
            <li> Soo easy for the at home manicure and inexperienced person.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that some of the colors for sale are too sheer which means you end up putting too many coats on causing it to peel.</li>
            <li> three different times with different colors and love it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to open the colors to know what they actually look</li>
            <li> Decent product</li>
            <li> The only thing I need to do is give my cuticles more attention before starting my nails.  </li>
            <li> It turned out very pretty (especially since I chose it for Christmas week)</li>
            <li> I finally buckled down and bought this last month, and I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> HIGH GLOSS &#x3D;</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anybody</li>
            <li> This kit too had high reviews and includes everything you will need.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this system.  </li>
            <li> She initially wasn&#x27;t very impressed due to the small size, and we contemplated returning it.</li>
            <li> Oh and I love the little train case it comes with.</li>
            <li> One would think that splurging for the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; set would give you a light big enough for your whole hand, but its not the end of the world.</li>
            <li> So far I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> If applied correctly (the key is to apply very sparingly!), it lasts for around 2 weeks and looks exactly like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> For the price, it should throw in a few more colors.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind being patient for a few minutes and you want to save tons of money by being able to do this at home instead of going to a salon, then I suggest you buy this kit.</li>
            <li> I definitely got the right one and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> have used other gel nail colors with this product and it has worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used three different color so far and am extraordinarily happen with the results.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li> Then 2 to 3 light coats of white (White Hot) on the nail tips (until I get the white color opaqueness I like), cure each white coat for 45 seconds, then the top coat (Brilliance) and the last cure for 45 seconds.</li>
            <li> when I painted my right hand and then did the final step Purify, I messed up two of the nails somewhere in the process but didn&#x27;t realize until I wiped them at the end.  </li>
            <li> They have grown super long and are the strongest they have been.  </li>
            <li> It is a very light, sheer pink.</li>
            <li> but after using this polish for a month they have grown out and are actually looking decent for the first time in a lot of years.</li>
            <li> I also use the light on other polishes that need to &#x27;cure&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is annoying and will most likely cause me to purchase a professional LED light that can fit an entire hand and will cure more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that may be I am a little more sensitive than some.</li>
            <li> but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> They switched my lamp, no questions asked for a brand new one</li>
            <li> They switched my lamp, no questions asked for a brand new one</li>
            <li> She plans on trying lots of new colors.  </li>
            <li> so that may be the test so far after 5 days of wear it still looks salon new!</li>
            <li> Easy, though slightly time consuming.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would add to this package is to buy the protective white gloves for when you have your hands under the LED light.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it just 4 stars is because you can only fit your fingers in, you have to do your thumb seperately</li>
            <li> This sure beats the 90 dollars at the nail salon I was spending for acrylics, and my nails are much healthier, and I can do this at home, anytime (usually late at night while listening to the news).  </li>
            <li> Essentially, the edges have to be smooth to stick properly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t as happy with 133 Only in Hollywood just because it took three thin coats (and probably could have used a 4th</li>
            <li> This leaves the polishes (only red color in lit) and UV light.</li>
            <li> I got my first gel manicure just recently, when I was going to an event.</li>
            <li> I did my first gel manicure last night.  </li>
            <li> I bought this first for $79, then saw that it went on sale for $69 two days later.  </li>
            <li> : I bought this exact same system months ago at Ulta.</li>
            <li> The results were NOT as stellar as Red Carpet&#x27;s polish.  </li>
            <li> I apply a french manicure, then a week or 10 days later I do some buffing, touching up, and a back fill which takes about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I painted my left thumb first</li>
            <li> AND WOW!</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions carefully if you want the true salon look.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They look great for usually two weeks (and I take long hot baths every other day)!</li>
            <li> Also the LED light is an improvement over UV lights and takes much less time to cure between applications.</li>
            <li> Red Carpet Reddy (a true Red polish)&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> I read the directions carefully, followed them to the T and my very first home gel manicure</li>
            <li> Not sure, but IMO it wasn&#x27;t worth it to take a chance in case something isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> It was hard, made my nails stronger (while applied - they were weaker and more brittle once I took the polish off, but that&#x27;s also true of regular nail polish for me) and lasted a week before starting to peel.</li>
            <li> it is not difficult to do, of course the first time it is not perfect, but i must say i learnd very quick..................</li>
            <li> I did find the LED light in this package a little stronger than the one at the nail salon</li>
            <li> I was a little worried by the fact that sometimes my fingers burned when I put them under the uv light.</li>
            <li> more thing to note is that the nails colors are a little deceiving from the outside of the bottle.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have the other version this cures my nails in a quick amount time and couldn&#x27;t image waiting 2 mintues for my nails to cure each time.</li>
            <li> Comes with a bottle of removed (100% acetone nail polish removed), a bottle of &amp;#34;purify&amp;#34; (isopropyl alcohol - just use some rubbing alcohol when it runs out), a bright red gel polish, a gel base coat, a gel top coat, some cuticle oil, a little prep bottle, and of course the UV light.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be daunted or scared at doing it alone, these instructions are really simple, clear and laid out so that you absolutely understand each step and what to do.</li>
            <li> Came with everything I needed and clear instructions.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this Red Carpet Kit.</li>
            <li> I was really suprised that my manicure was lasting three weeks at a time with NO peeling or color issues.</li>
            <li> Also do one hand at a time, go through 4 fingers, complete them and then do thumbs.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this kit early April and never got a chance to use it.</li>
            <li> If there is too much liquid, knock it off back into the bottle.</li>
            <li> ★Option to use USB or directly into outlet..</li>
            <li> : None so far, if anything come up I will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Follow all directions as listed in the instruction booklet and your manicure will come out looking professional.</li>
            <li> One other thing I found out is that you can add other polish (non gel) on top and take it off normally</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had gel nails done at a professional nail salon and that has never happened.</li>
            <li> I have only had it on for a few hours, but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> but it does take me several hours (2) to do whole manicure.</li>
            <li> Professional OR portable-</li>
            <li> My kit came with a portable, but the kit appears to have been upgraded to now include the professional light)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> light is only big enough for 4 fingers.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and you will have professional looking nails without the expense of the salon.</li>
            <li> The two nails that I messed up on and fixed weren&#x27;t even the one that chipped after 4 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only unwrap the nail that you are ready to scrape so</li>
            <li> have used two polishes so far.  </li>
            <li> Seems minor, but it really is a big time saver (two kids, a hubby, dog and full time</li>
            <li> Also I recommend purchasing this at ULTA using their weekly coupons (sometimes 20% off, other times $10 or $3.50 off) because they allow you to return this product within 60 days at full refund, if you didn&#x27;t find it useful or for any other reasons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rough on my nails, but it lasted easily a week without chipping, two weeks with minor chips + beginning to outgrow.  </li>
            <li> it is the same price without the coupons as other top brands such as OPI and Essie.</li>
            <li> coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who say it doesn&#x27;t work are not really doing it right.  </li>
            <li> Using the RedCarpet LED light I put SensatioNail on one hand and RedCarpet on the other (I do French manicures, so</li>
            <li> My right hand polish has only been lasting about 10 days and the left hand a lot longer since I don&#x27;t use it as my main hand.</li>
            <li> The gel product goes on like a very thick nail polish and is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> They look the same to me and last/wear the exact same on my nails.</li>
            <li> I used it not less than 3 minutes ago.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought it at Ulta and paid double the price I paid for the exact same kit!!</li>
            <li> I use other brands of polish for other colors , they need to make more color choices.</li>
            <li> Sure the polish might seem a little thicker then a single manicure</li>
            <li> Sure the polish might seem a little thicker then a single manicure</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all my friends, family and total strangers who ask how my nails look so nice!persevered.</li>
            <li> used to paint my nails all the time in high school and younger; used to like to do designs (stripes and what not) before there were appliques in every store.</li>
            <li> So I dug out a similar power cord that did fit into the light, unfortunately this also did not work.  </li>
            <li> Also, the dc cord that came in the box is too small for the pin of the light...</li>
            <li> and she really loves the gel as she does not have to do her nails every few days, more like every few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying my own system, and after reading countless reviews, I decided I definitely wanted an LED light (rather than UV).  </li>
            <li> While setting this up I realized that the power cord does not fit into the light, its too big!!  </li>
            <li> After several days of intense research I decided on The Red Carpet kit.  </li>
            <li> Altough my first attempt was pretty thick</li>
            <li> thing I will say though is there is a major inconsistency in price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing this kit before spending a lot of money on any of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> general</li>
            <li> My first time around was a bit rough but last time I painted both my nails and toe nails in 30 minutes and they look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> The polishes are in a very small bottle and the UV light is too small to fit your entire hand.</li>
            <li> The polish is quick to put on (compared to regular polish that has to dry between each coat) and last TWO weeks (where as I couldn&#x27;t get regular polish to last 2 days).</li>
            <li> Some people complain that it chips or peels and it has done that to me once because I didn&#x27;t apply it properly due to being lazy and thinking that it would be okay.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed in the least.</li>
            <li> My nail polish would dry hard after last step using the Brilliance top coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came with Red Carpet Red (obviously), so I bought white as well and went with the classic French tips.</li>
            <li> It didnt take near as long as I thought it would, it does take some time to keep it off the skin.  </li>
            <li> It takes the first time to learn how to apply not so heavy, and she has it mastered.</li>
            <li> I used to polish my nails and then sit on the couch waiting for them to dry, thinking about all the things I&#x27;d rather be doing and how nail polish was clearly a tool of the patriarchy.</li>
            <li> I was going to go to a salon this weekend, but I really didn&#x27;t feel like laying down the cash for something that I was going to have to go back for repeatedly...</li>
            <li> I usually discover tiny chips in the polish on my right hand after about a week.</li>
            <li> I usually discover tiny chips in the polish on my right hand after about a week.</li>
            <li> After reading tons of reviews I had no idea what I was getting into, but now that I got it home and tried it for myself I have to admit this little kit really rocks.</li>
            <li> they last at least two weeks for me and even more, if I don&#x27;t mind a little wear showing after that, but I usually change it after two weeks, so I am not bored with the same color.</li>
            <li> key is to put on very thin coats, their WEB sites recommends knocking all polish off the brush back into the top neck of the bottle until it looks like there is no longer any polish on the brush; then brush on nail.</li>
            <li> : Clean up around the nail with a short, narrow firm acrylic-bristled brush (I got mine for about $3 at a craft store).</li>
            <li> Polish is a little thick, didn&#x27;t dry completely, better</li>
            <li> It only needs to take like ten minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> and I *really* don&#x27;t have the time to reapply every few days, and have to wait for it to dry without being productive</li>
            <li> Cannot your gel because the light is not strong enough nail polishes are really weak and the whole kit is not worth the price</li>
            <li> but if it doesn&#x27;t, I will at least first try to determine if it was &#x27;user error.</li>
            <li> My biggest challenge is waiting out the manicure to see how long the results will last because I want to change the color.  </li>
            <li> The LED&#x27;s last a long time.</li>
            <li> I will report back with how long it lasted.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last as long as it should and my excitement will remain intact...</li>
            <li> The gel is not completely cured/set until you finish the final step</li>
            <li> It takes AT LEAST a week before my nails start to show any kind of wear (i am very hard on my hands and nails).</li>
            <li> If you are not familiar with the process, go visit a salon and have a gel manicure applied to your nails professionally, then after two weeks, when it begins to chip, go back and have them remove the manicure so that you see how that is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to with the removal and making sure the layers are thin.</li>
            <li> A full manicure with removal and a polish change usually takes a little over an hour.</li>
            <li> A full manicure with removal and a polish change usually takes a little over an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided it may not be necessary to remove it since it seems like that process is kind of bad for my nails</li>
            <li> and if it was poorly applied, at least it would be my own fault.</li>
            <li> : On one of your layers and again on the top coat, make sure you get a slight amount of polish along the actual tip of the nails, they call this \\&quot;sealing\\&quot; the nail, this prevents water from getting under the polish from the tips and getting those horrible chips.</li>
            <li> polish is probably not for the person who wants to change their color everyday since the whole process of taking it off and putting it on takes at least an hour, but at the end of that time it is completely dry and never do you get issues with it being tacky</li>
            <li> how difficult or easy it is to remove.</li>
            <li> Be careful though because a lot of the colors actually look NOTHING like the color on the outside of the bottle</li>
            <li> The RCM gel polishes are a bit limited in terms of color choices but you can also use any LED gel polish from different brands.</li>
            <li> I will not be using any product other than Red Carpet polish in the future.]</li>
            <li> I spend about $40+ every other week at nail salon until recently when I discovered Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 Starter Kit.</li>
            <li> This kit is enough polish to last for lots and lots of uses for the little bottle of red polish you get.</li>
            <li> Flipped the light over to see if something was wrong and one of the lights is out.  </li>
            <li> and this manicure lasted as long as the Shellac brand.  </li>
            <li> Polish does not stay on long.</li>
            <li> She loves how long the polish lasts using this system.</li>
            <li> [BTW, Walgreen&#x27;s offers a money-back guarantee if you use a cosmetic product and then don&#x27;t like it, but I had misplaced the receipts.  </li>
            <li> but it lasts just as long</li>
            <li> the polish won’t stay on for long and chip away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten my nails professionally done like twice in my life, and, while it&#x27;s neat to have it done, I&#x27;ve never been one to keep up on that sort of thing, partially because of the cost, partially because of time (and frequency), and partially because I&#x27;m just not that high-maintenance.</li>
            <li> that saves you a lot of money in the long run from not having to go to a nail salon</li>
            <li> One of the bottles were open and empty.</li>
            <li> Three uses and you&#x27;ve basically made your money back that you would have spent at a nail salon.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t take long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for long term supplies get the components seperate.</li>
            <li> I like this because it makes the nails hard (i.e. impossible to bite) and also makes the nails look great...</li>
            <li> black, coral, white, red, fuchsia.</li>
            <li> I usually end up changing it after 2 weeks just because I want  new color.  </li>
            <li> It does not work well, does not dry, not worth a penny.</li>
            <li> I do the recommend prep, which is no different than any other nail polish or gel nail or acrylic set-up.</li>
            <li> You can use different gel colors from other companies as well.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Other polish lasts maybe one day for me but this stuff can last up to two weeks, though when you are in the growing out</li>
            <li> I just wish this &amp;#34;starter pack&amp;#34; came with some color other than red.</li>
            <li> We will see how long this manicure lasts!</li>
            <li> Mine dry with using the timer twice.</li>
            <li> My nails would dry faster if i put them in front of a fan.</li>
            <li> I get tired of seeing the same color for 2 weeks, and am ready to change the color</li>
            <li> I am a licensed professional and I rank this system with OPI and Creative Nail systems.  </li>
            <li> I have not yet gotten 2 weeks out of a single application.  </li>
            <li> Mind you, the RC polishes are pricey at $10 a bottle for a tiny bottle but as with all the RC items, a little bit goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> used a regular nail file to scuff the nails and super thin coats for base, color, and top.  </li>
            <li> I then noticed that one of of the lights was not working, so, I was only down to two lights.</li>
            <li> Currently the price posted is $109 which is a little absurd because you can get this kit at Target and Ulta for significantly cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new bee and may have applied the polish to thick.</li>
            <li> Why pay the crazy prices for a salon manicure when you can have the easy to use kit at home?</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all&lt;br /&gt;Polish never dries completely no matter how much u use the led light&lt;br /&gt;wish</li>
            <li> Every single negative review I&#x27;ve read describes issues that are a result of not following the instructions properly.</li>
            <li> So SesatioNAIL product results in much more even thin layers (thin is the goal here) with less effort at a similar price</li>
            <li> I never wear polish in general but in my job my nails were always breaking because they were so dried out due to alway being wet</li>
            <li> only thing is to watch out for the little bottles inside they may leak and damage the product&lt;br /&gt;other</li>
            <li> I packed it up and then decided to do my toes (also French tip), and this time it took a little over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why our nails wouldn&#x27;t dry with the other two lights working.  </li>
            <li> Plus it makes your nails hard if they are soft.</li>
            <li> (I usually run the brush lightly along the tip, then brush the layer of polish along the nail tops as usual, so I do not get a thick ridge-like</li>
            <li> Just file the surface of the polish with a coarse metal file, dip a round cotton pad (cut into 4)  into remover, place on the nail and then wrap the fingertip in foil.  </li>
            <li> I opened the box - Prep polish bottle, Structure polish bottle and the Brilliance bottle was opened and completely empty.</li>
            <li> They are just like ones you get in a salon really no difference.</li>
            <li> I’ve heard of gel manicure benefits which made me curious about affordable DIY kits.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful who you purchase it from on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> If you buy a polish once a month, it&#x27;s roughly $144/yr.</li>
            <li> I just sandwiched the regular polish between the base and top coat.</li>
            <li> The only things you will ever need to buy again from RCM is the prep, base and top coat</li>
            <li> Also something I figure I&#x27;d share since I found it out the hard way...when you paint your nails, rather than starting with the brush by your cuticle, start in the middle of the nail, work your way down and then go back with the little bit of leftover polish on the brush and get by the cuticle.</li>
            <li> Items necessary for removal: (1) Cuticle pusher to help remove the polish; (2) Cotton to soak in acetone, (3) foil wraps (tin foil works fine) to wrap around acetone soaked</li>
            <li> Do NOT cure gel polish if there is any product on the skin, it can dry very hard, and irritate until it wears off; it can also pull up the polish on the nail and cause early chipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional gel manicures in the past, but didn&#x27;t like the way they dried my nails out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brand gels polishes with it</li>
            <li> The seller could/would not offer a refund or exchange due to the time limit.</li>
            <li> I usually have mine last for 1.5 to 2 weeks before I start to peel them off.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended it to me, and I recommended it to my other daughter.</li>
            <li> No more sitting around trying not to use my hands for hours while regular polish dries.</li>
            <li> No more sitting around trying not to use my hands for hours while regular polish dries.</li>
            <li> I have used Sally Hansen gel base and over coat which needs no light and have had better results with no chipping and pealing and the polish lasting close to over a week, but you do not get the shine that the gel has.</li>
            <li> Just remember to put each layer on thin not thick and follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li> money well spent!  </li>
            <li> , sometimes you can find the polishes for this on other sites for buy 1 get 1 50% off.</li>
            <li> Like with any other polish, some colors have a thicker consistency than others.</li>
            <li> plus I had to read the instructions very carefully and do everything step-by-step because I didn&#x27;t wantto risk messing anything up...</li>
            <li> : Ensure that you read the directions VERY CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li> lamps are fantastic and this is the least expensive I have found.</li>
            <li> My nails grow fairly fast so it is not practial for me to go get them done as I would have to go very often, and it gets very expensive!</li>
            <li> I would like my money back, at least the price to replace the machine itself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a French manicure fanatic, this is my routine:&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> The lamp can be used on feet if they are average women</li>
            <li> so I spend all day washing my hands and putting them in gloves the nail polish last for at least two weeks with no chipping</li>
            <li> ...long story short (too late)</li>
            <li> The first couple of tries were pretty awful, compared to the salon, but I hung in there</li>
            <li> At least I can cover it after Christmas with regular polish and extend my manicure.</li>
            <li> But, I wanted to write this to encourage other shoppers not to purchase this item!</li>
            <li> Also the starter kit is much less inexpensive purchasing it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> There was another one I previously purchased from that</li>
            <li> Because the \\&quot;polish\\&quot; does not air dry at all, you can take the time to slowly and carefully apply each coat and you can remove excess with the brush to obtain the thin coat necessary</li>
            <li> If I do get a chip, usually from doing really rough work with my hands, I do repair it like you can with any polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I used to pay $40 2x a month to get a shellac/gel mani which is quite a splurge if you&#x27;re tight on money.</li>
            <li> (A little.)</li>
            <li> I have been using RCM for a little over 3 years now.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE.</li>
            <li> Neat little kit.</li>
            <li> The gel color polish is still three steps, but the top and base coats are the same product; so there is no thick base coat (that RedCarpet has) and just one bottle instead of two to handle and store.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for the price of the polish to go down!</li>
            <li> cured at30 seconds, this coat is very thick and the most difficult to put on thin.</li>
            <li> hope this helps answer a few questions.</li>
            <li> I would suggest watching a few tutorials before you receive the kit</li>
            <li> 2 of the bulbs were dead and it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Thin coats and covering the tips are the key.  </li>
            <li> Twice I have taken a break and let my nails &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34; for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t help that I was watching Criminal Minds at the same time, as well as cooking dinner.</li>
            <li> This item is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I disliked how they file the nail bed.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money and cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> Put on the layers as THIN as possible!</li>
            <li> (thin is necessary to property cure the gel).  </li>
            <li> I do not vive 5 stars because if you used for too long make your nails weak</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll definitely wan a few!</li>
            <li> I typically have a hard time keeping nail polish on my nails.</li>
            <li> Plus new growth is less visible since the base of the nail blends in with the neutral pink tone of the polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> job leaves me little time for primping!).</li>
            <li> READ THE OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT DELIVERY OF DAMAGED GOODS!!!</li>
            <li> Just use small cotton balls and cut up aluminum foil to soak them off with the acetone remover.  </li>
            <li> It kept a glossy shine and way outlasted any salon manicure I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> (I have fairly small hands).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my excitement was short lived!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> I have tried the trick of dipping my fingertips into a small bowl of acetone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strangely, after about 4 uses my lamp started acting weird.</li>

            <li> Small bottles of acetone and alcohol:</li>
            <li> so it was basically pointless.</li>
            <li> And I am a mom to a 4 year old boy who has me running around like a crazy lady.</li>
            <li> I tried using just regular nail polish and it doesn&#x27;t work unfortunately.</li>
            <li> At the salon, they usually charge you $5 per finger if you want them to put plastic stones on.</li>
            <li> Polishes usually run $10-$15 depending on the type.</li>
            <li> First the base coat (Structure)</li>
            <li> One caveat, it&#x27;s hard to get off.</li>
            <li> But it does stay on at least a week.</li>
            <li> the process is time consuming... but at least I&#x27;m at home instead of in a salon!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it 2 times and the color stays on for at least one week without damage.  </li>
            <li> This was just opened and was completely broken and dried polish all over the dryer.</li>
            <li> I went with this one because it&#x27;s a little less expensive then others and the polishes are also less expensive.</li>
            <li> If you do these things you will have a salon quality manicure for a very small fraction of the price in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Also they are very small sized.</li>
            <li> this is ridiculous</li>
            <li> I am not good at doing my nails</li>
            <li> Needless to say I have collected quite a few colors.</li>
            <li> When I received the product there was a defect wtih the adapter cord - it would not fit into the LED lamp therefore making the kit unable to use.  </li>
            <li> I am soooooo disappointed and wish I can get my mother in laws money back for this item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very hard on my hands- always washing dishes, gardening, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing is that I have really weak nails that break all the time and ever since I started to use this my nails haven&#x27;t broken at all and look amazing.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I got tired of spending 40.00 every time I was in need of a manicure.</li>
            <li> This is only slightly annoying.</li>
            <li> Use thin layers, do not overdo it.</li>

            <li> Poor quality....</li>
            <li> I was spending a lot of money on gel nails, then gel nail polish that I was not completely happy with.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 Starter Kit, highly recommend it for anyone not wanting to spend $60 every time to get their nails done at a salon. You get professional quality nails in the comfort of your own home! The kit pays for itself in 2 uses! My nails grow fairly fast so it is not practial for me to go get them done as I would have to go very often, and it gets very expensive! Having this kit has saved me so much money, not to mention all the compliments I have gotten from people asking me where I get my nails done! I do them myself and they are in disbelief! This makes a great gift too!!</li>
            <li> It is hard to give a good rating for something that lasted 4 times.  I used it 4 times and I loved it but now the light won&#x27;t stay on so I can&#x27;t get it to work.  I would like my money back, at least the price to replace the machine itself.  I am totally dissapointed with this product I would not even give it a star but I had to if I wanted to write something about it.  I bought it as a gift for someone and I must say it was quite an embarrassing when she told me it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  I had been getting my nails done at a nail salon with the CND Shellac brand gel manicure and at $35 a visit, I figured I would try a home version.  Purchased this kit.  I followed the directions which are very simple (just multiple steps, like in the salon).  I am pretty good at painting my own nails so this was not very hard for me.  I found the gel actually easier to work with because you can keep working (painting) your nail and it will not cure until you put your nails under the LED light dryer.  One person commented about the dryer not staying on after only 4 uses.  That is because there is a built in timer in the light to keep it on either 30 or 45 seconds-according to the instruction manual.  The color (red) polish that is supplied is a nice red.  You have to use 2 coats of the color to make sure there is no bleeding through.  This was the same with the shellac brand as well.  I am very hard on my hands- always washing dishes, gardening, etc. and this manicure lasted as long as the Shellac brand.  I get about 2 weeks out of the manicure.  My nails are as strong with a gel manicure as they were when I used to have them wrapped. No fear in chipping or breaking.  I also find that my nails are healthier and stronger when you remove this product then when I used to have them silk wrapped.  My nails would be like paper when the wraps were removed and took about a year to grow back strong.  When I remove this product, my nails are still as strong as they were before the product was put on.  The only thing I would add to this package is to buy the protective white gloves for when you have your hands under the LED light.  I did find the LED light in this package a little stronger than the one at the nail salon so I might also purchase a better LED lamp in the near future.  Also don&#x27;t bother purchasing the remover pads.  Just use small cotton balls and cut up aluminum foil to soak them off with the acetone remover.  In conclusion, this kit worksexactly as stated and the additional polishes are much cheaper than competitor brands.</li>
            <li> then again the salon does it faster and better (if you get the right person). I also use the light on other polishes that need to &#x27;cure&#x27;. Can&#x27;t wait for the price of the polish to go down!</li>
            <li> The cudicle oil came open and spilled oer all the contents. I will switch the review when I getan answer or replacement.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this Red Carpet Kit. For years I have paid fifty dollars a nail salon visit and this ended that. I&#x27;m saving about a hundred dollars a month for this tiny investment! Don&#x27;t be daunted or scared at doing it alone, these instructions are really simple, clear and laid out so that you absolutely understand each step and what to do. Grab some polishes to go along with this, because it does come with one color it&#x27;s so easy you&#x27;ll definitely wan a few! I was really suprised that my manicure was lasting three weeks at a time with NO peeling or color issues. I absolutely love it and will continue to use it and save money!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Easy to use if you read and follow the instructions.  Manicure lasts for weeks!  I usually end up changing it after 2 weeks just because I want  new color.  I&#x27;ve used other brand gels polishes with it and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Polish does not stay on long. But it does stay on at least a week. You don&#x27;t have to worry about it chipping. Plus it makes your nails hard if they are soft.</li>
            <li> Greate to save on gel manicure</li>
            <li> This is so amazing and I have been using it a lot!! It has already paid for itself twice! I have been telling everyone to get this starter kit!!</li>
            <li> The product works well.  The first few times of doing my own nails did not turn out very well.  But now, they look like I had them done at a salon.</li>
            <li> easy to use, great instructions</li>
            <li> The manicure kit allowed for a pretty manicure with a very smooth glossy finish. Very professional looking manicure at a nice price. I&#x27;ve already would have paid for 4 gel manicures by now without the kit. It&#x27;s already paid for itself. A good buy!</li>
            <li> I got my first gel manicure just recently, when I was going to an event. Regular polish always chips for me within a day, but I was really impressed with gel polish. It was hard, made my nails stronger (while applied - they were weaker and more brittle once I took the polish off, but that&#x27;s also true of regular nail polish for me) and lasted a week before starting to peel. What I wasn&#x27;t impressed with was the job the manicurist did - my nails were very splotchy and uneven, with hard-as-rock drips in places. So I decided to get this kit, figuring I&#x27;d get the product I wanted and if it was poorly applied, at least it would be my own fault. So far, it&#x27;s been great. It stays shiny and strong for a whole week. I even had one nail that had started to tear before polishing, so I put an extra coat of color on it and that&#x27;s been enough to hold it together while it grows out. I used to polish my nails and then sit on the couch waiting for them to dry, thinking about all the things I&#x27;d rather be doing and how nail polish was clearly a tool of the patriarchy. (I&#x27;m kidding.) (A little.) Now I can go to the bathroom and unbutton my jeans immediately after applying! Can&#x27;t say that about regular polish.</li>
            <li> I decided to try and do this myself to save money...so far so good!  I am learning more each time I do it.</li>
            <li> The item arrived one day later from the estimated arrival day but in good condition. The product is easy to use and lasting! It has been 3 and a 1/2 week since I used it and my nails are as good as the day I just finished. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The manufacturers box came squashed with a rip on the side as if someone was trying to pry it open. Other than that it was delivered on time and the kit works great. Just wish it was packaged with more care.</li>
            <li> This is a great little gel kit for 1st time users. I highly recommend purchasing this kit before spending a lot of money on any of the more expensive ones. The light works great and isn&#x27;t cheaply made or flimsy.</li>
            <li> Cannot your gel because the light is not strong enough nail polishes are really weak and the whole kit is not worth the price</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this set.</li>
            <li> loves these colors and she really loves the gel as she does not have to do her nails every few days, more like every few weeks now.</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME TOOK ME 10 MIN TO DO MY DAUGHTERS PEDIS AND 10 MORE FOR THE MANIS.  THEY ARE LOVING IT LOOKS LIKE IF THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE SALON.  MAKES MOMMY AND DAUGHTERS TIME EVEN MORE FUN WITHOUT THE WAIT OF 30  MIN FOR THE POLISH TO DRY... LOVE IT!!! ITS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE ITS VERY SIMPLE AND EASY.  MOST DEF ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS I HAVE MADE.</li>
            <li> I did my first gel manicure last night.  I love the set and the LED dryer is the perfect size for my hands.  The instructions were easy to follow and my nails look great. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this starter kit on sale at Ulta. I absolutely love it! I got tired of spending 40.00 every time I was in need of a manicure. My daughter and I saw this at Ulta, while there we surfed the web for reviews, and decided to purchase the item. I am not disappointed in the least. Very easy to apply and what beautiful results! My polish never chipped and had the beautiful shine still at three weeks. By then my nails had grown and it was time to be redone, and again such an easy process.  I love all the variety of colors Red Carpet has. This is a wonderful product, I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Best thing, I have saved much since learning with this kit!</li>
            <li> this kit is perfect for first time users. the dryer is amazing</li>
            <li> This was given to my daughter as a gift and she absolutely loves it!  She loves how long the polish lasts using this system.</li>
            <li> I just got this kit a couple of weeks ago, and I absolutely love it!  My biggest challenge is waiting out the manicure to see how long the results will last because I want to change the color.  I have done 3 manicures with it so far and trust me when I say that you will get better in time.  Thin coats are key and try not to go all the way to your nail bed for best adhesion.  Also do one hand at a time, go through 4 fingers, complete them and then do thumbs.  Amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say though is there is a major inconsistency in price on Amazon.  I bought this first for $79, then saw that it went on sale for $69 two days later.  Amazon was kind enough to do a price adjustment since it hadn&#x27;t shipped yet.  Currently the price posted is $109 which is a little absurd because you can get this kit at Target and Ulta for significantly cheaper.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love my red carpet nail polish! My right hand polish has only been lasting about 10 days and the left hand a lot longer since I don&#x27;t use it as my main hand. 10 days is awesome though compared to other polish so I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit early April and never got a chance to use it. The first week of May I attempted to do my nails and two of the three bulbs would not come on in the led light. The seller could/would not offer a refund or exchange due to the time limit. The product is defective and I&#x27;m stuck with this junk. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Great product! Only thing is that it takes forever to remove nail polish, but it may be a good thing. Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> Everything is included for you to do your own at home gel polish. Instructions are included and the usb cable is a plus...</li>
            <li> Once you are able to find colors that are gel and LED, this device is awesome! I have never had faster nails then this before!! First.. after many research.. please use sun block on your hands. Just like tanning beds this too can cause &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34;effects and must take precaution to prevent skin cancer. So I use a sun block stick and apply to my hand each time. Just an idea to throw out there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the nails...VERY GLOSSY NAILS  and quite strong too. My nail polish would dry hard after last step using the Brilliance top coat. This seals/cures the color and then wipe with Purify to get any residue off. HIGH GLOSS &#x3D; pretty nails.  I have received many compliments from people!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can be sold at Ulta for 99.00 dollars. I found it much cheaper here on Amazon!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND for beautiful nails! Each nail takes about 5 mins from prep to brilliance. Only 3 steps and you are done!!</li>
            <li> I HAVE JUST STARTED DOING MY GEL MANICURES BUT I LOVE IT. THIS KIT COMES WITH EVERYTHING GREAT PRICE, AND IT ALLOWS FOR BEAUTIFUL NAILS! MY AUNT BOUGHT HER OWN GEL NAIL KIT AND SHE SAID MINE IS BETTER! SO I THINK I GOT A GREAT DEAL. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHERS FOR SURE. I HAVE HAD MY MANICURE FOR ALMOST 2 WEEKS NOW AND IT STILL LOOKS GOOD! MAKE SURE YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS VERY CAREFULLY, THAT IS MY ONLY TIP.</li>
            <li> Love this set! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Update 1: To remove the gel polishes, there is a great tool  that quickly removed the softened polish. SensatioNail by Nailene Gel Polish Removal Tool, (sorry no hyperlink, the Amazon software sometimes has a hard time finding this product so you need to cut and paste this in the address bar of your browser amazon.com/gp/product/B008N9DDWM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_mts_prod_img). It is very reasonable price and dramatically saves time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: The SensatioNAIL gel polish system is wonderful too[[ASIN:B0087P9PB0 sensationail by nailene starter kit in pink chiffon]]. Better distribution, available at local stores, Walmarts &amp; CVS/Longs drug stores in my area carry it). The gel color polish is still three steps, but the top and base coats are the same product; so there is no thick base coat (that RedCarpet has) and just one bottle instead of two to handle and store. So SesatioNAIL product results in much more even thin layers (thin is the goal here) with less effort at a similar price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are similar. They look the same to me and last/wear the exact same on my nails. Using the RedCarpet LED light I put SensatioNail on one hand and RedCarpet on the other (I do French manicures, so both hands had white tips from the RedCarpet brand of gel polish), otherwise it was put on the same.  They wore the same and got the same number of microchips the same number of days out (day three or four for me). I repaired both chips with the original products for each hand and it was freaky; both hands still experienced the exact same wear (I am ambidextrous, so my nails usually wear the same, but I did not expect it in this case with two different products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original RedCarpet Review: I bought this exact same system months ago at Ulta. It is wonderful. Works perfectly. The products are unique and go on a little different from regular nail polish or acrylics; so each time you do it, you&#x27;ll probably get better and better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TheseLED lamps are fantastic and this is the least expensive I have found. They do not get hot. They are easy to use. The LED&#x27;s last a long time. You do not have to worrying about replacing the cumbersome UV bulbs. There are only 3 LED&#x27;s in this lamp, I was concerned, before I bought it, but it cures perfectly and in 30 to 45 seconds per layer. (I have also used this for traditional nail polish and it significantly shortens that drying process too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to put on very thin coats, their WEB sites recommends knocking all polish off the brush back into the top neck of the bottle until it looks like there is no longer any polish on the brush; then brush on nail. If the polish looks spotty, just put a tiny dab on it and even them out. I find these micro layers work best and unlike regular polish all dry &amp; cure so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a French manicure fanatic, this is my routine:&lt;br /&gt;Some (their old) instructions recommend roughing up the top surface of the nail, with a fine emery board. I do not think it is recommended anymore, but I kind of do this; I just do a three step buff, with a $2.00 drug store nail buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I do the recommend prep, which is no different than any other nail polish or gel nail or acrylic set-up. Their products are called \\&quot;purify\\&quot; and \\&quot;prep\\&quot; (\\&quot;purify\\&quot; &#x3D; rubbing alcohol with coloring, conditioner and fragrance &amp; \\&quot;prep\\&quot; is the same prep and clean dehydrant you can buy at Ulta or Sally&#x27;s). These just take seconds to do, but are important to remove oils so the polish sticks. I&#x27;ve already have these types of nail products and either use Red Carpets (from the kit) or what I have (from Sally&#x27;s or Ulta), whichever I grab, and have seen no difference in wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do all ultra-thin layers (described above) on four fingers at a time, then the thumbs. Do NOT touch your nails once you start this process, you do not want oils on your nail or to touch these sticky polish layers.  First the base coat (Structure) cured at30 seconds, this coat is very thick and the most difficult to put on thin. Then 2 to 3 light coats of white (White Hot) on the nail tips (until I get the white color opaqueness I like), cure each white coat for 45 seconds, then the top coat (Brilliance) and the last cure for 45 seconds. Then rub the polished/cured nails with a swab of \\&quot;purify\\&quot; (removing all the stickiness) and viola, they are done! I then oil my nails as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: On one of your layers and again on the top coat, make sure you get a slight amount of polish along the actual tip of the nails, they call this \\&quot;sealing\\&quot; the nail, this prevents water from getting under the polish from the tips and getting those horrible chips. (I usually run the brush lightly along the tip, then brush the layer of polish along the nail tops as usual, so I do not get a thick ridge-like edge.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look great for usually two weeks (and I take long hot baths every other day)! I can go longer but do not like the grow-out pattern; I can and do put regular nail polish (clear top coat on top) to put a freshen tip to cuticle shine on about a week in; regular polish stays on so long on top of this stuff. If I do get a chip, usually from doing really rough work with my hands, I do repair it like you can with any polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Clean up around the nail with a short, narrow firm acrylic-bristled brush (I got mine for about $3 at a craft store). Do NOT cure gel polish if there is any product on the skin, it can dry very hard, and irritate until it wears off; it can also pull up the polish on the nail and cause early chipping. I also use this brush to clean up the French manicure, to get clean lines on the white polish. Dip that brush in either \\&quot;Nail Prep or nail polish remover, you just want it damp. If there is too much liquid, knock it off back into the bottle. After cleaning up polish on the skin or white polish I clean the brush on gauze or a paper towel to minimize contaminating the clean-up solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps answer a few questions. Honestly, if you can give yourself an okay manicure with regular polish, you can do this and get long lasting beautiful results. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I bought the pro kit with plug in LED light (the more expensive kit offers a better quality light than the starter with much quicker curing time.) If you follow the directions, you&#x27;ll probably be very pleased with the results. My manicure lasted two weeks, through a vacation that included a lot of swimming and activities. It kept a glossy shine and way outlasted any salon manicure I&#x27;ve had in the past. It does take longer to remove than regular polish, but that is the only downside.</li>

            <li> This kit is just what you need to do gel nails at home.  I am not good at doing my nails but I followed the instructions and they came out perfect! I am going to save so much money! I do wish the light fit all 5 fingers but I can live with it. I am one of those people who read review after review before I buy and I can tell you this is the best one to get if you are just starting out.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase for the cost! Works very well, and came with a free polish! I bought this for a Christmas gift and was a big hit!</li>
            <li> Tne UV lamp did not work.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loves it!  She has used it once so far and said it did a great job of drying the shellac polish!  I may have to get one of these for myself now!</li>
            <li> Was very happy with this product. Follow all directions as listed in the instruction booklet and your manicure will come out looking professional. Would recommend</li>
            <li> My daughter said this was the perfect Birthday Gift for her and she loves the product very much and has told everyone about it !!</li>
            <li> My daughter recently completed nail technician school. I gave this kit to her as a birthday gift and she loves it! Though not truly a professional kit, it produces excellent results. The manicures are long lasting and the results are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Contains most of the things you need both to put LED UV polish on and to take it off.  The light is really handy and works very well I especially like the 45 second timer so I don&#x27;t have to use a clock.  The polish with the kit is a nice red and everything else works as it is supposed to just make sure you use thin coats and use the UV light between coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who say it doesn&#x27;t work are not really doing it right.  I never wear polish in general but in my job my nails were always breaking because they were so dried out due to alway being wet etc. but after using this polish for a month they have grown out and are actually looking decent for the first time in a lot of years. Other polish lasts maybe one day for me but this stuff can last up to two weeks, though when you are in the growing out phase I suggest doing it once a week after they get a bit more grown out they have been lasting longer and they to not chip for the most part. I&#x27;ve decided it may not be necessary to remove it since it seems like that process is kind of bad for my nails and I have to immediately put it back on to avoid issues so I&#x27;m going to try just backfilling since the company says that is fine and that you just have to go through the steps again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish is probably not for the person who wants to change their color everyday since the whole process of taking it off and putting it on takes at least an hour, but at the end of that time it is completely dry and never do you get issues with it being tacky but you must remember to follow the steps. It works best if you do four fingers, two thumbs, and four fingers to completion in that order. So don&#x27;t do all fingers at once finish four, then finish the thumbs, then finish the other four I found this to be the best plan.  One other thing I found out is that you can add other polish (non gel) on top and take it off normally and it seemed to work the same as just putting nail polish on your nails, you can even removeit with nail polish remover and this stuff stays intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway enough about it hope it helps somebody.</li>
            <li> This product works great. This light works far better than the portable version, and I like the auto shut off -so you don&#x27;t need to time your exposure. I just wish this &amp;#34;starter pack&amp;#34; came with some color other than red.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this before buying it and was still a little worried, even though the majority of the reviews were good. One of the reviews that caught my attention was where the reviewer said if you read the instructions and follow them, you will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine just arrived in the mail yesterday. I used it not less than 3 minutes ago. I read the directions carefully, followed them to the T and my very first home gel manicure came out perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If some of the negative reviews worry you, just know that if you follow the directions (which also means purchasing any needed supplies that don&#x27;t come with the kit, like lint-free nail pads and a really good buffer), you will &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this manicure kit. I can&#x27;t wait to try a French manicure and start playing with designs and color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful! but not dummy-proof. Read the directions and don&#x27;t wing it. B</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about the at home gel manicure systems. I went with this one because it&#x27;s a little less expensive then others and the polishes are also less expensive. Such a great buy. The polishes last a long time and look really great. I don&#x27;t have any problems with bubbles and I&#x27;m not the best manicurist. This will definitely save me a ton of money over going to the nail salon.</li>
            <li> love it, worth the money and time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a present and it was the sensation. It is easy to use and the results are great. Is easy to use even if you are not a professional you can use and will have nice results.</li>
            <li> This kit saves me soo much time and money!  Soo easy for the at home manicure and inexperienced person.  Seriously the best purchase I have made in a long time.  It pays for itself over and over!</li>
            <li> I liked the packaging but my uv light worked for only a week and then broke</li>
            <li> LOVED THIS!  Follow the instructions carefully if you want the true salon look.  I got so many compliments on my nails (that I did myself).  They lasted a full 3 weeks.  I was so impressed I bought 2 other shades made by Red Carpet.  Alas, I also was seduced into buying a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; brand at Walgreen&#x27;s (buy one, get one free).  The results were NOT as stellar as Red Carpet&#x27;s polish.  [BTW, Walgreen&#x27;s offers a money-back guarantee if you use a cosmetic product and then don&#x27;t like it, but I had misplaced the receipts.  I will not be using any product other than Red Carpet polish in the future.]</li>
            <li> This kit works great, is easy to use, and the result is more than adequate.  In fact, my daughter does her own nails and gets a better result than she sometimes has in the past at the salon.  This kit has been used heavily for nearly a year now and the light still works great.  I&#x27;ve had to replace supplies but are all available either locally or on amazon.</li>
            <li> I worked in a salon for some time, this is what you are going to get any salon. If it is not working for you it is not the product, it is  the user. Make sure you buff your nails, and do not paint the product on your skin. You also need to use the cleanser (alcohol) before applying the product. DO NOT PUT OIL ON YOUR NAILS, and do not touch your fingers to the nails before you are done. The oils in your skin will make the product peel. I usually have mine last for 1.5 to 2 weeks before I start to peel them off. If you are in the water a lot they will lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other gel nail colors with this product and it has worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I love this kit! I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it.  After reading tons of reviews I had no idea what I was getting into, but now that I got it home and tried it for myself I have to admit this little kit really rocks. It was my first time trying to do LED nails myself and they came out perfect.  I would suggest watching a few tutorials before you receive the kit so you are ready for the process when it does arrive.  I am a happy customer, thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend for her birthday. She initially wasn&#x27;t very impressed due to the small size, and we contemplated returning it. However, after using it she fell in love! It&#x27;s a winner! Her nails always look fabulous :)</li>
            <li> I was spending $30 plus tip on top for a no chip manicure until I found this kit. Now I am able to do my own no chip manicure at home. I also purchased several polishes in addition to this kit. The first couple times I did it, being a newbie it took me a good couple hours because you have to be careful not to get the stuff on your skin or it will make the entire nail peal off. Once i got the hang of it i was able to become quicker at it. Now i save money on doing the no chips myself. They really do last 2-3 weeks when you use this kit just like they do in the salon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Easy instructions, easy to use.  Beautiful nails!  I bought kits for my daughters when they left for school.  A real money saver!</li>
            <li> This kit is great! Keep in mind, if you are not that good at painting your own finger nails, it will not magically make you better, but the quality of the equipment is awesome. Follow the directions and you will have a great polish.</li>
            <li> 2 of the bulbs were dead and it wouldn&#x27;t work.  I did read the reviews and decided to go for it but I should have paid a little more and purchased better quality</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it just 4 stars is because you can only fit your fingers in, you have to do your thumb seperately (I have fairly small hands).</li>
            <li> I love the Red Carpet Manicure Starter Kit!!  It is easy to use, the colors are great. They always have a sale on the nail polish at my local Ulta. The polish stays perfectly on your nails for approx 10 days. You ca probably get another 5 days out of it.  It will just not be as shiny. Or if your nails start to grow it&#x27;s time to reapply. Once you get the hang of it it takes the same amount of time as a regular do it yourself mani at home that only lasts 3 days. i highly recommend this product. My daughter recommended it to me, and I recommended it to my other daughter. We are all loving it. Also the starter kit is much less inexpensive purchasing it on Amazon. My daughter bought it at Ulta and paid double the price I paid for the exact same kit!! The nail polish is about the same price all over and with the sales and coupons at Ulta (the only store that carries Red Carpet polish by me) it is the same price without the coupons as other top brands such as OPI and Essie. With the coupons and the bogo sales it is even less expensive!! I highly recommend this product.  I would never go back to regular polish again!!</li>
            <li> i love it..............i dont must go to the nail center and stay more then 1 houer. it is not difficult to do, of course the first time it is not perfect, but i must say i learnd very quick..................very cool is that you can do the uv with your computer, so you dont have to move on a place with electricity............</li>
            <li> This kit is easy to use, although the process of doing your own gel manicure is a bit tedious and time consuming. (Leave an hour to do it. It&#x27;s a good activity to do in front of the tv.) The end result is great though, and this has paid for itself when I think about how much I would&#x27;ve spent by now on professional manicures. If applied correctly (the key is to apply very sparingly!), it lasts for around 2 weeks and looks exactly like a professional manicure. It takes some time and patience to do, so don&#x27;t order this if you aren&#x27;t blessed with time or patience for this kind of thing.</li>
            <li> I received this for a Christmas gift today. I have used a similar brand before and loooooved how my nails turned out. So, I was very excited to get my own kit. Unfortunately, my excitement was short lived!!!&lt;br /&gt;I first noticed that that cord did not even fit properly in the lamp. I then noticed that one of of the lights was not working, so, I was only down to two lights. Trying to be optimistic, I tired anyways! After doing the routine and having my nails under the lamp for 30 minutes... Yes 30 minutes!!! The nail polish just dripped right off!!! HORRIBLE!!! I am soooooo disappointed and wish I can get my mother in laws money back for this item.&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to write a review, even on an item I absolutely love!!! But, I wanted to write this to encourage other shoppers not to purchase this item!</li>
            <li> Works great, great price, paid for itself already. I use other brands of polish for other colors , they need to make more color choices.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and decided to return it because when I cure my nails under the UV lamp, it would make my nails tingle. I&#x27;ve had gel nails done at a professional nail salon and that has never happened. At first, I thought it was just me and that may be I am a little more sensitive than some. But, the same thing happened to my mom and a friend, when they tried it as well. That was enough for me to return it. Maybe it was the quality of the polish or the light? Not sure, but IMO it wasn&#x27;t worth it to take a chance in case something isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> I love Red Carpet Manicure! I&#x27;ve been using the kit for over a year and swear by it. The gel manicure lasts two weeks, easy. The only downside is that some of the colors for sale are too sheer which means you end up putting too many coats on causing it to peel. As long as you only put two coats of color on, you&#x27;re good to go. Otherwise, expect the color to peel within a week (which is fine by me for the right color). The 45 second lamp is great! I had the two minute lamp as well and I&#x27;m so happy I upgraded to the 45 second lamp. Seems minor, but it really is a big time saver (two kids, a hubby, dog and full time job leaves me little time for primping!).</li>
            <li> Im no professional, but this was so easy.  It didnt take near as long as I thought it would, it does take some time to keep it off the skin.  other than that, super easy!! I get tired of seeing the same color for 2 weeks, and am ready to change the color, that is the only reason I take off the polish!  There are no chips or anything. I had sooo many compliments on them, and when they hear I did it myself, they wanna know what I used, Ive had 4 random people say, they are going to get one as soon as they get home!!  I would highly recommend this product to anybody I know.  As long as you have a steady hand, you will love this product!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Very clean and easy to use... Haven&#x27;t removed it yet so that may be the test so far after 5 days of wear it still looks salon new!</li>
            <li> The product itself arrived quickly and easily.  I saved money from buying it in store, which is always a plus.  The manicure itself is great.  I&#x27;m rough on my nails, but it lasted easily a week without chipping, two weeks with minor chips + beginning to outgrow.  A note to users: you can easily patch a nail and it looks 80-100% like the original job, so touchup is easy!  Just watch for getting it on your skin.  You do want to take it off prior to putting it under the magical blue light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good product.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loved&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is to watch out for the little bottles inside they may leak and damage the product&lt;br /&gt;other than that she loved it.</li>
            <li> was what she wanted, sorry i am not a wordy person that goes on and on and on and on</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Easy to use</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit, used it about 10 times, and the LED light quit working. Not pleased with this at all.</li>
            <li> Love this. Great price. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Did my nails on Christmas eve ,nails still look beautiful,I loved this nail kit</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I used to pay $40 2x a month to get a shellac/gel mani which is quite a splurge if you&#x27;re tight on money. By the time you figure in the tip, you&#x27;re looking at $100 a month for nails. For less than 1 month worth of gel manis you can own your own kit &amp; do it yourself at home. Mind you, the RC polishes are pricey at $10 a bottle for a tiny bottle but as with all the RC items, a little bit goes a long, long way. Needless to say I have collected quite a few colors. They don&#x27;t have the widest selection of colors but I stick with the basics anyway; black, coral, white, red, fuchsia. Be careful though because a lot of the colors actually look NOTHING like the color on the outside of the bottle so it is very misleading. The colors tend to be more transparent than the color they appear to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the people complaining about the tackiness after you&#x27;re all done, I am here to tell you that you either didn&#x27;t read the directions or you missed a step. Every step is very important. I did have one run-in with the white color gel for some reason though where it was still tacky even after the &#x27;purify&#x27; step at the end. So I stuck them back under the light for another 45 second session, wiped them again with &#x27;purify&#x27; &amp; I was good. When you are wiping them with &#x27;purify&#x27; you have to keep rubbing it until it literally squeaks which tells you it&#x27;s smooth &amp; no longer tacky. Now I just do the 45 uv session 2x after the &#x27;brilliance&#x27; step. Also something I figure I&#x27;d share since I found it out the hard way...when you paint your nails, rather than starting with the brush by your cuticle, start in the middle of the nail, work your way down and then go back with the little bit of leftover polish on the brush and get by the cuticle. Otherwise it pools &amp; looks like crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all my nails last almost 2 weeks. Sometimes they chip, sometimes they don&#x27;t. But most of the time they don&#x27;t I just don&#x27;t like the &#x27;grown out&#x27; look where there&#x27;s that space of no color between my cuticles &amp; polish.</li>
            <li> I just bought this kit at Ulta.  I did a french manicure, so I also purchased white and blush colored shellac.  This was my first experience with nail shellac.  I&#x27;ve had professional gel manicures in the past, but didn&#x27;t like the way they dried my nails out.  (Plus I&#x27;d prefer to just do it myself for convenience and cost savings.)  This was an easy and beautiful manicure.  I have only had it on for a few hours, but so far I love it.  I will report back with how long it lasted.  I&#x27;m not sure yet how difficult or easy it is to remove.</li>
            <li> I love it.  The review from Ereader in Pleaston,CA is very accurate. Thin coats and covering the tips are the key.  Altough my first attempt was pretty thick it still looked good and lasted over 2 weeks.  Dark colors take 4 coats but look great.For your first time I recommend getting a light color, it&#x27;s more forgiving.  I also invested in a standing lighted magnifying glass.  Very helpful.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Bought this for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love my manicure set! I got it about a month ago and it is the best thing I have ever done for my nails and beauty routine. It takes a little getting used to with the removal and making sure the layers are thin. I have used it with various types of LED gel polish AND with regular nail polish. It works great with all of them. I just sandwiched the regular polish between the base and top coat. It&#x27;s useful to let the regular polish dry for a bit before the top coat but it lasts just as long and it means you don&#x27;t have to abandon your entire polish collection! The RCM gel polishes are a bit limited in terms of color choices but you can also use any LED gel polish from different brands. They&#x27;re not crazy pricey compared to a good normal polish from Essie or OPI. The remover is just acetone which you can buy at target for $4 for a HUGE bottle. I use the foil and cotton pad trick for removal which works great. Just file the surface of the polish with a coarse metal file, dip a round cotton pad (cut into 4)  into remover, place on the nail and then wrap the fingertip in foil.  I have tried the trick of dipping my fingertips into a small bowl of acetone. It works but dries out my fingers and cuticles more than I would like and it was no faster or easier than the foil method for me. The prep cleanser is just rubbing alcohol which is also very cheap at the pharmacy. The only things you will ever need to buy again from RCM is the prep, base and top coat and of course all the adorable colors your heart desires! I LOVE french manicures with the kit! There&#x27;s just something so elegant about a nice french manicure. Plus new growth is less visible since the base of the nail blends in with the neutral pink tone of the polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely, after about 4 uses my lamp started acting weird. The button which turns the lamp/timer on and off stopped working and the light was significantly more dim than it had been. Since I had already started my manicure when I noticed the issue I persevered. Made for a messy and terrible looking manicure but luckily I got my kit at Ulta and they have an AMAZING return policy. They switched my lamp, no questions asked for a brand new one and I was all set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My manicures last about 12-15 days with the kit. I usually discover tiny chips in the polish on my right hand after about a week. I can usually ignore them for a while until I have time for another manicure. Otherwise I will just fix the nail or two that is chipped which usually only takes about 10 minutes. Either I will removed all the polish on the chipped nail and do it fully over again OR my new trick of just buffing the surface of the nail and painting over it again paying special attention to the chipped region. Then I seal it all with a full coat of Brilliance (the top coat) and I am good for another week or so! You coud even try the trick with all your nails. When it&#x27;s time for a touch up just buff them and add another manicure right on top. Sure the polish might seem a little thicker then a single manicure but it saves lots of time and harm to your hands and nails with all the acetone. Done properly you can get away with only fully removing everything after 5-6 weeks. A full manicure with removal and a polish change usually takes a little over an hour. It has been getting quicker with every application and has saved me tons of money and time since I can do the manicures at home! No more sitting around trying not to use my hands for hours while regular polish dries. No more having a perfect manicure for all of 5 hours until they chip when I do dishes or wash my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE MY RED CARPET MANICURE PRO KIT. I highly recommend it to all my friends, family and total strangers who ask how my nails look so nice!persevered. Made for a messy and terrible looking manicure but luckily I got my kit at Ulta and they have an AMAZING return policy. They switched my lamp, no questions asked for a brand new one and I was all set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My manicures last about 12-15 days with the kit. I usually discover tiny chips in the polish on my right hand after about a week. I can usually ignore them for a while until I have time for another manicure. Otherwise I will just fix the nail or two that is chipped which usually only takes about 10 minutes. Either I will removed all the polish on the chipped nail and do it fully over again OR my new trick of just buffing the surface of the nail and painting over it again paying special attention to the chipped region. Then I seal it all with a full coat of Brilliance (the top coat) and I am good for another week or so! You coud even try the trick with all your nails. When it&#x27;s time for a touch up just buff them and add another manicure right on top. Sure the polish might seem a little thicker then a single manicure but it saves lots of time and harm to your hands and nails with all the acetone. Done properly you can get away with only fully removing everything after 5-6 weeks. A full manicure with removal and a polish change usually takes a little over an hour. It has been getting quicker with every application and has saved me tons of money and time since I can do the manicures at home! No more sitting around trying not to use my hands for hours while regular polish dries. No more having a perfect manicure for all of 5 hours until they chip when I do dishes or wash my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE MY RED CARPET MANICURE PRO KIT. I highly recommend it to all my friends, family and total strangers who ask how my nails look so nice!</li>
            <li> Have only used this once, going to give it another try. Chipped and pealed on the second day, I&#x27;m hoping that it was do to the fact I&#x27;m a new bee and may have applied the polish to thick. I have used Sally Hansen gel base and over coat which needs no light and have had better results with no chipping and pealing and the polish lasting close to over a week, but you do not get the shine that the gel has. It is hard to get off, I had the best luck soaking my nails in a bowl of  polish remover for about 10 minutes, then using a orange stick to scrap it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up date, after using this product a few more times and tweaking my technique,I still have not gotten my manicure to last any more the 4 or 5 days, not the 2 weeks as they claim. Bottom line, I would not pay full price for this system, if you can find it 1/2 price I would say the light may be worth your money, it is nice that the polish dry&#x27;s hard and super fast.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I am a dentist so I spend all day washing my hands and putting them in gloves the nail polish last for at least two weeks with no chipping it&#x27;s fabulous I would recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Great for first day....but the gel peels off so easy.  The light kinda feels like it burns your hands at first too.</li>
            <li> Great product I highly recommend it! Long lasting, easy to apply, and easy to remove!  Works perfect for me and my sister!</li>
            <li> It was quite easy to learn how to use this and the results are very professional looking! I do not think I will ever go back to regular polish. This looks better and lasts longer!</li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly in a shrink wrapped box with a strong gel polish coming from the box. I opened the box - Prep polish bottle, Structure polish bottle and the Brilliance bottle was opened and completely empty. The gel/polish spilled all over the LED light structure. You can not returned this item. DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON. READ THE OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT DELIVERY OF DAMAGED GOODS!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for how long it lasts (I just tried it today) but it looks amazing! Better than any manicure I&#x27;ve paid for. Easy, though slightly time consuming. Just gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and quick too!  I am a licensed professional and I rank this system with OPI and Creative Nail systems.  If you can polish your nails you can use this system.  Also the LED light is an improvement over UV lights and takes much less time to cure between applications.</li>
            <li> This was just opened and was completely broken and dried polish all over the dryer. And not able to return because of the contents.&lt;br /&gt;Would like a replacement but guess just have to eat the cost.</li>
            <li> This kit has improved since the last starter kit they had. They offer USB cord now so you can do this by your computer instead on the floor or somewhere not so comfortable. This kit is everything you need to make those pretty gel nails. They are just like ones you get in a salon really no difference. This kit is enough polish to last for lots and lots of uses for the little bottle of red polish you get. The light isn’t as strong, so if you have a plug or a certain USB that works faster than others use that one. It only needs to take like ten minutes to dry. You need to follow every step by step to get this right or the polish won’t stay on for long and chip away. The instructions are very simple and straight forward which is great and easy. Great kit for the holidays to someone special to you. Great price for everything that comes in the kit, and the polish is a deep red and very noticeable.</li>
            <li> While setting this up I realized that the power cord does not fit into the light, its too big!!  So I dug out a similar power cord that did fit into the light, unfortunately this also did not work.  I think that the light was damaged in some way.  You can&#x27;t return this product due to hazardous materials, but thanks Amazon for giving me a refund on this item.  I will try another brand.</li>
            <li> Great kit! Purchased it a while ago, just got around to using it for the first time. Easy to use! Just follow the kit directions for any easy manicure. It&#x27;s handy (pun intended? Haha) that the LED light automatically shuts off at 45 seconds. We will see how long this manicure lasts! The light color (camera shy) in the kit is very light, pretty much a sheer color - perfect for me as I am in the Army and can&#x27;t wear bright colors.</li>
            <li> I have been using RCM for a little over 3 years now.  Twice I have taken a break and let my nails &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34; for a few weeks.  I apply a french manicure, then a week or 10 days later I do some buffing, touching up, and a back fill which takes about 20 minutes.  I have very weak nails and RCM has really helped my nails grow longer.  I use the cotton ball &amp; foil method to remove them along with a cuticle pusher.  I love this product!  I have done beautiful manicures for my daughters for special occasions like Prom and weddings.  This is easy to use and saves so much money!  It took about three manicures before I felt like I had ironed out all the kinks.  I always do my thumbs first, start to finish, then each hand seperatly, start to finish.  It is a bit more time consuming but it is so much easier not smudging one hand while working on the other. (The first three manicures taught me this!).  I spend about 65-80 dollars a year on supplies, (including foil, cotton pads, nail files and appliques). This sure beats the 90 dollars at the nail salon I was spending for acrylics, and my nails are much healthier, and I can do this at home, anytime (usually late at night while listening to the news).  I don&#x27;t have to make an appointment and go somewhere.  The kit travels nicely and when we are on vacation for 3-4 weeks I can  touch up or back fill quickly.  If you love gel nails you need this RCM kit!</li>
            <li> Okay, so far I love this thing. I bought it today. Did my fingers and toes, and I am giddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to paint my nails all the time in high school and younger; used to like to do designs (stripes and what not) before there were appliques in every store. Festive/holiday colors, and all that jazz. I lost that drive when I became a barista years ago because nail polish is a no-no...I was excited when I could just do clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten my nails professionally done like twice in my life, and, while it&#x27;s neat to have it done, I&#x27;ve never been one to keep up on that sort of thing, partially because of the cost, partially because of time (and frequency), and partially because I&#x27;m just not that high-maintenance. Well, I&#x27;m in a job now where I have occasion to meet vendors, etc, and I need to look more professional on a regular basis. I was going to go to a salon this weekend, but I really didn&#x27;t feel like laying down the cash for something that I was going to have to go back for repeatedly...but I also know that just painting my nails doesn&#x27;t really work anymore because it chips off too easily and I *really* don&#x27;t have the time to reapply every few days, and have to wait for it to dry without being productive (very annoying).&lt;br /&gt;So...long story short (too late), I took the plunge and bought this baby today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with Red Carpet Red (obviously), so I bought white as well and went with the classic French tips. They could look better, but that&#x27;s only because I am out of practice and didn&#x27;t use any guides, but, aside from my own lack of expertise in this area, I am as happy as I could be, and I will get better with practice. And now I&#x27;m actually *excited* to do my nails again. Can&#x27;t wait to get some more colors and get all festive and junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fingers: It took about 2 hours from start to finish, but, as stated, I am out of practice...plus I had to read the instructions very carefully and do everything step-by-step because I didn&#x27;t wantto risk messing anything up...and it didn&#x27;t help that I was watching Criminal Minds at the same time, as well as cooking dinner. I packed it up and then decided to do my toes (also French tip), and this time it took a little over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, considering that I didn&#x27;t have to leave my living room *and* I got to watch Shemar Moore all within around the same time it might have taken to drive to a salon and get all four extremities done, I&#x27;d say this was a really good deal. It will have more than paid for itself in two &#x27;visits.&#x27; Hopefully it will last as long as it should and my excitement will remain intact...but if it doesn&#x27;t, I will at least first try to determine if it was &#x27;user error.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very very glad I decided to go for it. Oh and I love the little train case it comes with.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but it does take me several hours (2) to do whole manicure. Paid for itself in 2 mani&#x27;s. Lasts about 20 days.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing! I got for her birthday after she borrowed same unit from a friend and loved it. Her nails look great for weeks.</li>
            <li> This item is a waste of money. It does not work well, does not dry, not worth a penny. And you cannot return it once you open it. Customer service was horrible. Did not respond to my emails. They know its an item you cannot return based on amazon policy as it is considered a beauty product so they just ignore you. Do not buy anything from this seller. They are terrible.</li>
            <li> Works great!  So happy I decided to buy it on Black Friday when it was only 39.99!  Best purchase ever!!!  I used gelish nail polish and it works just as good as the red carpet manicure brand!</li>
            <li> I orderd this through Amazon.com because this product qualified for free super saver shipping.  When I received the product there was a defect wtih the adapter cord - it would not fit into the LED lamp therefore making the kit unable to use.  Aparently, b/c this item has hazardous materials, Amazon will not replace or refund me for it.  (interesting as they were the ones to ship it out to me).  Hoping I get better help from the manufacturer - still waiting to hear back from their customer service.</li>
            <li> Came with everything I needed and clear instructions. The polish is quick to put on (compared to regular polish that has to dry between each coat) and last TWO weeks (where as I couldn&#x27;t get regular polish to last 2 days).</li>
            <li> I received this kit as a gift from my husband for my birthday. I love gel manicures and used to frequent a salon on a twice-monthly basis to have my nails done. This kit has enabled me to do my own gel nails with salon quality look and staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Ensure that you read the directions VERY CAREFULLY. Every single negative review I&#x27;ve read describes issues that are a result of not following the instructions properly. If you are not familiar with the process, go visit a salon and have a gel manicure applied to your nails professionally, then after two weeks, when it begins to chip, go back and have them remove the manicure so that you see how that is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the Red Carpet (RC) Gel Manicure kit:&lt;br /&gt;1. LED light (Professional OR portable-My kit came with a portable, but the kit appears to have been upgraded to now include the professional light)&lt;br /&gt;2. The 3 coats that set your manicure: Prep, Structure, and Brilliance&lt;br /&gt;3. An oil to revive your cuticles: Revitalize&lt;br /&gt;4. Small bottles of acetone and alcohol: Erase and Purify&lt;br /&gt;5. One RC Gel LED Color: Red Carpet Reddy (a true Red polish)&lt;br /&gt;6. Instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not come with:&lt;br /&gt;1. Items necessary for removal: (1) Cuticle pusher to help remove the polish; (2) Cotton to soak in acetone, (3) foil wraps (tin foil works fine) to wrap around acetone soaked cotton)&lt;br /&gt;2. Orange Sticks to help remove polish that goes beyond the nail line (ensuring that no nail polish cures on your skin helps prevent the polish from &#x27;lifting&#x27;).&lt;br /&gt;3. Nail file/nail buffer&lt;br /&gt;4. Power for the LED Light: My kit came with the portable LED light and did not come with batteries or power cord to power the lights. The cord could be easily purchased but we had two batteries on hand to use so that is what I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Kit is VERY easy to use if you have experience with Gel manicures.&lt;br /&gt;-Staying power: The quality is excellent as the color lasts me a solid two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;-Beautiful: I can&#x27;t say enough about how gorgeous this kit makes my nails look. I&#x27;ve used three different color so far and am extraordinarily happen with the results.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy removal with pure acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-In general the process is time consuming... but at least I&#x27;m at home instead of in a salon!&lt;br /&gt;-The Red Carpet colors are very light, they require multiple coats which can be time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;-Kit only comes with one color.&lt;br /&gt;-The portable light: It requires longer curing times than the professional light and can only fit four fingers at a time requiring me to do 3 separate curing phases for each step of the process. This is annoying and will most likely cause me to purchase a professional LED light that can fit an entire hand and will cure more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is TOTALLY worth the money. If you (or someone you&#x27;re looking to purchase a gift for) likes gel manicures but hates the dent in their wallet from visiting a salon all the time, this kit is a gold mine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this manicure kit I always have a problem with my nailpolish chipping after a day but this gel polish lasts for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> One word...AMAZING!!  Follow the directions and you&#x27;ll have beautiful nails that last 2+ weeks!</li>
            <li> Review: I purchased this kit at Ulta and so far so good. I have painted my nails and toe nails three different times with different colors and love it. I would definitly recommend this product and would recommend the pro version. While I don&#x27;t have the other version this cures my nails in a quick amount time and couldn&#x27;t image waiting 2 mintues for my nails to cure each time. One reason why I like thos product so much is that in a short amount of time I have beautiful looking nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: I watched a lot of youtube videos to get a better idea about how to use this product. This is essential when learning how to apply this polish because it is technical in a sense. For example, when you put the structure coat on you need to ensure that it does not touch you cutiles or skin in anyway. If it does then the polish is more apt to come off sooner. Essentially, the edges have to be smooth to stick properly. My first time around was a bit rough but last time I painted both my nails and toe nails in 30 minutes and they look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing to note is that the nails colors are a little deceiving from the outside of the bottle. Be sure to open the colors to know what they actually look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, love it and will save a TON of money.</li>
            <li> This was a gilf for my granddauther and she loved it. She has used it a few times and her nail looks good.</li>
            <li> Just did my friends nails. I love this.</li>
            <li> Pays for itself in first use. So easy to use and it&#x27;s perfect for a new &amp; busy mom. :)</li>
            <li> I first purchased the kit because paying at the salon was becoming too much and I disliked how they file the nail bed. My nails became very fragile. I have been using Red Carpet for  about  6 months now.  The first couple of tries were pretty awful, compared to the salon, but I hung in there and now they look just as good as the salon.It took me a couple tries to make sure the nail was clean of cotton fiber (if you use cotton balls), to perfect my strokes with the brush , and to get the dry time right. Mine dry with using the timer twice. Cleaning off the tackiness is no problem and takes seconds. Well worth the cost. I am proud of the money I&#x27;ve saved!!!</li>
            <li> This kit gives you a great, un-chippable manicure. I was a little worried by the fact that sometimes my fingers burned when I put them under the uv light.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom because I knew how great the product is and she too fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> Gave this to my mother for Christmas.  She loves it!  So easy for her to use. It takes the first time to learn how to apply not so heavy, and she has it mastered. She plans on trying lots of new colors.  This is a must if you love having beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!! Does a great job and quickly.  So happy with this product! !!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Why pay the crazy prices for a salon manicure when you can have the easy to use kit at home? It pays for itself after a couple of uses, I would highly recommend (and I did!) to friends and family!</li>
            <li> I do not vive 5 stars because if you used for too long make your nails weak</li>
            <li> Polish is a little thick, didn&#x27;t dry completely, better if someone else does it for you, finish is completely smooth though</li>
            <li> I got this item and same as everyone else it had leaked inside the pacakge and was all over the light.  It says I can return it but I am going to persue getting a refund this is ridiculous I paid a ton for this piece of s***!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product twice and my nails were damaged from using this product.  It&#x27;s been a month since I used it and my nails are still trying to recover.</li>
            <li> The prep one was broke when I got it, but the others work really well. it&#x27;s always fun having my nails done by myself!!</li>
            <li> Got it for $40. I was thrilled as I&#x27;m not exactly rich but really wanted this. Works just like it should. Comes with a bottle of removed (100% acetone nail polish removed), a bottle of &amp;#34;purify&amp;#34; (isopropyl alcohol - just use some rubbing alcohol when it runs out), a bright red gel polish, a gel base coat, a gel top coat, some cuticle oil, a little prep bottle, and of course the UV light. Reallllly bright, I usually try to use sun block on my hands and throw a little washcloth over it as it&#x27;s curing so that I&#x27;m not blinded by the bright light.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I love it!  I love it!  I love it!  No complaints!</li>
            <li> very fussy to use....time consuming....not even close to salon results, might as well just use regular good quality polish.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy just like they said. If you are a 1st timer, like I was, I would also get the accessory kit - because they reference the items in that throughout the directions. If you are a pro at giving yourself maincures, then just ignore that and use the kit. It is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Decent product but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with large hands. I would recommend it for feet</li>
            <li> This product/system is not what I was expecting. It is no different than the ones you can get at Walmart.  The nails last about 3 days and then peal off. It does not come with a stick or emery board.</li>
            <li> I read buyer reviews when I am deciding to purchase an online product.  Hope this review is helpful.  I’ve heard of gel manicure benefits which made me curious about affordable DIY kits.  After several days of intense research I decided on The Red Carpet kit.  There are others kits that offere a more professional approach and  are highly recommended but cost much more.  This kit too had high reviews and includes everything you will need. The UV light is spacious enough for 4 fingers/hand (do thumbs separately) and 5 toes and has a built in timer.  The gel product goes on like a very thick nail polish and is very easy to apply.  Just remember to put each layer on thin not thick and follow the instructions.  Its that simple ..really!  FYI:  I’m giving 4/5 stars because I don’t care for the red color polish that comes with the kit. Though I used it for my manicure.  First day out with my new manicure 3 people commented on how nice my nails looked.  I decided to see if the gel products would work with my already purchased 2 Minute Sally Hansen Nail products for my pedicure and it worked just fine.  No signs of chipping at all 7+ days…sweet!  This kit was a good investment for me.  Just be careful who you purchase it from on Amazon.  This seller was great to work with.  There was another one I previously purchased from that didn’t have the product but advertised having several of them.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to finally have an at home gel mani kit. I did a lot of research befor I bought, and I&#x27;m glad I did. Red Carpet Manicure has 59 colors to date, and the colors only cost $10 each. This is much better than OPI&#x27;s $17 each. The bottles of color are smaller than OPI&#x27;s but I would rather have more colors and rebuy one that I use a lot than only have 2 or 3 from OPI.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are very clear and easy to follow. I did my first manicur in &amp;#34;Candid Moment&amp;#34;. It is a very light, sheer pink. I am glad I used a light color for my first try because I notice little mistakes I made, but they are not noticible to everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;The entire manicure only took 30 mins, max. and I am on day 4 with no chips at all!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. Anyone can do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside:&lt;br /&gt;The light is only big enough for 4 fingers. You have to do the thumb seperately. This is only slightly annoying. One would think that splurging for the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; set would give you a light big enough for your whole hand, but its not the end of the world.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all&lt;br /&gt;Polish never dries completely no matter how much u use the led light&lt;br /&gt;wish it could be returned after opening</li>
            <li> So far I really like the product.  I have used it 2 times and the color stays on for at least one week without damage.  I have not yet gotten 2 weeks out of a single application.  This kit only comes with red.  For the price, it should throw in a few more colors.</li>
            <li> I just tried it and its amazing! I love the turnout, i would give it 5/5 stars but it kinda feels like my hand burns with the base coat. That might be harmful im not sure, but aside from that i love it!</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the better vendors. A+ shopping experience; top quality product; super fast service. I would recommend them without reservation.</li>
            <li> Does not work. My nails would dry faster if i put them in front of a fan. This product is a waste of money and cannot be returned. Save your money and anticipations.</li>
            <li> This is the best kit. Follow the directions and you will have professional looking nails without the expense of the salon. Use thin layers, do not overdo it. they last at least two weeks for me and even more, if I don&#x27;t mind a little wear showing after that, but I usually change it after two weeks, so I am not bored with the same color. I find I can get my nails done in about 20 minutes now that I have practice.</li>
            <li> I got a red polish that came with the kit. I would&#x27;ve preferred white...but honestly that&#x27;s just me being picky...product works great for at home nail work</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had nice nails unless I went to get them professionally done.... I like this because it makes the nails hard (i.e. impossible to bite) and also makes the nails look great... it is a cost up front, that saves you a lot of money in the long run from not having to go to a nail salon</li>
            <li> Put on the layers as THIN as possible! And make sure they cover each other evenly and that the light hits all parts of the nail. If you do these things you will have a salon quality manicure for a very small fraction of the price in about 30 minutes. Lasts about 10 days, more if your hands aren&#x27;t in much water. Regular nail polish would last maybe 2 days for me so it was basically pointless. This is an amazing alternative that I cannot believe I did not try sooner. One caveat, it&#x27;s hard to get off. Resist the urge to peel or end up with damaged nails.</li>
            <li> I am extremely excited about this product. So far everything is going great. Love it!</li>
            <li> One star.  Would give zero.  Ordered from Amazon.  I gave this as a gift to my daughter for Christmas.  We tried to do manicures and our nails were not drying.  Flipped the light over to see if something was wrong and one of the lights is out.  I don&#x27;t know why our nails wouldn&#x27;t dry with the other two lights working.  I have never done gel nails before.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to see how to return this item.  Nonreturnable because it is considered hazardous material.  What now?</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Everything came as stated in product review. Extremely satisfied with everything! Very easy to operate and long-lasting nail color!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and watched a couple of YouTube videos to make sure I applied the gel correctly.  My first manicure turned out great and lasted 4 weeks before I got the first chip on one nail.  I followed the directions and tips exactly and it was time consuming but totally worth the effort and initial expense as I will save lots of money and have amazing looking nails all year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a regular nail file to scuff the nails and super thin coats for base, color, and top.  Because the \\&quot;polish\\&quot; does not air dry at all, you can take the time to slowly and carefully apply each coat and you can remove excess with the brush to obtain the thin coat necessary (thin is necessary to property cure the gel).  I painted my left thumb first and then the four left fingers completely from prep to top coat before doing my right hand.  The gel is not completely cured/set until you finish the final step so you want to do one hand at a time.  I&#x27;m right handed, so when I painted my right hand and then did the final step Purify, I messed up two of the nails somewhere in the process but didn&#x27;t realize until I wiped them at the end.  I just repainted color on the two nails, cured, and repainted top coat, cured, and used Purify and it fixed it perfectly.  The two nails that I messed up on and fixed weren&#x27;t even the one that chipped after 4 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks, I ended up painting two coats of OPI color and OPI top coat on top of the gel in order to hide the nail growth and because I felt like using a different color.  Before I bought this kit, an OPI manicure that I gave myself lasted 4 days before it chipped.  The OPI polish on top of the gel lasted for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used cut up cotton pads soaked in Erase and wrapped each finger with aluminum foil.  Wait 15 minutes and then use an orange stick to scrape off gel.  Only unwrap the nail that you are ready to scrape so the gel does not reharden.  Removal using this method was easy and did not damage the nails (but again was time consuming but worth it for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used two polishes so far.  I loved 132 Glitz &amp; Glamorous.  It is a sophisticated red with a pretty shimmer.  Two thin coats gave great coverage.  I wasn&#x27;t as happy with 133 Only in Hollywood just because it took three thin coats (and probably could have used a 4th but I was sick of painting my nails by then).  This one is a bright red polish with red glitter pieces suspended in the red.  I think the red base has to be thinner in order for the glitter to show through.  It turned out very pretty (especially since I chose it for Christmas week) but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it every day.  At least I can cover it after Christmas with regular polish and extend my manicure.</li>
            <li> not the best for the price,hard to get all just right maybe i need to practice more. like to have never got off with the removers</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying my own system, and after reading countless reviews, I decided I definitely wanted an LED light (rather than UV).  I must say....money well spent!  I´m a salon ¨snob¨....meaning, if I pay money, I want an amazing manicure and pedicure.  I usually am pleased at the salon, but gel polish is so expensive, and while it lasts forever, it grows out and there is white nail space where there should be color.  Now with this Red Carpet system at home, I can save a TON of money.  Not only can I take off my own polish (which can range from 8-12 dollars at the salon...and the bottle to do it at home is under $7), but the convenience of sitting at home with a coffee and music while doing my nails is priceless!  I would HIGHLY recommend this system.  Shell out the money now...and SAVE in the future! :-) Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife as a suggestion from her friend for christmas.  I got good points for that one.</li>
            <li> I bought this starter set about a year ago.  Use to have acrylic nails and then went to gel nails through the salon.  Wasn&#x27;t happy about paying $30 + everytime I went.  Decided to try this and make the investment.  I do my nails every two weeks and the only thing I have added to the set is different colors throughout the last year.  When I walk in to get my pedicures, they ask me if I want a fill.  My nails look like they did when I was wearing acrylics.  They have grown super long and are the strongest they have been.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Everyone asks where I get my nails done and I say I do them myself.  They are shocked.  It takes all of about 15-20 minutes and you are out the door - no dry time - I love it!</li>
            <li> Used also with other gel polishes with great success!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. There&#x27;s Nothing I do not like about it.</li>
            <li> I typically have a hard time keeping nail polish on my nails. I found the red carpet manicure kit on sale at Target, and decided to try it. It works wonderfully! It takes AT LEAST a week before my nails start to show any kind of wear (i am very hard on my hands and nails). I have tried Sally Hansen, and this is a far superior product. If you like having a gel manicure, but do not want to pay for the salon, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND PURCHASED THIS KIT FOR ME SO I COULD DO MY GEL NAILS AT HOME AND NOT HAVE TO SPEND A TON OF MONEY AT THE SALON. SO I TRIED IT AND WOW! I LOVE MY NAILS! MY HUSBAND SAID THEY ARE BETTER LOOKING NOW THAN WHEN I WENT TO THE SALON. ITS AN EASY KIT TO USE. THE ONLY BIT OF A PROBLEM I HAD WAS WHEN I WOULD CURE THE LED LIGHT WOULD STING MY FINGER NAILS A LITTLE.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, but buy separate polishes. The one included chips a lot more easily than gel should. Also they are very small sized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as good as the salon tech so they don&#x27;t look as good but same quality. Neat little kit.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles were open and empty. Also, the dc cord that came in the box is too small for the pin of the light... So it cannot connect to the power to turn on. I would recommend NOT purchasing this brand. Amazon did fully refund my money since it was sold through Amazon and thanks to Amazon for making it a easy return.</li>
            <li> I finally buckled down and bought this last month, and I am extremely happy with it. Some people complain that it chips or peels and it has done that to me once because I didn&#x27;t apply it properly due to being lazy and thinking that it would be okay. Well it wasn&#x27;t, but again that was my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t last 2 weeks for me, but I am an office manager for a cocktail catering company and I bartend on weekends. I am loading and unloading tons of cases of beer and wine and opening boxes and just doing a lot of jobs that make my nails hate me. And I am a mom to a 4 year old boy who has me running around like a crazy lady. It does last 7-9 days and I am actually okay with that since it is still better than regular nail polish and cheaper than going to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that I need to make sure I have a good 20 minutes or so to do all the steps properly on both hands, and to make sure that I don&#x27;t rush, and that I have a steady hand. If you don&#x27;t mind being patient for a few minutes and you want to save tons of money by being able to do this at home instead of going to a salon, then I suggest you buy this kit. You will not be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that I have really weak nails that break all the time and ever since I started to use this my nails haven&#x27;t broken at all and look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, sometimes you can find the polishes for this on other sites for buy 1 get 1 50% off. Which is awesome since they are $10.</li>
            <li> Poor quality....over rated and over charged for something that its simply not word it!!!!!! the size of the lamp it&#x27;s for kids size hands.....just a sorry produc!!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. Three uses and you&#x27;ve basically made your money back that you would have spent at a nail salon. I do recommend using the LED nail polish. I tried using just regular nail polish and it doesn&#x27;t work unfortunately. So you will have to spend the $10 per bottle of LED polish for it to work. The polish stayed on about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> After a little practice, works awesome!  Lasts about 2 weeks and saves going to the salon and spending $30 - $35 a trip!!!!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
            <li> I was spending a lot of money on gel nails, then gel nail polish that I was not completely happy with. I realized I could do the same thing to my one nails. It&#x27;s so easy and they turn out just as nice as the salons. The bonus is, I can do them whenever I feel like it. I recommend this product and that&#x27;s coming from someone who is very picky.</li>
            <li> thought is came with more. Its okay but can be a better value elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The kit doesn&#x27;t work. The polish peels after a day.</li>
            <li> This is a must buy for those gel nail or shellac nail lovers! I spend about $40+ every other week at nail salon until recently when I discovered Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 Starter Kit. I can do it at home whenever I want, I even put some sparkly stones on my nails to make it prettier. At the salon, they usually charge you $5 per finger if you want them to put plastic stones on. I ordered Swarovski crystals from ebay and design my nails myself. It looks beautiful and I don&#x27;t have to spend much at all! One thing that you really need to watch for is clean your hands thoroughly and make sure you do each step as described, or else your nail polish will start peeling. Also I recommend purchasing this at ULTA using their weekly coupons (sometimes 20% off, other times $10 or $3.50 off) because they allow you to return this product within 60 days at full refund, if you didn&#x27;t find it useful or for any other reasons. Hope you find this review helpful and enjoy your nail designs! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I also purchased Red Carpet Manicure Gems and Jewels and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I contemplated buying a gel nail kit for a while.  I looked at Sally Beauty, Sephora (OPI), and Ulta.  Red Carpet was the cheapest of all of them and Amazon has the best price by about $15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process was so simple and the instructions were very easy to follow.  They turned out great the very first time I did them.  The only thing I need to do is give my cuticles more attention before starting my nails.  A good manicure will make them look more professional....although I felt mine looked very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to regular ole nail polish application this will save you time...if you are accustomed to putting on more than one coat of polish.  There&#x27;s no drying time..just a cure time.  There three coats of gel nail polish but it doesn&#x27;t take long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to remember is that the nail polish is more expensive but Red Carpet was the cheapest.  They are $10 compared to OPI for $18 and Sally for about $12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so excited about this product and would recommend it everyone.  It saves me time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this kit for about almost 8 months now and I LOVE IT! Like with any other polish, some colors have a thicker consistency than others. I have yet to have any polish chip but I make sure I apply my prep &amp; structure very well. Polishes usually run $10-$15 depending on the type. I&#x27;ve gotten some good deals on line like BOGO. My polish lasts about 3 wks just for the simple fact that I&#x27;ve never had a color on for more than 3 wks. I hate having a gap between my cuticle and my polish, so the max I can go is 3 wks! I&#x27;ve even had coworkers ask if I can do their gel nails and they&#x27;ll pay me because they&#x27;ve gotten chips in gel polish after only 2-3 days of visiting the salon! I am ashamed of how much money I used to spend on getting my nails done! If you buy a polish once a month, it&#x27;s roughly $144/yr. If you spend about $100 a month at the nail salon, that&#x27;s $1,200/yr. You&#x27;re saving yourself $1,056 A YEAR with this kit! I&#x27;m loving all my extra money!!!!</li>
            <li> great deal for a good product.  great instructions included.  very easy to follow instructions and use.  I definitely got the right one and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ok as a starter kit but you&#x27;re better off buying components seperate. The pre/post clean is just alcohol. The remover is acetone which you can buy a bigger bottle at a beauty store. This leaves the polishes (only red color in lit) and UV light. The polishes are in a very small bottle and the UV light is too small to fit your entire hand. So if you are looking for convenience and one stop starter this is a good kit. If you are looking for long term supplies get the components seperate.</li>
