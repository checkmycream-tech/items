            <li>It seemed nice but didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>However, I live in the desert which is very drying...  </li>
            <li>I first noticed that it came in a pretty big bottle, it&#x27;s 2.0 oz.</li>
            <li>I can pump one and half pumps worth for my full face and neck.</li>

            <li>I have high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I can finally say I have found a product that actually works &amp; works quite well quickly!  </li>
            <li>It is a new product called Hyaluronic acid serum by Paul Joseph Skincare.</li>

            <li> I have used other anti-aging skin creams and have always been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is winter here now and my skin gets so bad it can bleed from the harsh winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle.</li>

            <li> So far not impressed. I received this yesterday and it either comes out as a watery thin liquid or lumpy gel that won&#x27;t soak in. I tried shaking the bottle hoping it would mix together but it didn&#x27;t work. Maybe I got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Already see a difference. Use this with a derma-roller and my skin is softer and plumper.</li>
            <li> I think my skin appears healthier, but no miracles here.  However, I live in the desert which is very drying...  Good thing is no negative side effects... Worth trying for others.</li>
            <li> I found this product very drying</li>
            <li> Why am I extremely happy with my results so far. It is a new product called Hyaluronic acid serum by Paul Joseph Skincare. What is it? An airless pump serum that comes out of the bottle. When it comes out of the pump it is clear and thick not runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is winter here now and my skin gets so bad it can bleed from the harsh winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying it to my elbows, face and neck which have been showing some dryness. To the point on my elbows are now very flaky and rough to the touch. Now I am noticing my skin on my elbows are smoother than before I started using this.  That is something I haven&#x27;t had in awhile. I am dry on my elbows year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! I am also using Hyaluronic Acid serum on my face and neck. I can pump one and half pumps worth for my full face and neck. When I pumped it out of the bottle first time in my fingers I felt a cooling effect. I even blew lightly on my skin and cooled even more.  The lavender scent makes it very relaxing to use. Since I have been using this serum my skin looks brighter. Which makes me feel younger. I look like I have a healthy glow to my face. I have starting to notice my skin is tightening back up and lifting the skin back where it was a few years back. I would have to say this is a fountain of youth wrapped up in this compacted bottle.</li>
            <li> So far I love the product.   3/23/15:   This is an update after using this product for almost three weeks.  I cannot believe the difference in my skin.  My family tells me that I look 10 years younger, that my complexion is radiant and that my skin is so soft.  I have used other anti-aging skin creams and have always been disappointed.  This product is fabulous.  Now when I put it on, I can actually feel it working.   Paul Joseph, I cannot thank you enough.    Tish F</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the changes yetðŸ˜•</li>
            <li> From the 1st time I put it on my face I could tell a difference!  It only takes a nickel size amount to make your face feel like pure silk!  I would recommend this product for any age, I am 44 and starting to notice the fine lines &amp; wrinkles and with this product you can feel the difference in your skin in just a week!  With make up and without you can see the lines fading and the soft natural glow of your skin coming thru.  The difference has been truly amazing &amp; I can finally say I have found a product that actually works &amp; works quite well quickly!  I received this product at a discounted price for my honest unbiased opinion and I say buy more than one at a time cause you will fall in love right away!  I will definitely make many more purchases of this serum!  The results are amazing and I really can&#x27;t wait to see the difference months even years down the road!  I even use it on my hands for the aging and have noticed a huge difference also!  Highly recommend this for women of all ages!</li>
            <li> I am trying to put up the good fight against aging.  Even with that said, I&#x27;m, noticing more lines on my forehead and around my eyes.  I was recommended this product from a friend, so decided to try it out.  I&#x27;m very pleased to say after a week I&#x27;ve noticed skin improvement.  No overnight results, but my skin does look healthier and feels amazing.  I use this morning and night.  About two small pumps is enough to cover my face and neck.  I&#x27;ve also been using on my chest area too.  It absorbs quickly, with no greasy after feeling.  I did receive this at a promotional discount in exchange for my unbiased review.  I&#x27;ve used this after my Derma roller as well. I feel it may work faster that way.  I do have oily skin that&#x27;s breakout prone.  I&#x27;ve not experienced any irritation or breakouts  while using this product. I will continue to use this as my fight against aging continues.  I would recommend this as I happy with the results.</li>

I&amp;#34;m so excited to see what more this little bottle of magic can do after more long term use. Immediately upon using the product, my skin felt and looked more hydrated, smoother, and softer. Hyaluronic Acid is  very potent and effective ingredient that will keep you looking great for years to come. I apply this product every night before i go to bed and when I wake up in the morning, my skin looks refreshed and brighter and overall younger. This is different than other products in the same category because of the added vitamins such as aloe and lavender oil which reduces the puffiness and the signs of aging. It&#x27;s literally a bottle of magic, and a lot less expensive and less invasive than botox or any kind of surgery. Give it a try, and be amazed just like I was. After long term use, I will edit this review so you can see a before and after photo. I was just so excited at the short term results, that I had to share my excitement with any potential buyers. I did order this at a promotional price in order to give an honest evaluation of the product. After careful observation, I am confident in my 5 star rating and am sure that you will love it!</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a week, but I do like it. It is absorbed in my skin really fast. and I think I see affects of it working already. My skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> It seemed nice but didn&#x27;t last very long I didn&#x27;t even get 3 weeks out of it</li>
            <li> The instructions are simple add two drops and and water, the pump on the bottle is really nice. Just 2 pumps is all it takes for your face and neck. Leaves a nice smell of lavender. It&#x27;s like having botox to your skin.  I absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a product that leaves your skin smooth &amp; soft, This is my opinion after testing this product.I was selected to try this Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Face and Skin with Vitamin A-C-D &amp; E-lavender Oil.</li>
            <li> I received this product at discount price for my honest and unbiased review and am so grateful for the opportunity. Im one that don&#x27;t get proper sleep and it definitely shows under my eyes. Since using this hyaluronic acid serum my eyes look 10 yrs younger. The fragrance is just right not to overbearing. It also has helped with my oily skin. Its now baby soft.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes my face clear and smooth...still fighting a few lines...</li>
            <li> Fantastic i love it â™¡â™¡â™¡</li>
            <li> It does tighten the pores and might help saggy skin but didn&#x27;t do any magic on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help control these deep wrinkles on my forehead. The first time I used it I saw a difference in my skin. I could feel it  pulling my skin. I use every 2 days for now. It works!!</li>
            <li> THE COMBINATION OF THE HYALURONIC ACID SERUM AND VITAMIN C SERUM SEEMS TO BE WORKING.  AFTER TWO WEEKS, THERE IS A NOTICIBLE DIFFERENCE IN THE RADIENCE IN MY SKIN.  I AM GOING TO PURCHASE FOR MY FRIENDS! SO FAR SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy! Im 19 and have oily acne prone skin.I have been using it for a week, and my skin is silky smooth and I have not developed any new blemishes. I use it 2 times a day and in love. They hit the nail on the head with this one. I&#x27;m going to get my mom this stuff for chirstmas because for the price why not!</li>
