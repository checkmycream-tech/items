            <li>Very light and thorough cleansing soap for face and most make-up.</li>
            <li>When I have time, I let it sit on my skin for 5-10 minutes, but most days I just wash and rinse.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and hopefully my skin would be better.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but better than any soap I had before.</li>

            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to a friend for sure.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial product I have ever used..very good on my skin..also reduces the look of my pores which is very important to me..gives my face a very clean and fresh look</li>
            <li>great for combination, sensitive, acneprone skin.</li>
            <li>For me, this is an easy choice.  </li>
            <li>Scent is not that strong, which I like.</li>
            <li>Great soap for facial cleansing</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin gorg and wrinkle free at 33.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and lathers very well.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Great mild, simple face soap</li>
            <li>It is very good for getting lingering, stubborn makeup &amp; other impurities out of your pores!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s travel friendly, moisturizes, softens skin</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to use this soap!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I were rich ...</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean without the tightness after.</li>
            <li>Skin feels clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>not bad.</li>
            <li>I use it for a quick wash or as a mask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild with an old-fashioned&lt;br /&gt;rose</li>
            <li>But&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s still better than the harsher SLS and parabens found in most commercial soaps.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Such a lovely product from Sweden!</li>
            <li>l use it almost every morning because this soap is very light not heavy as foam cleanser</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I have sensitive skin, it hasn&#x27;t irritated or caused more breakouts either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Using a BB cream is all I need,  if that, my face is becoming that clear.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many soaps that claim to not dry your skin out, this one delivers on its promise.</li>
            <li>Mild and gentle lather.</li>
            <li>As a mature woman I enjoy the tightening feeling and softness after a wash.</li>
            <li>They all come back and ask me to order more for them.</li>
            <li>My favorite facial soap/quick mask.  </li>
            <li>I do love this facial soap.</li>
            <li>No perfume just smells clean and very soft on skin.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt so smooth and clean without feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and a little bit more brighter!</li>
            <li>Does not dry the skin and works fabulously as a mask.  </li>
            <li>My face does feel firmer after washing, similar to how it feels when you use eggwhites as a mask, but the smell was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>My new favorite for facial cleansing.</li>
            <li>I have used before and really like it.  </li>
            <li>My face feels and looks much smoother.  </li>
            <li>shipping was really fast</li>
            <li>Skin is left soft with a healthy glow</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast and were same I had purchased at N!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and works so well on my round Swedish face!</li>
            <li>Last for while, which is good since it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li>I will reorder again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>have normal to oily skin but did not have any acne or pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for washing my face, usually, I have been using regular soaps or Clearsil.&lt;br /&gt;After using Lanolin Agg soap, my face is more clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean, yet does not dry out my already dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took about a month to clear up my skin and it has stayed clear.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients  are as natural as they will get for a soap.</li>
            <li>I really think this does the same thing.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive, and I have lupus.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the price for a box of these soaps was affordable.</li>
            <li>When ordering, be sure to look at soap size, there is a small version that is tiny.</li>
            <li>Only negatives are the high price and lanolin.</li>
            <li>As an African-American who is the age she is and, on a fixed income,  using this soap daily and mask every other day, fine lines on my face and decolletage are totally diminishing!</li>
            <li>the soap seems to last much longer than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>They helped clear up my acne (I also use pure jojoba oil mixed with a few drops of tea tree oil as a moisturizer) and one bar will last me just over 2 months, even by using it 2x per day.</li>
            <li>I read a few articles before selecting this soap, one of the professional reviewer had high remarks for this</li>

            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> This soap rinses well, lathers well, and has a very faint scent of rose water.</li>
            <li> So dry bar off after using to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time</li>
            <li> Because I have dry skin, I use this for my body as well.</li>
            <li> If you have problems  with blackheads and dry patches of skin on your face then this is the soap you need to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not make your skin feel dry after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I do have combo skin, so dryer skins may need to use only a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers are correct in writing this soap pulls out impurities, and users must be patient; I like that.</li>
            <li> gave a  bar to my friend who suffers with exzema and it really calmed her skin down.  </li>
            <li> Have been without them for a few years.</li>
            <li> I found this product by accident several years ago and was unable to obtain it again until Amazon.</li>
            <li> They are on the small size.</li>
            <li> Anything else I break out and get dull skin.</li>
            <li> Does not dry my skin out too badly</li>
            <li> I had pimples and bad skin problems after I moved to dry area.</li>
            <li> but i was a tad disappointed in the small size.</li>
            <li> Sad face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;so be careful to use it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> not bad. i think it&#x27;s good for oily skin</li>
            <li> I found this product by accident several years ago and was unable to obtain it again until Amazon. This stuff is great. It&#x27;s travel friendly, moisturizes, softens skin and you can use a a d facial mask. That&#x27;s a great deal coming from just one bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;Though I have sensitive skin, it hasn&#x27;t irritated or caused more breakouts either. Can&#x27;t wait to reorder!</li>
            <li> My face skin is like egg shell now</li>
            <li> These are awesome! They helped clear up my acne (I also use pure jojoba oil mixed with a few drops of tea tree oil as a moisturizer) and one bar will last me just over 2 months, even by using it 2x per day. When I have time, I let it sit on my skin for 5-10 minutes, but most days I just wash and rinse. I do this every morning and every night.</li>
            <li> I will purchase again!  Long lasting. Great suds. As a mature woman I enjoy the tightening feeling and softness after a wash. I do not find this soap drying at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent! They are on the small size. So dry bar off after using to make them last longer. They are wonderful but i was a tad disappointed in the small size. They were the size of guest soaps.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It leaves your skin feeling clean without the tightness after.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! Thx!</li>
            <li> I have used before and really like it.  Does not dry the skin and works fabulously as a mask.  Last for while, which is good since it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Great mild, simple face soap</li>
            <li> I had pimples and bad skin problems after I moved to dry area. So I just purchased it since I heard the soap is nice and hopefully my skin would be better. I used it for a week (sort of like facial mask- leave foams on your face and wait 2-3 mins then wash) and my pimples are gone!!! Also my skin feels like egg shell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this product and it made me to give a shot. I don&#x27;t see the best result out of it, but I like it so far. l use it almost every morning because this soap is very light not heavy as foam cleanser or else to use in the morning. Scent is not that strong, which I like. Overall, I give three stars.</li>
            <li> I use this soap after the foam cleanser. My skin feels smoother after i use this purchase. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Great soap has done wonders for my face. Will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> my sister tried the lanolin agg Tval Swedish Eggwhite, n she said its great cuz when u wash your face the white heads will come out</li>
            <li> I read a few articles before selecting this soap, one of the professional reviewer had high remarks for this so I tried it.  Pricey, but better than any soap I had before. The ingredients  are as natural as they will get for a soap.</li>
            <li> This soap rinses well, lathers well, and has a very faint scent of rose water. My pores appear smaller and my face feels smoother. It leaves my face feeling clean, yet does not dry out my already dry skin. Because I have dry skin, I use this for my body as well. It works great for shaving legs too.  I have tried many soaps that claim to not dry your skin out, this one delivers on its promise. When ordering, be sure to look at soap size, there is a small version that is tiny. I like the 50 g size</li>
            <li> This soap cleanses your face without making your skin draw up. It is very good for getting lingering, stubborn makeup &amp; other impurities out of your pores!</li>
            <li> Great soap. I struggle with skin issues. This is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I use this 1-2 times a week and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People brush egg whites on their face to help draw out impurities - which helps with acne, and to tone and tighten the skin.  I really think this does the same thing.  I can tell my pores appear smaller and my skin has a healthier appearance afterward.  It has helped my acne and reduce the appearance of pores.  I am a no fuss type of person, but wanted to do something.  For me, this is an easy choice.  I will reorder again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Mild and gentle lather. Skin feels clean but not stripped. My new favorite for facial cleansing. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love the creamy feel of the lather and the way this soap makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> Received this soap initially as a gift.  Now I cannot be without it!</li>
            <li> This is the best facial product I have ever used..very good on my skin..also reduces the look of my pores which is very important to me..gives my face a very clean and fresh look</li>
            <li> This facial soap has done wonders for my aging skin and larger pores.  My face feels and looks much smoother.  A great product that I will continue to order.  Bonus:  the soap seems to last much longer than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and I have got many of my friends to use it too! They all come back and ask me to order more for them. Such a lovely product from Sweden!</li>
            <li> shipping was really fast and I was so excited to use this soap!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;after using this soap for 2 weeks, my skin started breaking out!&lt;br /&gt;I have normal to oily skin but did not have any acne or pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY SKIN WAS CLAN BEFORE BUT THIS SOAP MADE ME BREAKING OUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so be careful to use it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice soap. No perfume just smells clean and very soft on skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive, and I have lupus. This soap cleanses well and also moisturizes too.good buy</li>
            <li> Very light and thorough cleansing soap for face and most make-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this product all over! I love it! My skin feels softer and a little bit more brighter!</li>
            <li> My favorite facial soap/quick mask.  Wash my face, leave the lather on while I brush my teeth, then rinse.  Skin is left soft with a healthy glow so I don&#x27;t use anything else, i.e., moisturizer, primer, etc.  One bar has lasted 3 years.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Since each soap lasts forever, I gave some to my mom and sister who also love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time and I think it&#x27;s great !! ^_^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also thank you for the gifts !!</li>
            <li> Love it !! My skin have cleared up :)&lt;br /&gt;After I washed my face, my skin feel very good :)</li>
            <li> Great soap for facial cleansing</li>
            <li> i love this soap. great for combination, sensitive, acneprone skin.</li>
            <li> for washing my face, usually, I have been using regular soaps or Clearsil.&lt;br /&gt;After using Lanolin Agg soap, my face is more clean and soft. And I am not using any scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to use it.</li>
            <li> My mom read in the papers that this was a popular product made in Sweden that was selling out in Asia. I thought &amp;#34;really? It must cost a lot then...&amp;#34; She asked me If I could find it for her and I went where I always go- Amazon... where they sell everything. I was surprised that the price for a box of these soaps was affordable. Anyway, after trying this out, I understand what the rage is about. You an you use it either as a cleanser or as a face mask. Because one of the ingredients is egg whites it gives a tightening effect on your face after use. I do feel like it&#x27;s a bit drying but i think that&#x27;s what makes the pores shrink. Don&#x27;t get this stuff in your eye though, it will sting. If you want to see more reviews from the &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; check out Makeupalley.</li>
            <li> This was really nice soap.  Smells great and makes my skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> As an African-American who is the age she is and, on a fixed income,  using this soap daily and mask every other day, fine lines on my face and decolletage are totally diminishing! I can&#x27;t afford fillers, etc. This is the business for me. Other reviewers are correct in writing this soap pulls out impurities, and users must be patient; I like that. I&#x27;m also using a collagen and Vitamin C serum with an antioxidant cream. Getting YEARS back. Using a BB cream is all I need,  if that, my face is becoming that clear.  Everyone will have a different experience,  but this soap works for this kid...</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter have used this product for several years. We also purchase it as gifts for their many friends overseas..</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin gorg and wrinkle free at 33. I&#x27;ve been using for the last 7 years. Anything else I break out and get dull skin.</li>
            <li> It was shipped on time, great quality product.</li>
            <li> If you have problems  with blackheads and dry patches of skin on your face then this is the soap you need to use.&lt;br /&gt;It took about a month to clear up my skin and it has stayed clear.  It does not make your skin feel dry after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I gave a  bar to my friend who suffers with exzema and it really calmed her skin down.  One bar lasts forever.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SOAP!! It&#x27;s amazing and works so well on my round Swedish face!</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago from Nordstrom. Loved them. Have been without them for a few years. Sad face. But with kids who has time for shopping at N? So happy when I found them on Amazon. Arrived super fast and were same I had purchased at N!! My skin responds beautifully to this soap. I use it for a quick wash or as a mask. Does not dry my skin out too badly but I do have combo skin, so dryer skins may need to use only a few times a week. I use this once or twice daily. Love.</li>
            <li> I like this soap. It smells nice, and lathers very well. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the other&#x27;s claims- clear, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> My face does feel firmer after washing, similar to how it feels when you use eggwhites as a mask, but the smell was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Great soap for the price. Leave it on your face as a pack for like 5 minutes and then wash off to use it like a mask also.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt so smooth and clean without feeling dry.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This facial care soap beats anything out on the market now. It is 100% chemical free!!! I will never buy anything else again!!</li>
            <li> As a &amp;quot;soap connoisseur&amp;quot; I&#x27;m always looking for quality soaps. This Swedish product has raised the bar. It&#x27;s mild with an old-fashioned&lt;br /&gt;rose scent. Cleans well but doesnt strip skin. Only negatives are the high price and lanolin. I read that lanolin might contain pesticides. But&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s still better than the harsher SLS and parabens found in most commercial soaps. If I were rich ... I&#x27;d buy this as a Christmas present for family and friends.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. After only a few days using it my skin was much clearer and softer. It definitely gets the gunk out your pores.</li>
            <li> I do love this facial soap. It does feel just like an egg white mask, without the egg white smell. This smells good.  I even parted with one of the Bars and sent it to my step daughter in her birthday box. Would recommend to a friend for sure.</li>
