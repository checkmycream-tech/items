            <li>Smells great.  </li>
            <li>Have used for about 2 months and have definitely experienced tightening and firming of face and neck.</li>
            <li>This is a great serum.  </li>
            <li>Great product line.  </li>
            <li>I heard great things about this line from Peter Thomas Roth, and am blown away.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff,</li>
            <li>This was a good serum</li>
            <li>I am 39 with good skin.  </li>
            <li>good service and good quality</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>this product goes on so smooth and has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light and pleasant..</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to find that I am not allergic to this serum</li>
            <li>and I liked the way it made my skin feel .  </li>
            <li>almost no fragrance at all to be honest.  </li>
            <li>nice on my skin for moisture &amp; firming day &amp; night under creams</li>
            <li>However I do use it @ 3 times a day (more than suggested) and I also use Vitamin C Ester serum.</li>
            <li>Love his products</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>I had not ordered this type of product from Amazon before, but I surely will again.  </li>
            <li>Have used for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>(so if you&#x27;re in your 50s or later, this might not be the best product - perhaps check out PTR UnWrinkle line)..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m middle-aged and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This product does not cause my skin to breakout, it&#x27;s SUPER moisturizing (here&#x27;s lookin&#x27; at you northerners!), and seems to focus more so on prevention of wrinkles/aging</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m also a huge fan of PTR in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am frequently told my skin looks great and &amp;#34;whatever</li>
            <li>Excellent products for half the price means more shopping for me.....</li>
            <li>The fine lines seem to fade away.  </li>
            <li>As I continue to battle the aging process, PTR is always in my corner, helping to reduce the appearance of fine lines, etc.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that line as much for anti-aging reasons, but hey - a cheap and effective SPF?</li>
            <li>Light.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is lightweight and is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>American Dollars, great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use morning as primary moisturizer and at night.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I love this product and certainly the price is a bonus!</li>
            <li>I probably used it more liberally the first month..</li>
            <li>I was tested and discovered that I have become allergic to certain preservatives found in most cosmetic and skin care products (including my favourite spa products Pevonia).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a couple of weeks now , love how my skin feels after use, very silky and moisturized without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Two pumps twice a day, it covers my skin with a creamy consistency, dries quickly and then a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I do weekly exfoliation treatments with a mild glycolic mask as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different serums but this one delivers more than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and was assured that the Peter Thomas Roth serum would give me the anti-wrinkle aspect I was looking for without overwhelming my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Really does help smooth lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I still have laugh and smile lines when I actually laugh or smile..</li>
            <li>tip - Simple offers a moisturizing gel that is great for sensitive/acne-prone skin, and you can pick it up at any drug store or Wal-Mart today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin just soaks it up and my concealer glides right over it.  </li>
            <li>I love it, this is the second purchased.</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old, have used more anti-aging products and spent more money than you can imagine.  </li>
            <li>I am 59, I have used this for a month and although it is pricey for me, I love the way my face feels when I put it on, and the texture of my skin has definitely improved.</li>
            <li>, I will re- purchase another bottle to have a better idea if the product actually improve elasticity and tone...</li>
            <li>I am a mature female and have been able to use many facial skin products over the years without problem.</li>
            <li>Ok.. I will have to say, this stuff actually does reduce the appearance of your fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants there skin to glow and look youthful and radiant</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>it can really help stretch your dollar.</li>
            <li>The online pricing makes it very affordable.</li>
            <li>I really did not see any change or improvement.</li>
            <li>Peter Thomas Roth unwrinkle line has been a real skin saver for me.  </li>
            <li>Not opposed to facials and light therapies for aging skin, I went on a limb to try to save money and once again, go for a topical product.  </li>
            <li>younger and significantly reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li>so now only using a drop or two, I am hoping that I can make it last a little over 2 months to make it more cost effective for</li>
            <li>It took a long time for me to pull the trigger and buy this serum because of the huge price tag</li>
            <li>and I knew I liked it from just the small sample they gave me.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels more plumped and firm to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Having spent my late teens and twenties, and now thirties fighting the future signs of aging as best</li>
            <li>, this works better, for far less money.</li>
            <li>Use PTR products regularly and this is right up there with others I use.  </li>
            <li>I CANNOT WAIT TO RECEIVE THE NEW NIGHT&lt;</li>
            <li>I use a couple of other products from PTR, and find this really makes my face super soft.</li>
            <li>I generally like Peter Thomas Roth products, but this one not so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 years old and it broke my face out!</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd bottle and while pricey (I paid 150 for the first bottle..</li>
            <li>In late 20s, have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, but also concerned about aging and more so focused on prevention tactics.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re at all sensitive to Retinol, this product is too strong, even if you&#x27;re only using a drop every other day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be clear:</li>
            <li>I have gone through 3 bottles so far</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin soft and seems to make it look plumper.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised as I had no idea what to expect.</li>
            <li>So far so good,&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and am sticking to Vitamin C,  collagen, and products made for those sensitive to.</li>
            <li>Lines began to diminish and sun spots (I dont have many, but the few I had are no longer visible to the naked eye).  </li>
            <li>The lotion goes a long way is very silky but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I will and have purchased this product again, in fact, recently purchased another product/face cream from the company to give this new one a try.</li>
            <li>They are also less noticeable when I DO smill or laugh.  </li>
            <li>I generally like Peter Thomas Roth products.</li>
            <li>as for whether it works for lines or not....i&#x27;m not sure but upon application my skin definitely feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>but I just can&#x27;t bare to part with another 150 bucks.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several more items and pricing was much less than my previous stores.  </li>
            <li>I really hesitated to order this due to price.  </li>

            <li> I really hesitated to order this due to price.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten better results with far less expensive Avon and Olay products.  </li>
            <li> It really does lift and firm skin!</li>
            <li> This product seems to&lt;br /&gt;not produce as obvious results as other PTR products</li>
            <li> With 20% Vitamin C, 10% Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide &amp; CoQ10 - Exfoliating Moisturizer Lotion for Face - Pore Cleanser for Acne, Dry &amp; Aging Skin - InstaNatural - 1.7 OZ</li>
            <li> My skin actually felt a little tighter</li>
            <li> and I feel I spent a lot of money for nothing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be wrinkly and bitter, which I would be if I bought another bottle.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice improvement on my 40 something skin, but again, Ive been using it only a few weeks</li>
            <li> After using the serum for a month, I have seen only a very slight improvement in skin firmness.  </li>
            <li> I use it on face, neck and chest at night with all the other stuff.</li>
            <li> After about a week of every other day use, my face had darkened noticeably from the Retinol in the product, and my skin was peeling in places.  </li>
            <li> ANYWAY, AMAZON HAS NOT ONLY AN UNBELIEVABLE PRICE.</li>
            <li> could be a little less expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> The price to was about half of everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that its a bit expensive for me on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> So these splurges aren&#x27;t so painful! :)</li>
            <li> A lot of money for so little result (which was none).</li>
            <li> you combine these expensive products with the use of less expensive products (think: first, do no harm - skin that&#x27;s not breaking out will not have scars to worry about)</li>
            <li> BUT.. it&#x27;s expensive and I may have to try to make it last longer</li>

            <li> It was an expired product. The manufactured date was August 2013. (code 3H33). With a life time of 12-month. It was expired already. I am going to ask a refund.</li>
            <li> After using the serum for a month, I have seen only a very slight improvement in skin firmness.  I have gotten better results with far less expensive Avon and Olay products.  It definitely did not deliver on what it promised and I feel I spent a lot of money for nothing.</li>
            <li> I love it, this is the second purchased.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really does help smooth lines around my eyes. However I do use it @ 3 times a day (more than suggested) and I also use Vitamin C Ester serum. I am a mature female and have been able to use many facial skin products over the years without problem. However in the last year, I have had skin allergies (especially around my eye area). I was tested and discovered that I have become allergic to certain preservatives found in most cosmetic and skin care products (including my favourite spa products Pevonia). I am thrilled to find that I am not allergic to this serum and it does help. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> Use PTR products regularly and this is right up there with others I use.  Love his products</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but wish it wasn&#x27;t  so expensive.</li>
            <li> An amazing product!!!!</li>
            <li> It took a long time for me to pull the trigger and buy this serum because of the huge price tag but I am a desperate woman. Now I am a desperate woman who is out 150 bucks with nothing to show. I used it twice a day and saw no results. My skin actually felt a little tighter but I couldn&#x27;t see any difference. Maybe I need to use another bottle but I just can&#x27;t bare to part with another 150 bucks. It&#x27;s bad enough to have wrinkles. I don&#x27;t want to be wrinkly and bitter, which I would be if I bought another bottle.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes a long way is very silky but not greasy.  My skin just soaks it up and my concealer glides right over it.  The fine lines seem to fade away.  My skin looks and feels more plumped and firm to the touch.  I really recommend it I have gone through 3 bottles so far and I will order another when I finish this one.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> The best product for anti aging. Anyone who wants there skin to glow and look youthful and radiant this is the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years.  Two pumps twice a day, it covers my skin with a creamy consistency, dries quickly and then a moisturizer.  My skin looks great and I&#x27;ve used Estee Lauders nu-triv serum, this works better, for far less money.</li>
            <li> I really hesitated to order this due to price.  I got a sample from Sephora and I knew I liked it from just the small sample they gave me.  It was the price that held me back.  I found it on Amazon and ordered it immediately.  The price to was about half of everywhere else.  I had not ordered this type of product from Amazon before, but I surely will again.  I have ordered several more items and pricing was much less than my previous stores.  Excellent products for half the price means more shopping for me.....there is no downside.</li>
            <li> I generally like Peter Thomas Roth products, but this one not so much. I&#x27;m 63 years old and it broke my face out! Skin products are trial and error, so this might work for someone else, but ugh. It&#x27;s the only thing that changed in my skin routine so don&#x27;t know what else it could be.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but I also use Cellex and some other expensive elixirs.  I am on my second bottle, so, YES, it is part of the routine.  I use it on face, neck and chest at night with all the other stuff. And nobody believes I&#x27;m 58.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have used it for years.  Light.  Moisturizing.  Smells great.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This was a good serum and I liked the way it made my skin feel .  The only thing is that its a bit expensive for me on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  I saw differences within a week of use.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second bottle of the FIRMx serum.  I am 39 with good skin.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or discoloration, but want to preserve my skin&#x27;s elasticity and plump look.  This product makes my skin soft and seems to make it look plumper.  I also use a daily vitamin C serum in the morning and a retinol at night.  I do weekly exfoliation treatments with a mild glycolic mask as well.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Have used for years and love it.  could be a little less expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old, have used more anti-aging products and spent more money than you can imagine.  Without a doubt this is the best product I have ever used, producing noticeable results.  I am frequently told my skin looks great and &amp;#34;whatever you are doing, keep doing it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Ok.. I will have to say, this stuff actually does reduce the appearance of your fine lines and wrinkles.  Yeah... I still have laugh and smile lines when I actually laugh or smile.. but when my face is at rest, they dissapear.  They are also less noticeable when I DO smill or laugh.  The lotion is lightweight and is silky smooth.  The fragrance is very light and pleasant.. almost no fragrance at all to be honest.  It absorbs well into my skin.  This is my 2nd bottle and while pricey (I paid 150 for the first bottle.. 89 for the 2nd on amazon), it lasted me about 2 months.  I probably used it more liberally the first month.. so now only using a drop or two, I am hoping that I can make it last a little over 2 months to make it more cost effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow up the use with a moisturizer that has SPF and occasionally use an eye cream.  I am 48 and find that it does improve the look and feel of my skin.  I wish I could find something less expensive though as 45-75/month is a lot of money to spend on just one part of my skincare regime.  But it WORKS and works WELL.. so I feel like I can&#x27;t not use it..lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.. LOVES IT.. IT WORKS.  BUT.. it&#x27;s expensive and I may have to try to make it last longer somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is neat.. but I wish you could tell how close you were getting to the end of the bottle.  It is opaque so it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it says it will do. Very expensive and is a waste of money. Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as expected. At 75(ish) American Dollars, great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear: LOVE this product. In late 20s, have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, but also concerned about aging and more so focused on prevention tactics. This product does not cause my skin to breakout, it&#x27;s SUPER moisturizing (here&#x27;s lookin&#x27; at you northerners!), and seems to focus more so on prevention of wrinkles/aging (so if you&#x27;re in your 50s or later, this might not be the best product - perhaps check out PTR UnWrinkle line).. but 20s, 30s, even 40s this item is simply swell. :) I&#x27;m also a huge fan of PTR in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip for others with super-sensitive skin, Mario Badescu has some fantastic products, and they&#x27;re nowhere near as expensive. I don&#x27;t like that line as much for anti-aging reasons, but hey - a cheap and effective SPF? Check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last tip - Simple offers a moisturizing gel that is great for sensitive/acne-prone skin, and you can pick it up at any drug store or Wal-Mart today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you combine these expensive products with the use of less expensive products (think: first, do no harm - skin that&#x27;s not breaking out will not have scars to worry about) it can really help stretch your dollar. So these splurges aren&#x27;t so painful! :)</li>
            <li> good service and good quality</li>
            <li> This product is everything it promises to be and I have been using it for 3 years. The online pricing makes it very affordable.</li>
            <li> I am 59, I have used this for a month and although it is pricey for me, I love the way my face feels when I put it on, and the texture of my skin has definitely improved. I am using in in conjunction with Glycolic Acid Cream 10% - With 20% Vitamin C, 10% Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide &amp; CoQ10 - Exfoliating Moisturizer Lotion for Face - Pore Cleanser for Acne, Dry &amp; Aging Skin - InstaNatural - 1.7 OZ</li>
            <li> Good product.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is expensive.  I am&lt;br /&gt;over 50 and always use PTR products.  They do keep your skin&lt;br /&gt;looking younger and significantly reduce wrinkles. This product seems to&lt;br /&gt;not produce as obvious results as other PTR products</li>
            <li> I love this product and certainly the price is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m middle-aged and I love this product.  It makes my skin feel like satin and has improved how it looks.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says. It makes a difference; skin is firmer. I was very pleasantly surprised as I had no idea what to expect. I had read about the product, but no one I knew had ever tried it. I&#x27;m now recommending it!</li>
            <li> Have used for about 2 months and have definitely experienced tightening and firming of face and neck. Use morning as primary moisturizer and at night.</li>
            <li> I generally like Peter Thomas Roth products. I really did not see any change or improvement. by using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great serum.  I use a couple of other products from PTR, and find this really makes my face super soft.</li>
            <li> nice on my skin for moisture &amp; firming day &amp; night under creams</li>
            <li> Great product line.  Peter Thomas Roth unwrinkle line has been a real skin saver for me.  As I continue to battle the aging process, PTR is always in my corner, helping to reduce the appearance of fine lines, etc.</li>
            <li> Having spent my late teens and twenties, and now thirties fighting the future signs of aging as best I could, I have to say that using this product line has made me a believer in topical products.  Not opposed to facials and light therapies for aging skin, I went on a limb to try to save money and once again, go for a topical product.  I heard great things about this line from Peter Thomas Roth, and am blown away.  Instantly my skin felt softer. Lines began to diminish and sun spots (I dont have many, but the few I had are no longer visible to the naked eye).  I will and have purchased this product again, in fact, recently purchased another product/face cream from the company to give this new one a try.</li>
            <li> So far so good,&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a couple of weeks now , love how my skin feels after use, very silky and moisturized without a greasy feeling. I use it three to four times a week in the morning after wash and tone. I haven&#x27;t notice improvement on my 40 something skin, but again, Ive been using it only a few weeks, I will re- purchase another bottle to have a better idea if the product actually improve elasticity and tone...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different serums but this one delivers more than any I&#x27;ve tried. It really does lift and firm skin!</li>
            <li> this product goes on so smooth and has a wonderful smell. as for whether it works for lines or not....i&#x27;m not sure but upon application my skin definitely feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This DID NOT WORK FOR ME!  I went out and found a video of how to apply properly. Therefore, I know it was done properly.  A lot of money for so little result (which was none).</li>
            <li> I would reorder this product.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and was assured that the Peter Thomas Roth serum would give me the anti-wrinkle aspect I was looking for without overwhelming my fair skin.  After about a week of every other day use, my face had darkened noticeably from the Retinol in the product, and my skin was peeling in places.  If you&#x27;re at all sensitive to Retinol, this product is too strong, even if you&#x27;re only using a drop every other day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and am sticking to Vitamin C,  collagen, and products made for those sensitive to.Retinol.</li>
            <li> I AM A SELF-PROCLAIMED SKIN CARE JUNKIE, SO WHEN I GET THIS &amp;#34; OVER THE MOON &amp;#34; ABOUT A SKIN CARE&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT.....TAKE NOTE!!!!!  PETER THOMAS ROTH HAS STRUCK GOLD WITH THIS ONE!!!!!  IT DOES THINGS LIKE&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE.... LIKE FIRMNESS, DISAPPEARANCE OF PORES ALTOGETHER,  SKIN THAT&lt;br /&gt;YOU DON&#x27;T EVEN RECOGNIZE.... ALL THIS IN SHORT ORDER TOO!!!!  I CANNOT WAIT TO RECEIVE THE NEW NIGHT&lt;br /&gt;CREAM THAT WORKS WITH THE SERUM!!!  IF THE PRICE INTIMIDATES YOU JUST IGNORE YOUR FRIGHT---THIS&lt;br /&gt;COULD BE A TURNING POINT IN YOUR LIFE.  ANYWAY, AMAZON HAS NOT ONLY AN UNBELIEVABLE PRICE. BUT&lt;br /&gt;THEIR RETURN POLICY IS THE BEST!!!!!!  I CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO HEAR WHAT YOU WILL SCREAM WITH GLEE WHEN YOU&lt;br /&gt;HAVE YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE!!!!!  I WOULD GO WITHOUT FOOD TO KEEP THIS EXQUISITE STUFF ON MY VANITY!!!!</li>
