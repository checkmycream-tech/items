            <li>So I was very happy.</li>
            <li>and yes, if you get highlights and lowlights and spend hours in the chair that is the best way to go.  </li>
            <li>I have a number of friends who have stopped going to the salon and started using this color and are all very happy with their results.  </li>

            <li>Gotta love the subscribe &amp; save, it comes once a month just in time for my root touch ups!</li>
            <li>I had been using another popular brand for 2 decades  and noticed a reduction in the quality --</li>
            <li>I always try to mach my own color -- just to make me *</li>
            <li>* :-)  </li>
            <li>My hair looked and felt better than I can ever remember.  </li>
            <li>but it should be okay.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair color.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t change my hair color much,not sure why?</li>
            <li>I have tried every box color and like several, but this is the shiniest end result, the best at covering stubborn grays, and the most natural-looking color ON ME.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this brand for many years.</li>
            <li>The financial savings is incredible.  </li>
            <li>Great price through Amazon with my regular subscription and prime membership :)</li>
            <li>The fruit oil gives hair a lovely shine and the colour is true to the picture.</li>
            <li>Grays get covered just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; I have used this color for a long time, and I am happy that would be so easy to get</li>
            <li>I bought this for grey coverage and am happy to say it covers grey beautifully (Have greying problem since teens).</li>
            <li>It quick, easy and a lot cheaper than going to the salon.  </li>
            <li>It works great at covering the grey and also makes it softer because of the oil pouch that is put in too.</li>
            <li>.which would be ok if only I could learn to be ok with it!  </li>
            <li>colour stays true for 3 - 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>Good quality home color, I have used it for years; I am 90% white and use it for root touch-ups about every 8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair nice &amp; soft, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years every month and there is NO damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>The boring-sounding Light Brown was vibrant and did not change my own natural look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a year or more now and love how it covers the grey!</li>
            <li>I definitely did not like my own drab color and all the visible greys (sigh).  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the shipping costs to get it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will have to strand test to see what is best for you, but IF YOU ARE GRAY, NATURAL IS USUALLY THE WAY TO GO.  </li>
            <li>better* and not *different</li>
            <li>I was just amazed the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll repost more later  </li>
            <li>Just letting you know in case your interested.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Blends nicely with my natural color and is simple.  </li>
            <li>but it is nowhere near as nice as the US version and does not give the same condition to my hair..</li>
            <li>Less chemicals is always better!</li>
            <li>The color is not really accurate compared to the box photo, but I really do love the rich color that resulted.</li>
            <li>It is a natural light brown just like the box photo and leaves hair healthy due to the oil in the formula.  </li>
            <li>I have paid as much as $250 for salon color -</li>
            <li>so I use \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; light brown as opposed to \\&quot;Golden\\&quot; which makes my hair red or \\&quot;Ash\\&quot; which can give me greenish hues.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m not, I buy this color, which works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted haircolor</li>
            <li>This is the only one that I find had a nice, rich but subtle color.  </li>
            <li>Is the only one that doesn&#x27;t hurt or makes my skin scalp itch, it covers grey easily..</li>
            <li>or maybe because my original hair color is black?</li>
            <li>My natural color was medium brown, but now it&#x27;s salt &amp; pepper.  </li>
            <li>The acorn (60) color is so close to my natural brown that I don&#x27;t really notice the new growth except for the grey.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands and would not use any other now.&lt;br /&gt;The same product in Australia</li>
            <li>Still its better than all the harsh chemicals in other products.</li>
            <li>I find most home color kits are too stark (as if it was a dark crayon color).  </li>
            <li>I expected a different color I guess, It just didn&#x27;t show up that well in my hair and my hair takes to dye very well.</li>
            <li>I use it once a month to do grey cover up near my ears and around my face.  </li>

            <li> like it because you can have as dark/medium brown-&lt;br /&gt;light brown-and dark blonde hair.</li>

            <li> I had used L&#x27;Oreal Preference and the other</li>
            <li> Anyway, I will still buy this brand but maybe try other colors.</li>
            <li> I am hoping it stay longer than other hair colors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy any other brand!</li>
            <li> It is thick, doesn&#x27;t drip (unless you put it on too thick) and the color is very natural.</li>
            <li> Pull color through in strands every few months to freshen.  </li>
            <li> The color is what I usually use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look solid and fake like some hair colors do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It turned my hair green!</li>
            <li> Way less expensive than going to the hairdresser!</li>
            <li> It was terrible!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My natural color was medium brown, but now it&#x27;s salt &amp; pepper.  This #60 Acorn is perfect.  The first few days it&#x27;s a little too dark, but after one or two shampoos it lightens to just right.  I&#x27;ve been buying this color and product for about two years now, and have no intention of changing.  I also like Garnier&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that this is particularly moisturinzing, but it does the job at covering hard to cover white hair strands. The color is not really accurate compared to the box photo, but I really do love the rich color that resulted. I&#x27;m ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I had been using another popular brand for 2 decades  and noticed a reduction in the quality -- did they continually change the formula?  In any event I had left my hair uncolored for a while to let it all grow out.  I definitely did not like my own drab color and all the visible greys (sigh).  I decided to try this brand. I always try to mach my own color -- just to make me *better* and not *different* :-)  What can I say?  My hair looked and felt better than I can ever remember.  I got zillions of compliments. The boring-sounding Light Brown was vibrant and did not change my own natural look.  What I need now is to find out which hair conditioner to buy that is equivalent to the one in the hair color box.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to call the company to find out which formulation it is.</li>
            <li> Got everything o time, I will buy again from you guys.; I have used this color for a long time, and I am happy that would be so easy to get it- sometimes I do not found it at the stores.</li>
            <li> Less chemicals is always better! However, the color washes out after 2 weeks if you wash your hair daily. Still its better than all the harsh chemicals in other products. Still it does have chemicals!!!</li>
            <li> I use it once a month to do grey cover up near my ears and around my face.  Blends nicely with my natural color and is simple.  Way less expensive than going to the hairdresser!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a year or more now and love how it covers the grey! I had used L&#x27;Oreal Preference and the other L&#x27;Oreal one for years and those NEVER covered ANY grey. This Garnier color is as good as it gets! I was just amazed the first time I used it. It works great at covering the grey and also makes it softer because of the oil pouch that is put in too. The acorn (60) color is so close to my natural brown that I don&#x27;t really notice the new growth except for the grey.</li>
            <li> Havn&#x27;t used it yet so don&#x27;t know. i&#x27;ll repost more later  but it should be okay.  you get wht you pay for you know?</li>
            <li> I expected a different color I guess, It just didn&#x27;t show up that well in my hair and my hair takes to dye very well.</li>
            <li> The Garnier Nutrisse permanent hair colour is a beautiful product that never dries your hair. The fruit oil gives hair a lovely shine and the colour is true to the picture. I have tried many other brands and would not use any other now.&lt;br /&gt;The same product in Australia says the fruit oil is already in the developing cream but it is nowhere near as nice as the US version and does not give the same condition to my hair.. It is well worth the shipping costs to get it.&lt;br /&gt;The colour stays true for 3 - 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I only use garner because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. The color is what I usually use. So I was very happy.</li>
            <li> Good quality home color, I have used it for years; I am 90% white and use it for root touch-ups about every 8 weeks.  It is a natural light brown just like the box photo and leaves hair healthy due to the oil in the formula.  Great price through Amazon with my regular subscription and prime membership :)</li>
            <li> I like the dye except for the color is darker than shown. Just letting you know in case your interested.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair color. It is thick, doesn&#x27;t drip (unless you put it on too thick) and the color is very natural. Doesn&#x27;t look solid and fake like some hair colors do. I don&#x27;t buy any other brand!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t change my hair color much,not sure why? Maybe the product isn&#x27;t work well? or maybe because my original hair color is black? Anyway, I will still buy this brand but maybe try other colors. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for 20 years now.  I have paid as much as $250 for salon color - and yes, if you get highlights and lowlights and spend hours in the chair that is the best way to go.  But my white roots show after less than two weeks, and I can not afford to go back to the salon even every month for that type of service.  I have tried every box color and like several, but this is the shiniest end result, the best at covering stubborn grays, and the most natural-looking color ON ME.  I have a lot of red in my hair so I use \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; light brown as opposed to \\&quot;Golden\\&quot; which makes my hair red or \\&quot;Ash\\&quot; which can give me greenish hues.  You will have to strand test to see what is best for you, but IF YOU ARE GRAY, NATURAL IS USUALLY THE WAY TO GO.  I have a number of friends who have stopped going to the salon and started using this color and are all very happy with their results.  The financial savings is incredible.  When you touch up, just do the roots - leave the ends alone.  Pull color through in strands every few months to freshen.  Your hair will stay healthier that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going grey since I was 30 . .which would be ok if only I could learn to be ok with it!  Since I&#x27;m not, I buy this color, which works really well for me.  It quick, easy and a lot cheaper than going to the salon.  I will say it works differently with everyone&#x27;s hair color, so play around with different colors till you find one that works for you.  I have a lot of red in my hair and, when I use this color, my hair is reddish brown (no red on box color).</li>
            <li> great product that i use all the time and cheaper than the store.... i love it !!! !!!! !!! !</li>
            <li> I bought this for grey coverage and am happy to say it covers grey beautifully (Have greying problem since teens). I am hoping it stay longer than other hair colors.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It came on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It turned my hair green! I had to go buy another dye to cover it up. It was terrible!! I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for many years. Is the only one that doesn&#x27;t hurt or makes my skin scalp itch, it covers grey easily.. Sometimes I just put it on for 10 or 15 minutes and I&#x27;m done..</li>
            <li> I really wanted haircolor that&#x27;s almost like blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because you can have as dark/medium brown-&lt;br /&gt;light brown-and dark blonde hair. You&#x27;ll have choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takako Masuda</li>
            <li> Gotta love the subscribe &amp; save, it comes once a month just in time for my root touch ups! Leaves my hair nice &amp; soft, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years every month and there is NO damage to my hair. I leave it in for about 1/2 hour although the directions say 15 minutes. Grays get covered just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for years and have tried ALL the brands!  This is the only one that I find had a nice, rich but subtle color.  I find most home color kits are too stark (as if it was a dark crayon color).  And, there&#x27;s no \\&quot;eye watering\\&quot; smell!</li>
