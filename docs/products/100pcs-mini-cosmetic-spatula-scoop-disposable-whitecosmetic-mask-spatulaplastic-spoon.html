            <li> Just what I needed, thank you. :)</li>
            <li> I think the spoons are too small. They look glossy on the picture but they&#x27;re not. My spoons look like used and have some dust and dirt marks on them.</li>
            <li> They were OK but too small</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> Exactly as they look, exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I received my second shipment of this product in perfect condition. My wife can&#x27;t wait to use them on her job.Our expectations were fully met.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sampling out my products. Exactly what I needed &amp; FAST shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought these for scooping face cream, and mixing mica base makeup, they are perfect....  at first i didn&#x27;t like that these were put loosely in a shipping bag. Then I remembered they weren&#x27;t advertised as being a sanitized product. After I washed them in sudsy water, I ended up using a strainer for rinsing. I dried each one and put them in a clean container, oops, I only counted 98. Must have lost them. If you have small kids, count when first getting scoops then again before storage, to ensure all are accounted for.</li>
            <li> Use these for my pain creams. Just the right amount and keeps the cream clean.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these for samples.  The cosmetic sample spoons that I can order from the direct sale company I am with puts too much product on the spoon and then needs scooped out.  These are perfect!</li>
