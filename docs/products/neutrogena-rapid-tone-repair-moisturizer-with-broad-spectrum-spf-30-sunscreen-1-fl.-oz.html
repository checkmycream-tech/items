            <li>I hope this is the case, because the benefits are too good to give up, at this point.</li>
            <li>I have never used a face lotion that made my skin look this good.</li>

            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product for what it does to my skin and its price!  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing, but I can use this cream on the outer corners of my eyes without any irritation afterwards.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is nice, because it does not leave my skin feeling oily or coated.</li>
            <li>Feels nice applying and leaves skin feeling supple.</li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous formula, in a really cute pearly glass pump bottle.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>got this product one week ago in hopes that it would fade my acne scars, which are quite prominent on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Both seem similarly effective and reducing skin imperfections, lines and spots.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this stuff smells bad!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great - and I use it also in the day, it&#x27;s really soothing to my skin and a great feel.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>Easy bottle to apply; feels good after applying.  </li>
            <li>What I liked the most was that it made my skin really smooth, and bright.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I liked similar Neutrogena Night Moisturizer and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>the smell is a bit strong, but after a week your skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t strong or bothersome to me, the packaging and dispenser are nice as well.</li>
            <li>But on top of all that before I even noticed those changes I noticed the fine line on the right side of my mouth was gone 5 days into using this product and that impressed me first!</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li>Mainly, most of the things I buy is to try and help with the blackheads around my nose</li>
            <li>So I figured I&#x27;d give it a try since my favorite face wash--and</li>
            <li>Really fantastic!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this, I&#x27;ve read so many great reviews on it</li>
            <li>It took me more than 2 weeks to see a difference.</li>
            <li>i do think i will see a greater improvement with more time.</li>
            <li>There is a more even tone and some fading of brown spots.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products and the Rapid Tone Repair did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I hope it works better for others.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is about the best CVS/Walgreens carried line use i can rely on, and this moisturizer was cheaper here on Amazon than at my local store.  </li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>I know that Neutrogena is one of the top brands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a week and my face seems to have a better complexion and tone.  </li>
            <li>love, love this-</li>
            <li>and he had better results than me.</li>
            <li>I felt this is like a magic poison....</li>
            <li>I think this is more like a concealer and not a cure....</li>
            <li>and it works ok.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I love what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Neutrogena fan forever, and LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I know that Neutrogena is one of the top brands</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is definitely the best for me.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more even and healthier after just 1 week of using it.</li>
            <li>I switched to use a sunscreen moisturizer that is much more oily (used both day and night</li>
            <li>My skin tone is brighter, more even.</li>
            <li>Pleasant, clean fragrance but light.</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>Lovely smell</li>
            <li>I think the magic is in the vitamin C because I already use the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair with sa/retinol (I have no wrinkles -</li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably brighter and more even toned.</li>
            <li>it was like magic.</li>
            <li>I am glad I stuck with it.</li>
            <li>This product has given me a lovely dewy look without problems with acne.  </li>
            <li>Glad it found it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>This stuff works, I love it.</li>
            <li>but i love this product and will continue to purchase it here.</li>
            <li>I have tried this product for a month now and love it.  </li>
            <li>But not to worry I just put on my kiss my face overnight cream then applied this cream on top of that</li>
            <li>I also use the Ageless intensives tone correcting, and I like that better than this.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>By the way - I&#x27;ve probably researched dozens of age spot products and it seems most of them do NOT appear to work.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use the day version without any problem.</li>
            <li>I even got to the point where I felt comfortable not wearing any concealer!</li>
            <li>Oh, and as a moisturizer it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>A good product for the right skin type. :)</li>
            <li>Good for the right skin type.</li>
            <li>i was very good ,happy with the product and was in the right box and was shipped fast and hope it works well and will order again ty for shipping very fast</li>
            <li>Applying first 2 days, my face looked more bright and</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the VERY FIRST DAY - and after almost two weeks, my skin has never looked better in my life!</li>
            <li>They should make the same wonderful products, fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Great retinol cream for mature skin.</li>
            <li>Use at night with BelEssence for a more wrinkle free face-works wonders on wrinkles</li>
            <li>I had some age spots I was trying to lighten up and after using this for 3 weeks I noticed my skin was becoming</li>
            <li>One pump is good for my whole face, but if I want to do my neck too</li>
            <li>My skin feels great and my pores seem smaller and my tone more even.</li>
            <li>and then it was a easy to keep using.  </li>
            <li>Makeup easily covers.</li>
            <li>and if it doesn&#x27;t end up working then you can spend more for more powerful stuff</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product was much to strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it for that purpose.</li>
            <li>However, since it works for me, I’m pretty sure it will work for most people</li>
            <li>A HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>It works quite well for me, I use it almost daily, and have for over a year now, and have experienced no irritation.l</li>
            <li>I now go comfortably without make up.</li>
            <li>Have switched to Alba Botanica Even Advanced.</li>
            <li>In my humble opinion this is an excellent product that does what it says it will do and you don’t have to liquidate your 401K to afford it.</li>
            <li>My pores are itty bitty, my skin feels great and the color is uniform no red acne scars</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin smooth for overnight use.</li>
            <li>Light coverage.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer for sensitive</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does!!</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and light.</li>
            <li>so I feel more confident using a well known brand compared to something new.</li>
            <li>so I feel more confident using a well known brand compared to something new.</li>
            <li>I wish you got a little more than one ounce for your money, but I guess good products just cost more.</li>
            <li>It is a nice weight and goes on smoothly, absorbing quickly.  </li>
            <li>I also have summer freckles and some blotchy discolored areas and everything has faded to a more even consistent tone.</li>
            <li>The product has a very powerful scent, not a bad one in fact</li>
            <li>Light, non-oily, disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>but I believe one needs to eat healthy, exercise, do routine facials and take care of his/her skin with good cleansers and other supplements to make the best out of it rather than just depending on one small bottle.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t see anything special about this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because many reviewers said it help diminish acne scars and large pores.</li>
            <li>I did have to stop using it because it began to irritate my skin, specially around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Lotion is light, easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t want to read full insight:))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how neutrogena products accomplish all of this, but I&#x27;m super happy with the result on my fair, sensitive, acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>first use, it seemed fine.</li>
            <li>I have mild combination skin.</li>
            <li>, it actually does make you look better and healthy.</li>
            <li>This product does what it says - evens tone and results are quickly noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>First of all, I didn&#x27;t expect this cream (and I wouldn&#x27;t expect any cream) alone to make a huge noticeable difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>First of all, I didn&#x27;t expect this cream (and I wouldn&#x27;t expect any cream) alone to make a huge noticeable difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin&#x27;s never been all that smooth or pretty, .but</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin perhaps you will like the new product better.</li>
            <li>Gentle on skin compared to other lighteners I&#x27;ve used, which is a good thing!</li>
            <li>Nothing better then this I always found results the first 3 days I used and is my 3 bottle ,because I spend to much day time out I have to used all the time .</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever written!  </li>
            <li>On the back of the product it states \\&quot;you may experience mild redness, a warm tingling sensation or flaking,which is normal\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>However, it does make my skin feel super soft and leaves it with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>The Tone Repair works quickly and I could see the difference right away.</li>
            <li>YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE USING IT FOR WHAT IT WORTH</li>
            <li>This is the same kind of moisturizer, and soothing, and it&#x27;s  night cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also pleased that it hasn&#x27;t made my acne any worse (and it smells great).</li>
            <li>I have used neutrogena products for years and have rarely had reason to complain.  </li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone; B. It makes it smooth and silky to the touch; C. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin closer to my eyes; D. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores; E. It lightens up my multiple freckles or better</li>
            <li>more and more aged looking.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare to find a beauty product that delivers all that it promises plus shows results immediately.</li>
            <li>For me, it also works pretty quick.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>Faded them pretty quickly too.  </li>
            <li>Long review to give a good deal of insight into product for certain skin types and issues</li>
            <li>Smells good and can be used with other products which is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;however</li>
            <li>After using this for 10 days, I&#x27;ve noticed my acne scars are significantly lighter and my skin tone has really evened out.</li>
            <li>Right as I started using this</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>I bought this creme because I have dark circles under my eyes that have been bothering me more and more</li>
            <li>It was fine the day after too, but on day three, my skin began to completely peel off - the top layer of dermis was sloughing off completely.</li>
            <li>Then I typically use Loreal Ideal Moisture for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li>I used with the day cream everyday for 4 weeks and noticed a nice difference!  </li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle to give it a full month or so to work.</li>
            <li>Generally it makes you look healthy and radiant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just thrilled &amp; will be sticking with Nuetrogena for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and dark hair, btw.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the night moisturizer is a little light for me, but it does seem to be effective.</li>
            <li>This is a very unusual formula and to find retinol SA and Hyaluronic acid together with vitamin C is unheard of.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smoother, younger, more even.  </li>
            <li>and I must say in exactly one week since I started using it</li>
            <li>It really does everything you&#x27;d want it to!</li>
            <li>It also smells great (to me at least).</li>
            <li>I love this entire Neutogena retinol product line.  </li>
            <li>You get the picture and it isn&#x27;t a pretty one, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After just 3 nights of consistent</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have too many deep lines.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more plump and younger as well as breakouts happen once a month now!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m buying chemical free natural skin products that takes time but cures the problem and doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer and smoother and looks overall much better.</li>
            <li>This product delivers exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li>My skin really loves it!</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have too many deep lines.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>At first, i wore it as a day and night moisturizer.</li>
            <li>my first bottle ( I use it every night &amp; sometimes during the day),</li>
            <li>The warnings say you may experience redness and some peeling at first, but I never did.  </li>
            <li>kept getting more red each time.</li>
            <li>first then this.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I only have to use one product… saving even more.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>The first couple of days your skin does peel and</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely has a more even tone and its look brighter which makes me look refreshed.</li>
            <li>Will Update further as I go along :)</li>
            <li>I have been using two different products on my face most nights (maybe 5 out of 7) for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I do use the day cream in this same line with no problem, so I confidently bought the night cream, however there must be some ingredient that irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li>it really really works!</li>
            <li>Within the first week my skin was smoother &amp; more radiant, by the 3rd week</li>
            <li>Rapid tone repair is very smooth, it does not create any irritation and even though I&#x27;ve used it for just a short period of time, I can see and feel the positive results from its use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have in realistic expectations, I have freckles and some spots from the sun, I have a few fine lines on my forehead, I&#x27;m 30 and honestly look 25 or 26.</li>
            <li>The humidity in my area is 25%-50%, and on the 50% days I don&#x27;t really need much moisturizer, but on the other days I suffer from flakes if I don&#x27;t use a good quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of hydrating properly taken care of skin that doesn&#x27;t lean towards very dry.</li>
            <li>I finally got rid of most of my acne, but the scars pretty much cover my face.</li>
            <li>I have quite oily skin,i have a med/fair complexion, and i have post blemish scars i have been desperately trying to get rid of for years, i have tried so many fade and tone creams,expensive &amp; cheap,nothing i been trying has given me great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 19 year old man in college, I don&#x27;t have many issues in the acne or wrinkle department, but I do have naturally ruddy skin and suffer from blackheads.</li>
            <li>Not only is the price more than reasonable, it’s also a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am also (finally) using a good sunscreen on my face when I know I&#x27;m going outside or will be driving.  </li>
            <li>and yes, I do notice a positive difference.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, which is why it still got 2 stars, but thats pretty much it.</li>
            <li>With consistent use, I noticed improved smoother overall tone, diminished redness, and diminished look of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I only experienced a slight reddening of my skin the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>so I could easily get the last bits out.</li>
            <li>Most skin products dry my face out, but this one didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Also the smell is too strong and actually gives me headaches sometimes.</li>
            <li>Certainly recommend it</li>
            <li>This (large) area of discoloration is on my left/driving side of my face.  </li>
            <li>It definitely helped to reduce my fine lines</li>
            <li>Today, I noticed my whole face is peeling</li>
            <li>but I must say that my spots are almost gone, thank so much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product!</li>
            <li>This is very affordable for the amount and quality of ingredients, you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also 34 and starting to get a few lines, most notably on my brow where I&#x27;m getting \\&quot;Furrow\\&quot; lines.</li>
            <li>My neck and chin area look so much smoother</li>
            <li>Really reasonably price.</li>
            <li>I would also say that I much prefer the night version compared to the day moisturizer with sunscreen .</li>
            <li>i did not see any changes.but in time this product really work.i am going .</li>
            <li>I have scaring and sun damage under my eyes that is very embarassing for me</li>
            <li>Really works well on my blotchy skin.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was very hopeful this would work.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>Considering the price and the benefits of this product compared to some department store brands, this is the absolute winner.</li>
            <li>Fast results.</li>
            <li>but this product made me feel comfortable enough to do it.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t know which product improved this area on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>I has really faded my cystic acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using their stress-something-or-other labeled salicylic acid toner after I wash my face (something gentle from Biore) and Aveno&#x27;s SPF-laden tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it really does work</li>
            <li>the price is really</li>
            <li>it works really well</li>
            <li>In the beginning it can make your skin worse, or it can change the top layers of skin for the better.</li>
            <li>so i went right back to my old Olay 7 stand-by, which doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, moisturizes better, smells nice (or not at all), and at least doesn&#x27;t claim to correct my tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than half way done with the first bottle.  </li>
            <li>At my last facial, my esthetician said that my skin looked incredible and asked if I was had been getting other skin treatments.  </li>
            <li>My other cheek is where most of the acne marks are.</li>
            <li>I wanted my skin to look dewy and clear, and this really does exactly that.</li>
            <li>applied this product day and nite with high ( perhaps too high ! )  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised that after about 4 - 6 weeks use, there has been a significant reduction in the red acne scars.  </li>
            <li>using this despite my young age because i have a few freckles that i want to fade, and this product is kind of giving me results.</li>
            <li>Kinda gross, but it just left a smooth surface below!</li>
            <li>anyone in your 50- and older DO NOT USE THIS</li>
            <li>Great product for toning down red and helping make scarring less visible and overall just better looking skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly to anyone with this issue.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews for this product, I had high hope that it might work.  </li>
            <li>When I first started, I did experience some redness and tingling for the first few days immediately after applying, but it was not unbearable and the sensation faded quickly.</li>
            <li>the pump is a nice touch,  but in the morning I find my skin less moisturized and soft than when I use the old product.  </li>
            <li>Best of all I am seeing noticeable improvement in uneven skin tone, actually seems to be lighting my few &#x27;age&#x27; spots.</li>
            <li>the nighttime version of these types of lotions generally have a higher concentration of retinol.</li>
            <li>Just started using it this week, and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth mentioning that peeling and irritation are listed as possible side effects of overuse and should stop after skin adjusts.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have had no negative effects.</li>
            <li>I began using both the day &amp; night time versions of this product a few weeks ago &amp; am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I had a huge pimple on my cheek due to hormones that had been there for weeks.</li>
            <li>I finished an entire bottle and found this moisturizer to be decent - it generally helps with skin tone and mild acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s time for a new product, and I would NEVER buy this again.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was waking up every morning to 3 or 4 new zits.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, I feel like it has helped control new outbreaks.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Neutrogena product that came in a tube but decided to give the new product a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>turning 30 gave me a new face.</li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive, and I can put all around my eyes with no irritation.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t bothered me one bit.</li>
            <li>In two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed significant fading of my red acne scars, a decrease in the number of new pimples I get, and a speedier heal-time in my current pimples.  </li>
            <li>Adult acne!</li>
            <li>(if you don&#x27;t mind the taste) and a glycolic acid/lactic acid peel every few months..this with the day moisturiser has helped clear my breakouts, fade considerably and keep my skin feeling smooth and looking like 20!</li>
            <li>&gt; The pice should not affect the rating of tis product on Amazon because there are so many different prices on same products from different sellers as well as in stores.</li>

            <li>I have an old scar from stitches on my chin and it has even faded that!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently trying out some other night moisturizers, but if I don&#x27;t find anything better</li>
            <li>I have less fine lines and</li>
            <li>I noticed in my mid thirties, after having a baby that my once pretty skin had gone to ughh.</li>
            <li>It gave this 50 year old acne!</li>
            <li>I saw a difference initially, like in the first week, but now, it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it will lighten any more</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>to get an overview of my skin: I&#x27;m 20 years old, Extremely pale, generally an NC-15 to anyone who knows MAC standards with very light acne, I&#x27;ve had more severe acne in the past but have been on Birth control for 4 months now.</li>
            <li>Any new scar i got,the toner reduced it slightly,but any old scaring showed no improvement.</li>
            <li>I will need to use the product more to see the final result, but over all it has improved the look of the dark spots.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed to see a few people mentioned, this product cause them to break out or too strong for their skin.</li>
            <li>If you have oily, combination, or normal to slightly dry skin that is NOT sensitive to fragrance then you should get on fine with this.</li>
            <li>This is a light moisturizer, and if you have dry skin it may not be enough for you.</li>
            <li>This is the only tone repair product I&#x27;ve found that actually showed an improvement quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a Retinol product, so be prepared for some mild irritation/warming sensation -- especially if used with another facial product for acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only use it on certain spots on my face.</li>
            <li>It is light and has little fragrence.</li>
            <li>My skin is a mature (light-to-medium color) skin with some problems like melasma and occasional acne (reaction to certain foods, pollution and creams).</li>
            <li>and my acne scar has been little bit better than last time!</li>
            <li>I really just wanted something to clear my post-acne marks/uneven-ness, but this actually helps keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>At age 77 nothing is going to completely remove wrinkles</li>
            <li>It looks like I was punched) but if I put too much on it then my face is oily in that area the next morning.</li>
            <li>But i am remaining patient and family seeing a difference in the old acne scars i had on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not saying it completely changed my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did the microdermabrasion, and trust me I have paid much bigger money for professionals than for the Neutrogena microderm and this moisterizer, after 6x I have finally gotten rid of a big brown spot that was a burn from some facial trmt, but it gets better-</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not saying it completely changed my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product, which only lasted two weeks, did absolutely nothing for the brown spots on my face.  </li>
            <li>She seems please with the results so far.</li>
            <li>Not only has this faded acne scars, but I&#x27;ve had absolutely ZERO irritation, redness or breakouts from this.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and sometimes during the day, since I seem to be sensitive to the daytime with sunscreen moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin, and this product does not cause me any break outs.</li>
            <li>I can really notice the difference the next morning after applying it before bed.</li>
            <li>My face is as soft as my butt now.</li>
            <li>Both are extremely gentle, the strawberry seed just takes away that last bit of roughness in the winter months.</li>
            <li>None so far.</li>
            <li>they are actually showing up in photographs and are very noticeable and embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>It is still there - but at least 50% better and does not jump out at me anymore.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say the Sun spots or age spots are gone completely ( which I didn&#x27;t expect)</li>
            <li>I had to switch to extremely gentle products to ease my skin back to the way it was before.  </li>
            <li>I have to preface this by saying I had maybe 2 or 3 scars from an adult acne breakout (yeah, zits in my 30s...</li>
            <li>I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrance or unsure if you are then</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrances, not overly, but this gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li>Good product .more expensive in a brick &amp; mortar store.</li>
            <li>Basically it is difficult to find a good product for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I sure am getting a lot of attention, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I was skeptical at first and glad I took a chance.</li>
            <li>I use it at night every other day &amp; it made a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>I developed a few dark spots last summer, i am using the  tone with the nuetrogena microbrasion kit, so far I have noticed them fading, i truly love these products!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides lightening the red spot of the above mentioned breakout to a lighter shade of pink, The product hasn&#x27;t really changed my skin significantly any further.</li>
            <li>(my skin tone is more even and less red) and actually help my skins general condition and reduce acne.</li>
            <li>they are completely gone or barely noticeable now.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, although it does not eliminate age spots entirely, it did wash them out enough I don&#x27;t feel like my 80 year old grandmother.</li>
            <li>It may flake and that might be expected for the first couple of days to a week.</li>
            <li>and my blackheads are pretty much all but gone, as well as my skin is less red from a day to day basis.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t feel it does anything more or less than the other product.</li>
            <li>Not only does it help my blemishes to fade, but it also has helped prevent new ones from cropping up.</li>
            <li>Let me preface this by describing my skin - I&#x27;m 28, my skin is dry, and I don&#x27;t really get blemishes.</li>
            <li>It does (they all do) seem to thin out my skin a bit and make it more pressure sensitive and if I am reading it correctly you need to use a sun screen separately.</li>
            <li>I generally use ROC Max facial wash every night, it has a light exfoliator in it, along with a strawberry seed heavy exfoliator by Mark in Avon.</li>
            <li>and I left many scars, at first I was skeptical to buy it</li>
            <li>my husband is major outdoorsman, I have done his face and neck twice</li>
            <li>Noticed a  major difference in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use in conjunction with the Broad Spectrum Rapid Tone Corrector.  </li>
            <li>If it had actually worked I would have been willing to pay double for the next bottle.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t&#x27; have too many dark spots but a few light small ones and they have reduced.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this same cream as low as $12.00 and as high as $25.00 per bottle from afferent brick and mortar stores as well as online</li>
            <li>I have purchased this same cream as low as $12.00 and as high as $25.00 per bottle from afferent brick and mortar stores as well as online</li>
            <li>So now instead of 4 huge red marks, there&#x27;s about 10 tiny little marks that are dissolving as I use this stuff.</li>
            <li>It generally takes four weeks for a product to grab hold and change your skin.</li>
            <li>I generally use two to three pumps to cover my skin as I feel.</li>
            <li>I had a strange red mark that looked like a very inflamed pimple on my forehead, but no pimple to speak of.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve used this for one week now, and my crow&#x27;s feet wrinkles are barely visible.</li>
            <li>I started using this product  3 weeks ago and have recently gotten a few compliments on how clear and fresh my complexion looks.</li>
            <li>My facial skin is extremely sensitive to moisturizers, sunscreen, etc..</li>
            <li>However I am completely ecstatic that this \\&quot;tone repair\\&quot; moisturizer seems to ACTUALLY repair tone</li>
            <li>And also, this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough (i&#x27;m 19 years old,</li>
            <li>Another change that was immediate was the apparent decrease in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>Normal to dry skin type.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little expensive, but it does give great results.  </li>
            <li>Rapid Tone Night Moisturizer has an accelerated Retinol SA which is a unique combination of Retinol SA, Glucose Complex and Hyaluronic Acid brought together, along with Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and am 40 something so my skin tends towards the dry.  </li>
            <li>Finally after starting using the neutrogena clear pore astringent (which has alcohol)</li>
            <li>Finally, after discontinuing, I have my clear complexion back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently finished a bottle of Loreal Youth Code, the skin luminous one and not the one for dark spots, which here on Amazon reviews were stellar for reducing the appearance of acne marks.</li>
            <li>and I’m sure a company such as Neutrogena would stand behind their product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, which was why I was hesitant to buy this stuff in the first place, but now I wouldn&#x27;t think of trying anything else.</li>
            <li>It tingles just a little at first but didn&#x27;t make my skin break out or anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive products that haven&#x27;t done half as much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m serious, while it&#x27;s not perfect, I&#x27;m positive my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was 8.</li>
            <li>and I do notice a slight reduction in my brown spots, but not as much as I would  like.</li>
            <li>I have very noticeable dark spots and splotches, and was hoping that this product would be the cure, but no such luck.</li>
            <li>I have (had actually) some acne scarring and a pretty uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>However the formula is a little greasy and it really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell how much is in this little glass bottle.  </li>
            <li>The product is amazing for the spots,I had chicken pox three months ago</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product....very good seller....will order again.</li>
            <li> I did not feel the product was too greasy, and it has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> Consumer reports and good house keeping day</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember my complexion ever looking so good.</li>
            <li> my skin feels good in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Great for a night moisturizer, kind of greasy looking for day-time use.  </li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> I hope this is the case, because the benefits are too good to give up, at this point.</li>
            <li> I have never used a face lotion that made my skin look this good.</li>
            <li> Please if you are in your 20&#x27;s then maybe its good..</li>
            <li> Skin feels and looks good.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Keep your face bright and looks nice</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied all in all.</li>
            <li> Price was the biggest factor for purchasing it and after using it for 2 months I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda pleasant but very strong in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product for what it does to my skin and its price!  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing, but I can use this cream on the outer corners of my eyes without any irritation afterwards.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is nice, because it does not leave my skin feeling oily or coated.</li>
            <li> Feels nice applying and leaves skin feeling supple.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous formula, in a really cute pearly glass pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> got this product one week ago in hopes that it would fade my acne scars, which are quite prominent on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Both seem similarly effective and reducing skin imperfections, lines and spots.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this stuff smells bad!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great - and I use it also in the day, it&#x27;s really soothing to my skin and a great feel.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> Easy bottle to apply; feels good after applying.  </li>
            <li> What I liked the most was that it made my skin really smooth, and bright.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I liked similar Neutrogena Night Moisturizer and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> the smell is a bit strong, but after a week your skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t strong or bothersome to me, the packaging and dispenser are nice as well.</li>
            <li> But on top of all that before I even noticed those changes I noticed the fine line on the right side of my mouth was gone 5 days into using this product and that impressed me first!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> Mainly, most of the things I buy is to try and help with the blackheads around my nose</li>
            <li> So I figured I&#x27;d give it a try since my favorite face wash--and</li>
            <li> Really fantastic!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, I&#x27;ve read so many great reviews on it</li>
            <li> It took me more than 2 weeks to see a difference.</li>
            <li> i do think i will see a greater improvement with more time.</li>
            <li> There is a more even tone and some fading of brown spots.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products and the Rapid Tone Repair did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I hope it works better for others.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is about the best CVS/Walgreens carried line use i can rely on, and this moisturizer was cheaper here on Amazon than at my local store.  </li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> I know that Neutrogena is one of the top brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a week and my face seems to have a better complexion and tone.  </li>
            <li> love, love this-</li>
            <li> and he had better results than me.</li>
            <li> I felt this is like a magic poison....</li>
            <li> I think this is more like a concealer and not a cure....</li>
            <li> and it works ok.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I love what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Neutrogena fan forever, and LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I know that Neutrogena is one of the top brands</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is definitely the best for me.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more even and healthier after just 1 week of using it.</li>
            <li> I switched to use a sunscreen moisturizer that is much more oily (used both day and night</li>
            <li> My skin tone is brighter, more even.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, clean fragrance but light.</li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> Lovely smell</li>
            <li> I think the magic is in the vitamin C because I already use the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair with sa/retinol (I have no wrinkles -</li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably brighter and more even toned.</li>
            <li> it was like magic.</li>
            <li> I am glad I stuck with it.</li>
            <li> This product has given me a lovely dewy look without problems with acne.  </li>
            <li> Glad it found it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, I love it.</li>
            <li> but i love this product and will continue to purchase it here.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for a month now and love it.  </li>
            <li> But not to worry I just put on my kiss my face overnight cream then applied this cream on top of that</li>
            <li> I also use the Ageless intensives tone correcting, and I like that better than this.</li>
            <li> but I love it</li>
            <li> By the way - I&#x27;ve probably researched dozens of age spot products and it seems most of them do NOT appear to work.  </li>
            <li> I am able to use the day version without any problem.</li>
            <li> I even got to the point where I felt comfortable not wearing any concealer!</li>
            <li> Oh, and as a moisturizer it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> A good product for the right skin type. :)</li>
            <li> Good for the right skin type.</li>
            <li> i was very good ,happy with the product and was in the right box and was shipped fast and hope it works well and will order again ty for shipping very fast</li>
            <li> Applying first 2 days, my face looked more bright and</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the VERY FIRST DAY - and after almost two weeks, my skin has never looked better in my life!</li>
            <li> They should make the same wonderful products, fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Great retinol cream for mature skin.</li>
            <li> Use at night with BelEssence for a more wrinkle free face-works wonders on wrinkles</li>
            <li> I had some age spots I was trying to lighten up and after using this for 3 weeks I noticed my skin was becoming</li>
            <li> One pump is good for my whole face, but if I want to do my neck too</li>
            <li> My skin feels great and my pores seem smaller and my tone more even.</li>
            <li> and then it was a easy to keep using.  </li>
            <li> Makeup easily covers.</li>
            <li> and if it doesn&#x27;t end up working then you can spend more for more powerful stuff</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product was much to strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> However, since it works for me, I’m pretty sure it will work for most people</li>
            <li> A HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> It works quite well for me, I use it almost daily, and have for over a year now, and have experienced no irritation.l</li>
            <li> I now go comfortably without make up.</li>
            <li> Have switched to Alba Botanica Even Advanced.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion this is an excellent product that does what it says it will do and you don’t have to liquidate your 401K to afford it.</li>
            <li> My pores are itty bitty, my skin feels great and the color is uniform no red acne scars</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin smooth for overnight use.</li>
            <li> Light coverage.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for sensitive</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does!!</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and light.</li>
            <li> so I feel more confident using a well known brand compared to something new.</li>
            <li> so I feel more confident using a well known brand compared to something new.</li>
            <li> I wish you got a little more than one ounce for your money, but I guess good products just cost more.</li>
            <li> It is a nice weight and goes on smoothly, absorbing quickly.  </li>
            <li> I also have summer freckles and some blotchy discolored areas and everything has faded to a more even consistent tone.</li>
            <li> The product has a very powerful scent, not a bad one in fact</li>
            <li> Light, non-oily, disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> but I believe one needs to eat healthy, exercise, do routine facials and take care of his/her skin with good cleansers and other supplements to make the best out of it rather than just depending on one small bottle.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything special about this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because many reviewers said it help diminish acne scars and large pores.</li>
            <li> I did have to stop using it because it began to irritate my skin, specially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Lotion is light, easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t want to read full insight:))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how neutrogena products accomplish all of this, but I&#x27;m super happy with the result on my fair, sensitive, acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> first use, it seemed fine.</li>
            <li> I have mild combination skin.</li>
            <li> , it actually does make you look better and healthy.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says - evens tone and results are quickly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t expect this cream (and I wouldn&#x27;t expect any cream) alone to make a huge noticeable difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t expect this cream (and I wouldn&#x27;t expect any cream) alone to make a huge noticeable difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Skin&#x27;s never been all that smooth or pretty, .but</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin perhaps you will like the new product better.</li>
            <li> Gentle on skin compared to other lighteners I&#x27;ve used, which is a good thing!</li>
            <li> Nothing better then this I always found results the first 3 days I used and is my 3 bottle ,because I spend to much day time out I have to used all the time .</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever written!  </li>
            <li> On the back of the product it states \\&quot;you may experience mild redness, a warm tingling sensation or flaking,which is normal\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> However, it does make my skin feel super soft and leaves it with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> The Tone Repair works quickly and I could see the difference right away.</li>
            <li> YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE USING IT FOR WHAT IT WORTH</li>
            <li> This is the same kind of moisturizer, and soothing, and it&#x27;s  night cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also pleased that it hasn&#x27;t made my acne any worse (and it smells great).</li>
            <li> I have used neutrogena products for years and have rarely had reason to complain.  </li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone; B. It makes it smooth and silky to the touch; C. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin closer to my eyes; D. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores; E. It lightens up my multiple freckles or better</li>
            <li> more and more aged looking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare to find a beauty product that delivers all that it promises plus shows results immediately.</li>
            <li> For me, it also works pretty quick.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> Faded them pretty quickly too.  </li>
            <li> Long review to give a good deal of insight into product for certain skin types and issues</li>
            <li> Smells good and can be used with other products which is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;however</li>
            <li> After using this for 10 days, I&#x27;ve noticed my acne scars are significantly lighter and my skin tone has really evened out.</li>
            <li> Right as I started using this</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> I bought this creme because I have dark circles under my eyes that have been bothering me more and more</li>
            <li> It was fine the day after too, but on day three, my skin began to completely peel off - the top layer of dermis was sloughing off completely.</li>
            <li> Then I typically use Loreal Ideal Moisture for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li> I used with the day cream everyday for 4 weeks and noticed a nice difference!  </li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle to give it a full month or so to work.</li>
            <li> Generally it makes you look healthy and radiant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just thrilled &amp; will be sticking with Nuetrogena for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and dark hair, btw.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the night moisturizer is a little light for me, but it does seem to be effective.</li>
            <li> This is a very unusual formula and to find retinol SA and Hyaluronic acid together with vitamin C is unheard of.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smoother, younger, more even.  </li>
            <li> and I must say in exactly one week since I started using it</li>
            <li> It really does everything you&#x27;d want it to!</li>
            <li> It also smells great (to me at least).</li>
            <li> I love this entire Neutogena retinol product line.  </li>
            <li> You get the picture and it isn&#x27;t a pretty one, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After just 3 nights of consistent</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have too many deep lines.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more plump and younger as well as breakouts happen once a month now!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m buying chemical free natural skin products that takes time but cures the problem and doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer and smoother and looks overall much better.</li>
            <li> This product delivers exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> My skin really loves it!</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have too many deep lines.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> At first, i wore it as a day and night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> my first bottle ( I use it every night &amp; sometimes during the day),</li>
            <li> The warnings say you may experience redness and some peeling at first, but I never did.  </li>
            <li> kept getting more red each time.</li>
            <li> first then this.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I only have to use one product… saving even more.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> The first couple of days your skin does peel and</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely has a more even tone and its look brighter which makes me look refreshed.</li>
            <li> Will Update further as I go along :)</li>
            <li> I have been using two different products on my face most nights (maybe 5 out of 7) for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I do use the day cream in this same line with no problem, so I confidently bought the night cream, however there must be some ingredient that irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> it really really works!</li>
            <li> Within the first week my skin was smoother &amp; more radiant, by the 3rd week</li>
            <li> Rapid tone repair is very smooth, it does not create any irritation and even though I&#x27;ve used it for just a short period of time, I can see and feel the positive results from its use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have in realistic expectations, I have freckles and some spots from the sun, I have a few fine lines on my forehead, I&#x27;m 30 and honestly look 25 or 26.</li>
            <li> The humidity in my area is 25%-50%, and on the 50% days I don&#x27;t really need much moisturizer, but on the other days I suffer from flakes if I don&#x27;t use a good quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of hydrating properly taken care of skin that doesn&#x27;t lean towards very dry.</li>
            <li> I finally got rid of most of my acne, but the scars pretty much cover my face.</li>
            <li> I have quite oily skin,i have a med/fair complexion, and i have post blemish scars i have been desperately trying to get rid of for years, i have tried so many fade and tone creams,expensive &amp; cheap,nothing i been trying has given me great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 year old man in college, I don&#x27;t have many issues in the acne or wrinkle department, but I do have naturally ruddy skin and suffer from blackheads.</li>
            <li> Not only is the price more than reasonable, it’s also a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am also (finally) using a good sunscreen on my face when I know I&#x27;m going outside or will be driving.  </li>
            <li> and yes, I do notice a positive difference.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes, which is why it still got 2 stars, but thats pretty much it.</li>
            <li> With consistent use, I noticed improved smoother overall tone, diminished redness, and diminished look of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I only experienced a slight reddening of my skin the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> so I could easily get the last bits out.</li>
            <li> Most skin products dry my face out, but this one didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Also the smell is too strong and actually gives me headaches sometimes.</li>
            <li> Certainly recommend it</li>
            <li> This (large) area of discoloration is on my left/driving side of my face.  </li>
            <li> It definitely helped to reduce my fine lines</li>
            <li> Today, I noticed my whole face is peeling</li>
            <li> but I must say that my spots are almost gone, thank so much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product!</li>
            <li> This is very affordable for the amount and quality of ingredients, you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also 34 and starting to get a few lines, most notably on my brow where I&#x27;m getting \\&quot;Furrow\\&quot; lines.</li>
            <li> My neck and chin area look so much smoother</li>
            <li> Really reasonably price.</li>
            <li> I would also say that I much prefer the night version compared to the day moisturizer with sunscreen .</li>
            <li> i did not see any changes.but in time this product really work.i am going .</li>
            <li> I have scaring and sun damage under my eyes that is very embarassing for me</li>
            <li> Really works well on my blotchy skin.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was very hopeful this would work.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> Considering the price and the benefits of this product compared to some department store brands, this is the absolute winner.</li>
            <li> Fast results.</li>
            <li> but this product made me feel comfortable enough to do it.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t know which product improved this area on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I has really faded my cystic acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using their stress-something-or-other labeled salicylic acid toner after I wash my face (something gentle from Biore) and Aveno&#x27;s SPF-laden tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it really does work</li>
            <li> the price is really</li>
            <li> it works really well</li>
            <li> In the beginning it can make your skin worse, or it can change the top layers of skin for the better.</li>
            <li> so i went right back to my old Olay 7 stand-by, which doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, moisturizes better, smells nice (or not at all), and at least doesn&#x27;t claim to correct my tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than half way done with the first bottle.  </li>
            <li> At my last facial, my esthetician said that my skin looked incredible and asked if I was had been getting other skin treatments.  </li>
            <li> My other cheek is where most of the acne marks are.</li>
            <li> I wanted my skin to look dewy and clear, and this really does exactly that.</li>
            <li> applied this product day and nite with high ( perhaps too high ! )  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised that after about 4 - 6 weeks use, there has been a significant reduction in the red acne scars.  </li>
            <li> using this despite my young age because i have a few freckles that i want to fade, and this product is kind of giving me results.</li>
            <li> Kinda gross, but it just left a smooth surface below!</li>
            <li> anyone in your 50- and older DO NOT USE THIS</li>
            <li> Great product for toning down red and helping make scarring less visible and overall just better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly to anyone with this issue.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews for this product, I had high hope that it might work.  </li>
            <li> When I first started, I did experience some redness and tingling for the first few days immediately after applying, but it was not unbearable and the sensation faded quickly.</li>
            <li> the pump is a nice touch,  but in the morning I find my skin less moisturized and soft than when I use the old product.  </li>
            <li> Best of all I am seeing noticeable improvement in uneven skin tone, actually seems to be lighting my few &#x27;age&#x27; spots.</li>
            <li> the nighttime version of these types of lotions generally have a higher concentration of retinol.</li>
            <li> Just started using it this week, and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is worth mentioning that peeling and irritation are listed as possible side effects of overuse and should stop after skin adjusts.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have had no negative effects.</li>
            <li> I began using both the day &amp; night time versions of this product a few weeks ago &amp; am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I had a huge pimple on my cheek due to hormones that had been there for weeks.</li>
            <li> I finished an entire bottle and found this moisturizer to be decent - it generally helps with skin tone and mild acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time for a new product, and I would NEVER buy this again.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was waking up every morning to 3 or 4 new zits.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, I feel like it has helped control new outbreaks.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Neutrogena product that came in a tube but decided to give the new product a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> turning 30 gave me a new face.</li>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive, and I can put all around my eyes with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t bothered me one bit.</li>
            <li> In two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed significant fading of my red acne scars, a decrease in the number of new pimples I get, and a speedier heal-time in my current pimples.  </li>
            <li> Adult acne!</li>
            <li> (if you don&#x27;t mind the taste) and a glycolic acid/lactic acid peel every few months..this with the day moisturiser has helped clear my breakouts, fade considerably and keep my skin feeling smooth and looking like 20!</li>
            <li> &gt; The pice should not affect the rating of tis product on Amazon because there are so many different prices on same products from different sellers as well as in stores.</li>

            <li> I have an old scar from stitches on my chin and it has even faded that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently trying out some other night moisturizers, but if I don&#x27;t find anything better</li>
            <li> I have less fine lines and</li>
            <li> I noticed in my mid thirties, after having a baby that my once pretty skin had gone to ughh.</li>
            <li> It gave this 50 year old acne!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference initially, like in the first week, but now, it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it will lighten any more</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> to get an overview of my skin: I&#x27;m 20 years old, Extremely pale, generally an NC-15 to anyone who knows MAC standards with very light acne, I&#x27;ve had more severe acne in the past but have been on Birth control for 4 months now.</li>
            <li> Any new scar i got,the toner reduced it slightly,but any old scaring showed no improvement.</li>
            <li> I will need to use the product more to see the final result, but over all it has improved the look of the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed to see a few people mentioned, this product cause them to break out or too strong for their skin.</li>
            <li> If you have oily, combination, or normal to slightly dry skin that is NOT sensitive to fragrance then you should get on fine with this.</li>
            <li> This is a light moisturizer, and if you have dry skin it may not be enough for you.</li>
            <li> This is the only tone repair product I&#x27;ve found that actually showed an improvement quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a Retinol product, so be prepared for some mild irritation/warming sensation -- especially if used with another facial product for acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use it on certain spots on my face.</li>
            <li> It is light and has little fragrence.</li>
            <li> My skin is a mature (light-to-medium color) skin with some problems like melasma and occasional acne (reaction to certain foods, pollution and creams).</li>
            <li> and my acne scar has been little bit better than last time!</li>
            <li> I really just wanted something to clear my post-acne marks/uneven-ness, but this actually helps keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> At age 77 nothing is going to completely remove wrinkles</li>
            <li> It looks like I was punched) but if I put too much on it then my face is oily in that area the next morning.</li>
            <li> But i am remaining patient and family seeing a difference in the old acne scars i had on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not saying it completely changed my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did the microdermabrasion, and trust me I have paid much bigger money for professionals than for the Neutrogena microderm and this moisterizer, after 6x I have finally gotten rid of a big brown spot that was a burn from some facial trmt, but it gets better-</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not saying it completely changed my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product, which only lasted two weeks, did absolutely nothing for the brown spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> She seems please with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Not only has this faded acne scars, but I&#x27;ve had absolutely ZERO irritation, redness or breakouts from this.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and sometimes during the day, since I seem to be sensitive to the daytime with sunscreen moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin, and this product does not cause me any break outs.</li>
            <li> I can really notice the difference the next morning after applying it before bed.</li>
            <li> My face is as soft as my butt now.</li>
            <li> Both are extremely gentle, the strawberry seed just takes away that last bit of roughness in the winter months.</li>
            <li> None so far.</li>
            <li> they are actually showing up in photographs and are very noticeable and embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> It is still there - but at least 50% better and does not jump out at me anymore.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say the Sun spots or age spots are gone completely ( which I didn&#x27;t expect)</li>
            <li> I had to switch to extremely gentle products to ease my skin back to the way it was before.  </li>
            <li> I have to preface this by saying I had maybe 2 or 3 scars from an adult acne breakout (yeah, zits in my 30s...</li>
            <li> I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to fragrance or unsure if you are then</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrances, not overly, but this gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li> Good product .more expensive in a brick &amp; mortar store.</li>
            <li> Basically it is difficult to find a good product for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I sure am getting a lot of attention, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I was skeptical at first and glad I took a chance.</li>
            <li> I use it at night every other day &amp; it made a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> I developed a few dark spots last summer, i am using the  tone with the nuetrogena microbrasion kit, so far I have noticed them fading, i truly love these products!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides lightening the red spot of the above mentioned breakout to a lighter shade of pink, The product hasn&#x27;t really changed my skin significantly any further.</li>
            <li> (my skin tone is more even and less red) and actually help my skins general condition and reduce acne.</li>
            <li> they are completely gone or barely noticeable now.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, although it does not eliminate age spots entirely, it did wash them out enough I don&#x27;t feel like my 80 year old grandmother.</li>
            <li> It may flake and that might be expected for the first couple of days to a week.</li>
            <li> and my blackheads are pretty much all but gone, as well as my skin is less red from a day to day basis.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel it does anything more or less than the other product.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help my blemishes to fade, but it also has helped prevent new ones from cropping up.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by describing my skin - I&#x27;m 28, my skin is dry, and I don&#x27;t really get blemishes.</li>
            <li> It does (they all do) seem to thin out my skin a bit and make it more pressure sensitive and if I am reading it correctly you need to use a sun screen separately.</li>
            <li> I generally use ROC Max facial wash every night, it has a light exfoliator in it, along with a strawberry seed heavy exfoliator by Mark in Avon.</li>
            <li> and I left many scars, at first I was skeptical to buy it</li>
            <li> my husband is major outdoorsman, I have done his face and neck twice</li>
            <li> Noticed a  major difference in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in conjunction with the Broad Spectrum Rapid Tone Corrector.  </li>
            <li> If it had actually worked I would have been willing to pay double for the next bottle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t&#x27; have too many dark spots but a few light small ones and they have reduced.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this same cream as low as $12.00 and as high as $25.00 per bottle from afferent brick and mortar stores as well as online</li>
            <li> I have purchased this same cream as low as $12.00 and as high as $25.00 per bottle from afferent brick and mortar stores as well as online</li>
            <li> So now instead of 4 huge red marks, there&#x27;s about 10 tiny little marks that are dissolving as I use this stuff.</li>
            <li> It generally takes four weeks for a product to grab hold and change your skin.</li>
            <li> I generally use two to three pumps to cover my skin as I feel.</li>
            <li> I had a strange red mark that looked like a very inflamed pimple on my forehead, but no pimple to speak of.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve used this for one week now, and my crow&#x27;s feet wrinkles are barely visible.</li>
            <li> I started using this product  3 weeks ago and have recently gotten a few compliments on how clear and fresh my complexion looks.</li>
            <li> My facial skin is extremely sensitive to moisturizers, sunscreen, etc..</li>
            <li> However I am completely ecstatic that this \\&quot;tone repair\\&quot; moisturizer seems to ACTUALLY repair tone</li>
            <li> And also, this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough (i&#x27;m 19 years old,</li>
            <li> Another change that was immediate was the apparent decrease in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> Normal to dry skin type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but it does give great results.  </li>
            <li> Rapid Tone Night Moisturizer has an accelerated Retinol SA which is a unique combination of Retinol SA, Glucose Complex and Hyaluronic Acid brought together, along with Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and am 40 something so my skin tends towards the dry.  </li>
            <li> Finally after starting using the neutrogena clear pore astringent (which has alcohol)</li>
            <li> Finally, after discontinuing, I have my clear complexion back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently finished a bottle of Loreal Youth Code, the skin luminous one and not the one for dark spots, which here on Amazon reviews were stellar for reducing the appearance of acne marks.</li>
            <li> and I’m sure a company such as Neutrogena would stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, which was why I was hesitant to buy this stuff in the first place, but now I wouldn&#x27;t think of trying anything else.</li>
            <li> It tingles just a little at first but didn&#x27;t make my skin break out or anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive products that haven&#x27;t done half as much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious, while it&#x27;s not perfect, I&#x27;m positive my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was 8.</li>
            <li> and I do notice a slight reduction in my brown spots, but not as much as I would  like.</li>
            <li> I have very noticeable dark spots and splotches, and was hoping that this product would be the cure, but no such luck.</li>
            <li> I have (had actually) some acne scarring and a pretty uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> However the formula is a little greasy and it really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell how much is in this little glass bottle.  </li>
            <li> The product is amazing for the spots,I had chicken pox three months ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 years old and started getting age spots due to the hormonal changes of menopause.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use the accompanying day time lotion with SPF 30, but I find that using both for long periods of time dries my skin out and leaves it bumpy, so I alternate the daytime lotion with a regular facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> In the past they were kinda big, doting the whole apple of my cheek, now?</li>
            <li> The bottle didn&#x27;t last long enough to tell if it worked or not.  </li>
            <li> and it does really help slough off dead skin cells faster!</li>
            <li> No problems with this so far, feels like a toned down version of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum, doesnt burn after exfoliating.</li>
            <li> A little background information: I am 29 years old with paper white skin.</li>
            <li> So at this point I still have a majority of the product left, it is hard to tell however as it does come in a glass bottle, so you can&#x27;t really judge the remaining product by shaking it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle of Neutrogena  (which I only use  on my forehead and down the sides of my face) and my 3rd of the Vichy (which I use on my entire face).</li>
            <li> No obvious results on my forehead, which is where I&#x27;ve never really had acne before, and yet I have a bunch of those red dots, go figure, but I&#x27;ll take what it is doing for my cheeks</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that despite all the hype of other products will still breakout in the t-zone if i&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li> Dark patches caused by sun damage didn&#x27;t disappear but they are certainly much lighter and less visible then before .</li>
            <li> I am an African American 35 yr old woman that HAD been suffering with acne for the past 2 yrs and this product COMPLETELY stopped the acne and started fading my dark spot within a week!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference for at least a month.</li>
            <li> Usually love their products, disappointing.</li>
            <li> Light but has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it did anything for my skin, at least may not yet anyway.</li>
            <li> I also use the Neutrogena Clear Face 30 sun screen everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months and barely see the dark spots lighting.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen my skin like this in a long time.</li>
            <li> Used for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am African American and left with uneven skin tone from trying everything for my acne.</li>
            <li> I did notice some lightening of a few spots near my hairline.</li>
            <li> It is not a perfect cure-all - I still have some dark marks, and I still get the occasional blemish, but it has helped more in those two regards than any other product I have ever</li>
            <li> Less expensive and better.</li>
            <li> the only other thing I&#x27;ve ever found that helps with blackheads--is from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> And finally - I personally did not notice any redness or any other issues using two products.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be nearly impossible to have an even skin tone and after nearly to weeks, I see significant improvement.</li>
            <li> I never had dry or peeling skin.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin dry and flaky, which is a warning that it&#x27;s working, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference.  </li>
            <li> This product did not live up to expectations and did not fulfill any of the so called &amp;#34;clinically proven&amp;#34; statements on the box.</li>
            <li> I am just shy of my 50th birthday, and I&#x27;ve never been someone to put special creams on my skin.</li>
            <li> During the winter my skin has a habit of getting very dry, and I haven&#x27;t had a single dry patch since using this product.</li>
            <li> I had dark spots from the sun on my jaw line and some on my upper chest area and use both products to include those areas.</li>
            <li> Also, upon further research I did not find any ingredient in this product which would reduce the looks of dark spots and discoloration.</li>
            <li> its a shame they&#x27;ve recently jacked up the price because it&#x27;s definately not worth it.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit skeptical that this product could live up to the claims on the box, but it really does!  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin supple and and glowy, and I only use half of a drop at night after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a realistic expectation.</li>
            <li> I got this cream thinking it would help remove/fade dark spots, but I have been using for a few weeks and so far no change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a realistic expectation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only half done w/</li>
            <li> After using this for about a month and a half now I can not only see the difference but feel it.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I burned my face last summer after a day at the beach and for a year have been trying to find anything to lighten up the big dark blotches on my forehead and checks!!!  </li>
            <li> but when I do im careful of the amount I apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s not really carried in CVS stores anymore however.</li>
            <li> But when I run out or don&#x27;t use it everyday, my untoned skin comes back.</li>
            <li> I used it for over a month and saw absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> This works as expected, not too oily and has a neutral smell.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a  lot of time in the sun&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> i used it every night until the bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> I initially saw a reduction in the size of my pores after a few weeks use...</li>
            <li> had minimal tingling in the beginning of use.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use, with advil, until empty and will report my results if anything changes.</li>
            <li> This cream arrived with a third of the product wasted due to a loose lid causing it to be spilled and unusable inside of the box.</li>
            <li> It has only been a little over a week and combined with the use of the cleanser and dark sport corrector</li>
            <li> This product really does reduce freckles, marks and small scars from delicate skin on the face and hands.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the smell is irritating and it&#x27;s a little rough on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn but did when I used any other lotions on my face.</li>
            <li> My reason for using this cream was to do my due diligence and know that I&#x27;m taking care of my skin and not just giving up on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My reason for using this cream was to do my due diligence and know that I&#x27;m taking care of my skin and not just giving up on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it every other night.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and other products.</li>
            <li> My skin was extremely irritated and flaky.</li>
            <li> My cheeks and forehead have red marks due to the past acne, however I even these small red marks in places</li>
            <li> Then, finally, this stuff for the past week.</li>
            <li> Purchase from Amazon due to price.</li>
            <li> Have used and continue to use other retinol products without this result.  </li>
            <li> Remember, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Not greasy like other products.</li>
            <li> I might consider other options.</li>
            <li> I have seen no improvement in my Melasma due to pregnancy hormones altering the color of my skin on my cheekbones creating brown spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased due to rave reviews here to even my increasingly blotchy looking face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly (with just a few exceptions) for over 3 weeks and noticed dry areas on the side of my nose a week ago.  </li>
            <li> The retinol and vitamin C are the active ingredients in this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin as of late and using this only helps a little bit.</li>
            <li> Very little product in this very tiny, but heavy bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try to lighten some dark areas on my face.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about Neutrogena products is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> so whenever I get a blemish, the dark mark lingers for months.</li>
            <li> - I read that retinol can help reduce dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average and it works.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just average.  </li>
            <li> a lot of time trying to hide the dark spots.</li>
            <li> So while out looking at the Loreal Youth Code, specifically for dark spots, I picked up this instead.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice any change with the dark shadows under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use the day time dark spot repair as well.</li>
            <li> Noticed with use that dark spots are less noticeable .</li>
            <li> It got rid of the dark spots on my face in less than a week.</li>
            <li> It lighted the areas slightly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a week I can see a visibile reduction in redness, my scars are less noticable and there is nary a zit to be found.</li>
            <li> I have black spots.....</li>
            <li> We all age and even the less vain are sometimes bothered by age spots.  </li>
            <li> I am a 48 yr Black woman who&#x27;s had acne since I was 15.</li>
            <li> : My skin does feel smoother, and the acne scars seem to have faded slightly</li>
            <li> odor ( slight), and</li>
            <li> I used it for a 4 weeks and did not notice any difference in the tone of my skin and a few dark spot that I have were not diminished.</li>
            <li> Their not real greasy or heavy, but the pump puts out very little product.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve noticed some patches of skin peeling a little.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that it does break out your skin a little bit</li>
            <li> Not very satisfied with the results or the price.</li>
            <li> I get dullness and uneven texture in my skin in combination with a little acne on my chin.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and then tried again a few weeks later-same thing, along with little bumps under the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I am finding it difficult for the pimples to clear from my face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t finished the bottle yet and the spots have almost disappeared but for a few stubborn areas.</li>
            <li> Wasted my time and money.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to waste this toner I bought</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel pasty or heavy.</li>
            <li> This dried out my skin because vitamin A is drying.</li>
            <li> I still have a few stubborn freckles that won&#x27;t go away though.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer now for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night I can remember too, it is not too oily and i can see small changes to the dark marks on my face.  </li>
            <li> When used everyday, my face is glowing and toned.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been 3 weeks at this point and my poor nose is still constantly peeling.)</li>
            <li> i noticed a difference within a few days</li>
            <li> This stuff actually dried out the pimple</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is one of few I can use from now on.</li>
            <li> And yes - this is not a cheap process.  </li>
            <li> I started using this every night before bed and within a few days</li>
            <li> Not a strong lightener.  </li>
            <li> After trying bio oil (which caused flare ups like crazy) and prescription topical creams (which dry out my skin), I bought this tone repair out of desperation.</li>
            <li> I kept having painful rashes all over my neck, I didn&#x27;t use it on my face, wanted to try it first on my neck and chin before applying to my face.</li>
            <li> Not long after using this my face began to break out in deep, painful blemishes which I have never had before.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, dark marks are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> The products deliver as promised; I have smoother skin tone and my dark blotchy patches are fading slowly.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin that has flared terribly and repeatedly scarring my skin for the last two years due to a mixture of stress and cystic acne from a combination of things, one of which I think was too much biotin.</li>
            <li> I tried acne products and felt like I was yo-yo-ing between oily broken out skin and dry peeling skin.</li>
            <li> Works little bit!</li>
            <li> Subtle, but progressive change to dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have used this product every day for the past year.</li>
            <li> Not sure why just in that area.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it did NOT erase any lines by the end of the tiny 1 ounce bottle so for the price I would suggest Infinite Aloe Skin cream...</li>
            <li> I had gotten a lot of small, blotchy sunspots from the California sun and</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to start this routine on my hands which are covered with small spots (and wrinkles).  </li>
            <li> i was hoping for even a small improvement on my skin</li>
            <li> I always apply this with just a small amount of water on my hands as it goes on easier, and the product lasts longer too.</li>
            <li> Very harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend using this product for at least a month before making any judgements about the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all around for products that claim to get rid of discoloration from past acne marks, red spots, and just any unpleasant features.</li>
            <li> Works slowly on fading brown spots.  </li>
            <li> I use it along with the day cream with SPF and am already noticing a dramatic difference in the dark spots on my face!  </li>
            <li> In the past week I have noticed results!</li>
            <li> have serious \\&quot;problem\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> I thought this is a magic...but third day, my skin broke out badly...</li>
            <li> When I ran out, after a couple of days, my skin reverted to its pre cream issues of scary wrinkles around the eyes and and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Not good for my skin</li>
            <li> I did not notice a difference on the spots and this was after several weeks of use :(</li>
            <li> These things either had no effect or made things worse by way of irritating and reddening or even burning my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a cluster of 4 freckles all on 1 cheek that has annoyed me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I specifically chose the “Night” version because [I have no way of confirming this as it’s a trade secret]</li>
            <li> and it works wonders without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;ve broken up into freckle sized marks.</li>
            <li> About 2-3 months ago I realized my &amp;#34;dark area&amp;#34; had really decreased A LOT.  </li>
            <li> I use less makeup and my aging skin doesn&#x27;t look so bad.</li>
            <li> I promise I am not trying to be dramatic</li>
            <li> I will have to say that day 3 was a little painful.</li>
            <li> Was sent the wrong bottle.</li>
            <li> + and getting serious age/sun spots on my forehead that are getting so bad</li>
            <li> I regretted it due to the awful smell.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but bought it!  </li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t terribly bad, but they were noticeable.  </li>
            <li> This tings like crazy!</li>
            <li> I see some reviews saying they were disappointed</li>
            <li> I see some reviews saying they were disappointed</li>
            <li> you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very Sad!</li>
            <li> Very painful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as I use Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this too terribly often</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst product I ever bought.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have combination skin, &amp;surface scars left from my acne on my chin, was hoping it would help fade my scars but just gave me acne all over again. It didn&#x27;t burn but did when I used any other lotions on my face.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without leaving oily residue. My skin feels great and my pores seem smaller and my tone more even. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try to lighten some dark areas on my face.  It says it should work in seven days.  It lighted the areas slightly.  I will continue to use it. What I liked the most was that it made my skin really smooth, and bright.  It also made my pores smaller.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. At age 77 nothing is going to completely remove wrinkles but it has helped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly (with just a few exceptions) for over 3 weeks and noticed dry areas on the side of my nose a week ago.  Today, I noticed my whole face is peeling and when I put anything on it, its excruciating!  I don&#x27;t know if this product lives up to any claims or not - I can&#x27;t continue using it.  I&#x27;ve used the day product with no problems for months.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help even out my skin tone from acne scars. I finally got rid of most of my acne, but the scars pretty much cover my face. It moisturizes, which is why it still got 2 stars, but thats pretty much it. Didn&#x27;t help my skin tone at all.</li>
            <li> Keep your face bright and looks nice</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this too terribly often but when I do im careful of the amount I apply. I only use it on certain spots on my face. I have a red blotch (unsure of what it is or if it&#x27;s scar tissue, never went to a doctor. It looks like I was punched) but if I put too much on it then my face is oily in that area the next morning. But with consecutive use it did improve the color. However, since I don&#x27;t use it daily the redness did come back some.. BUT it DID work!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is nice, because it does not leave my skin feeling oily or coated. It is light and has little fragrence.</li>
            <li> great toner , my wife loves it</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. Lotion is light, easily absorbed. I have used this product every day for the past year. My skin is smoother, dark marks are slowly fading. At my last facial, my esthetician said that my skin looked incredible and asked if I was had been getting other skin treatments.  My eyes are very sensitive, and I can put all around my eyes with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Ouch.  This tings like crazy!</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m sold. I am just shy of my 50th birthday, and I&#x27;ve never been someone to put special creams on my skin. But, the crow&#x27;s feet wrinkles are getting to be quite noticeable. Well, I&#x27;ve used this for one week now, and my crow&#x27;s feet wrinkles are barely visible. It leaves my skin supple and and glowy, and I only use half of a drop at night after I wash my face. I also have very sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t bothered me one bit. Somebody pinch me! This is great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who loves this product. a great buy and is as advertised. Go for it.</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims to do--evens your skin tone noticeably.  I use it at night every other day &amp; it made a difference right away.  My skin looks smoother, younger, more even.  I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance. I will reorder this product.</li>
            <li> I had visible results within a week!</li>
            <li> Love it! I have oily skin that has flared terribly and repeatedly scarring my skin for the last two years due to a mixture of stress and cystic acne from a combination of things, one of which I think was too much biotin. Adult acne! I tried everything. Everything I could get my hands on. Finally after starting using the neutrogena clear pore astringent (which has alcohol) a cleansing diet of detox teas like the Peach detox by Yogi (if you don&#x27;t mind the taste) and a glycolic acid/lactic acid peel every few months..this with the day moisturiser has helped clear my breakouts, fade considerably and keep my skin feeling smooth and looking like 20! Yay!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as it is advertised.</li>
            <li> It has only been a little over a week and combined with the use of the cleanser and dark sport corrector I am seeing noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 year old man in college, I don&#x27;t have many issues in the acne or wrinkle department, but I do have naturally ruddy skin and suffer from blackheads. Mainly, most of the things I buy is to try and help with the blackheads around my nose and I recently read that retinol helps with blackheads. I did research and came across this Neutrogena product that also helps with tone issues. So I figured I&#x27;d give it a try since my favorite face wash--and the only other thing I&#x27;ve ever found that helps with blackheads--is from Neutrogena. And it says you&#x27;ll notice results in a week and I must say in exactly one week since I started using it my skin isn&#x27;t as oily anymore and my blackheads are pretty much all but gone, as well as my skin is less red from a day to day basis. But on top of all that before I even noticed those changes I noticed the fine line on the right side of my mouth was gone 5 days into using this product and that impressed me first! I went out and bought the day version as well! Their not real greasy or heavy, but the pump puts out very little product. One pump is good for my whole face, but if I want to do my neck too I use two pumps.</li>
            <li> Smells good and can be used with other products which is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;however I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement on my face</li>
            <li> Really fantastic! I have mild combination skin. I get dullness and uneven texture in my skin in combination with a little acne on my chin. I wanted my skin to look dewy and clear, and this really does exactly that. I really just wanted something to clear my post-acne marks/uneven-ness, but this actually helps keep my skin clear. It really does everything you&#x27;d want it to! I wish you got a little more than one ounce for your money, but I guess good products just cost more. It also smells great (to me at least). For me, it also works pretty quick. You can see a difference in a week.</li>
            <li> Easy bottle to apply; feels good after applying.  Hope it helps the sun spots.</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL WITHIN TWO TO THREE DAYS. YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE USING IT FOR WHAT IT WORTH</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 years old and started getting age spots due to the hormonal changes of menopause. I started using this product  3 weeks ago and have recently gotten a few compliments on how clear and fresh my complexion looks. I use the product twice daily (morning and evening) and like how it absorbs in my skin. It even works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing for the spots,I had chicken pox three months ago and I left many scars, at first I was skeptical to buy it but I must say that my spots are almost gone, thank so much and I have to say that the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> My facial skin is extremely sensitive to moisturizers, sunscreen, etc.. Rapid tone repair is very smooth, it does not create any irritation and even though I&#x27;ve used it for just a short period of time, I can see and feel the positive results from its use. I highly recommend the product!</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome.  I used with the day cream everyday for 4 weeks and noticed a nice difference!  Great product for toning down red and helping make scarring less visible and overall just better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I love this entire Neutogena retinol product line.  My dermatologist said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re using on your skin, but keep using it!&amp;#34;  Okey dokey, I believe I will!!!</li>
            <li> Great product . Noticed with use that dark spots are less noticeable .</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, I&#x27;ve read so many great reviews on it but it doesn&#x27;t suit my skin. I kept having painful rashes all over my neck, I didn&#x27;t use it on my face, wanted to try it first on my neck and chin before applying to my face. I&#x27;ve not given up, would still continue to use until it&#x27;s finished. But with the rate things are going, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be reordering.</li>
            <li> Works slowly on fading brown spots.  Keep using it and you will see a difference.</li>
            <li> It took me more than 2 weeks to see a difference. Maybe about 1 month. But i am remaining patient and family seeing a difference in the old acne scars i had on my cheeks. I will stick with using this i do think i will see a greater improvement with more time.</li>
            <li> My skin is aging, I have some brown spots and lines. I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but do want improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This Rapid Tone Night Moisturizer has an accelerated Retinol SA which is a unique combination of Retinol SA, Glucose Complex and Hyaluronic Acid brought together, along with Vitamin C. This is a very unusual formula and to find retinol SA and Hyaluronic acid together with vitamin C is unheard of. These formulas work to help provide increased clarity and brighter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The info from Neutrogena tells us we&#x27;d will see results in one week. I didn&#x27;t see much difference for at least a month. I did find this product did help to nourish and hydrate my skin. This is a light moisturizer, and if you have dry skin it may not be enough for you. The scent is clean and light. Heavily scented moisturizers really offend my senses, and this scent is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the retinol and hyaluronic acid you might expect red and irritated skin. It may flake and that might be expected for the first couple of days to a week. It you continue to notice irritation,stop using it, it may be the combination of both ingredients that affect you. Try another brand and use judiciously. I have used retinol SA and hyaluronic acid products, so this product is perfect for me. With consistent use, I noticed improved smoother overall tone, diminished redness, and diminished look of fine lines. There is a more even tone and some fading of brown spots. The consistency of the night moisturizer is a little light for me, but it does seem to be effective. It may be the heavier night creams I have been using are not as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using this product for at least a month before making any judgements about the effectiveness. This is very affordable for the amount and quality of ingredients, you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 03-13-14</li>
            <li> i like all neutrogena products. i thoug this will make a diference in my skin but after only 5 uses i got a reaction, my skin was irritated and red</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Consumer reports and good house keeping day this is the best on the market. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have serious \\&quot;problem\\&quot; skin. Oily acne ridden \\&quot;t zone\\&quot;. Seborheaic dermatitis in my eyebrows and nasal creases. rosacea on my nose and cheeks. Acne scarring. I&#x27;m also 34 and starting to get a few lines, most notably on my brow where I&#x27;m getting \\&quot;Furrow\\&quot; lines. You get the picture and it isn&#x27;t a pretty one, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of perscription medications like retin-a and tetracyclene. I have also try otc topicals like proactiv, benzol peroxide, salicylic acid. Lots of brands, lots of formulations... These things either had no effect or made things worse by way of irritating and reddening or even burning my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, for some reason, I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a week I can see a visibile reduction in redness, my scars are less noticable and there is nary a zit to be found. I&#x27;m serious, while it&#x27;s not perfect, I&#x27;m positive my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was 8. I havne&#x27;t noticed a difference in the lines, yet. However I am completely ecstatic that this \\&quot;tone repair\\&quot; moisturizer seems to ACTUALLY repair tone (my skin tone is more even and less red) and actually help my skins general condition and reduce acne.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products and the Rapid Tone Repair did not disappoint. I started using it along with the&lt;br /&gt;Pore Refining Daily Cleanser. I can&#x27;t remember my complexion ever looking so good. I sure am getting a lot of attention, if you know what I mean. The Tone Repair works quickly and I could see the difference right away. I had dark spots from the sun on my jaw line and some on my upper chest area and use both products to include those areas. I haven&#x27;t finished the bottle yet and the spots have almost disappeared but for a few stubborn areas. My neck and chin area look so much smoother it has taken years off my appearance. I did however have to cut back some on putting it on my chest area because after about two weeks of use, I started breaking out. Very painful. Not sure why just in that area. I also use the Neutrogena Clear Face 30 sun screen everyday. The only complaint I have about Neutrogena products is the fragrance. They should make the same wonderful products, fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I used it every night.  it aborbs very good, not greasy.  my skin feels good in the morning.  recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> It works quite well for me, I use it almost daily, and have for over a year now, and have experienced no irritation.l</li>
            <li> No problems with this so far, feels like a toned down version of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum, doesnt burn after exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Have been using once a day with matching moisturizer for 3 weeks. Feels nice applying and leaves skin feeling supple. Best of all I am seeing noticeable improvement in uneven skin tone, actually seems to be lighting my few &#x27;age&#x27; spots. 😊074</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing it advertised in multiple ladies magazines.  I had a cluster of 4 freckles all on 1 cheek that has annoyed me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this product day and nite with high ( perhaps too high ! )  hopes of finally lightening them up and ultimately having them fade completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.  Did nothing at all.  Wasted my time and money.  I hope it works better for others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but it does give great results.  I have combination skin that despite all the hype of other products will still breakout in the t-zone if i&#x27;m not careful.  Neutrogena is about the best CVS/Walgreens carried line use i can rely on, and this moisturizer was cheaper here on Amazon than at my local store.  After just 3 nights of consistent I can see a difference in the  amount of oiliness in my t-zone, though i can&#x27;t see any difference in my &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34; (which might just be freckles).  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the day and night versions for about 6 months now. First of all, I didn&#x27;t expect this cream (and I wouldn&#x27;t expect any cream) alone to make a huge noticeable difference on my skin. It&#x27;s just not a realistic expectation. I see some reviews saying they were disappointed and I understand but I believe one needs to eat healthy, exercise, do routine facials and take care of his/her skin with good cleansers and other supplements to make the best out of it rather than just depending on one small bottle. My reason for using this cream was to do my due diligence and know that I&#x27;m taking care of my skin and not just giving up on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has made some difference on my skin as I had some parts on my face where I could see pores were larger and now they are not so noticeable. Also maybe 15-20 reduced/less visible lines but I&#x27;m 37 so I didn&#x27;t have too many deep lines. I think my skin looks also smoother and silkier now compared to before but again, I&#x27;m not saying it completely changed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The pice should not affect the rating of tis product on Amazon because there are so many different prices on same products from different sellers as well as in stores. I have purchased this same cream as low as $12.00 and as high as $25.00 per bottle from afferent brick and mortar stores as well as online stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this cream serves it&#x27;s purpose and does what it&#x27;s intended to do. I know that Neutrogena is one of the top brands so I feel more confident using a well known brand compared to something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a week and my face seems to have a better complexion and tone.  Great for a night moisturizer, kind of greasy looking for day-time use.  However, does not make me break out.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin so whenever I get a blemish, the dark mark lingers for months. This treatment is the best solution I have found within this price range. Not only does it help my blemishes to fade, but it also has helped prevent new ones from cropping up. It is not a perfect cure-all - I still have some dark marks, and I still get the occasional blemish, but it has helped more in those two regards than any other product I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 3-4 months now. When I first started, I did experience some redness and tingling for the first few days immediately after applying, but it was not unbearable and the sensation faded quickly. Sometimes I use the accompanying day time lotion with SPF 30, but I find that using both for long periods of time dries my skin out and leaves it bumpy, so I alternate the daytime lotion with a regular facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more plump and younger as well as breakouts happen once a month now! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the only tone repair product I&#x27;ve found that actually showed an improvement quickly.  I recommend it highly to anyone with this issue.</li>
            <li> Was sent the wrong bottle. Dont buy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks. I like the consistency of the moisturizer and it blends well into the skin. It did not fade my brown spots, however, I have noticed that the texture of my skin is smoother so I will continue to use it. I reduced the rating by one star since it did not fade my spots.</li>
            <li> I have quite oily skin,i have a med/fair complexion, and i have post blemish scars i have been desperately trying to get rid of for years, i have tried so many fade and tone creams,expensive &amp; cheap,nothing i been trying has given me great results. I gave this product 4 months to impress me and it did not. On the back of the product it states \\&quot;you may experience mild redness, a warm tingling sensation or flaking,which is normal\\&quot;. I didn&#x27;t experience none of the above. Any new scar i got,the toner reduced it slightly,but any old scaring showed no improvement. My search continues.</li>
            <li> love, love this- I did the microdermabrasion, and trust me I have paid much bigger money for professionals than for the Neutrogena microderm and this moisterizer, after 6x I have finally gotten rid of a big brown spot that was a burn from some facial trmt, but it gets better-my husband is major outdoorsman, I have done his face and neck twice and he had better results than me. I bought this for my sister and my niece as well.</li>
            <li> I have black spots.....Applying first 2 days, my face looked more bright and even skin tone...I thought this is a magic...but third day, my skin broke out badly...I got big bumps all over my face....So I stopped using...I felt this is like a magic poison....I think this is more like a concealer and not a cure....&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m buying chemical free natural skin products that takes time but cures the problem and doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to waste this toner I bought so I&#x27;m using on my legs, knee and it works ok.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever written!  I HAD to!!!  I burned my face last summer after a day at the beach and for a year have been trying to find anything to lighten up the big dark blotches on my forehead and checks!!!  This is it!!  After just one week i can see a huge difference!!! I would say try it!!  You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t strong or bothersome to me, the packaging and dispenser are nice as well. However the formula is a little greasy and it really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing. I think I have seen some reduction in acne scarring, however I imagine any retinol-containing cream would do the same.</li>
            <li> This product really does reduce freckles, marks and small scars from delicate skin on the face and hands.  I use it mostly on my hands.  USE WITH SUNSCREEN.  Really reasonably price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I do notice a slight reduction in my brown spots, but not as much as I would  like.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. Very little product in this very tiny, but heavy bottle. Usually love their products, disappointing.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does!! I love it!! I&#x27;m buying the second bottle of both the day and night versions. My skin is clearer and smoother and looks overall much better. Just hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it!</li>
            <li> the price online is definitely a reason to purchase Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair... unfortunately it did NOT erase any lines by the end of the tiny 1 ounce bottle so for the price I would suggest Infinite Aloe Skin cream... you get a much larger jar and it does make your skin feel softer</li>
            <li> This is the same kind of moisturizer, and soothing, and it&#x27;s  night cream.</li>
            <li> Great night time moisturizer! My face felt so plump &amp; rejuvenated in the morning &amp; yes I completed the entire bottle before posting the review! Did not break me out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything special about this product. Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t soothe my skin.</li>
            <li> Already bought this for my daughter... I love what it has done for my skin. I now go comfortably without make up. Noticed a  major difference in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous formula, in a really cute pearly glass pump bottle. It feels luxurious to use!</li>
            <li> This product delivers exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> We all age and even the less vain are sometimes bothered by age spots.  This product works as well as the $70 stuff my mother suggested I try.  It does (they all do) seem to thin out my skin a bit and make it more pressure sensitive and if I am reading it correctly you need to use a sun screen separately. I am very satisfied all in all.</li>
            <li> This product is not designed for brown skin tones.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months and barely see the dark spots lighting. It&#x27;s time for a new product, and I would NEVER buy this again.</li>
            <li> Very good product and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Subtle, but progressive change to dark spots. If you are looking for an overnight change this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> I got this cream thinking it would help remove/fade dark spots, but I have been using for a few weeks and so far no change. I will continue to use thought, as it might take time and I want to give it the benefit of the doubt! LOL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Neutrogena fan forever, and LOVE this moisturizer. My skin really loves it! Thank you, Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the day and night versions for about 6 months now. First of all, I didn&#x27;t expect this cream (and I wouldn&#x27;t expect any cream) alone to make a huge noticeable difference on my skin. It&#x27;s just not a realistic expectation.

Also maybe 15-20 reduced/less visible lines but I&#x27;m 37 so I didn&#x27;t have too many deep lines. I didn&#x27;t&#x27; have too many dark spots but a few light small ones and they have reduced. I think my skin looks also smoother and silkier now compared to before but again, I&#x27;m not saying it completely changed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pice should not affect the rating of tis product on Amazon because there are so many different prices on same products from different sellers as well as in stores.

I know that Neutrogena is one of the top brands so I feel more confident using a well known brand compared to something new.</li>
            <li> This really works! I saw a difference within 3 days. Light, non-oily, disappears quickly. Doesn&#x27;t feel pasty or heavy. I have an old scar from stitches on my chin and it has even faded that! I also have summer freckles and some blotchy discolored areas and everything has faded to a more even consistent tone. Love it!</li>
            <li> I finished an entire bottle and found this moisturizer to be decent - it generally helps with skin tone and mild acne. It didn&#x27;t blow me away, but I also don&#x27;t believe in miracle products. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s comparable to [[ASIN:B0018SAJAY RoC Multi-Correxion Night Treatment, 1 Ounce]]. I do like that the Neutrogena product doesn&#x27;t contain parabens while RoC does. I&#x27;m currently trying out some other night moisturizers, but if I don&#x27;t find anything better it&#x27;s possible I will return to this one. I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s not really carried in CVS stores anymore however.</li>
            <li> Seems to lighten spots some.  Not a strong lightener.  Gentle on skin compared to other lighteners I&#x27;ve used, which is a good thing!</li>
            <li> Up until 2 weeks ago, I was struggling with ways to get rid of acne scars for months. After trying bio oil (which caused flare ups like crazy) and prescription topical creams (which dry out my skin), I bought this tone repair out of desperation. It&#x27;s a little pricey, which was why I was hesitant to buy this stuff in the first place, but now I wouldn&#x27;t think of trying anything else. After using this for 10 days, I&#x27;ve noticed my acne scars are significantly lighter and my skin tone has really evened out. I&#x27;m also pleased that it hasn&#x27;t made my acne any worse (and it smells great). Would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is definitely the best for me. My skin looks more even and healthier after just 1 week of using it. Dark patches caused by sun damage didn&#x27;t disappear but they are certainly much lighter and less visible then before . I have less fine lines and miraculously this cream  moisturises my skin without causing spots and breakouts ! I would also say that I much prefer the night version compared to the day moisturizer with sunscreen . Certainly recommend it</li>
            <li> Good product .more expensive in a brick &amp; mortar store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than half way done with the first bottle.  At first, i wore it as a day and night moisturizer. This dried out my skin because vitamin A is drying. And also, this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough (i&#x27;m 19 years old, though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I switched to use a sunscreen moisturizer that is much more oily (used both day and night,it makes me break out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you use a greasier moisturizer in the day and this one at night, it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this despite my young age because i have a few freckles that i want to fade, and this product is kind of giving me results. I still have a few stubborn freckles that won&#x27;t go away though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought my second bottle, so that means I like it. My skin tone is brighter, more even. I use it every other night. Have never felt irritation. Pleasant, clean fragrance but light.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift, had no complaints</li>
            <li> i purchased this product.i used about a weeks i did not see any changes.but in time this product really work.i am going . to buy another one</li>
            <li> This product, which only lasted two weeks, did absolutely nothing for the brown spots on my face.  Not very satisfied with the results or the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing better then this I always found results the first 3 days I used and is my 3 bottle ,because I spend to much day time out I have to used all the time . I love it . Great deliver thsnks</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer now for a few weeks. I think it&#x27;s doing something but it hasn&#x27;t lightened my sun spots as well as I was hoping it would. It tingles just a little at first but didn&#x27;t make my skin break out or anything. Your skin gets used to it after a couple of uses. I will continue to use it in hopes it&#x27;s improving my skin texture.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night I can remember too, it is not too oily and i can see small changes to the dark marks on my face.  I will need to use the product more to see the final result, but over all it has improved the look of the dark spots.  I have scaring and sun damage under my eyes that is very embarassing for me and I&#x27;ve been dying to get rid of them.  This product is helping to reduce their darkness and hopefully over time will help to get rid of them, if not I may go see a dermotologist.</li>
            <li> I got pimples on my face after using it for just two days and I am finding it difficult for the pimples to clear from my face.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Really works well on my blotchy skin. Lovely smell</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  I use it along with the day cream with SPF and am already noticing a dramatic difference in the dark spots on my face!  A great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She&#x27;s been using for a couple weeks. She seems please with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was very hopeful this would work. I noticed a difference the VERY FIRST DAY - and after almost two weeks, my skin has never looked better in my life! I am a 48 yr Black woman who&#x27;s had acne since I was 15. Not only has this faded acne scars, but I&#x27;ve had absolutely ZERO irritation, redness or breakouts from this. (It even helped heal a zit that was starting!) I think the magic is in the vitamin C because I already use the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair with sa/retinol (I have no wrinkles - I was only using it proactively and only 2-3 times a week. I&#x27;m only half done w/my first bottle ( I use it every night &amp; sometimes during the day), but I&#x27;m back ordering my 2nd bottle because I don&#x27;t EVER want to be without this product now that I&#x27;ve discovered it.</li>
            <li> A little background information: I am 29 years old with paper white skin. I had never had acne in my life  until about six months ago, and BOOM. I felt like I was waking up every morning to 3 or 4 new zits. I tried acne products and felt like I was yo-yo-ing between oily broken out skin and dry peeling skin. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product one week ago in hopes that it would fade my acne scars, which are quite prominent on my fair skin. I use it twice daily (as I have not yet purchased the daytime formula) immediately after washing my face in the morning and before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: My skin does feel smoother, and the acne scars seem to have faded slightly (of course, it&#x27;s only been one week). As a bonus, I feel like it has helped control new outbreaks. This may just be a coincidence, but I hope it continues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; when I put it on, it BURNS. I&#x27;m a relatively stubborn person, however, so I continue to use it regularly. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed some patches of skin peeling a little. They aren&#x27;t red and irritated like they were with acne products, so I can accept that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth mentioning that peeling and irritation are listed as possible side effects of overuse and should stop after skin adjusts. I hope this is the case, because the benefits are too good to give up, at this point.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily skin. I bought this product because many reviewers said it help diminish acne scars and large pores. Well, I have used it for about a month now and I will say that it does not help acne or reduce pores. However, it does make my skin feel super soft and leaves it with a healthy glow. I got a compliment from my dentist that my skin looked very nice and &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34;. During the winter my skin has a habit of getting very dry, and I haven&#x27;t had a single dry patch since using this product. Overall, it does what it says: rapid tone repair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years until I learned animal testing is done on Neutogena products. Have switched to Alba Botanica Even Advanced. Less expensive and better.</li>
            <li> Wish I found this years ago. Great product. Visible results.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in conjunction with the Broad Spectrum Rapid Tone Corrector.  The products deliver as promised; I have smoother skin tone and my dark blotchy patches are fading slowly.  This is a Retinol product, so be prepared for some mild irritation/warming sensation -- especially if used with another facial product for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a mid priced (mid priced for me) beauty &amp;#34;potion&amp;#34; it&#x27;s a keeper in my book (...or would that be medicine cabinet...)!</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  I use it every night and sometimes during the day, since I seem to be sensitive to the daytime with sunscreen moisturizer.  It is a nice weight and goes on smoothly, absorbing quickly.  Never a sticky or gummy feeling after application.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle to give it a full month or so to work. No change in the appearance of my age spots...and I am only 39.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products, and this was the only one that faded stubborn brown areas on my jawline and neck.  Faded them pretty quickly too.  I a very happy with this and will reorder!</li>
            <li> I was a little bit skeptical that this product could live up to the claims on the box, but it really does!  I have only been using it for a week and there is already a visible difference in my skin.  I had gotten a lot of small, blotchy sunspots from the California sun and they are completely gone or barely noticeable now.  Not only that, but it cleared up any acne!  The warnings say you may experience redness and some peeling at first, but I never did.  If it works this well in only a week, I can only imagine what it will accomplish in a month!</li>
            <li> This product works. When used everyday, my face is glowing and toned. But when I run out or don&#x27;t use it everyday, my untoned skin comes back. I wish it worked in a way so that my skin wasn&#x27;t dependent on it.&lt;br /&gt;And I have naturally oily skin, and this product does not cause me any break outs.</li>
            <li> Light but has a weird smell. That said, it works just as it states. Skin is even and appearance is brighter. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Buy this product! No matter what your issue, it will improve it. Eliminated my acne, redness and evened skin tone. Best product over the counter. LOVE!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Minimizes the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by describing my skin - I&#x27;m 28, my skin is dry, and I don&#x27;t really get blemishes. The humidity in my area is 25%-50%, and on the 50% days I don&#x27;t really need much moisturizer, but on the other days I suffer from flakes if I don&#x27;t use a good quality moisturizer. I bought this creme because I have dark circles under my eyes that have been bothering me more and more - I read that retinol can help reduce dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first use, it seemed fine. It was fine the day after too, but on day three, my skin began to completely peel off - the top layer of dermis was sloughing off completely. I discontinued use but it took over a week for my skin to recover (and it&#x27;s been 3 weeks at this point and my poor nose is still constantly peeling.) I don&#x27;t think I will try using it again.</li>
            <li> Works little bit! i have using this for about 2 weeks! and my acne scar has been little bit better than last time!</li>
            <li> i was very good ,happy with the product and was in the right box and was shipped fast and hope it works well and will order again ty for shipping very fast thank you so much</li>
            <li> Looking for a miracle for age spots/sun spots. I noticed in my mid thirties, after having a baby that my once pretty skin had gone to ughh. I have very noticeable dark spots and splotches, and was hoping that this product would be the cure, but no such luck. I used it for over a month and saw absolutely no difference. Also the smell is too strong and actually gives me headaches sometimes. So if you have a sensitivity to smells beware.</li>
            <li> Great retinol cream for mature skin. I can really notice the difference the next morning after applying it before bed. When I ran out, after a couple of days, my skin reverted to its pre cream issues of scary wrinkles around the eyes and and uneven skin tone. Now I don&#x27;t want to be without it so I keep a spare. It really works !!!!!! I just wish it came in a tube so I could easily get the last bits out.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. I used it for a 4 weeks and did not notice any difference in the tone of my skin and a few dark spot that I have were not diminished.</li>
            <li> Price was the biggest factor for purchasing it and after using it for 2 months I am very pleased with it. It does work as described and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Tried several times&lt;br /&gt;Skin kept getting more red each time. Think maybe I had an allergic reaction? Stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I have now used this faithfully for 2 weeks and it has done nothing to date. I will finish out the bottle. If anything changes I will come back and update this review. But, as of this moment, all it has done is made my pillowcase sticky. No change in tone at all, no change in spots, no change in skin texture. It is as if I hadn&#x27;t done anything at all.  If it had actually worked I would have been willing to pay double for the next bottle.</li>
            <li> Use at night with BelEssence for a more wrinkle free face-works wonders on wrinkles</li>
            <li> Rapid wrinkle repair serum first then this.  My face is as soft as my butt now.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer Night for about a week and yes, I do notice a positive difference. Since it is a moisturizer, you get the advantage of softer skin and the lessening of some finer age lines and wrinkles. My skin is noticeably brighter and more even toned. Another change that was immediate was the apparent decrease in the size of my pores. Generally it makes you look healthy and radiant. I promise I am not trying to be dramatic, it actually does make you look better and healthy. If I can notice a difference already, I imagine it will only continue improving. I specifically chose the “Night” version because [I have no way of confirming this as it’s a trade secret] the nighttime version of these types of lotions generally have a higher concentration of retinol. The retinol and vitamin C are the active ingredients in this lotion. I only experienced a slight reddening of my skin the first day I used it. This is a sign the retinol is working. Since then, I have had no negative effects. I plan to continue using this product. In fact, I’ve already ordered my next bottle. Not only is the price more than reasonable, it’s also a moisturizer. Therefore, I only have to use one product… saving even more. Considering the price and the benefits of this product compared to some department store brands, this is the absolute winner. In my humble opinion this is an excellent product that does what it says it will do and you don’t have to liquidate your 401K to afford it. Please remember this is only one person’s opinion and your mileage may vary. However, since it works for me, I’m pretty sure it will work for most people and I’m sure a company such as Neutrogena would stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a week ago. I will have to say that day 3 was a little painful. My skin was extremely irritated and flaky. Day 5 it was like magic. The irritation stopped and my skin was glowing. I haven&#x27;t seen my skin like this in a long time. I am 36 by the way. I am glad I stuck with it. It truly does work!!!! Another plus is that it cleared up my blackheads! I am really happy I decided to try it!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle didn&#x27;t last long enough to tell if it worked or not.  You can&#x27;t tell how much is in this little glass bottle.  This is my second bottle of this stuff and i don&#x27;t think i will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Because i never saw the results in one week as they said it does until now, am disapointed, the products</li>
            <li> Like neutrogena product.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says - evens tone and results are quickly noticeable.  Wake up to smoother, softer looking skin. I also use the day time version with SPF.  This is a dynamic duo!</li>
            <li> I have used neutrogena products for years and have rarely had reason to complain.  This product is superlative.  I live in the desert and am 40 something so my skin tends towards the dry.  This product has given me a lovely dewy look without problems with acne.  Glad it found it.</li>
            <li> This works as expected, not too oily and has a neutral smell.  It is something that I would keep buying-- cheaper than in the stores here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average and it works.  It&#x27;s not the best product I have ever bought.  It&#x27;s not the worst product I ever bought.  It&#x27;s just average.  Probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to expectations and did not fulfill any of the so called &amp;#34;clinically proven&amp;#34; statements on the box. Quite the reverse happened to me. It gave this 50 year old acne! Also, upon further research I did not find any ingredient in this product which would reduce the looks of dark spots and discoloration. Finally, after discontinuing, I have my clear complexion back.</li>
            <li> I love this. It does exactly what it says it will do. It got rid of the dark spots on my face in less than a week. I have spent a  lot of time in the sun&lt;br /&gt;and a lot of time trying to hide the dark spots. This is excellent and when I am out...I will buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff works, I love it. The first couple of days your skin does peel and the smell is a bit strong, but after a week your skin looks amazing. I have never used a face lotion that made my skin look this good. I&#x27;m 38 and now starting to experiment with several face creams, night lotions, eye balms... this one is a keeper for me.  Fast results.</li>
            <li> I have used this and its sister product, the Rapid Wrinkle Repair night cream. Both seem similarly effective and reducing skin imperfections, lines and spots. Thus I would not pay the extra for this product&#x27;s &amp;#34;added Vitamin C&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t feel it does anything more or less than the other product.</li>
            <li> I developed a few dark spots last summer, i am using the  tone with the nuetrogena microbrasion kit, so far I have noticed them fading, i truly love these products!</li>
            <li> Like it works well. Combats dryness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite sometime and will keep on using it. I never thought of looking on line but i love this product and will continue to purchase it here.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for a month now and love it.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  i noticed a difference within a few days and then it was a easy to keep using.  I use less makeup and my aging skin doesn&#x27;t look so bad.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the smell is irritating and it&#x27;s a little rough on sensitive skin. But not to worry I just put on my kiss my face overnight cream then applied this cream on top of that and it works wonders without irritating my skin. My skin is definitely has a more even tone and its look brighter which makes me look refreshed. I hadn&#x27;t went to work without foundation in years but this product made me feel comfortable enough to do it. This has also reduced my breakouts and when I forget to apply it my face definitely reminds me in the morning so if you&#x27;re going to use this product use it every night.</li>
            <li> I should say my daughter loves these products as she is the one using and very effective for her skin.  Total improvement.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Neutrogena product that came in a tube but decided to give the new product a try.&lt;br /&gt;I find it has an improved feel and  odor ( slight), and the pump is a nice touch,  but in the morning I find my skin less moisturized and soft than when I use the old product.  I have no problems with irritation from either product.  If you have oily skin perhaps you will like the new product better. I need some moisture, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all around for products that claim to get rid of discoloration from past acne marks, red spots, and just any unpleasant features. I&#x27;ve recently finished a bottle of Loreal Youth Code, the skin luminous one and not the one for dark spots, which here on Amazon reviews were stellar for reducing the appearance of acne marks. The youth code, however, did nothing noticeable. So while out looking at the Loreal Youth Code, specifically for dark spots, I picked up this instead. It promised results in one week, so I figured I&#x27;d do a review of what I saw in One week, and update as I go through the bottle. ( Note! Long review to give a good deal of insight into product for certain skin types and issues Skip to bottom if you don&#x27;t want to read full insight:))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to get an overview of my skin: I&#x27;m 20 years old, Extremely pale, generally an NC-15 to anyone who knows MAC standards with very light acne, I&#x27;ve had more severe acne in the past but have been on Birth control for 4 months now. Normal to dry skin type. My cheeks and forehead have red marks due to the past acne, however I even these small red marks in places I&#x27;ve never had acne before! Ugh. I generally use ROC Max facial wash every night, it has a light exfoliator in it, along with a strawberry seed heavy exfoliator by Mark in Avon. Both are extremely gentle, the strawberry seed just takes away that last bit of roughness in the winter months. Then I typically use Loreal Ideal Moisture for Sensitive Skin. Then, finally, this stuff for the past week. FYI: It is best to exfoliate before using a product that needs to get into the layers of your skin. This is because we too, like Shrek, are onions:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the actual review, after all that. In the past week I have noticed results! Right as I started using this I had a strange red mark that looked like a very inflamed pimple on my forehead, but no pimple to speak of. It just kinda appeared, and after two days of this stuff, there is no red mark anymore. Also starting out I had a huge pimple on my cheek due to hormones that had been there for weeks. This stuff actually dried out the pimple and it actually caused it to peel off my skin. Kinda gross, but it just left a smooth surface below! My other cheek is where most of the acne marks are. In the past they were kinda big, doting the whole apple of my cheek, now? Now they&#x27;ve broken up into freckle sized marks. So now instead of 4 huge red marks, there&#x27;s about 10 tiny little marks that are dissolving as I use this stuff. No obvious results on my forehead, which is where I&#x27;ve never really had acne before, and yet I have a bunch of those red dots, go figure, but I&#x27;ll take what it is doing for my cheeks so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I do often use this in the day time, on the off day that I don&#x27;t have work and don&#x27;t put on any makeup to speak of. I&#x27;m wondering if i should just get the day lotion too. Plus, besides the one peeling incident, which actually helped my skin, the only adverse effects I&#x27;ve had to this is a tiny pimple on the tip of my nose, and one night that I got it too close to my mouth I regretted it due to the awful smell. Honestly, this stuff smells bad!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********* Update 2 Weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides lightening the red spot of the above mentioned breakout to a lighter shade of pink, The product hasn&#x27;t really changed my skin significantly any further. However, I&#x27;m not giving up on it yet. It generally takes four weeks for a product to grab hold and change your skin. In the beginning it can make your skin worse, or it can change the top layers of skin for the better. So at this point I still have a majority of the product left, it is hard to tell however as it does come in a glass bottle, so you can&#x27;t really judge the remaining product by shaking it. I generally use two to three pumps to cover my skin as I feel. Will Update further as I go along :)</li>
            <li> I just dunno! I saw a difference initially, like in the first week, but now, it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks it&#x27;s basically the same. No change in my face what so ever. I don&#x27;t have in realistic expectations, I have freckles and some spots from the sun, I have a few fine lines on my forehead, I&#x27;m 30 and honestly look 25 or 26. I also use the Ageless intensives tone correcting, and I like that better than this. I really don&#x27;t think it did anything for my skin, at least may not yet anyway. I am looking for a night cream to compliment it, but I don&#x27;t think this is it, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again at the price that is stated.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this for about a month and a half now I can not only see the difference but feel it. My pores are itty bitty, my skin feels great and the color is uniform no red acne scars no weird blotches, just the usual freckles. I think i will keep using this, I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I liked similar Neutrogena Night Moisturizer and am very happy with my purchase. My skin is a mature (light-to-medium color) skin with some problems like melasma and occasional acne (reaction to certain foods, pollution and creams). Basically it is difficult to find a good product for my skin type. This moisturizer is one of few I can use from now on. Pros: A. It evens out my skin tone; B. It makes it smooth and silky to the touch; C. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin closer to my eyes; D. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores; E. It lightens up my multiple freckles or better say melasma; F. I can use it twice a day without any problems if I don&#x27;t have to leave the house.  Cons: None so far. It is absolutely amazing, but I can use this cream on the outer corners of my eyes without any irritation afterwards.  My nightly routine is simple. I wash my face with a cleanser, apply SK-II SK2 Facial Treatment Essence to minimize pores, Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle Serum, and then this moisturizer.  I love this product for what it does to my skin and its price!  It is March 2015 and I still use this moisturizer with the same routine. It is a night time cream but I love it so I use it twice a day with a 100% sunblock that I purchased in one of the pharmacies in Europe (Bioderma 100% sunblock).  I use this moisturizer with Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night.   Good product!</li>
            <li> OMG it just about runined my skin.  I had some age spots I was trying to lighten up and after using this for 3 weeks I noticed my skin was becoming more and more aged looking.  Please if you are in your 20&#x27;s then maybe its good.. anyone in your 50- and older DO NOT USE THIS</li>
            <li> Did not see any difference even after 5 wks of use.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews for this product, I had high hope that it might work.  I used it for over 2 weeks with  no improvements. I did have to stop using it because it began to irritate my skin, specially around the eyes. Definitely do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> great product.  Used for a long time.  Purchase from Amazon due to price.</li>
            <li> I have been using two different products on my face most nights (maybe 5 out of 7) for about 6 months.  I start with this Neutrogena product and only use it on my forehead.  Then I use Vichy Liftactive Retinol HA night over my entire face.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle of Neutrogena  (which I only use  on my forehead and down the sides of my face) and my 3rd of the Vichy (which I use on my entire face). And yes - this is not a cheap process.  My reason for this is I&#x27;m 60+ and getting serious age/sun spots on my forehead that are getting so bad they are actually showing up in photographs and are very noticeable and embarrassing.  I am also (finally) using a good sunscreen on my face when I know I&#x27;m going outside or will be driving.  This (large) area of discoloration is on my left/driving side of my face.  About 2-3 months ago I realized my &amp;#34;dark area&amp;#34; had really decreased A LOT.  It is still there - but at least 50% better and does not jump out at me anymore. I&#x27;m not sure if it will lighten any more and I really don&#x27;t know which product improved this area on my forehead.  Or if the combination of both of them worked.  Anyway - something worked so I&#x27;m not changing my routine now.  I think I&#x27;m going to start this routine on my hands which are covered with small spots (and wrinkles).  By the way - I&#x27;ve probably researched dozens of age spot products and it seems most of them do NOT appear to work.  So I don&#x27;t know why this combination worked for me - but it did. And finally - I personally did not notice any redness or any other issues using two products.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping.  Price is right.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin smooth for overnight use.</li>
            <li> I has really faded my cystic acne scars.  I started noticing a difference after three weeks of use.  Good moisturizer for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;CON: it tingles a bit when you put it on.</li>
            <li> Did not work as advertised.  Very disappointed as I use Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> moisturizing without making my skin break out. I have been pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> This product just isn&#x27;t for my skin type.  I do use the day cream in this same line with no problem, so I confidently bought the night cream, however there must be some ingredient that irritates my skin.  Within days my face started peeling and flaking.</li>
            <li> no change after a month</li>
            <li> I did not notice a difference on the spots and this was after several weeks of use :( Very Sad!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but bought it!  Wow. Can&#x27;t say the Sun spots or age spots are gone completely ( which I didn&#x27;t expect) but they are totally lightened. A HUGE difference. Makeup easily covers. It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks. Do it every day/night and you will see a difference.</li>
            <li> Tried using Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer Night and found it immediately started to burn my skin. I washed it off and am not continuing its&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> Works very well, although it does not eliminate age spots entirely, it did wash them out enough I don&#x27;t feel like my 80 year old grandmother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this at night along with the daytime moisturizer/SPF in the same line (rapid tone repair w/30 SPF),  In two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed significant fading of my red acne scars, a decrease in the number of new pimples I get, and a speedier heal-time in my current pimples.  I&#x27;m not sure how neutrogena products accomplish all of this, but I&#x27;m super happy with the result on my fair, sensitive, acne-prone skin.  I&#x27;m also using their stress-something-or-other labeled salicylic acid toner after I wash my face (something gentle from Biore) and Aveno&#x27;s SPF-laden tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin very dry. Not good for my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great - and I use it also in the day, it&#x27;s really soothing to my skin and a great feel.  I like neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> Not long after using this my face began to break out in deep, painful blemishes which I have never had before.  I stopped using it and then tried again a few weeks later-same thing, along with little bumps under the skin.  I had to switch to extremely gentle products to ease my skin back to the way it was before.  Have used and continue to use other retinol products without this result.  I am able to use the day version without any problem.</li>
            <li> It definitely helped to reduce my fine lines but I didn&#x27;t notice any change with the dark shadows under my eyes.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!! It works like it said it does. I am an African American 35 yr old woman that HAD been suffering with acne for the past 2 yrs and this product COMPLETELY stopped the acne and started fading my dark spot within a week!! yes a week....I use the day time dark spot repair as well. If you are on the fence I would say don&#x27;t be it really does work but you have to use it every day faithfully. You will be amazed!!!</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this product. to begin with, i would&#x27;nt recommend this product to anyone with oily skin because it WILL cause breakouts. The product has a very powerful scent, not a bad one in fact it&#x27;s kinda pleasant but very strong in my opinion. that said the product did nothing it claimed it would do. i used it every night until the bottle was empty. i was hoping for even a small improvement on my skin but it didnt do a damn thing. its a shame they&#x27;ve recently jacked up the price because it&#x27;s definately not worth it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles after a week of use...you will be disappointed.  I have been using for about 2 months now, every evening.  I initially saw a reduction in the size of my pores after a few weeks use...great!  I was very surprised that after about 4 - 6 weeks use, there has been a significant reduction in the red acne scars.  I have to preface this by saying I had maybe 2 or 3 scars from an adult acne breakout (yeah, zits in my 30s...I thought those days were over?) in the last year or so.  They weren&#x27;t terribly bad, but they were noticeable.  After using this, they are almost gone...I was surprised.  I will continue to use this product for the above reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had minimal tingling in the beginning of use.  I never had dry or peeling skin.  I did not feel the product was too greasy, and it has a pleasant scent.  Remember, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last five days and there is definitely a noticeable difference in my skin tone. Just keep in mind that it does break out your skin a little bit but I started using a acme wash with it and now my skin is great! I think if you are on the fence about getting it just go for it the price is really it works really well and if it doesn&#x27;t end up working then you can spend more for more powerful stuff</li>
            <li> Very nice. Not greasy like other products. Light coverage. I would recommend this product. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena  product are product you can depend on</li>
            <li> Best product ever.  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually WORKS. I have (had actually) some acne scarring and a pretty uneven skin tone. I started using this every night before bed and within a few days I could see &amp; feel a difference. Most skin products dry my face out, but this one didn&#x27;t. I even got to the point where I felt comfortable not wearing any concealer!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. I like Neutrogena products and this one is great.</li>
            <li> it really really works!</li>
            <li> Just started using it this week, and so far I really like it. I like the feeling of it and it does really help slough off dead skin cells faster! Skin feels and looks good.</li>
            <li> I began using both the day &amp; night time versions of this product a few weeks ago &amp; am extremely pleased. It&#x27;s rare to find a beauty product that delivers all that it promises plus shows results immediately. Within the first week my skin was smoother &amp; more radiant, by the 3rd week I noticed my pores were visibly smaller. I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive products that haven&#x27;t done half as much. I&#x27;m just thrilled &amp; will be sticking with Nuetrogena for a long time to come. The 5 stars are well deserved.</li>
            <li> Great product....very good seller....will order again.</li>
            <li> This product was much to strong for my skin. I got very red and my skin started to peel! I also purchased the Rapid Wrinkle Eye ,the Rapid Wrinkle Night Repair and Day Lotion and I had to return them all! Very harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to my friends. It gives energy to my skin, my face seems younger and brighter</li>
            <li> Good for the right skin type. If you have oily, combination, or normal to slightly dry skin that is NOT sensitive to fragrance then you should get on fine with this. If you are sensitive to fragrance or unsure if you are then I might consider other options. I have extremely dry skin as of late and using this only helps a little bit. It does a great job of hydrating properly taken care of skin that doesn&#x27;t lean towards very dry. The retinol and vitamin c combo does a great job of evening skin and brightening it. A good product for the right skin type. :)</li>
            <li> I was amazed to see a few people mentioned, this product cause them to break out or too strong for their skin. For that reason, I was skeptical at first and glad I took a chance. I am African American and left with uneven skin tone from trying everything for my acne. I thought I would be nearly impossible to have an even skin tone and after nearly to weeks, I see significant improvement. Idk if it help with acne scars but I took care of that using zianna and needed to get even ski tone. I strongly recommend it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrances, not overly, but this gave me a headache.  I have seen no improvement in my Melasma due to pregnancy hormones altering the color of my skin on my cheekbones creating brown spots. It made my skin dry and flaky, which is a warning that it&#x27;s working, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference.  I will continue to use, with advil, until empty and will report my results if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I always apply this with just a small amount of water on my hands as it goes on easier, and the product lasts longer too. I did notice some lightening of a few spots near my hairline. There is a fragrance to the cream, and while not overpowering, some guys may not like it.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, smells like perm chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased due to rave reviews here to even my increasingly blotchy looking face. Pinker spots, darker spots, etc. Have literally seen NO change at all. Not a bit. I understand some things just don&#x27;t work on everyone so I guess that&#x27;s what happened here. I have fair skin and dark hair, btw. Skin&#x27;s never been all that smooth or pretty, .but turning 30 gave me a new face. Oh well. Oh, and as a moisturizer it&#x27;s just ok. Burns my eyes so i went right back to my old Olay 7 stand-by, which doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, moisturizes better, smells nice (or not at all), and at least doesn&#x27;t claim to correct my tone. lol</li>
            <li> This cream arrived with a third of the product wasted due to a loose lid causing it to be spilled and unusable inside of the box. Did not get what I paid for.</li>
