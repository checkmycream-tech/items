            <li>Nice smooth color.</li>
            <li>Product is OK, just not for me.  </li>
            <li>but it did cover my more noticeable blemishes.</li>
            <li>Why spend more for make up when this works?</li>
            <li>This has always been my favorite brand of makeup.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to blend around the jawline so you do not have any lines.</li>
            <li>It blended easily and it lasted all day.</li>
            <li>very quick and product as described.</li>
            <li>I have light skin</li>
            <li>it covers what needs to be covered skin looks ideally smooth.</li>
            <li>so feel free to pair it with a concealer.</li>
            <li>that I almost always take it off right away.</li>
            <li>If you tilt it too much, then you have hand full of foundation.</li>
            <li>This was the first liquid foundation I had every used.</li>
            <li>It really works for me!</li>

            <li>i&#x27;m very dissapointed</li>
            <li>I started wearing this in high school.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this foundation since high school</li>

            <li>The product is thick and you have to be REALLY careful when taking it out because if you don&#x27;t tilt it enough, it will take a good minute for the foundation to come out.</li>
            <li>It has covered up my red spots and blemishes in the past and it really gives an overall  smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like it looked natural enough.</li>

            <li> Wife loves this shade.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. this is my second purchase. I have light skin and I use creamy natural 120 color to give some color to me skin, although it doesn&#x27;t look painted or unnatural. it covers what needs to be covered skin looks ideally smooth. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It worked well. Nice smooth color. A little darker than expected, but that was my mistake. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Product is OK, just not for me.  It was darker than I expected and I don&#x27;t feel like it looked natural enough.</li>
            <li> It was lighter than i expected. I didn&#x27;t get complete coverage with this but it did cover my more noticeable blemishes.It blended easily and it lasted all day. The only con is that you have to pour it out the bottle, which can result in pouring too much. I have not bought this product again because of that.</li>
            <li> I started wearing this in high school.  I am in my 40s now, and have tried other brands, but have always come back to CoverGirl.  Why spend more for make up when this works?</li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite brand of makeup.  It&#x27;s terrific that I can get it regularly through the subscribe and save program.</li>
            <li> This was the first liquid foundation I had every used. Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to apply it, but this product is AWFUL. Even if I put a little bit on my face, it looks so caked on that I almost always take it off right away. I initially used my fingers to spread the product on my face. When the results turned out poorly, I bought the Real Technique Expert Face brush. Even that didn&#x27;t help make the foundation look good on my face. For me, it doesn&#x27;t provide any coverage. I use an orange color corrector for my dark circles and when I apply some foundation over it, I can still see the orange! This foundation has been useless and a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also agree with another reviewer regarding the bottle- the packaging is terrible! The product is thick and you have to be REALLY careful when taking it out because if you don&#x27;t tilt it enough, it will take a good minute for the foundation to come out. If you tilt it too much, then you have hand full of foundation. Overall, I would never, ever recommend this foundation.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I use.  My skin looks great.  It has covered up my red spots and blemishes in the past and it really gives an overall  smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> very quick and product as described.</li>
            <li> it has such a smell, that couldnot use. it costs 0$ !  i&#x27;m very dissapointed and i&#x27;ll never order coverg girl production again!</li>
            <li> The product is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have been using this foundation since high school and I probably will use it in years to come. I have switched a few times but keep coming back to it. It really works for me! Apply evenly all over face with a sponge. It does not have a deep coverage so feel free to pair it with a concealer. I have found that using setting spray really helps make it last throughout the day. The smell is not the best but you do get used to it. Make sure to blend around the jawline so you do not have any lines. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 35 years, I see not reason to change.</li>
            <li> Love this make up, been using it for at least 20 years, it isn&#x27;t greasy...It was the only one that I could use that did not make my skin break out when that was a problem as a teenager.  No more break outs as an adult, but still using it as it gives good even coverage as a base make-up.  Why spend a fortune on expensive make-ups from department stores when I found the right product...sticking to it, as long as they sell it, I will be buying it.</li>
