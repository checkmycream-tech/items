            <li>Great stuff.</li>

            <li>It is amazing to me</li>

            <li>Used a travel kit of Shiseido (http://www.amazon.com/Shiseido-Fitit-Treatment-Shampoo-Conditioner/dp/B0012UDATA) on a recent trip and loved it.</li>

            <li>The conditioner is really what i like the most though.</li>
            <li>Awesome Product especially for Asian hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super shiny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and smooth for things like braiding or a flat iron, but took away the curl and body I&#x27;d just wished to calm.     </li>
            <li>Read the raves about this new type with the Tsubaki oil and that it was an even better product than the one I&#x27;d tried.</li>
            <li>which does a good cleaning job while dry my hair a lot.</li>
            <li>Once dry, my hair was smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>I have straight fine, untreated hair</li>
            <li>I was using Aveda smooth infusion and ABBA Pure color.</li>
            <li>I definitely have a nice shine in my hair after.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo, especially really good for Asian hair .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s actually made for dyed hair, but this shampoo is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Plus its an added bonus that the shipping was pretty fast(got</li>
            <li>I had to think about that as I was using this for the first time.</li>
            <li>but it much better than the regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it actually bring me more problem like hair loss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go back to Japan just to get more.</li>
            <li>I find the clean and shine last two full days of work and play.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair so soft and full of volume.</li>
            <li>I was experiencing significantly more hair loss while using this shampoo, and it get back to normal when i stop using it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks shinier and healthier, it really feels its like a positive treatment to my hair.</li>
            <li>For the same price and  free shipping you just cant beat that.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this quality product from a quality seller!</li>
            <li>And also perfectly straight in others.</li>
            <li>The price the reasonable, that why it keep by it again.</li>
            <li>cleans out all the product from the day really well.</li>
            <li>and I do really like it.</li>
            <li>Very smoothy.</li>
            <li>bottom of the bottle is very watery.</li>
            <li>I live in VA and purchased this shampoo for the first time when I traveled to MD.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hair everyday and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out, but it also doesn&#x27;t make it oily, so this is a great plus.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love everything about this with the exception of making my hair feel a little to weighed down&lt;br</li>
            <li>especially when it comes to beauty supplies and fun stuff.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was thick and lathered nicely.</li>
            <li>It smelled more like chemicals and less natural than I like.     </li>
            <li>I use this shampoo with no conditioner and it makes my hair beautiful without being heavy, and the Tsubaki oil leaves me with no static or flyaways.</li>
            <li>I love the smell (not overwhelming) and it makes my highly color-treated hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It gave my hair that instant smoothing feeling when I first used it.</li>
            <li>I really like it and actually purchased it there for around $15.  </li>
            <li>The other thing I noticed was that while my hair was smooth and soft, it virtually lost all of its body and became flat.</li>
            <li>but this keeps the fly-away down, the static down and</li>
            <li>If I brush it, it just \\&quot;poofs\\&quot; and takes awhile to calm back down into locks.     </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really like this shampoo - smells great, and leaves my hair silky soft!  Not the cleanest of shampoos, though - it sometimes leaves a bit of residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I saw it recommended in a magazine article.  I love the smell (not overwhelming) and it makes my highly color-treated hair soft and shiny.  This is my second time ordering.  If it seems slightly expensive (I&#x27;ve tried Caviar shampoo that was much more expensive and didn&#x27;t like it). Don&#x27;t worry,  the bottle lasted a really long time.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s actually made for dyed hair, but this shampoo is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I live in VA and purchased this shampoo for the first time when I traveled to MD.  I really like it and actually purchased it there for around $15.  Instead of traveling all the way to MD to purchase I checked Amazon.  For the same price and  free shipping you just cant beat that.  Plus its an added bonus that the shipping was pretty fast(got here in 3 days from the west coast).  This shampoo smells lovely and I find it cleans my hair well (I have oily, thick, coarse, curly Asian hair).  I definitely have a nice shine in my hair after.  I find the clean and shine last two full days of work and play.  I highly recommend purchasing this quality product from a quality seller!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have straight fine, untreated hair but this keeps the fly-away down, the static down and the softness is still in my hair without making it look greasy, like some conditioning type shampoos can do.  The smell and feel of my hair is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now.  I was using Aveda smooth infusion and ABBA Pure color. But I stopped using both once I tried the Shisedio Shining Shampoo in the RED bottle.  Both the Aveda and ABBA are pretty good but neither compare to this made in Japan Shiseido product.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length super-fine hair. I use this shampoo with no conditioner and it makes my hair beautiful without being heavy, and the Tsubaki oil leaves me with no static or flyaways. It is amazing to me thst I have body and control. I can wash my hair every 4 days if I want to, also. This shampoo is in no way greasy. Prior to this, I was using an extremely expensive salon brand shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am a self-described \\&quot;product junkie\\&quot;...especially when it comes to beauty supplies and fun stuff. My shower could be an Aveda storefront. That said, I am a lifelong Aveda lover and was enticed enough by the other reviews to give this stuff a whirl.     Background: Used a travel kit of Shiseido (http://www.amazon.com/Shiseido-Fitit-Treatment-Shampoo-Conditioner/dp/B0012UDATA) on a recent trip and loved it. Read the raves about this new type with the Tsubaki oil and that it was an even better product than the one I&#x27;d tried. I&#x27;m going to cover both reviews of shampoo and conditioner here.     If it helps, I am Caucasian with non-colored, auburn-ish long hair. It&#x27;s very wavy, and even curly in many places. And also perfectly straight in others. I wanted to see if it could be tamed a bit in the frizz area. If I brush it, it just \\&quot;poofs\\&quot; and takes awhile to calm back down into locks.     The shampoo was thick and lathered nicely. One of the reasons I enjoy Aveda products is that they use great ingredients and do no animal testing. I had to think about that as I was using this for the first time. Ingredients had the usual stuff to make suds, which I wasn&#x27;t crazy about but they aren&#x27;t abnormal in these products. What I did notice was the absence of a non-animal-testing icon or label. No warm fuzzy there.     But it made my hair feel sleek and nice, even when I washed it out. A little goes a long way, btw. Another thing I&#x27;d heard a lot about was how good this stuff smells. Honestly, I can&#x27;t say that. It was a little too pungent for me. It smelled more like chemicals and less natural than I like.     Onto the conditioner. It gave my hair that instant smoothing feeling when I first used it. And it didn&#x27;t go away when I rinsed it out. Seemed to \\&quot;tame\\&quot; my hair nicely. Made it easy to comb.    Once dry, my hair was smooth and nice. I am not one to wash my hair daily, so I noticed a bit of oiliness by the second day. The other thing I noticed was that while my hair was smooth and soft, it virtually lost all of its body and became flat. In that way, it&#x27;s a catch-22. It&#x27;s nice and smooth for things like braiding or a flat iron, but took away the curl and body I&#x27;d just wished to calm.     All in all, not sold and going back to Aveda once this is done.</li>
            <li> My problem with this is that it isn&#x27;t colour-safe and has no indication of it. I was recommended it for damaged hair like mine which is often bleached and coloured and it stripped my colour a lot faster than drug store colour-safe shampoos. However, the texture and the scent is amazing! I still use the conditioner happily and have just changed shampoos. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I like it even thought it not too good but it much better than the regular shampoo.  The price the reasonable, that why it keep by it again.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft and full of volume. I love it</li>
            <li> I really love this Shiseido Tsubaki brand. I use different kinds of Shiseido shampoo. My hair feels and looks shinier and healthier, it really feels its like a positive treatment to my hair.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this with the exception of making my hair feel a little to weighed down&lt;br /&gt;  However!  keep in mind this is only my own opinion &amp; may do fine for you!  :)</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other brands before, but this one is the best and I have been using it for almost 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair very smooth and another good thing is that it is easy to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice clean feeling shampoo. cleans out all the product from the day really well. It has a nice smell too. The conditioner is really what i like the most though. I have thick straight asian hair, and i&#x27;m male and it&#x27;s quite short. I condition every day and this helps to keep it looking healthy and shiny, and it also helps to keep it moisturized so my hair doesn&#x27;t fly up on end. Rinse with cool water to get best results! :)</li>
            <li> I use head&amp;shoulders to wash my hair. which does a good cleaning job while dry my hair a lot. This product is pretty good to smooth my hair after i wash it.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product especially for Asian hair.  Makes my hair super shiny.  Good size Bottle and price is also good too.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo and its conditioners and even spas for over 5 years. It is always the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, especially really good for Asian hair . When the first time I have used and fell in love with it .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever found a shampoo that I think is amazing, but I have been using this for about a month and I do really like it. I wash my hair everyday and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out, but it also doesn&#x27;t make it oily, so this is a great plus. I will buy it again and keep using it for a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this for its reputation. My hair is thick and fuzzy sometime, and i was hoping this shampoo is going to solve the problem for me. Unfortunately, it actually bring me more problem like hair loss. I was experiencing significantly more hair loss while using this shampoo, and it get back to normal when i stop using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic pixie dust infused with goody goodness I&#x27;d go back to Japan just to get more. Or just buy it here. I don&#x27;t often wash my hair, but when I do, I wash it with shiseido magic pixie dust shampoo.</li>
            <li> Like the shine and the smell. A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> Always like Japanese hair shampoo and conditioners. Very smoothy. Just as shampoo in Kiehl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> bottom of the bottle is very watery. half of bottle not useable.</li>
