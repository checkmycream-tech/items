            <li>This product is great!  </li>
            <li>I never leave reviews for products, but felt I had to for this great conditioner.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way it makes my hair smell!!</li>
            <li>Yeah, my hair looks good again...had run out</li>
            <li>I was so happy and astounded that my first thought was to go on Amazon and post a review about how awesome this stuff is!</li>
            <li>They are fabulous!!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>oz.)], and coconut oil, which makes this item smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and perfect product</li>
            <li>I was buying this product in the store and a lady with corkscrew curly hair asked how I liked these products and then also mentioned that the leave in conditioner in their organic line did wonders for her hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love it and it smells good too.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure which to choose, however, reading the reviews, I choose this one, with the matching shampoo, and ordered on the subscribe and save option, (which I LOVE), and I love it, it makes my hair feal wonderful, soft, silky, and smooth, and does help with the frizzyness, no product is going to take away every bit of frizz, I don&#x27;t believe there is anyway lol, but this does wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li>Nice conditioner, just wish it worked better and had a stronger, prettier fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love having nice smelling hair.</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner I found so far.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for a better result.</li>
            <li>The NEXXUS Frizz Defy Shampoo is great too, but it doesn&#x27;t have as much impact on my hair as the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can control it better</li>
            <li>Controls the frizz and gives nice smooth curls.</li>
            <li>I think this may be even better suited for my frizz issues.</li>
            <li>I used to use Nexxus&#x27; Sleek line, which I had pretty good luck with.  </li>
            <li>They make my hair feel so soft and smell great.</li>
            <li>Frizz defy works great on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>well.. it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance like I hoped.</li>
            <li>Enjoy, Kiehls ... to store products (pantene, frizz ease, treseme and every type of leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>It helps smooth and moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable buying any Nexxus product because it usually is a decent product and their prices are not too high either, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I color my mostly gray hair every 4 weeks, and it was looking witchy lately, so I needed a really good moisturizing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than Fekkai&#x27;s Gloss conditioner by far, which didn&#x27;t do too much for me.  </li>
            <li>For serious frizz problems, I feel you need the leave in conditioner to help the most and because I prefer a more deeper conditioning than this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>B004Z209HS Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil (4 fl.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, thick, long and at times frizzy hair, and this is one of the best conditioners that I have ever used on it.  </li>
            <li>Both products really eliminate 90% of my frizz problem.  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this .. not for the price.</li>
            <li>I have tried every inexpensive (less than $8) brand of conditioner that I can find, and none of those compare to the NEXXUS Frizz Defy Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>But using this on her last night, the smell, color, and quality was super duper duper way off.</li>
            <li>so I dried off the best I could and awaited the inevitable frizz that would develop as my hair dried as well.</li>
            <li>I paid a few more dollars for it, but</li>
            <li>I apply after shampoo then complete the rest of my shower and do a quick  rinse last.</li>
            <li>I am lucky to live in a relatively dry climate</li>
            <li>My naturally curly hair has met its match!</li>
            <li>It also left a nice shine too, which not many conditioners do.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this as much as I do, I used to use nexxus products all the time, then I started using other products, and decided to switch back, however, with all the options on different types of shampoo&#x27;s and conditioner&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I used my old stuff (not Nexxus) for the rest of my hair routine (shampoo / product / styling).</li>
            <li>Thanks to NEXXUS for discontinuing this product, I felt it was my only option to purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Bottle came in completely busted all over the box</li>
            <li>While this makes my hair luxuriously soft without flattening it</li>
            <li>This conditioner made my hair really soft and did take out the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have straight hair, that I color on a regular basis (not to often, but as often as needed, and I change colors at times as well)</li>
            <li>soft being</li>
            <li>When I wash out my daughter&#x27;s hair, it is so soft.</li>
            <li>Low and behold, the first day after trying this, we experience our first heavy rain of the season.</li>
            <li>To my utter disbelief, several hours later, my now dry hair was smooth and frizz-free - it basically looked as if the rain had never touched it.</li>
            <li>I unfortunately got stuck outside without an umbrella for a good 5 minutes, leaving my hair drenched (along with the rest of me).</li>
            <li>I was always battling major frizz issues until I started using this and the leave in conditioner.  </li>

            <li> I noticed with this conditioner that it is somewhat harder to rinse out, I also don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my hair compared to other products.</li>

            <li> (I have very thin, dry hair) , and it did an OK job at managing my frizz</li>
            <li> other conditioner that I have found comparable to this product is the Neutrogena Intensive Daily Conditioner which is usually a similar price per ounce, and I have typically only found it at Ulta stores.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry, coarse, wavy hair and live in the humidity-rich South.  </li>
            <li> Like another reviewer I color my hair pretty frequently and have wiry grays that are very hard to tame.  </li>
            <li> , however I have always been very very prone to frizz, and the humidity makes it worse, as does using the flat iron ect, and I can tell that this  product, along with the other nexxus frizz defy products have worked wonders for me!</li>
            <li> It detangles long hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with it also.</li>
            <li> Will try other products after I use this up.</li>
            <li> It conditions, but not as deep as some Nexxus Conditioners that I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other products in Nexxus&#x27;</li>
            <li> Now I am eager to try the other Frizz defy products.</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair feeling softer than other conditioners, but no better frizz control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and didn&#x27;t notice any buildup.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is so thick that it&#x27;s hard to dispense from the bottle.</li>
            <li> unruly, wavy, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have very thin wavy hair that tends to frizz at the slightest drop of moisture.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> ,..im sad NEXXUS discontinued this item!!!!</li>

            <li> This conditioner is so thick that it&#x27;s hard to dispense from the bottle. I apply after shampoo then complete the rest of my shower and do a quick  rinse last. I leave some conditioner in. I had hoped for a better result. It does leave my hair feeling softer than other conditioners, but no better frizz control. I&#x27;m a little disappointed. Will try other products after I use this up.</li>
            <li> This has helped with my Frizz.  The best combination is to purchase the frizz leave in conditioner cream as well.  Both products really eliminate 90% of my frizz problem.  I have thick, dry, coarse, wavy hair and live in the humidity-rich South.  I was always battling major frizz issues until I started using this and the leave in conditioner.  I rated this conditioner 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons.  For serious frizz problems, I feel you need the leave in conditioner to help the most and because I prefer a more deeper conditioning than this conditioner.  It conditions, but not as deep as some Nexxus Conditioners that I have tried in the past.  Oh! the scent of this conditioner is wonderful!  I absolutely love the way it makes my hair smell!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Nexxus Sleek Finish lotion for a year now, decided to finally try the shampoo and conditioner. They are fabulous!! They make my hair feel so soft and smell great. A little goes a long way with it also. Thanks for the great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews for products, but felt I had to for this great conditioner. I have very thin wavy hair that tends to frizz at the slightest drop of moisture. (I have come away with frizz after boiling water on the stove). I am lucky to live in a relatively dry climate so I was hoping this conditioner would manage my regular day to day frizz issues. Low and behold, the first day after trying this, we experience our first heavy rain of the season. I unfortunately got stuck outside without an umbrella for a good 5 minutes, leaving my hair drenched (along with the rest of me). I was at work at the time so I dried off the best I could and awaited the inevitable frizz that would develop as my hair dried as well. To my utter disbelief, several hours later, my now dry hair was smooth and frizz-free - it basically looked as if the rain had never touched it. I have to believe that it was this conditioner that made the difference - I used my old stuff (not Nexxus) for the rest of my hair routine (shampoo / product / styling). I was so happy and astounded that my first thought was to go on Amazon and post a review about how awesome this stuff is! I haven&#x27;t tried other products in Nexxus&#x27; Frizz Defy line but I can definitely say that this conditioner was a miracle worker for me.</li>
            <li> GREATPRODUCT, GREAT PRICE!!! VERY HAPPY WITH PURCHASE******</li>
            <li> I have very curly, thick, long and at times frizzy hair, and this is one of the best conditioners that I have ever used on it.  I have tried every inexpensive (less than $8) brand of conditioner that I can find, and none of those compare to the NEXXUS Frizz Defy Conditioner.  My hair is noticeably softer after using this conditioner. The NEXXUS Frizz Defy Shampoo is great too, but it doesn&#x27;t have as much impact on my hair as the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other conditioner that I have found comparable to this product is the Neutrogena Intensive Daily Conditioner which is usually a similar price per ounce, and I have typically only found it at Ulta stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from seller JSW Deals. It definitely 100% isn&#x27;t the same NEXXUS frizz defy conditioner that I was purchasing for a year. Thanks to NEXXUS for discontinuing this product, I felt it was my only option to purchase on Amazon. I paid a few more dollars for it, but oh well, it&#x27;s the only conditioner that works for my daughters unruly, wavy, thick hair. But using this on her last night, the smell, color, and quality was super duper duper way off. I was so disappointed. I&#x27;ve already asked for my refund and I&#x27;ll be mailing it back tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Frizz defy works great on my naturally curly hair.  I can control it better</li>
            <li> Bottle came in completely busted all over the box</li>
            <li> Yeah, my hair looks good again...had run out</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Controls the frizz and gives nice smooth curls.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner, just wish it worked better and had a stronger, prettier fragrance. I love having nice smelling hair. While this makes my hair luxuriously soft without flattening it (I have very thin, dry hair) , and it did an OK job at managing my frizz well.. it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance like I hoped. Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this .. not for the price.</li>
            <li> I color my mostly gray hair every 4 weeks, and it was looking witchy lately, so I needed a really good moisturizing conditioner.  My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy, but this works perfectly.  It contains argan oil, a miracle product I discovered recently, which if purchased separately costs $48[ASIN:B004Z209HS Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.)], and coconut oil, which makes this item smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable buying any Nexxus product because it usually is a decent product and their prices are not too high either, which is nice.  This conditioner made my hair really soft and did take out the frizz.  Like another reviewer I color my hair pretty frequently and have wiry grays that are very hard to tame.  If I use the wrong product, my hair can be pretty awful--straw-like dry and with those little bits that frizz up and stick up on top.  Those pieces seem flattened and smoothed.  It also left a nice shine too, which not many conditioners do.  I like it better than Fekkai&#x27;s Gloss conditioner by far, which didn&#x27;t do too much for me.  Now I am eager to try the other Frizz defy products. I used to use Nexxus&#x27; Sleek line, which I had pretty good luck with.  I think this may be even better suited for my frizz issues.</li>

            <li> I have used everything from salon products (deva nopoo sp?) Enjoy, Kiehls ... to store products (pantene, frizz ease, treseme and every type of leave in conditioner and I found that this products works and is affordable.  I have long wavy hair that cannot be brushed without turning into a frizzball.  I was buying this product in the store and a lady with corkscrew curly hair asked how I liked these products and then also mentioned that the leave in conditioner in their organic line did wonders for her hair.

            <li> I noticed with this conditioner that it is somewhat harder to rinse out, I also don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my hair compared to other products.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  My daughter and I both love it and it smells good too.  Works well as a leave-in conditioner overnight.  When I wash out my daughter&#x27;s hair, it is so soft.</li>
            <li> Love this! It helps smooth and moisturizes. My naturally curly hair has met its match!</li>
