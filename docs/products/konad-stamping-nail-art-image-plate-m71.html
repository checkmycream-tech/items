            <li>The results were very surprising!</li>
            <li>Have loved the 3 Konad plates I have ordered!</li>
            <li>Good buy!</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>The lace would make a great background for gems, paints, or 3D sculpts.</li>
            <li>They print off great</li>
            <li>The designs all stamp nicely are are so cute!!!</li>
            <li>I love this product much better than the cheaper fingrs brand i tried!!!</li>
            <li>I loved the lace look of this plate.</li>
            <li>Good design-</li>
            <li>This Konad image Plate is good as always.</li>
            <li>wife loved it she does hair and nails</li>
            <li>Good quality and nice patterns.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Don&#x27;t get discouraged if your first attempts don&#x27;t look perfect.</li>
            <li>These are really nice.</li>
            <li>The full finger stamps comes out great.</li>
            <li>I bought this plate because it was konda and the images are cute, but now I regret buying it because I couldn&#x27;t get the image onto the stamp at all.</li>
            <li>this one is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>One of the most feminine and lacey plates out there</li>
            <li>Plate M71 is one of my favorite plates.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much and very happy with my new purchase.</li>
            <li>This plate was exactly what I was hoping for!!!</li>
            <li>Definitely loved this image plate, very classy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They sell konad brand polishes that are designed to go with the plates, but some of my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; nail polishes do a fine job with these  stamps.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy having fun with nail art, or even if you&#x27;re a pro, nail stamping adds more versatility to your looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was new to stamping when I got this plate, so therefore I wasn&#x27;t very creative and didn&#x27;t know what I was doing.  </li>
            <li>this one is worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I used the lace strips as French tips that came out really nice and the bow looks cute on the full nail stamp or just by itself.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping and authentic konad plate.  </li>
            <li>All have produced crisp images just using good quality regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>I can only say I really like this product and its so much fun to create so many intresting desings on my nails.</li>
            <li>They could be a bit larger of images to cover more nail surface</li>
            <li>works very well!</li>
            <li>To get this plate to transfer properly you will have to practice stamping many times before getting intricate designs to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very feminine and can be used in many different designs.</li>
            <li>After a few practice attempts, it became very easy and fun.</li>
            <li>The stampings came out even and crisp, and despite my short nails, my very first french lace manicure turned out very sweet (pic uploaded).</li>
            <li>Konad makes a wide variety of cute stamps, some designs are easier to use than others.</li>
            <li>Black or colored lace would look very sexy on a natural nail.</li>
            <li>The images are very delicate so using a good amount polish and working fast usually ensures a good stamped image.  </li>
            <li>the rest of the plates i can never use or am never interested in more than one, maybe 2 designed.</li>
            <li>highly suggest using Konad special stamping polish for this plate also, as regular polishes will dry to fast in these super thin/shallow designs.</li>
            <li>The price in the official webiste is much higher than here and the products are the same.   </li>
            <li>Very whimsical and good for all ages!</li>
            <li>Takes a little practice applying the right amount of pressure--not too hard n&#x27; not too light, but is easy enough to figure out.</li>
            <li>they transfer nicely so far.</li>
            <li>and I have no trouble with them.</li>
            <li>If you do have larger nail beds, the images will not cover your whole nail, also if you have long nails, again the image will not cover your whole nail.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I had recently cut all of my nails short, but I was still able to learn and use the stamping kit very quickly with the help of a how-to video.</li>
            <li>I did a beautiful black &amp; white toile nail using Sally Hansen&#x27;s Extreme in black and white regular polish using stamp M71.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I only have one plate so far.</li>

            <li> The lace is very delicate looking over a sheer polish (I did mine in Konad white on Essie Pink Glove Service), but it still camouflaged my uneven and short natural nails - as you can see in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not try any other brand of Nail Art Image Plate besides Konad Brand.  </li>
            <li> I found the french manicure type of stamps to be a little hard to line up.</li>
            <li> I will have to break these out again and see what I can do for I have had these for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not take a picture of my design before I took my polish off</li>

            <li> Have loved the 3 Konad plates I have ordered! All have produced crisp images just using good quality regular nail polish. Would purchase again. I did a beautiful black &amp; white toile nail using Sally Hansen&#x27;s Extreme in black and white regular polish using stamp M71.</li>
            <li> I bought this plate because it was konda and the images are cute, but now I regret buying it because I couldn&#x27;t get the image onto the stamp at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this plate.</li>
            <li> Beautiful plate! Unfortunately I did not take a picture of my design before I took my polish off but I am very pleased! This plate was exactly what I was hoping for!!!</li>
            <li> I was new to stamping when I got this plate, so therefore I wasn&#x27;t very creative and didn&#x27;t know what I was doing.  I will have to break these out again and see what I can do for I have had these for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I loved the lace look of this plate. It&#x27;s very feminine and can be used in many different designs. Good buy!</li>
            <li> I have not try any other brand of Nail Art Image Plate besides Konad Brand.  I can only say I really like this product and its so much fun to create so many intresting desings on my nails.</li>
            <li> I love this product much better than the cheaper fingrs brand i tried!!! The designs all stamp nicely are are so cute!!!</li>
            <li> Good design- they transfer nicely so far. They could be a bit larger of images to cover more nail surface</li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t like a romantic look on your nails! Very whimsical and good for all ages! works very well! I am happy!</li>
            <li> This Konad image Plate is good as always. I bought konad image plates in its offical website before. The price in the official webiste is much higher than here and the products are the same.   By google, I find the prices of konad prodcuts probably are the lowest in U.S..</li>
            <li> this one is probably my favorite. there are about 3 designs that i like to use. the rest of the plates i can never use or am never interested in more than one, maybe 2 designed. this one is worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to create a french lace manicure for a long time, but wasn&#x27;t having any luck with decals or pens. I recently ordered my stamping kit and this plate, and they arrived yesterday. Unfortunately, I had recently cut all of my nails short, but I was still able to learn and use the stamping kit very quickly with the help of a how-to video. The results were very surprising! After a few practice attempts, it became very easy and fun. The stampings came out even and crisp, and despite my short nails, my very first french lace manicure turned out very sweet (pic uploaded). The lace is very delicate looking over a sheer polish (I did mine in Konad white on Essie Pink Glove Service), but it still camouflaged my uneven and short natural nails - as you can see in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have one plate so far. But I can already see this lace plate&#x27;s versatility. Black or colored lace would look very sexy on a natural nail. White or pastels for weddings, Quincea&amp;ntilde;eras, etc. The lace would make a great background for gems, paints, or 3D sculpts. If you enjoy having fun with nail art, or even if you&#x27;re a pro, nail stamping adds more versatility to your looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get discouraged if your first attempts don&#x27;t look perfect. It takes a few tries to get the feel for stamping, and the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Am a big fan of these. Have been using them for a couple years now. They allow me to save money on getting mani-pedis. Konad makes a wide variety of cute stamps, some designs are easier to use than others. I found the french manicure type of stamps to be a little hard to line up. Takes a little practice applying the right amount of pressure--not too hard n&#x27; not too light, but is easy enough to figure out. You can find videos online that demonstrate how to use these stamps. They sell konad brand polishes that are designed to go with the plates, but some of my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; nail polishes do a fine job with these  stamps.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping and authentic konad plate.  The images are very delicate so using a good amount polish and working fast usually ensures a good stamped image.  One of the most feminine and lacey plates out there</li>
            <li> Plate M71 is one of my favorite plates. The full finger stamps comes out great. I used the lace strips as French tips that came out really nice and the bow looks cute on the full nail stamp or just by itself. I would recommend this to anyone who likes nail art and stamping.</li>
            <li> Definitely loved this image plate, very classy and easy to use. I recommend getting the double sided stamper from Konad. If you are worried about your plates scratching try using a credit card or a study piece of paper. If you do have larger nail beds, the images will not cover your whole nail, also if you have long nails, again the image will not cover your whole nail.</li>
            <li> Good quality and nice patterns. Same as I expected. I liked it very much and very happy with my new purchase.</li>
            <li> wife loved it she does hair and nails</li>
            <li> This is my fave design plate by Konad. I use it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, however, this particular plate is VERY intricate and the designs are wire thin. To get this plate to transfer properly you will have to practice stamping many times before getting intricate designs to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest using Konad special stamping polish for this plate also, as regular polishes will dry to fast in these super thin/shallow designs.</li>
            <li> These are really nice. They print off great and I have no trouble with them.Will be buying more in the future.</li>
