            <li>I would&#x27;ve been better off with some 11.99 futuristic whatever it&#x27;s called from the hair store.</li>
            <li>If you straighten it then you might feel better about it.</li>
            <li>I wish I didn&#x27;t the hair had do many gray strands.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery ,Great Quality Hair .</li>
            <li>Hair Arrived on time also hair is beautiful also soft in Georgia in no time..</li>
            <li>Hair was good the first couple days</li>
            <li>but it’s easy to remove without breakage.</li>
            <li>but once I washed it and it was easily to mat up.</li>
            <li>Malaysian is better if you like a thicker , fuller look and rarely sheds ad does not tangle .</li>
            <li>Was great when new, but it does not hold up very well at all.</li>
            <li>I ordered from Human Hair Direct twice and the hair was great !</li>
            <li>I purchased the 14 16 18 inch Peruvian hair in November 2014 and used the hair to make a full wig unit with a lace front closure in December 2014.  </li>
            <li>You would need 3 or 4 to make a full head.  </li>
            <li>GOOD- when I first got the hair it was very nice &amp; soft &amp; fluffy &amp; long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even worth</li>
            <li>It ain&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>There is a reason that you can rarely find it in stores.  </li>
            <li>This hair is more like 50g total for three pieces of hair.</li>
            <li>Hair was extremely hot and smoking while bleaching, then the( body wave)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad but expected it to have more to it</li>
            <li>It matches the texture and color of african american relaxed hair perfectly in its natural state and it is so light you hardly feel it once it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>The product is not an accurate amount of hair it is much smaller.</li>
            <li>As I washed it the hair matted up even more got tangled &amp; just felt really rough.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>People are really checking it out wherever I go.  </li>
            <li>Other than that its some okay hair</li>
            <li>The hair was a little better than pack hair.</li>
            <li>The curls fall looser the first day, so expect much bigger waves.  </li>
            <li>The hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time to purchase this item, its samples.</li>
            <li>I did a whole head sew in with bundles and still had hair left over .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not trying to discriminate human hair direct</li>
            <li>bought it as an in between weave hair as I waited on some high quality factory hair that actually is a little less than 250 and well worth it.</li>

            <li> It sheds, goes flat and overall just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> When I open the package and run my hands down the hair I was surprised to discover lice.</li>
            <li> The wave pattern did not last long at all but the hair does wash and blow dry well.</li>
            <li> &amp; it still feels kind of bad.</li>
            <li> curl pattern never came back after being wet.</li>
            <li> hair seems to be heavily processed and low quality, assuming it&#x27;s human hair at all.</li>
            <li> After 2 days the hair started to loose</li>
            <li> Even the hair that wasn&#x27;t dyed, but got wet was ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These bundles are extra small.  </li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for really bad cheap hair that is not 100% virgin.</li>
            <li> At the beginning there was quite a bit of shedding but the shedding slowed down as I worebtge hair longer.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately My hair dresser made it work perfectly but still bad hair !!!</li>
            <li> I tried to dye it a little--deposit color for a tint-- and the hair basically melted and then became a frazzled mess.</li>
            <li> The hair was soft and the bundles were full however the quality was terrible.</li>
            <li> If you are not familiar with Peruvian hair, it is lighter than brazillian weave.  </li>
            <li> Bundles are 50g bundle not 100g waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I saw a few dyed greys.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the hair did not smell bad like it usually does.</li>
            <li> The hair sheds very little is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative stars I would.  </li>
            <li> The weft was so thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just saying that maybe you need to look over you&#x27;re hair &amp; see what&#x27;s going on because this is just not good at all</li>
            <li> Bundles were very small and thin...</li>
            <li> curls get really matted &amp; nappy &amp; feel horrible.</li>
            <li> but the hair was so thin.</li>
            <li> Please beware of false advertising</li>
            <li> Very thin, sheds a lot..</li>
            <li> Hair was extremely bad .</li>
            <li> So Bad</li>
            <li> It isnt as bad as the reveiws say..barely sheds or tangle..</li>
            <li> In addition the hair sheds extremely bad.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> But The Shedding Is Horrible</li>
            <li> Very awful hair.</li>
            <li> Simply awful.</li>

            <li> Hair Arrived on time also hair is beautiful also soft in Georgia in no time.. great texture you always on point!!</li>
            <li> GOOD- when I first got the hair it was very nice &amp; soft &amp; fluffy &amp; long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD- After 2 days the hair started to loose it&#x27;s curls get really matted &amp; nappy &amp; feel horrible. As I washed it the hair matted up even more got tangled &amp; just felt really rough. I&#x27;m blow drying it now &amp; it still feels kind of bad. I&#x27;m not trying to discriminate human hair direct I&#x27;m just saying that maybe you need to look over you&#x27;re hair &amp; see what&#x27;s going on because this is just not good at all</li>
            <li> I purchased the 14 16 18 inch Peruvian hair in November 2014 and used the hair to make a full wig unit with a lace front closure in December 2014.  The shipping was fast. The hair is soft and manageable. I have worn the hair for 2 weeks and it became fuller and duller but I did not add any oil to the hair. I washed the hair last night with Wen cleansing conditioner products and the luster returned but  the wave did not. I have attached 2 before I washed and 2 after pictures side by side. The hair does tangle at the nape of the neck but it’s easy to remove without breakage. The hair sheds very little is hardly noticeable. I would purchase the hair again but I only gave it 3 stars because lost of the wave and tangling.</li>
            <li> Malaysian is better if you like a thicker , fuller look and rarely sheds ad does not tangle . this hair sheds and can tangle at the ends after a couple weeks. I won&#x27;t get it again. Keep hair wrapped at night.</li>
            <li> Ordered a 14-16-18 and got 16-18-20-22 . Hair was extremely bad . Shed lots ! It was for my prom and I got it a day before so I had no choice but to keep it and get it cut . I ordered from Human Hair Direct twice and the hair was great ! The hair I reviewed wasn&#x27;t the hair I ordered . But unfortunately My hair dresser made it work perfectly but still bad hair !!!</li>
            <li> It looks really good for the price,  decided to curl mine and it looks amazing, couldn&#x27;t expect more!</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative stars I would.  These bundles are extra small.  You would need 3 or 4 to make a full head.  DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> Hair was shredding &amp; matted after 3 days</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for really bad cheap hair that is not 100% virgin. Please beware of false advertising</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time to purchase this item, its samples.</li>
            <li> Very thin, sheds a lot.. DO NOT Recommend!! RIP OFF!! Seller hasn&#x27;t responded after 2 months.. Very disappointed!! This hair is more like 50g total for three pieces of hair. Barely enough to even do a ponytail.</li>
            <li> Hair was a good price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but expected it to have more to it</li>
            <li> I love the hair I just received it in the mail. I cant wait to use it. The only thing that got me was it didnt come package like they said. But am going to do a youtube review on this hair. Got my fingers crossed for good uses.</li>
            <li> Was great when new, but it does not hold up very well at all. It sheds, goes flat and overall just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Bundles were very small and thin... Bundles are 50g bundle not 100g waste of money</li>
            <li> Sheds So Bad But Curls And Styles Perfect But The Shedding Is Horrible Will Not Purchase Again!</li>
            <li> The product is not as described. The product is not an accurate amount of hair it is much smaller. When I open the package and run my hands down the hair I was surprised to discover lice. There was not a lot but they were there.</li>
            <li> The weft was so thick but the hair was so thin. I sewed in 3 bundles, and it only looked like I had 1 bundle in.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the hair did not smell bad like it usually does. The hair was soft and the bundles were full however the quality was terrible. After I co-washed the hair the waves didn&#x27;t come back and the texture changed. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> the hair is very nice. I love it and I will will surely buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> The list price for this hair is in no way 250. It simply couldn&#x27;t be. It wasn&#x27;t even worth the 30 something I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as an in between weave hair as I waited on some high quality factory hair that actually is a little less than 250 and well worth it. I tried to dye it a little--deposit color for a tint-- and the hair basically melted and then became a frazzled mess. Even the hair that wasn&#x27;t dyed, but got wet was ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair seems to be heavily processed and low quality, assuming it&#x27;s human hair at all. I would&#x27;ve been better off with some 11.99 futuristic whatever it&#x27;s called from the hair store. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It ain&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Hair was good the first couple days but once I washed it and it was easily to mat up. I have had the hair in for three weeks. It sheds alot... But good part is... If you straighten it then you might feel better about it.</li>
            <li> Very awful hair. Simply awful. I wanted to cry.</li>
            <li> Hair was extremely hot and smoking while bleaching, then the( body wave) curl pattern never came back after being wet. Would never purchase this air again my opinion.</li>
            <li> It isnt as bad as the reveiws say..barely sheds or tangle.. The only problem was the smell when i washed it.and a lot of greys. Other than that its some okay hair</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and said I was going to give it a try. I wish I didn&#x27;t the hair had do many gray strands. In addition the hair sheds extremely bad. I am very disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> Can this hair be dyed</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery ,Great Quality Hair . I did a whole head sew in with bundles and still had hair left over . So bundles are nice size !</li>
            <li> The hair was a little better than pack hair. The wave pattern did not last long at all but the hair does wash and blow dry well. At the beginning there was quite a bit of shedding but the shedding slowed down as I worebtge hair longer. For a cheaper option I would purchase the hair again.</li>
            <li> awesome hair, got it before</li>
            <li> This hair is lovely and it arrived in excellent condition.  I&#x27;m wearing it now.  I got great reviews from my mother and sister.  People are really checking it out wherever I go.  I saw a few dyed greys. I could have removed them, but I like them.  If you are not familiar with Peruvian hair, it is lighter than brazillian weave.  The curls fall looser the first day, so expect much bigger waves.  There is a reason that you can rarely find it in stores.  It matches the texture and color of african american relaxed hair perfectly in its natural state and it is so light you hardly feel it once it&#x27;s on.  After my local hair store ran out of Peruvian hair, I found this gem on Amazon.com.  This is where I will shop from now on.</li>
            <li> exactly what you see ,beautiful.</li>
