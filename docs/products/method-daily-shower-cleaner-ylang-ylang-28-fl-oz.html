            <li>I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Method and have used their bathroom cleaner for YEARS even though a company that I partner with has bathroom cleaner.</li>
            <li>but it does keep our shower clean!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad Amazon has this available</li>
            <li>extraordinary product - works perfectly - spray daily and shower door looks like it was just cleaned by hand.</li>
            <li>I wanted a way to be able to proactively keep my shower clean.</li>
            <li>Yes, the smell is unique.  </li>
            <li>This daily shower cleaner has a great fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-toxic and leaves your shower clean without scrubbing.</li>
            <li>At this point any lingering scent just reminds me of how clean the bath is.</li>
            <li>After about 10 mins the scent dissipates and is pleasant enough.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product that I will continue to refill with the large refill bottle that the company sells.</li>
            <li>love this cleaner and the fragrance of it.. cleans without heavy scrubbing and has a good spray area</li>
            <li>Just look them up on Environmental Working Group as i did AFTER buying this product - you will see that many of their products were even rating F - HIGHLY toxic.</li>
            <li>The odor is a bit strong, but I really like that, as it makes the whole bathroom smell clean!</li>
            <li>This is a safe product just wish they sold it where I live</li>
            <li>method shower cleaner wins hands down ..there is no harsh odors at all and Thank you Method for making it and keep the great (Method) products coming..</li>
            <li>I have used water in my house and this cleaner really helps to combat the buildup that can occur as a result.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this product when I moved into my new apartment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for over 1.5 years and find it superior to any other daily shower cleaner.</li>
            <li>When I needed to move out 6 months later, I did absolutely nothing to clean the shower.</li>
            <li>I love some of the other Method products I use and thought I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li>When I finished, it was amazingly clean, grout was pearl white.</li>
            <li>So when we moved into our new house, I figured I would give this stuff a whirl, not expecting much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shower cleaner for two and a half months now and have only needed to clean the shower by hand once, but I only suspect that was needed because my husband isn&#x27;t the best at remembering to spray the shower down when he gets out!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get this if you can&#x27;t stand highly perfumed products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little like baby powder, but more perfume-y.</li>
            <li>better then bleach and harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>I have been using it in a new shower for about three years and no hard water spots on the chrome fixtures.</li>
            <li>After quickly going through a bottle of this, I have to say it doesn&#x27;t really do anything other than make your bathroom smell</li>
            <li>I could never get it off our shower doors in our old house.</li>
            <li>I think there is a legal case in their future.</li>
            <li>I use this almost every day on the shower walls and floor and have been able to prevent soap scum buildup.</li>
            <li>The smell is not chemically but can be a bit strong in a small bathroom.</li>
            <li>I like this shower cleaner so easy just spray and requires very little scrubbing I use daily to keep up with it</li>
            <li>When I moved into my new apartment, I bought this product, Method Daily Shower, and used it daily.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by Method&#x27;s claims - as a company they do maintain green practices but their actual products are a far cry from the non toxic wonder&#x27;s that they claim them to be.</li>
            <li> I use it every day after showering and it really cuts down on how hard I have to scrub when I do a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> Not a super big fan of the smell</li>
            <li> I used the for the first, second, third time and the results were disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I also use it for the sinks and counters.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on all the wet surfaces after a shower.</li>
            <li> When I moved from my previous apartment, cleaning the shower was one of the toughest things to do.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little over powering, though.</li>
            <li> No more scrubbing my shower.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why not sure I just no</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the formula for this scent that made it inferior in cleaning quality.</li>
            <li> I had to use other products, not happy customer at all</li>
            <li> I just spray my tub after every shower and it prevents mildew and soap scum.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with mildew on my no-skid mat in the tub but no more mildew in my shower!</li>
            <li> Not that method hasn&#x27;t disappointed me, but using this stuff daily, after showers, has drastically reduced the amount of water build up on our bath and tile.</li>
            <li> We have very hard water in our area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely lazy, hate cleaning showers, and frankly they&#x27;ve always looked terrible in the past with mildew and soap scum building up.  </li>
            <li> The grout was dirty and did not come off with scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this is a dangerous product!  </li>
            <li> It smells disgusting!</li>
            <li> It lingers for hours and is so horrible!</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this product! No more scrubbing my shower. I just spray my tub after every shower and it prevents mildew and soap scum. I had a problem with mildew on my no-skid mat in the tub but no more mildew in my shower! The smell is not chemically but can be a bit strong in a small bathroom. Smells like ylang ylang (kind of like baby powder).</li>
            <li> We have very hard water in our area.  I could never get it off our shower doors in our old house. So when we moved into our new house, I figured I would give this stuff a whirl, not expecting much. I have been wowed by this stuff. Not that method hasn&#x27;t disappointed me, but using this stuff daily, after showers, has drastically reduced the amount of water build up on our bath and tile. The smell is a little over powering, though.</li>
            <li> I like this shower cleaner so easy just spray and requires very little scrubbing I use daily to keep up with it mybe that&#x27;s why not sure I just no this product is the best for those whom can&#x27;t  stand the smell of nasty chemicals.This is a safe product just wish they sold it where I live but I&#x27;m glad Amazon has this available</li>
            <li> After quickly going through a bottle of this, I have to say it doesn&#x27;t really do anything other than make your bathroom smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;Skip it.</li>
            <li> Nice product, very refreshing scent and works as described  Easy to use and priced better than supermarket products that are not as effective</li>
            <li> Not a super big fan of the smell but it does keep our shower clean! No residue on our door whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I used the for the first, second, third time and the results were disappointing.  I had to use other products, not happy customer at all</li>
            <li> Love the stuff. I have been using it in a new shower for about three years and no hard water spots on the chrome fixtures. Would recommend for showers and tubs.</li>
            <li> CLEANS THE SHOWER AND SMELLS GOOD</li>
            <li> I really LOVE the smell of this.  I use it on the showers and tub at my house.  I also use it for the sinks and counters.  The smell is so amazing.  I have many of the Method cleaners and this one is the best.  If they made a plug in I would totally use it.  I love the way my house smells after using this.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this smells! It&#x27;s a little like baby powder, but more perfume-y. The odor is a bit strong, but I really like that, as it makes the whole bathroom smell clean! I have used water in my house and this cleaner really helps to combat the buildup that can occur as a result.  I&#x27;ve had this shower cleaner for two and a half months now and have only needed to clean the shower by hand once, but I only suspect that was needed because my husband isn&#x27;t the best at remembering to spray the shower down when he gets out! Overall a great product that I will continue to refill with the large refill bottle that the company sells.</li>
            <li> Been working like its supposed to!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year. I spray it on all the wet surfaces after a shower. I have not had to do any shower or bathtub scrubbing since I started using it. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this if you can&#x27;t stand highly perfumed products.  Gave us a headache.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I love this product, after a shower we just spray it and leave it. Has a nice pleasant smell</li>
            <li> extraordinary product - works perfectly - spray daily and shower door looks like it was just cleaned by hand.</li>
            <li> The best.  Just use it!  Your bathroom will smell good and clean.  Method is a great product and is so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  Yes, the smell is unique.  It reminds me of baby powder, and while I&#x27;d prefer pine or eucalyptus, I am so overjoyed by the products&#x27; effectiveness I&#x27;ll never give it up.  I&#x27;m extremely lazy, hate cleaning showers, and frankly they&#x27;ve always looked terrible in the past with mildew and soap scum building up.  But with this stuff, I literally don&#x27;t have to do anything and my shower sparkles!  I just spray it on after a shower and leave.  After about 10 mins the scent dissipates and is pleasant enough.  At this point any lingering scent just reminds me of how clean the bath is.</li>
            <li> This cleaner is awesome ..better then bleach and harsh chemicals ..i&#x27;m not just saying it .. I&#x27;ve tried bleach , ammonia and just about every name brand cleaner out there ..method shower cleaner wins hands down ..there is no harsh odors at all and Thank you Method for making it and keep the great (Method) products coming..</li>
            <li> by this cleaner. I LOVE Method and have used their bathroom cleaner for YEARS even though a company that I partner with has bathroom cleaner. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the formula for this scent that made it inferior in cleaning quality. Another not is that it doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li> It smells disgusting! Used once and will never use again. Don&#x27;t buy unless you like your bathroom to smell like a perfume shop.</li>
            <li> The smell of this spray is so overwhelming! It lingers for hours and is so horrible! It&#x27;s does a good job cleaning but I will never purchase this scent again!!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work but WHY oh why do companies feel the need to perfume their products SO heavily?&lt;br /&gt;I have to immediately vacate the bathroom to avoid olfactory overwhelm not to mention the toxicity that comes with these engineered fragrances. Don&#x27;t be fooled by Method&#x27;s claims - as a company they do maintain green practices but their actual products are a far cry from the non toxic wonder&#x27;s that they claim them to be. Just look them up on Environmental Working Group as i did AFTER buying this product - you will see that many of their products were even rating F - HIGHLY toxic.</li>
            <li> I love some of the other Method products I use and thought I&#x27;d try this. It does not work and the odor is very strong and I find it offensive. A bit like rotten baby powder is the closest I can describe it. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this is a dangerous product!  It not only doesn&#x27;t work as advertised, it only serves to make your shower floor so slippery, you could bust you butt!  I think there is a legal case in their future.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day on the shower walls and floor and have been able to prevent soap scum buildup.</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product when I moved into my new apartment. I wanted a way to be able to proactively keep my shower clean. When I moved from my previous apartment, cleaning the shower was one of the toughest things to do. The grout was dirty and did not come off with scrubbing. I had only lived there for 6 months! What I ended up doing was soaking paper towels in bleach and sticking individual sheets to the wall and let them cling to the shower walls for about 12 hours while periodically spritzing with a bleach water solution. When I finished, it was amazingly clean, grout was pearl white. When I moved into my new apartment, I bought this product, Method Daily Shower, and used it daily. I&#x27;d used the shower head and rinse the walls with water before I exited the shower, and then follow it up with this spray. When I needed to move out 6 months later, I did absolutely nothing to clean the shower. This product is awesome.</li>
