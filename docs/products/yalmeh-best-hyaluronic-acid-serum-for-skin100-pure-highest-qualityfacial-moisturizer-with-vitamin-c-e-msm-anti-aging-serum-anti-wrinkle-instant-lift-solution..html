            <li>Hi thank you for checking on me but to be honest</li>
            <li>It smells like something in the Aveda product line (woodsy/natural) and it feels so nice to apply -</li>
            <li>Very good price thou ;)</li>
            <li>It has an interesting texture, kind of liquid and almost gel-like.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so soft and that makes me feel more beautiful!</li>
            <li>Its water activated so I spritz my face first then apply and it feels great.</li>
            <li>Fine lines gone!</li>
            <li>First is goes on very nice and does have a tightening affect - used with the eye cream</li>
            <li>I liked it fine when I started using it, then got an email from the company telling me a trick to do with it</li>
            <li>Does not stay on top.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more bottles so that I wouldn&#x27;t run out and the blowout price can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>Now I love it.</li>
            <li>On top of the serum itself being rather watery in texture</li>
            <li>I will continue usage just to make sure it isn&#x27;t something else.</li>
            <li>They are not as noticeable any more.</li>
            <li>I love your product</li>
            <li>and im glad ii order it..</li>
            <li>I SURE HOPE SO..</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels after using this.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use as instructed to get the most benefit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll tell you more.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and always feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this Hyaluronic Acid .</li>
            <li>I have been using YALMEH Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin since Jan 1, 2015 and I am truly amazed at the difference this has made on all my deep lines between my forehead and pores.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with the customer support</li>
            <li>and I am looking forward to seeing more skin improvements in the coming months.</li>
            <li>Have been slowly switching to all of the product because it&#x27;s a great brand at an awesome price!</li>
            <li>I recommend mixed a drop with water before applying - that seems to work best.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love Yalmeh.</li>
            <li>And I love using it with the aloe moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li>its, ok, but no discernible difference</li>
            <li>I started a daily routine using YALMEH Super Youth Eye CreamTM and YALMEH Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin since January 1, 2015.  </li>
            <li>I have used another brand which I also liked very much</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite serum!</li>
            <li>I have not started to use this product yet but the place that I bought it from is fantastic in customer service.</li>
            <li>Feels light, and my lines/wrinkles have truly diminished.</li>
            <li>and it made my skin softer and smooth.</li>
            <li>Pairs well with a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night and wake up to silky smooth skin on my face.</li>
            <li>Overall, it has been a great product.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I have noticed a change in my skin&#x27;s texture and radiance within a week of using the product.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I can see some improvement, however, when you&#x27;re 65</li>
            <li>I can tell a tremendous improvement in the fine lines I had between my brows and around my lips.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>at first I was not so sure, then I received an email telling me tips on how to use it.</li>
            <li>I love that Yalmeh products are made with safe &amp; natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I purchased the full line of Yalmeh products and believe that my skin has become firmer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>I just started this serum, so kind of early to tell.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what led me to this, but I am so glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>I probably need more time to see real result.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it really works.</li>
            <li>It was very reasonably priced and I see a noticeable improvement in fine lines and wrinkles after just over a week of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using yalmeh&#x27;s hyaluronic acid alons with aloe super youth eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a skin product that has worked so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Ordered came quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every morning and evening after washing with a mild cleanser.</li>
            <li>Super satisfaction with the company and speed of shipment as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and will return to order more.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the addition of this hyaluronic acid serum to my daily regimen.  </li>
            <li>serum is wonderful, especially now when we have winter and dry air</li>
            <li>It takes time to see a huge difference for me, because I am older and wrinkled to begin with!</li>
            <li>This Hyaluronic Acid  is amazing and so affordable, I wish I had discovered it last month.</li>
            <li>YALMEH is an amazing company, I read reviews saying the same thing which is one of the reasons that I choose this company and their products.  </li>
            <li>After trying other skin creams I find Yalmeh to be the most beneficial and satisfying.  </li>
            <li>There is not a greasy  feeling,  and it goes right into the skin.</li>
            <li>Overall normal Hyaluronic acid, but good customer service</li>
            <li>and I think they are helpful in holding the line on new wrinkles and helping to smooth skin.</li>
            <li>First time used I noticed right away the deffierent on my face .</li>
            <li>Tried this initially because it was such a great deal.  </li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s a really nice thing because the dry part of my skin can get the moister</li>
            <li>My skin is hydrated, looks wrinkle free and is very soft.  </li>
            <li>and like it very much.  </li>
            <li>but  believe I actually see better results&lt;</li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement in my skin within the first week.  </li>
            <li>A friend that I have not seen in a few weeks just comment on how good my face looks</li>
            <li>next review should be more positive.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a month ago seeing those positive reviews</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old with the normal fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product more for under eye puffiness than fine lines/wrinkles and while I think it has helped with the puffiness, I also think its helped with tiny little wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was 100% pure Hyaluronic acid  </li>
            <li>In my battle to beat back time, it is a new favorite weapon in my arsenal.</li>
            <li>Really seems to help my face cream work.</li>
            <li>There is no odor &amp; fragrance which I really like.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>I really like that they sent me a follow up email with some tips on how to use and asking me how I like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell you if I really like it or not as I bought it for a friend that lives in Canada.</li>
            <li>, it gives my skin some much needed balance.</li>
            <li>Thanks YALMEH</li>
            <li>The ingredients seem promising.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Im not seeing much improvement</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you give it a try!</li>
            <li>Never greasy, goes on smooth and works instantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>It works better than any other serum I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week with the Yalmeh Vitamin C &amp; Eye Cream with aloe vera as a full night time only regimen</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for about a week (morning and night), and I have already noticed that my skin seems to be firmer, have better tone, and even look younger.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I tried this in an attempt to find something that was a better deal than my usual pricey stand-by, Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>I have used a very similar product in the past and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I will return with a more updated review once I have used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this product again, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Youthfulness is not hard not define anymore</li>
            <li>and she does not know that I am using anything new.  </li>
            <li>I gave it to my husband to use since the scent is very masculine</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have not had any adverse reactions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product for about two weeks now, but my skin absolutely feels tighter and more firm after putting it on.  </li>
            <li>I can see several of the veins in my hands as I get older and a few age spots, mostly on one hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and there is a noticeable difference in both the fine lines and dark circles!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply and does not interfere with make-up application or other facial products.</li>
            <li>Helps my wrinkles and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>Of course, I&#x27;ve only been using it on my hands for a couple of months, and that&#x27;s too short a time to really see much difference,</li>
            <li>I have noticed since using your product my skin is much clearer and my pores are getting smaller.</li>
            <li>I have used this over a month and really see no difference in my facial skin at all.</li>
            <li>but I will not waste my money again.</li>
            <li>My skin looks forever young.</li>
            <li>hope is it will show some results so far none , but still using it</li>
            <li>and I can see a considerable change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This serum has lightened my skin and it makes it so soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I saw a Dr. Oz show where he highly recommended the Vitamin C / Hyaluronic acid for keeping / rebuilding skin elasticity, so I am sticking with using one of these type products for the long run.</li>
            <li>I like how the serum makes my skin feel buttery soft but have noticed I am starting to break out a bit from it.</li>
            <li>I am no where near to being out of the product, but when I am, I will likely reorder.</li>
            <li>It made my skin soft and radiant within the first few days of using it.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this product I have seen a more even complexion on my face and it has decreased the appearance of blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li>Massaging some of this Hyaluronic Acid Serum into the skin on top of my hands seems to make the brown spots a little lighter and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Dark circles - whole nother story - mine are pretty dark.  </li>
            <li>My face did not dry out at all</li>
            <li>, I use it at night and already noticed that it makes my skin firm and hydrated and my lines diminished ;)</li>
            <li>This product has decreased my fine line.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It smells like something in the Aveda product line (woodsy/natural) and it feels so nice to apply -</li>
            <li> Very good price thou ;)</li>
            <li> It has an interesting texture, kind of liquid and almost gel-like.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so soft and that makes me feel more beautiful!</li>
            <li> Its water activated so I spritz my face first then apply and it feels great.</li>
            <li> Fine lines gone!</li>
            <li> First is goes on very nice and does have a tightening affect - used with the eye cream</li>
            <li> I liked it fine when I started using it, then got an email from the company telling me a trick to do with it</li>
            <li> Does not stay on top.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more bottles so that I wouldn&#x27;t run out and the blowout price can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> Now I love it.</li>
            <li> On top of the serum itself being rather watery in texture</li>
            <li> I will continue usage just to make sure it isn&#x27;t something else.</li>
            <li> They are not as noticeable any more.</li>
            <li> I love your product</li>
            <li> and im glad ii order it..</li>
            <li> I SURE HOPE SO..</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after using this.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use as instructed to get the most benefit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you more.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and always feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this Hyaluronic Acid .</li>
            <li> I have been using YALMEH Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin since Jan 1, 2015 and I am truly amazed at the difference this has made on all my deep lines between my forehead and pores.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with the customer support</li>
            <li> and I am looking forward to seeing more skin improvements in the coming months.</li>
            <li> Have been slowly switching to all of the product because it&#x27;s a great brand at an awesome price!</li>
            <li> I recommend mixed a drop with water before applying - that seems to work best.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Yalmeh.</li>
            <li> And I love using it with the aloe moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> its, ok, but no discernible difference</li>
            <li> I started a daily routine using YALMEH Super Youth Eye CreamTM and YALMEH Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin since January 1, 2015.  </li>
            <li> I have used another brand which I also liked very much</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite serum!</li>
            <li> I have not started to use this product yet but the place that I bought it from is fantastic in customer service.</li>
            <li> Feels light, and my lines/wrinkles have truly diminished.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin softer and smooth.</li>
            <li> Pairs well with a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and wake up to silky smooth skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Overall, it has been a great product.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have noticed a change in my skin&#x27;s texture and radiance within a week of using the product.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I can see some improvement, however, when you&#x27;re 65</li>
            <li> I can tell a tremendous improvement in the fine lines I had between my brows and around my lips.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> at first I was not so sure, then I received an email telling me tips on how to use it.</li>
            <li> I love that Yalmeh products are made with safe &amp; natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I purchased the full line of Yalmeh products and believe that my skin has become firmer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> I just started this serum, so kind of early to tell.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what led me to this, but I am so glad I found it.  </li>
            <li> I probably need more time to see real result.</li>
            <li> On top of that, it really works.</li>
            <li> It was very reasonably priced and I see a noticeable improvement in fine lines and wrinkles after just over a week of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using yalmeh&#x27;s hyaluronic acid alons with aloe super youth eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a skin product that has worked so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Ordered came quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every morning and evening after washing with a mild cleanser.</li>
            <li> Super satisfaction with the company and speed of shipment as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and will return to order more.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the addition of this hyaluronic acid serum to my daily regimen.  </li>
            <li> serum is wonderful, especially now when we have winter and dry air</li>
            <li> It takes time to see a huge difference for me, because I am older and wrinkled to begin with!</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid  is amazing and so affordable, I wish I had discovered it last month.</li>
            <li> YALMEH is an amazing company, I read reviews saying the same thing which is one of the reasons that I choose this company and their products.  </li>
            <li> After trying other skin creams I find Yalmeh to be the most beneficial and satisfying.  </li>
            <li> There is not a greasy  feeling,  and it goes right into the skin.</li>
            <li> Overall normal Hyaluronic acid, but good customer service</li>
            <li> and I think they are helpful in holding the line on new wrinkles and helping to smooth skin.</li>
            <li> First time used I noticed right away the deffierent on my face .</li>
            <li> Tried this initially because it was such a great deal.  </li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s a really nice thing because the dry part of my skin can get the moister</li>
            <li> My skin is hydrated, looks wrinkle free and is very soft.  </li>
            <li> and like it very much.  </li>
            <li> but  believe I actually see better results&lt;</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement in my skin within the first week.  </li>
            <li> A friend that I have not seen in a few weeks just comment on how good my face looks</li>
            <li> next review should be more positive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a month ago seeing those positive reviews</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old with the normal fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product more for under eye puffiness than fine lines/wrinkles and while I think it has helped with the puffiness, I also think its helped with tiny little wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was 100% pure Hyaluronic acid  </li>
            <li> In my battle to beat back time, it is a new favorite weapon in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> Really seems to help my face cream work.</li>
            <li> There is no odor &amp; fragrance which I really like.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> I really like that they sent me a follow up email with some tips on how to use and asking me how I like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> I cannot tell you if I really like it or not as I bought it for a friend that lives in Canada.</li>
            <li> , it gives my skin some much needed balance.</li>
            <li> Thanks YALMEH</li>
            <li> The ingredients seem promising.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Im not seeing much improvement</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you give it a try!</li>
            <li> Never greasy, goes on smooth and works instantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> It works better than any other serum I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week with the Yalmeh Vitamin C &amp; Eye Cream with aloe vera as a full night time only regimen</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about a week (morning and night), and I have already noticed that my skin seems to be firmer, have better tone, and even look younger.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried this in an attempt to find something that was a better deal than my usual pricey stand-by, Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I have used a very similar product in the past and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I will return with a more updated review once I have used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this product again, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Youthfulness is not hard not define anymore</li>
            <li> and she does not know that I am using anything new.  </li>
            <li> I gave it to my husband to use since the scent is very masculine</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have not had any adverse reactions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for about two weeks now, but my skin absolutely feels tighter and more firm after putting it on.  </li>
            <li> I can see several of the veins in my hands as I get older and a few age spots, mostly on one hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and there is a noticeable difference in both the fine lines and dark circles!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply and does not interfere with make-up application or other facial products.</li>
            <li> Helps my wrinkles and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;ve only been using it on my hands for a couple of months, and that&#x27;s too short a time to really see much difference,</li>
            <li> I have noticed since using your product my skin is much clearer and my pores are getting smaller.</li>
            <li> I have used this over a month and really see no difference in my facial skin at all.</li>
            <li> but I will not waste my money again.</li>
            <li> My skin looks forever young.</li>
            <li> hope is it will show some results so far none , but still using it</li>
            <li> and I can see a considerable change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This serum has lightened my skin and it makes it so soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I saw a Dr. Oz show where he highly recommended the Vitamin C / Hyaluronic acid for keeping / rebuilding skin elasticity, so I am sticking with using one of these type products for the long run.</li>
            <li> I like how the serum makes my skin feel buttery soft but have noticed I am starting to break out a bit from it.</li>
            <li> I am no where near to being out of the product, but when I am, I will likely reorder.</li>
            <li> It made my skin soft and radiant within the first few days of using it.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product I have seen a more even complexion on my face and it has decreased the appearance of blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li> Massaging some of this Hyaluronic Acid Serum into the skin on top of my hands seems to make the brown spots a little lighter and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Dark circles - whole nother story - mine are pretty dark.  </li>
            <li> My face did not dry out at all</li>
            <li> , I use it at night and already noticed that it makes my skin firm and hydrated and my lines diminished ;)</li>
            <li> This product has decreased my fine line.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of expensive products that didn&#x27;t live up to their claims.</li>
            <li> I received the small sample of this Hyaluronic Acid with my Yalmeh super youth face cream and all I can say this serum is extremely absorbable and dose not feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I only give a 4 because I have not had it long to see results.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as i can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It does comes a long  way, the feeling is it tightens the skin of my face.  </li>
            <li> I put it on every night &amp; morning, let it dry, then use the eye cream.</li>
            <li> Only a little amount is needed.</li>
            <li> some results not what i expected  </li>
            <li> the directions suggest using wet fingertips</li>
            <li> It also adds some moisture, just enough that my dry skin can usually get by without additional moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> (I guess there is less hyaluronic acid here since it is much further down the list of ingredients), there is an odd &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use other product</li>
            <li> Tried it in my wet hair after shampoo and it works like a thickener too!</li>
            <li> Im not sure i like the product Im going to finish whats left in the bottle and see what happens</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to dry</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought it&#x27;s not that expensive compared to the prices I normally pay for serums</li>
            <li> It seems to make the skin on my face look a little fresher and brighter.</li>
            <li> I shall use a little water which I was not doing.  </li>
            <li> I like this product as it makes my skin firm and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I want to have this everyday and night</li>
            <li> I have been optimistic and applying it everyday, but i see no results.</li>
            <li> and i thought it is really waste of my money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old and was a sun worshiper, needless to say I have a lot of sun damage.  </li>
            <li> Used with water as directed for few days and then neat.</li>
            <li> This bottle should last for a couple of months at least because it goes on fairly thin.</li>
            <li> I usually apply Peter Thomas Roth pm retinol but have been using this</li>
            <li> No issues with breakouts or excessive oil production either.</li>
            <li> Let me say, what works for me, might not work for you, but you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> Definately improving the area around my eyes, at least when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> I saw a dramatic improvement in the lines between my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> So when I found this of course I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Im sorry Sharon</li>
            <li> They are very faint now and not as noticeable.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My absolute favorite serum! Bot my DH &amp; I use this morning &amp; night. Really seems to help my face cream work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Hyaluronic Acid serums before and I think they are helpful in holding the line on new wrinkles and helping to smooth skin. These products won&#x27;t wipe out wrinkles and they aren&#x27;t advertised to do that. No cream or serum is going to perform miracles no matter what they promise. But this seems to make a difference and it feels good on my face without feeling greasy. It has an interesting texture, kind of liquid and almost gel-like. It comes with an eye dropper which helps to apply it. It takes a few minutes to dry and I sometimes apply Argan Oil over it, but not always.  It seems to make the skin on my face look a little fresher and brighter. It also adds some moisture, just enough that my dry skin can usually get by without additional moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve found another use for it which I read about in an article about thinning skin on our hands as we age. I can see several of the veins in my hands as I get older and a few age spots, mostly on one hand. Massaging some of this Hyaluronic Acid Serum into the skin on top of my hands seems to make the brown spots a little lighter and less noticeable. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my imagination either. Of course, I&#x27;ve only been using it on my hands for a couple of months, and that&#x27;s too short a time to really see much difference, but I&#x27;m going to keep applying it a couple times a day and see what happens. This bottle should last for a couple of months at least because it goes on fairly thin. (If I don&#x27;t sill any). I&#x27;ll report back here if I see any big changes. I&#x27;ll keep applying it to my face as well. It does make my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> I have people asking me what I use on my skin. I use Yalmeh Hyaluronic Acid with vitamin c and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I purchased the full line of Yalmeh products and believe that my skin has become firmer and smoother.  The pores on my nose have also diminished.</li>
            <li> I have not started to use this product yet but the place that I bought it from is fantastic in customer service. I have used a very similar product in the past and I loved it. It does just as advertised. I will return with a more updated review once I have used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum I have ever bought, it plumps you skin. There is not a greasy  feeling,  and it goes right into the skin. Does not stay on top. Great product</li>
            <li> Great serum to hydrate your skin!  I like this product as it makes my skin firm and hydrated.  Only a little amount is needed.</li>
            <li> I try to use Yalmeh Hyaluronic Acid Serum daily at night. There is no odor &amp; fragrance which I really like. I love this serum! Makes my skin so soft a little goes a long way. Feels light, and my lines/wrinkles have truly diminished. Especially the lines above my lip.I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just started this serum, so kind of early to tell.  I does make your make up look fresher.  I am hoping it will help my hyperpigmentation.  Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> First time used I noticed right away the deffierent on my face . Great product ! Love it ! Love it !</li>
            <li> I have just started to use this serum and like it very much.  I am very glad you sent me directions on how to use because I was doing it incorrectly.  Now that I know, there should be some great success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next review should be more positive.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what led me to this, but I am so glad I found it.  It has been about 2 weeks and I can definitely tell a difference.  It isn&#x27;t sticky.  It hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.  I just ordered two more bottles so that I wouldn&#x27;t run out and the blowout price can&#x27;t be beat.  Believe me.  I looked.</li>
            <li> Been using going on 3 weeks now. I used especially under eyes where skin starts getting saggy and crows feet. I put it on every night &amp; morning, let it dry, then use the eye cream. After even a week I was amazed at the difference! Fine lines gone! Under eye area smoother! I&#x27;m sold. I love that Yalmeh products are made with safe &amp; natural ingredients. A must try!</li>
            <li> Tried this initially because it was such a great deal.  Now I love it. This product has decreased my fine line.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.  I have tried a couple different hyaluronic acid treatments and this one is good. My skin feels good.  I use it twice a day</li>
            <li> I am a long-time user of hyaluronic acid serums. I tried this in an attempt to find something that was a better deal than my usual pricey stand-by, Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamin C. This one is not to my preference at all. On top of the serum itself being rather watery in texture (I guess there is less hyaluronic acid here since it is much further down the list of ingredients), there is an odd &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; smell to mine--almost like a campfire. I can still smell it on my face after I apply. I gave it to my husband to use since the scent is very masculine and I don&#x27;t care to smell it all day.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have noticed a change in my skin&#x27;s texture and radiance within a week of using the product. I believe I will continue use of this product and plan on purchasing it again when my current supply is finished,</li>
            <li> I have used the hyaluronic acid serum for about two weeks, day and night. I like how the serum makes my skin feel buttery soft but have noticed I am starting to break out a bit from it. I will continue usage just to make sure it isn&#x27;t something else.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with the face and eye cream by Yalmeh as a morning regimen. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I have seen a big change in the pores on my cheeks and forehead.  They are not as noticeable any more. I followed the instructions and it did not make my skin red which was a concern for me since I have Rosacea. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of products in all price ranges to diminish the web-like lines on my chin and forehead.  I am very pleased with the addition of this hyaluronic acid serum to my daily regimen.  It works better than any other serum I have tried.  I use it in the morning under my moisturizer, but I have a different nighttime regimen.  I think you have to find what works best for you.  I would encourage you to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love your product it is nice to have it everyday,,i don&#x27;t use other product this is it!! I want to have this everyday and night it is good for my skin.. thank you so much and im glad ii order it..</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old with the normal fine lines.  Dark circles - whole nother story - mine are pretty dark.  I also have the driest skin.  I&#x27;ve been using yalmeh&#x27;s hyaluronic acid alons with aloe super youth eye cream.  First is goes on very nice and does have a tightening affect - used with the eye cream it&#x27;s really, really nice.  The thing is that it help retain that dewy look without settling in my lines.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and there is a noticeable difference in both the fine lines and dark circles!</li>
            <li> I have been using Comedica Hydraulic Acid along with Primeir Sea Eye serum and I like that.  However I still found I had puffiness under my eyes and some darkness.  So I bought this Hydraulic Acid as it has Vitamin C &amp; E with it and I got the eye cream from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a noticeable difference where the puffiness is now gone and the under eye area looks brighter.  I use it both in the morning and at night.  I really like that they sent me a follow up email with some tips on how to use and asking me how I like it.</li>
            <li> WELL IT&#x27;S BEEN ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND NO DIFFERENCE AS OF YET, MAYBE MY SKIN TAKES LONGER. I SURE HOPE SO..</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about a week (morning and night), and I have already noticed that my skin seems to be firmer, have better tone, and even look younger.  My skin is also softer to the touch.  I will continue to use this product as long as i can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  My skin looks and feels better.  In my battle to beat back time, it is a new favorite weapon in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after using this.  Be sure to use as instructed to get the most benefit.  It takes time to see a huge difference for me, because I am older and wrinkled to begin with! I saw a Dr. Oz show where he highly recommended the Vitamin C / Hyaluronic acid for keeping / rebuilding skin elasticity, so I am sticking with using one of these type products for the long run.</li>
            <li> Works well, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought it was 100% pure Hyaluronic acid  but when I read the ingredients I saw that there&#x27;s only 5% of it in this serum. I cannot tell you if I really like it or not as I bought it for a friend that lives in Canada. When I hear of how she liked it I&#x27;ll tell you more.</li>
            <li> I use product for 2 weeks and I like its touch and how my skin feels. I probably need more time to see real result. Will comment again in a month or so. Very good price thou ;)</li>
            <li> I have noticed since using your product my skin is much clearer and my pores are getting smaller. My skin is getting a youthful look which makes me happy since I am in my fifties.</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid Serum is amazing.  I have never had a skin product that has worked so quickly.  I have monthly facials at a Spa but have never had immediate results like this.  The results from the Hyaluronic Acid Serum are both visible and to the touch.  My skin is hydrated, looks wrinkle free and is very soft.  Per the instructions I used it once per day combined with water on my face and neck.  I have only had the product for five days but I intend to continue to use it daily.  Another plus is the price!</li>
            <li> I like using this at night time after I wash my face. I put it on before my moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and always feels refreshing. I have combo skin and it doesn&#x27;t even make my t zone oily. So that&#x27;s a really nice thing because the dry part of my skin can get the moister it needs.in short, it gives my skin some much needed balance.</li>
            <li> I love it. I have used another brand which I also liked very much but  believe I actually see better results&lt;br /&gt;with this product. I will buying it again (and again)</li>
            <li> I always apply this Serum every time I wash my face.  It does comes a long  way, the feeling is it tightens the skin of my face.  I believe this will help me a lot to avoid wrinkles.  We can achieve best results if we will partner this with the face moisturizer just like what I did.  I keep on looking at the mirror seeing the noticeable results using these Yalmeh beauty product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have used this over a month and really see no difference in my facial skin at all. Each to their own but I will not waste my money again.</li>
            <li> Delivers excellent results for the price that you pay for it. Hyaluronic acid is miracle for your skin- do yourself a favor and use it no matter what age you are.</li>
            <li> I love it, as it&#x27;s great moisturizing serum, I use it at night and already noticed that it makes my skin firm and hydrated and my lines diminished ;) Thanks YALMEH</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks now and I think the texture of my skin has improved... I do use good moisturizing creams and I think this serum is helping my skin to absorb those... I am hoping the improvement continues</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for about two weeks now, but my skin absolutely feels tighter and more firm after putting it on.  A little goes a long way.  I originally purchased this product more for under eye puffiness than fine lines/wrinkles and while I think it has helped with the puffiness, I also think its helped with tiny little wrinkles.  I am giving it 4 stars for now.  I am using with the youth eye cream and that product says it can take 3 months for results.  I am no where near to being out of the product, but when I am, I will likely reorder.</li>
            <li> I think it does good things for my skin.</li>
            <li> Helps my wrinkles and keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I received the small sample of this Hyaluronic Acid with my Yalmeh super youth face cream and all I can say this serum is extremely absorbable and dose not feel sticky. It made my skin soft and radiant within the first few days of using it. I plan to buy it as soon as I&#x27;m done with my sample.</li>
            <li> I love this Hyaluronic Acid . I use the serum at night and the morning. It has been great with the moisturizing, I feels light, and my lines/wrinkles have truly diminished. Especially the lines above my lips. I will definitely buy this product again, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid  is amazing and so affordable, I wish I had discovered it last month. I noticed an immediate overnight change in the texture of my skin, it was smoother, my pores were smaller.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Feb 21, 2015  I have been using YALMEH Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin since Jan 1, 2015 and I am truly amazed at the difference this has made on all my deep lines between my forehead and pores.  They are very faint now and not as noticeable.  A friend that I have not seen in a few weeks just comment on how good my face looks and she does not know that I am using anything new.  I just ordered another one.  I am a forever client.  Great product and company!!!    Jan 1, 2015:  YALMEH is an amazing company, I read reviews saying the same thing which is one of the reasons that I choose this company and their products.  After I ordered the company sent me an e-mail thanking me for the order and letting me know that they have a 100% guarantee and welcomed me to call them with any questions at all.  To me that is really a wonderful way to do business.  I do not see this type of service anymore.  Before the products arrived they sent me another e-mail with instructions as to how to use it and what to expect.  I am extremely happy with the company and customer service business practices.    I started a daily routine using YALMEH Super Youth Eye CreamTM and YALMEH Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin since January 1, 2015.  The very first day that I used YALMEH Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin I saw a dramatic improvement in the lines between my eyebrows.  I do not have anything to say about the eye crème yet.  I will update this review after using both products a bit longer.    I am extremely satisfied with the customer support and I am looking forward to seeing more skin improvements in the coming months.</li>
            <li> Have been slowly switching to all of the product because it&#x27;s a great brand at an awesome price!</li>
            <li> Ordered came quickly.  I cannot speak to the effectiveness of the product since I am not using it to treat wrinkles.  The ingredients seem promising.</li>
            <li> Am using the product and loving it so far.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again when finished with this bottle. The company is very supportive with its customers. I would recommend it&lt;br /&gt;To family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a month ago seeing those positive reviews and i have been applying since then. I dont see any improvement on my skin. I have been optimistic and applying it everyday, but i see no results. I didnt like it at all and i thought it is really waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the seller service, i would give them 5 stars. But not for this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I can see some improvement, however, when you&#x27;re 65+ things take a bit longer.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid is a must have!!! I have been using it for a week with the Yalmeh Vitamin C &amp; Eye Cream with aloe vera as a full night time only regimen and I have to be totally honest.  It&#x27;s absolutely amazing on my ethnic skin.  I wake up and my skin looks like it was injected with moisture overnight.  My skin looks forever young.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, but so far so good! I have very sensitive skin and have not had any adverse reactions. I&#x27;ve been using it every morning and evening after washing with a mild cleanser. It seems to tighten the skin and fill in wrinkles temporarily. I&#x27;ll post an update if I begin to see any lasting effects!</li>
            <li> serum is wonderful, especially now when we have winter and dry air</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now, along with my Yalmeh Aloe Moisturizer. I can tell a tremendous improvement in the fine lines I had between my brows and around my lips. Very impressed with the Yalmeh products. Highly recommended and will return to order more.</li>
            <li> Greatest customer service ever. They email you, check up on you, give you advice on how to use the product to get maximum results. On top of that, it really works. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of serum from Nature&#x27;s advantage to &amp;#34;you name it&amp;#34;. None of them worked for me. So when I found this of course I was skeptical. I read the reviews and thought it&#x27;s not that expensive compared to the prices I normally pay for serums so lets give it a try. I was not disappointed. Let me say, what works for me, might not work for you, but you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try. My face did not dry out at all and it made my skin softer and smooth. Youthfulness is not hard not define anymore</li>
            <li> I did purchase this for the reviews. But I do not find it to be any different then anything else I have tried. No miracle in a bottle here.</li>
            <li> After trying other skin creams I find Yalmeh to be the most beneficial and satisfying.  I have been using it for several months now and continue to see a reduction of deeper wrinkles and an increased firmness.  It also seems to improve puffiness under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a week. Absorbs beautifully into skin with no greasy feel. Pairs well with a light moisturizer. Skin is definitely smoother.</li>
            <li> Overall normal Hyaluronic acid, but good customer service</li>
            <li> Product Seems To Work Well. I Have Only Used It For A Couple Of Weeks So I Haven&#x27;T Noticed A Big Change Yet But I Am Hoping I Will Over Time.</li>
            <li> It is nice, but not as wonderful as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> some results not what i expected  hope is it will show some results so far none , but still using it</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a week and already have been complemented on my appearance. I recommend mixed a drop with water before applying - that seems to work best.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks and I can see a considerable change in my skin.  I am 56 years old and was a sun worshiper, needless to say I have a lot of sun damage.  This serum has lightened my skin and it makes it so soft to the touch.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Great serum. Noticed a definite difference after 2 weeks. Lines around eyes especially reduced. Used with water as directed for few days and then neat. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Used it overnite and saw immediate results. Awesome stuff.  Tried it in my wet hair after shampoo and it works like a thickener too!</li>
            <li> Hi thank you for checking on me but to be honest Im not seeing much improvement yet Im not sure i like the product Im going to finish whats left in the bottle and see what happens but I dont think I will purchase it again Im sorry Sharon</li>
            <li> I usually apply Peter Thomas Roth pm retinol but have been using this and I love it. It smells like something in the Aveda product line (woodsy/natural) and it feels so nice to apply - the directions suggest using wet fingertips but I apply a hydrating toner prior to application. Love, love, love Yalmeh.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of expensive products that didn&#x27;t live up to their claims. So, I am very happy with this Yalmeh product. It was very reasonably priced and I see a noticeable improvement in fine lines and wrinkles after just over a week of use. Highly recommend you give it a try!</li>
            <li> Thank you for following through with addition info on your product.  I shall use a little water which I was not doing.  Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vicci</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot! I liked it fine when I started using it, then got an email from the company telling me a trick to do with it (have water on your face and fingers as you apply it) and it made a big difference! And I love using it with the aloe moisturizer at night. My skin feels so good! I love these products and will continue to purchase them! Super satisfaction with the company and speed of shipment as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! Never greasy, goes on smooth and works instantly. I put it on at night and wake up to silky smooth skin on my face. No issues with breakouts or excessive oil production either. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I noticed an improvement in my skin within the first week.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I  love this Hyaluronic Acid Serum! It makes my face feel so soft and that makes me feel more beautiful! It is pure delightful youth in a bottle!</li>
            <li> its, ok, but no discernible difference</li>
            <li> I only give a 4 because I have not had it long to see results.  But my skin feels amazing!!! I recommend! !</li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply and does not interfere with make-up application or other facial products. Since I started using this product I have seen a more even complexion on my face and it has decreased the appearance of blemishes on my face. Overall, it has been a great product.</li>
            <li> Love it! at first I was not so sure, then I received an email telling me tips on how to use it. Its water activated so I spritz my face first then apply and it feels great. Definately improving the area around my eyes, at least when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
