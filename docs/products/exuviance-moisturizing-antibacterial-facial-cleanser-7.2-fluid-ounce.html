    <ol>
            <li>This wash works wonderful.</li>
            <li>(Thank goodness they have  a good return policy!)</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>I found this on my own and it is the best cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love it wonderful products</li>
            <li>Also, the product stated that it was good for people with oily/acne prone skin, which I have combination skin and acne as well.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I use the a light covering of Exuviance foundation (no brush required, it says use fingers to apply - time saver) with Pur powder foundation on top which covers wonderfully.</li>
            <li>My skin is so amazing</li>
            <li>Triclosan is used in antibacterial products like soaps and sanitizers and toothpastes because it is an effective bacteride.</li>
            <li>I read that many people had good results with this cleanser</li>
            <li>find the cleanser to be effective, albeit</li>
            <li>I ordered and it was delivered quickly and in great condition.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and didn&#x27;t cause more breakouts or any rashes.</li>
            <li>You need something stronger if your acne is more on the severe side.</li>
            <li>I have had acne off and on for most of my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this combined procedure many times without issues.</li>
            <li>Most of them were either</li>
            <li>love love love</li>
            <li>skin is better than it ever has been.</li>
            <li>I love their makeup</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I would be sure to avoid contact with mouth, and eyes.</li>
            <li>have tried many of the recommendations of the sales people at Ulta, may of which did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I mostly buy this now from Amazon, since they have better pricing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after researching that it was very good for your skin, especially if you had acne.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin, or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a gentle cleanser that does not break you out, this may be a good option for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a huge range of over-the-counter acne products from drugstore brands to spa brands.  </li>
            <li>But there has been a real improvement that I think is honestly attributable to this cleanser; I haven&#x27;t changed anything else about my skincare routine, diet, habits, etc.    </li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and a gel consistency.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>If you have acne prone skin that needs a gentle touch, I honestly think this cleanser is worth a try.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely going to buy more when my bottle runs out.  </li>
            <li>I feel so strongly about this that I&#x27;m writing what I think is my first review on Amazon ever.    </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and just as described.  </li>
            <li>Great everyday wash to prevent acne</li>
            <li>For me, it was totally worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I was using Proactiv for years with ok results, but as I have gotten older, it was really drying out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works well but is really nothing special in my book.</li>
            <li>it helps keep my skin clear and is very mild.</li>
            <li>I went in to have a microderm and glycolic peel at my favorite local salon.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This product was able to achieve what oral and topical prescription medication and fad subscription systems could not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different cleansers and I&#x27;m sticking with this one.</li>
            <li>Especially if you break out a lot, this product works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented and has no colorants, so if you have sensitive skin with mild acne, this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>My pores feel so clean and soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>A sales associate at Ulta talked me into buying this after Murad&#x27;s gentle acne gel didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>It really hasn&#x27;t done anything for my acne.</li>
            <li>I find that I have to add it with Philosophy&#x27;s Purity in order to really get all my skin and eye makeup</li>
            <li>This really works for me.  </li>
            <li>For real.  </li>
            <li>(2) so gentle that it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>and it really helps me avoid brake outs.</li>
            <li>and this proved a real problem for me.</li>
            <li>Not too much moisture, tho.</li>
            <li>This has worked well beyond what I was expecting and has really stopped the breakouts and all the darkspots and scaring</li>
            <li>and there is an actual significant reduction in my breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It does not have an overpowering smell like many of the other cleansers</li>
            <li>For the first time since I was a teenager, my skin is once again clear.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>Exuviance&#x27;s cleanser is gentle enough not to irritate my skin but strong enough to combat the oilyness and acne.  </li>
            <li>A week later, that one blemish had turned into 5 and two to three weeks after that, had completely taken over my entire forehead with more pustules than I could count (thank goodness for bangs).</li>
            <li>am 26 and my skin is oily in the T zone and normal on the rest.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is normal, the redness has vanished, my oiliness reduced.</li>
            <li>[...] At the end of the day, this product is only good for people with little to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>Also, it made the oily parts of my skin more oily than usual, which irritated me.</li>
            <li>skin is perfect now, I urge you to give it a try because it made what I felt was impossible for me possible.</li>
            <li>then kinda clear.</li>
            <li>It is the only product that I&#x27;ve found that actually removes all of my make up and makes my cystic acne prone skin calm down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and suffering from adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Sometimes it gets in my mouth when I wash my face, and it does taste a little funny.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m black, in my early twenties with combination and sensitive skin)</li>

            <li> My acne scars are disappearing (I have only been using a few weeks), my wrinkles have reduced, my spots are practically none existent and when I do get one, I just put a little of the Excuviance Purifying Clay Mask on it and it clears right up over night.</li>

            <li> I have cystic acne at the jawline/cheeks (a recent development) and small whiteheads/clogged pores generally (since I was a teen).  </li>

            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused any major eye irritation for me, but it does sting a little.</li>
            <li> I later did some research on Triclosan, the listed active ingredient for this product.</li>
            <li> Wash face with exuviance moisturizing antibacterial face wash (I thought that it seemed less harsh than what I had tried previously and wouldn&#x27;t work at first, this was not the case)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and it does not dry out my skin or make it feel tight.</li>
            <li> I am 31 and recently started experiencing a lot of breakouts and oily skin which has resulted in scaring and some dark spots.</li>
            <li> (I use it twice a day -- sometimes with my hands, sometimes with the clarisonic -- and I have roughly half a bottle left after four weeks.)      </li>
            <li> (1) so harsh that the surface of my skin dried out and sometimes even started flaking/peeling (gross)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin that has just gotten worse with age.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has very no real strong scent.</li>
            <li> but this cleanser is not great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As a mid 30-something who still suffers from adult acne, this stuff is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little drying</li>
            <li> I know it is a little pricy</li>

            <li> My acne had been well managed for the past year and a half.</li>
            <li> helps fight my type of acne without causing excessive drying or any other negative side effects.    </li>

            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve tried proactiv, antibiotics, prescription ointments, and accutane.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 4 years and out of everything I&#x27;ve used (including Rx)</li>
            <li> At almost 40, I&#x27;d never had such a bad breakout in all my life.</li>
            <li> I am very annoyed that I wasted close to $30 on this product</li>
            <li> I have acne scars, my skin tone is so uneven and red that I cannot go without makeup as it looks awful</li>
            <li> and then just broke out worse or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a few things about this being bad for the environment and possibly bad for humans, but I&#x27;m not sure I want to give it up yet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still have acne.  </li>
            <li> Boy, how wrong I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expensive, has ingredients that are questionable, and burned my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as describe</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after researching that it was very good for your skin, especially if you had acne. Also, the product stated that it was good for people with oily/acne prone skin, which I have combination skin and acne as well. This did not help with my acne AT ALL!! Also, it made the oily parts of my skin more oily than usual, which irritated me. I later did some research on Triclosan, the listed active ingredient for this product. Triclosan is suspected of being a cause for cancer in humans(but then again everything is these days), however the side effects are lasting. Triclosan is used in antibacterial products like soaps and sanitizers and toothpastes because it is an effective bacteride. Here&#x27;s the article I read. [...] At the end of the day, this product is only good for people with little to moderate acne. You need something stronger if your acne is more on the severe side. I am very annoyed that I wasted close to $30 on this product</li>
            <li> A sales associate at Ulta talked me into buying this after Murad&#x27;s gentle acne gel didn&#x27;t help. It really hasn&#x27;t done anything for my acne. I have been using it for 2-3 months and my skin has gone through its usual cycles of breakouts and then kinda clear. I recently started leaving it on for 10 mins in the morning and sometimes at night to see if that would help. So far it hasn&#x27;t. (I&#x27;m black, in my early twenties with combination and sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for the last 10 years and I feel like I can&#x27;t take a shower without it.  My pores feel so clean and soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> Does what it’s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I have had acne off and on for most of my life. My acne had been well managed for the past year and a half. I went in to have a microderm and glycolic peel at my favorite local salon. I&#x27;ve had this combined procedure many times without issues. This time I had one blemish on my forehead that was scraped during the microderm. A week later, that one blemish had turned into 5 and two to three weeks after that, had completely taken over my entire forehead with more pustules than I could count (thank goodness for bangs). At almost 40, I&#x27;d never had such a bad breakout in all my life. My doc gave me oral antibiotics which did nothing but give me a yeast infection. My doc then advised that I should take Accutane (for the 2nd time in my life). I declined. I read that many people had good results with this cleanser so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the cleanser to be effective, albeit it is no miracle worker. I do not find that it breaks me out, which is a plus. But I did not notice a drastic improvement in my acne after I added it to my skin care regime. I find that I have to add it with Philosophy&#x27;s Purity in order to really get all my skin and eye makeup removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I will order this product again. It works well but is really nothing special in my book. But if you are looking for a gentle cleanser that does not break you out, this may be a good option for you.</li>
            <li> This really works for me.  I think skin is personal and what works for one person may not work for another... but I have to say that no one product has ever worked for me in a definite and noticeable way before this cleanser.  For real.  I feel so strongly about this that I&#x27;m writing what I think is my first review on Amazon ever.    I&#x27;ve had \\&quot;problem\\&quot; skin since I was a teenager, I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and suffering from adult acne.  I have cystic acne at the jawline/cheeks (a recent development) and small whiteheads/clogged pores generally (since I was a teen).  I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser (suggested to me by a skincare aesthetician) for about a month now and there is an actual significant reduction in my breakouts.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still have acne.  But there has been a real improvement that I think is honestly attributable to this cleanser; I haven&#x27;t changed anything else about my skincare routine, diet, habits, etc.    In the past, I&#x27;ve tried proactiv, antibiotics, prescription ointments, and accutane.  I&#x27;ve tried a huge range of over-the-counter acne products from drugstore brands to spa brands.  Most of them were either (1) so harsh that the surface of my skin dried out and sometimes even started flaking/peeling (gross) and then just broke out worse or (2) so gentle that it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all.  I feel like this antibacterial cleanser actually cleans my face, helps fight my type of acne without causing excessive drying or any other negative side effects.    I don&#x27;t know how long this is going to continue to work for me, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll work on all types of acne and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll work for you.  I do think that it definitely improved my skin in a way that I have never seen any other cleanser do.  For me, it was totally worth every penny.  I am absolutely going to buy more when my bottle runs out.  (I use it twice a day -- sometimes with my hands, sometimes with the clarisonic -- and I have roughly half a bottle left after four weeks.)      If you have acne prone skin that needs a gentle touch, I honestly think this cleanser is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product</li>
            <li> As a mid 30-something who still suffers from adult acne, this stuff is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried all the celebrity hyped commercial systems to no avail. This product was able to achieve what oral and topical prescription medication and fad subscription systems could not. For the first time since I was a teenager, my skin is once again clear.</li>
            <li> Love it wonderful products</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and acne prone skin. This wash works wonderful. I highly recommend trying this product. I&#x27;ve tried so many different cleansers and I&#x27;m sticking with this one. Especially if you break out a lot, this product works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and just as described.  When I moved from the midwest to the south my skin went haywire. I was getting pimples and dry irritated patches at the same time so I needed to overhaul my products.  Exuviance&#x27;s cleanser is gentle enough not to irritate my skin but strong enough to combat the oilyness and acne.  It is fragrance free and a gel consistency. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great everyday wash to prevent acne</li>
            <li> My oldest granddaughters favorite/</li>
            <li> Works like a charm every time. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 4 years and out of everything I&#x27;ve used (including Rx) this is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s a little drying but I use the Exuviance foundation and it heals the pealing and moisturizes. love love love</li>
            <li> I like this face soap. it helps keep my skin clear and is very mild.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I suffered with cystic acne for several years. Once I started using the Exuviance line my face cleared up!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and it really helps me avoid brake outs. I ordered and it was delivered quickly and in great condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but worth every penny.  This product is not nearly as drying as the antibacterial OTC product I&#x27;d been using.  It&#x27;s unscented and has no colorants, so if you have sensitive skin with mild acne, this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part the introductory set for acne prone skin. I thought that it would jkust be another face wash that doesn&#x27;t fix anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 26 and my skin is oily in the T zone and normal on the rest. I have acne scars, my skin tone is so uneven and red that I cannot go without makeup as it looks awful and I am prone to zits no matter what I do. I feel like a teenager exept now I get the joys of dealing with wrinkles too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a consultant suggested this whilst I was shopping for foundation, I scoffed. I thought it was too high priced and was going to be a waste of money. Boy, how wrong I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is better than it ever has been. My skin tone is normal, the redness has vanished, my oiliness reduced. My acne scars are disappearing (I have only been using a few weeks), my wrinkles have reduced, my spots are practically none existent and when I do get one, I just put a little of the Excuviance Purifying Clay Mask on it and it clears right up over night. My skin is so amazing, I can actually go out without make up, a feet that I never thought possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine goes like this:&lt;br /&gt;Morning:&lt;br /&gt;- Wash face with exuviance moisturizing antibacterial face wash (I thought that it seemed less harsh than what I had tried previously and wouldn&#x27;t work at first, this was not the case)&lt;br /&gt;- Rub on sheer refining fluid&lt;br /&gt;- If I want make up I use the a light covering of Exuviance foundation (no brush required, it says use fingers to apply - time saver) with Pur powder foundation on top which covers wonderfully. I do use a Pur primer as I prefer it to the Excuviance Matt but that is just personal preference. My make up stays on all day with no oil or cakiness like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening:&lt;br /&gt;- Wash face with exuviance moisturizing antibacterial face wash (gets all my make up off with such ease)&lt;br /&gt;- Rub on Excuviance Night Renewal Gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The once a week I use the Purifying Clay Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is perfect now, I urge you to give it a try because it made what I felt was impossible for me possible.</li>
            <li> Expensive, has ingredients that are questionable, and burned my skin. I have extremely sensitive skin and this proved a real problem for me. It also did nothing for my acne. I love their makeup but this cleanser is not great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve heard a few things about this being bad for the environment and possibly bad for humans, but I&#x27;m not sure I want to give it up yet. It is the only product that I&#x27;ve found that actually removes all of my make up and makes my cystic acne prone skin calm down.&lt;br /&gt;It has very no real strong scent. It removes makeup without a lot of rubbing involved. It is a gel but it foams in the water. Sometimes it gets in my mouth when I wash my face, and it does taste a little funny. I would be sure to avoid contact with mouth, and eyes. It hasn&#x27;t caused any major eye irritation for me, but it does sting a little.</li>
            <li> Removes makeup well!  Not too much moisture, tho.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my clarisonic skin brush.  I have some enlarged pores and a few breakouts off and on in my T zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well with my clarisonic and cleans the T zone throughly without drying out my skin overall. Nice scent and didn&#x27;t cause more breakouts or any rashes.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin, or acne-prone skin. I use this with my Clarisonic but the product can be applied as described.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin that has just gotten worse with age.  I was using Proactiv for years with ok results, but as I have gotten older, it was really drying out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many of the recommendations of the sales people at Ulta, may of which did not work for me. (Thank goodness they have  a good return policy!) I found this on my own and it is the best cleanser I have ever used. I have been using this product for three years. I use it twice a day and it does not dry out my skin or make it feel tight. It does not have an overpowering smell like many of the other cleansers have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any product, it may work well for some and not for others. I mostly buy this now from Amazon, since they have better pricing.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. I am 31 and recently started experiencing a lot of breakouts and oily skin which has resulted in scaring and some dark spots. I bought this as an introductory kit. I used this to wash my face and the sheer refining fluid in the morning and the Night Renewal Hydragel in the evening (also came with a clay mask that I use once every one to two weeks).  This has worked well beyond what I was expecting and has really stopped the breakouts and all the darkspots and scaring are all disappearing. I know it is a little pricy but it works and I can&#x27;t put a price on the way I now feel about my skin.</li>
