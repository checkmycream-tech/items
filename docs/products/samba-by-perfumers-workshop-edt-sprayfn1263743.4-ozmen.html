    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I buy this cologne as a birthday gift every year  for my brother and he loves it!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this cologne and he loves it. I also love the smell of it to !</li>
            <li> Samba has been my choice of cologne since receiving as a gift 25 years ago.  My sons have started using more so I got them their own bottles.  Clean scent, not overpowering, long lasting.</li>
            <li> I used this perfume about 15 years ago and smells attractive so I could not forget the way it smelled. However, I could not find it at local stores for years but  accidentally,one day I found it online (Amazon)so I deccided to buy two bottles in order to save money on shipping backhome (Saudi Arabai).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my perfume last night and tried it on and it smells ugly and I could not stand the smell. I could not believe this the perfume I used to wear years ago. I think the perfume is expired or stored in hot enivronment storage. In fact it is not a perfume at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will get rid of them by burying them somewhere in the desert so nobody gets sick lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is becareful to buy this perfume online. I believe they are not producing this perfume anymore and all these ones online are storage for long time so you are not sure you will get the good ones.</li>
            <li> unbelievable smell. Love it, Love it. Many years using it and i keep getting great compliments. and it was delivered fast. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This perfume is really good... I love I recommend that perfume that price really good so I buy more love.. Thanks</li>
            <li> I used to love this scent when I was in my early 20s and then it became almost impossible to find at any retail store. I was super happy to find it here and glad I have one bottle now that will last me a good time. One of my favorites with a mix of citrus and spices - uplifting scent. Greatly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband, it smells great and he loves it! It shipped really fast as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle with one more on the way to arrive today. This is a really good cologne to add to your collection</li>
            <li> This is the cologne I wore in high school (15+ years ago). It has a clean, sweet smell and will last all night. I promise. I don&#x27;t know why this scent never really caught on, but every time I wore it out somewhere, the girls would inevitably ask what it was. It&#x27;s very distinctive - in a good way!</li>
            <li> The price was excellent and the products are good</li>
            <li> Decent colonge, inexpensive</li>
            <li> I remember this from when my mom had it when I was just a lil kid. I had to have it and I&#x27;m really happy I found it. It came right on time and smells as great as it did when I first smelled this aeromatic fragrance</li>
            <li> Samba By Perfumers Workshop For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces is one of my favorite men cologne for all occasions.</li>
            <li> Love the fragance.... I just wish was more lasting.. Thats the only reason i don&#x27;t give it a five star, but i love this colongne... And love the price also....</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t go wrong with this one right here. Been wearing this for years. It&#x27;s basically the swiss army knife of my cologne selection. Perfect for any season and weather. Perfect for any occasion; formal, informal, and casual. Also with this one you don&#x27;t have to worry about over-applying. You can put it all over your upper, and it might come off strong for the first 5 min, but it&#x27;ll wear down to a light aura that you can be confident in. Also, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to be too common in the states; unlike cool water, curve, aspen, burberry, jovan, hollister, hummer, calvin klein, etc. So you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like someone&#x27;s ex. For whatever reason this fragrance was popular in Puerto Rico from what I could tell, but I&#x27;m no expert on trends and all that. I just know the smell of a decent cologne and when it&#x27;s appropriate. So if you&#x27;re like me; style is young and fresh 365 days out of the year, your game is natural, and your personality stands out more than your appearance; then this cologne is right up your alley.</li>
            <li> The same perfume that he buys 20 years ago</li>
            <li> Thank you very much  shipping speed the quality of the product</li>
            <li> Its amazing love the smell n last for a long time anyone who buys this cologne will be satisfied promise</li>
            <li> With cologne, you either like it or you don&#x27;t.  I like this fragrance.  But, the next guy maybe not.  It&#x27;s very subjective.</li>
            <li> I also bought the aftershave.  This is a great colongne that I can only find on Amazon or in local mall...much more expensive there though.  Definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> I used it in the 80s and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this Samba online for my boyfriend. It smells wonderful on him. Not overpowering and very sexy with his chemistry. I am going to order a few more bottles to have on hand.</li>
            <li> This is a cologne that is light and sweat but, not overpowering, Good for everyday. It is hard to find in departement stores,except occaisonaly in discount outlets. Not expensive but ,does not last as long as some more expensive colognes.</li>
            <li> Its great , If this is the only way that I can purchase Samba then I will . I have love this cologne for year , and you can not find it in any store .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff ever since I was about 11 years old. This is one of my signature scents that I where.</li>
