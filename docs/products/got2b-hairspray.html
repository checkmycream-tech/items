            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>I find this hairspray great for setting the curl while taming frizziness.</li>
            <li>It hold my hair style perfectly even in very strong wind.</li>
            <li>This is a good hairspray and a great buy if you want to freeze your style in place.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes i like to have a great hair day and go a good 3 days with it before a wash, with this stuff</li>
            <li>It works good with thinner hair, which is what I have.</li>
            <li>Good price though.</li>
            <li>and the price is a good deal.</li>
            <li>I have longhair style and before using this product, I&#x27;ve been searching on the market to find a hairspray that could hold my hair in shape when I&#x27;m outdoor, but nothing work good as this one.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything and mine came with 20% more wich is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>Very lovely, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I was still able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Use this with a blow dryer and watch the magic happen!</li>
            <li>A lot comes in the can too and love the way its shaped like an air horn. !</li>
            <li>The hold is amazing and literally lasts until your decide to wash your hair.</li>
            <li>For the price it can&#x27;t be beat, forget salon quality because this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t have nice scrunchy hair without it.</li>
            <li>GREAT ,CHEAP , AND EASY!</li>
            <li>Both live up to their claims and are excellent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been to saunas that are super hot, and amazingly it holds my hair perfectly in place.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is the most indestructible hairspray on the market.  </li>
            <li>Thirdly, I love how the spray sets my hair in place.</li>
            <li>This is one of my all-time favorite beauty products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My friends son recommended it, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing is better than this product at the moment.</li>
            <li>I use it to hold in place most of my spikes when I style my wigs.</li>
            <li>SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER AND MORE CONVENIENT TO ORDER IT ONLINE.  </li>
            <li>It all depends on where I&#x27;m at in the cycle of my latest haircut.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but it sure does hold hair in place</li>
            <li>this is truly the ONLY product that works flawlessly on mohawks or any vertical style you can dream of.&lt;br</li>
            <li>takes me about 10 minutes to achieve an awe inspiring head of hair.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it in abundance on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>and though it keeps my hair looking shiny and healthy, the hold still isnt what this puppy can do.  </li>
            <li>3.5 is more like it.</li>
            <li>Considering I&#x27;m not paying top dollar for this hairspray...</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t look like it has a ton of gel or hairspray in it, even though I used(what</li>
            <li>us to much or show it was clogged (experienced).</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>My hair even gets shiny when I use this too and my color pops out more.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much to get really strong hold and great</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best hairspray on the market and Amazon does a great job delivering this item.  </li>
            <li>but in reality this is one great spray even if you like your hair to move and look natural.</li>
            <li>and i am good for the whole day.</li>
            <li>thank you guys for good and fast service.</li>
            <li>It does brush out easily tho.</li>
            <li>This sprays on and is easy to use and is easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the spray nozzle clogs easily and often.  </li>
            <li>Got2b glued is really strong</li>
            <li>i got this because i needed something strong to hold up my hair for a mohawk</li>
            <li>This hair spray is so strong.</li>
            <li>Incredibly strong hold.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;oww, u hit me with ur hair\\&quot; strong</li>
            <li>This stuff is also great to mold and style with, and I use it to tame flyaways fairly often.</li>
            <li>I have no use for this anymore because Gatsby wax does fine for me</li>
            <li>Fabulous hair spray.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the price ($6) at my local Fred Meyer.  </li>
            <li>This will hold my piece securely for 2 or 3 days and it&#x27;s water-soluble so you can slide it off when you shower.</li>
            <li>I imagine this works great for spikes or mohawks or similar styles</li>
            <li>overall good product:)</li>
            <li>Unlike the other Got2be hairsprays, this one doesn&#x27;t contain water, which is a very good thing.  </li>
            <li>But then one day, while scouring around looking for a product to tame my Lion&#x27;s mane, I came across this wonderful fella.</li>
            <li>and cheap and lasts a long time, but great quality also.</li>
            <li>I once spiked my bangs up and applied this and was able to play a two hour sweaty tennis match and my hair stayed exactly in tacked without any differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just expect to clean the nozzle in between uses.</li>
            <li>The only limitations of this spray is that the smell isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant</li>
            <li>I have bought this more than four times in my current 16 year long streak of having the best hair in the world.</li>
            <li>It has a strong hold, but combs right out.  </li>
            <li>It will literally hold up to pretty much any kind of stress test.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give it that &#x27;too much spray matted look&#x27; that most hairsprays give.</li>
            <li>This hairspray is just as good for holding a solid shape that won&#x27;t budge in a tornado.</li>
            <li>Well this hairspray is my evidence that this is true.  </li>
            <li>If you want softer hold, try Tresemme&#x27;s new runway collection Perfectly Undone hairspray, which give flexible, touchable hold even in high humidity or Nexxus Comb Thru, which gives brushable, soft hold that also works in any weather.  </li>
            <li>Some of the best for getting a great spike look for other wise impossible to style looks.</li>
            <li>other than showering afterwards it is a GREAT product.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is nice for spraying your ponytail into place; I expected something more than that.</li>
            <li>and I read in a magazine that Schwartzkopf (a different line by the same dude) hairspray was the very best, according to the hairdresser interviewed in InStyle.  </li>
            <li>I do particularly like how strong it is as it can be very useful and convenient.</li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t give me a greasy/wet or dryed out look, my hair just looks normal.</li>
            <li>i am more than happy with buying it and thus this is the second time i am purchasing it from the same supplier.</li>
            <li>this stuff works so good and lost a long time</li>
            <li>it freezes curls and hair in place and is the cheerleaders choice of hairspray even in hot conditions!</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;This hair gel is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I am sensitive to many fragrant products, and this leaves no odor in my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Your own personal experience will depend on what you&#x27;re trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s worth a shot though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite hairspray, Pravana, runs about $18-$25 a can, but as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>no doubt got more than my moneys worth, I marked the bottom where I got it from</li>
            <li>My daughter is going to help me get it right.  </li>
            <li>and then right before I head out of the house</li>
            <li>but it adds a nice crisp hold that stays even longer on your hair when you use the glue from the same company.</li>
            <li>Warm water will clean it out, but cleaning it every other day seems excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I typically wear some kind of beach wave or light curl at the ends.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s SO economical.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly crunchy when you touch it, but it&#x27;s able to move a bit in the wind and such without losing shape and still looks like clean hair.</li>
            <li>I have soft, fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to avoid spraying it downwards towards the scalp as the high alcohol content can be irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>The bull-horn like nozzle is funny.</li>
            <li>but I soon adjusted to it after the first week.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need a MASSIVE hold, just hold the can away from a greater distance for a mist of spray.</li>
            <li>I first bought it when my teenage son needed products for all those goofy hair styles that kids that age wear.  </li>
            <li>I love this spray for numerous reasons.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Big and Sexy hairspray</li>
            <li>The manufacturer told me that many guys were using Got2be glued spiking cream mixed in the palm with a blast of Freeze spray.</li>
            <li>I first tried two or three shampoos to wash out the glue of the spray.  </li>
            <li>I EVER ORDERED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using this thing for the next couple of months for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this and definitely will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to clean the nozzle before spraying (a quick flick with the fingernail is usually enough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However it certainly does its job.</li>
            <li>Since I have to use a large amount for my hair sometimes the smell of the spray gets in my nose</li>
            <li>I have a ton of kinky-curly, thick hair that I love to style, especially in HUGE ways - faux hawks, pompadours, or just generally making it as big as I can for a pom-pom type of look.</li>
            <li>It is the only hairspray that keeps my fine hair (lots of it) in style without looking like a helmet head.  </li>
            <li>I have really really fine hair that is cut short.  </li>
            <li>No other type of gel I&#x27;ve used can own up to what this stuff does - and I also use the hairspray by this same brand, which I also HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>so when you use for something you absolutely HAVE to shower after and use A LOT of shampoo.</li>
            <li>and it stayed REALLY well</li>
            <li>Help from anyone who knows will be much appreciated and USED.  </li>
            <li>You will be charged and ready.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really expect people to be running their fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is medium thickness with a shoulder length smooth style and short bangs.  </li>
            <li>This is a very affordable hairspray.  </li>
            <li>By itself, the product doesn&#x27;t serve much purpose for guys.</li>
            <li>it really holds.</li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair in place and spiked for hours, even a whole day</li>
            <li>Ok, this stuff really holds to the point of not funny.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product for hard to hold styles ;).</li>
            <li>This spray doesn&#x27;t flake and it holds better than any other gel or mousse</li>
            <li>and WOW does this stuff really do it!</li>
            <li>For me, I use it by spraying my roots [after teasing] and it keeps your teased hair full and big ALL DAY!</li>
            <li>i just do a quick 2 second spray</li>
            <li>Has a decent smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does make your hair stiff if you use too much, but I go more for how it looks than how it feels when I go out.</li>
            <li>I backcomb the hell out of my hair and do it up mile high with just a bit of this stuff.</li>
            <li>The girls have to wear a high ponytail, with a front poof, and this keeps the style in place while they are tumbling.  </li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but once I recieved it, I was surprised how large it was and</li>
            <li>application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray function, while useful, is quirky: the nozzle clogs easily, and a cursory scrape of the nozzle mouth is often necessary to ensure a solid spray, and the spray sets exceedingly fast-so fast</li>
            <li>curly hair, which used to take upwards of an hour on good days to tame into a mohawk (with a less than a 5% success rate...</li>
            <li>I want a hair product that will cast my hair in concrete while still being water soluble.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is - you have to clean the nozzle hole often because it easily clogs from dried hairspray.</li>
            <li>So far I really like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>sure to chip the dried up spray from the nozzle between uses so that you don&#x27;t accidentally spray it in your eye though.</li>
            <li>now my mohawk is simply gravity defying, perfectly fanned, and without the white residue some gels leave behind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the heavy duty so -called sprrays ..and NONE live up to the rep that GOT 2B GLUED</li>
            <li>As a child of the 80&#x27;s where perms, 2 &amp; 3 inch high bangs and Aqua Net ruled the day,  I have to say I expected more from a product that describes itself as \\&quot;screaming hold for hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even the new Elnett from l&#x27;oreal</li>
            <li>After having very limited success, I went to the hairdresser who spent an hour trying degreaser, dawn dish liquid, strong shampoos, corn starch and so on.  </li>
            <li>final result, when applied properly, is a light to moderate hold that may or may not survive a brisk wind walking from the car to the office.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a female and I&#x27;ve got super thick hair cut into a pixie(the top</li>
            <li>omg I bow down to this product my cosplays would be nothing without this product, it has amazing hold for all the spikes I have to do and it stays up for a long time&lt;br /&gt;two</li>
            <li>has so far!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a five second fix under hot water.  </li>
            <li>I usually have a bottle for 3 or more months</li>
            <li>Unless I have this spray in it - I can literally flip my head upside down, spray, and my hair will stay sticking straight up even after I stand back up, yet it&#x27;s easy to work with.</li>
            <li>With most other hairsprays, my hair still falls flat if I get in the wind.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many &#x27;extra-hold&#x27; and &#x27;super-hold&#x27; - &#x27;maxium hold&#x27; - &#x27;extreme-hold&#x27; and &#x27;ultimate-hold&#x27; hairspray that are all the same: they suck and fall down.</li>
            <li>The company should know better - a hard hold spray is thick and drys very hard, so they need a good spray head design and a cap, so it doesn&#x27;t clog so easily.</li>
            <li>You use it like you would any other hairspray if that&#x27;s all your after, but I recommend getting your look totally perfectly in place, and i mean every hair, because when you coat your head down with this stuff there&#x27;s no moving it around after.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something much smaller when it came in, but wow the product really does work.</li>
            <li>If you want flowing, natural hair then this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Will not do to much for a guy tho, unless you have a spiker to go with it such as Got2b Glued Spiking glue or Ice Spiker.</li>
            <li>Then, I called a professional hairdresser for advice and tried baking soda and cleansing shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The company changed the spray head design and the darn thing clogs soooo frequently, the spray pattern is all messed up.  </li>
            <li>This means you have double the product in your hair, which doesn&#x27;t really feel all that clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need a product I can depend on.18-$25 a can, but as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if the nozzle didn&#x27;t get clogged frequently.</li>
            <li>I am a 17 year old girl</li>
            <li>I want my hair to be soft and touchable, but without frizziness or heaviness....</li>
            <li>Nothing so far comes close.</li>
            <li>I took the chance that the same dude would not make two separate and distinct product lines but would instead simply repackage the one.  </li>
            <li>It literally holds your hair exactly in place where you want it and lasts all day long!</li>
            <li>I used to love this hairspray but NO MORE!  </li>
            <li>BUT the one big bugger is that inevitably, the nozzle spray gets clogged even after running hot water on it.</li>
            <li>Then I spray my whole head and if the hold is a little too stiff, run a wide toothed comb through it and you&#x27;ll have great hold and enough movement to not look plastered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone its low price as well!</li>
            <li>only complaint is that sometimes the nozzle gets clogged, so just make sure you run it under some water.</li>
            <li>The trade-off for the strong hold is that it can feel pretty uncomfortable if you do not wash it out.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use it for 3 inch high bangs, those days are long gone, but I did want something that would keep my hair in place throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a spray like Joico \\&quot;ICE\\&quot; spray that they&#x27;ve apparently discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I frequently get overspray on my phone screen, and it only washes off with water.</li>
            <li>spent so much money on products that just dont work.</li>
            <li>my first reaction was that this would be the same as every other flimsy spray product.</li>
            <li>Your hair with out a doubt will not loose whatever shape you put it in.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair sharp the whole day.</li>
            <li>Beware: this stuff is very hard to get out of your hair, you may even experience pain if you try to rub shampoo and water into your hair too fast at first.</li>
            <li>If you do apply too much, that section will have a flattened, almost matted down, \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li>I usually use CHI Helmet Head, which is awesome, but I was hoping for a less expensive alternative.  </li>
            <li>No flat head!!</li>
            <li>Why would you spray water on your dry, fixed style?  </li>
            <li>I buy this hair spray exclusively cuz I have fine, thin short spiky hair.</li>
            <li>This will also cause the product to spray in multiple directions, with too little or too much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> He thinks it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my mohawk and it works really great.</li>
            <li> The hold is great, though.</li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> I find this hairspray great for setting the curl while taming frizziness.</li>
            <li> It hold my hair style perfectly even in very strong wind.</li>
            <li> This is a good hairspray and a great buy if you want to freeze your style in place.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes i like to have a great hair day and go a good 3 days with it before a wash, with this stuff</li>
            <li> It works good with thinner hair, which is what I have.</li>
            <li> Good price though.</li>
            <li> and the price is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I have longhair style and before using this product, I&#x27;ve been searching on the market to find a hairspray that could hold my hair in shape when I&#x27;m outdoor, but nothing work good as this one.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything and mine came with 20% more wich is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Very lovely, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I was still able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Use this with a blow dryer and watch the magic happen!</li>
            <li> A lot comes in the can too and love the way its shaped like an air horn. !</li>
            <li> The hold is amazing and literally lasts until your decide to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> For the price it can&#x27;t be beat, forget salon quality because this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t have nice scrunchy hair without it.</li>
            <li> GREAT ,CHEAP , AND EASY!</li>
            <li> Both live up to their claims and are excellent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even been to saunas that are super hot, and amazingly it holds my hair perfectly in place.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is the most indestructible hairspray on the market.  </li>
            <li> Thirdly, I love how the spray sets my hair in place.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all-time favorite beauty products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My friends son recommended it, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than this product at the moment.</li>
            <li> I use it to hold in place most of my spikes when I style my wigs.</li>
            <li> SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER AND MORE CONVENIENT TO ORDER IT ONLINE.  </li>
            <li> It all depends on where I&#x27;m at in the cycle of my latest haircut.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but it sure does hold hair in place</li>
            <li> this is truly the ONLY product that works flawlessly on mohawks or any vertical style you can dream of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> takes me about 10 minutes to achieve an awe inspiring head of hair.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find it in abundance on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> and though it keeps my hair looking shiny and healthy, the hold still isnt what this puppy can do.  </li>
            <li> 3.5 is more like it.</li>
            <li> Considering I&#x27;m not paying top dollar for this hairspray...</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t look like it has a ton of gel or hairspray in it, even though I used(what</li>
            <li> us to much or show it was clogged (experienced).</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> My hair even gets shiny when I use this too and my color pops out more.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much to get really strong hold and great</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best hairspray on the market and Amazon does a great job delivering this item.  </li>
            <li> but in reality this is one great spray even if you like your hair to move and look natural.</li>
            <li> and i am good for the whole day.</li>
            <li> thank you guys for good and fast service.</li>
            <li> It does brush out easily tho.</li>
            <li> This sprays on and is easy to use and is easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the spray nozzle clogs easily and often.  </li>
            <li> Got2b glued is really strong</li>
            <li> i got this because i needed something strong to hold up my hair for a mohawk</li>
            <li> This hair spray is so strong.</li>
            <li> Incredibly strong hold.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;oww, u hit me with ur hair\\&quot; strong</li>
            <li> This stuff is also great to mold and style with, and I use it to tame flyaways fairly often.</li>
            <li> I have no use for this anymore because Gatsby wax does fine for me</li>
            <li> Fabulous hair spray.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the price ($6) at my local Fred Meyer.  </li>
            <li> This will hold my piece securely for 2 or 3 days and it&#x27;s water-soluble so you can slide it off when you shower.</li>
            <li> I imagine this works great for spikes or mohawks or similar styles</li>
            <li> overall good product:)</li>
            <li> Unlike the other Got2be hairsprays, this one doesn&#x27;t contain water, which is a very good thing.  </li>
            <li> But then one day, while scouring around looking for a product to tame my Lion&#x27;s mane, I came across this wonderful fella.</li>
            <li> and cheap and lasts a long time, but great quality also.</li>
            <li> I once spiked my bangs up and applied this and was able to play a two hour sweaty tennis match and my hair stayed exactly in tacked without any differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just expect to clean the nozzle in between uses.</li>
            <li> The only limitations of this spray is that the smell isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant</li>
            <li> I have bought this more than four times in my current 16 year long streak of having the best hair in the world.</li>
            <li> It has a strong hold, but combs right out.  </li>
            <li> It will literally hold up to pretty much any kind of stress test.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give it that &#x27;too much spray matted look&#x27; that most hairsprays give.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is just as good for holding a solid shape that won&#x27;t budge in a tornado.</li>
            <li> Well this hairspray is my evidence that this is true.  </li>
            <li> If you want softer hold, try Tresemme&#x27;s new runway collection Perfectly Undone hairspray, which give flexible, touchable hold even in high humidity or Nexxus Comb Thru, which gives brushable, soft hold that also works in any weather.  </li>
            <li> Some of the best for getting a great spike look for other wise impossible to style looks.</li>
            <li> other than showering afterwards it is a GREAT product.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is nice for spraying your ponytail into place; I expected something more than that.</li>
            <li> and I read in a magazine that Schwartzkopf (a different line by the same dude) hairspray was the very best, according to the hairdresser interviewed in InStyle.  </li>
            <li> I do particularly like how strong it is as it can be very useful and convenient.</li>
            <li> I also love that it doesn&#x27;t give me a greasy/wet or dryed out look, my hair just looks normal.</li>
            <li> i am more than happy with buying it and thus this is the second time i am purchasing it from the same supplier.</li>
            <li> this stuff works so good and lost a long time</li>
            <li> it freezes curls and hair in place and is the cheerleaders choice of hairspray even in hot conditions!</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;This hair gel is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I am sensitive to many fragrant products, and this leaves no odor in my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Your own personal experience will depend on what you&#x27;re trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s worth a shot though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray, Pravana, runs about $18-$25 a can, but as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> no doubt got more than my moneys worth, I marked the bottom where I got it from</li>
            <li> My daughter is going to help me get it right.  </li>
            <li> and then right before I head out of the house</li>
            <li> but it adds a nice crisp hold that stays even longer on your hair when you use the glue from the same company.</li>
            <li> Warm water will clean it out, but cleaning it every other day seems excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I typically wear some kind of beach wave or light curl at the ends.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s SO economical.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly crunchy when you touch it, but it&#x27;s able to move a bit in the wind and such without losing shape and still looks like clean hair.</li>
            <li> I have soft, fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to avoid spraying it downwards towards the scalp as the high alcohol content can be irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> The bull-horn like nozzle is funny.</li>
            <li> but I soon adjusted to it after the first week.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need a MASSIVE hold, just hold the can away from a greater distance for a mist of spray.</li>
            <li> I first bought it when my teenage son needed products for all those goofy hair styles that kids that age wear.  </li>
            <li> I love this spray for numerous reasons.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Big and Sexy hairspray</li>
            <li> The manufacturer told me that many guys were using Got2be glued spiking cream mixed in the palm with a blast of Freeze spray.</li>
            <li> I first tried two or three shampoos to wash out the glue of the spray.  </li>
            <li> I EVER ORDERED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this thing for the next couple of months for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this and definitely will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to clean the nozzle before spraying (a quick flick with the fingernail is usually enough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However it certainly does its job.</li>
            <li> Since I have to use a large amount for my hair sometimes the smell of the spray gets in my nose</li>
            <li> I have a ton of kinky-curly, thick hair that I love to style, especially in HUGE ways - faux hawks, pompadours, or just generally making it as big as I can for a pom-pom type of look.</li>
            <li> It is the only hairspray that keeps my fine hair (lots of it) in style without looking like a helmet head.  </li>
            <li> I have really really fine hair that is cut short.  </li>
            <li> No other type of gel I&#x27;ve used can own up to what this stuff does - and I also use the hairspray by this same brand, which I also HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> so when you use for something you absolutely HAVE to shower after and use A LOT of shampoo.</li>
            <li> and it stayed REALLY well</li>
            <li> Help from anyone who knows will be much appreciated and USED.  </li>
            <li> You will be charged and ready.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really expect people to be running their fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is medium thickness with a shoulder length smooth style and short bangs.  </li>
            <li> This is a very affordable hairspray.  </li>
            <li> By itself, the product doesn&#x27;t serve much purpose for guys.</li>
            <li> it really holds.</li>
            <li> thanks again</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in place and spiked for hours, even a whole day</li>
            <li> Ok, this stuff really holds to the point of not funny.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product for hard to hold styles ;).</li>
            <li> This spray doesn&#x27;t flake and it holds better than any other gel or mousse</li>
            <li> and WOW does this stuff really do it!</li>
            <li> For me, I use it by spraying my roots [after teasing] and it keeps your teased hair full and big ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> i just do a quick 2 second spray</li>
            <li> Has a decent smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does make your hair stiff if you use too much, but I go more for how it looks than how it feels when I go out.</li>
            <li> I backcomb the hell out of my hair and do it up mile high with just a bit of this stuff.</li>
            <li> The girls have to wear a high ponytail, with a front poof, and this keeps the style in place while they are tumbling.  </li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but once I recieved it, I was surprised how large it was and</li>
            <li> application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray function, while useful, is quirky: the nozzle clogs easily, and a cursory scrape of the nozzle mouth is often necessary to ensure a solid spray, and the spray sets exceedingly fast-so fast</li>
            <li> curly hair, which used to take upwards of an hour on good days to tame into a mohawk (with a less than a 5% success rate...</li>
            <li> I want a hair product that will cast my hair in concrete while still being water soluble.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is - you have to clean the nozzle hole often because it easily clogs from dried hairspray.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> sure to chip the dried up spray from the nozzle between uses so that you don&#x27;t accidentally spray it in your eye though.</li>
            <li> now my mohawk is simply gravity defying, perfectly fanned, and without the white residue some gels leave behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the heavy duty so -called sprrays ..and NONE live up to the rep that GOT 2B GLUED</li>
            <li> As a child of the 80&#x27;s where perms, 2 &amp; 3 inch high bangs and Aqua Net ruled the day,  I have to say I expected more from a product that describes itself as \\&quot;screaming hold for hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even the new Elnett from l&#x27;oreal</li>
            <li> After having very limited success, I went to the hairdresser who spent an hour trying degreaser, dawn dish liquid, strong shampoos, corn starch and so on.  </li>
            <li> final result, when applied properly, is a light to moderate hold that may or may not survive a brisk wind walking from the car to the office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female and I&#x27;ve got super thick hair cut into a pixie(the top</li>
            <li> omg I bow down to this product my cosplays would be nothing without this product, it has amazing hold for all the spikes I have to do and it stays up for a long time&lt;br /&gt;two</li>
            <li> has so far!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a five second fix under hot water.  </li>
            <li> I usually have a bottle for 3 or more months</li>
            <li> Unless I have this spray in it - I can literally flip my head upside down, spray, and my hair will stay sticking straight up even after I stand back up, yet it&#x27;s easy to work with.</li>
            <li> With most other hairsprays, my hair still falls flat if I get in the wind.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many &#x27;extra-hold&#x27; and &#x27;super-hold&#x27; - &#x27;maxium hold&#x27; - &#x27;extreme-hold&#x27; and &#x27;ultimate-hold&#x27; hairspray that are all the same: they suck and fall down.</li>
            <li> The company should know better - a hard hold spray is thick and drys very hard, so they need a good spray head design and a cap, so it doesn&#x27;t clog so easily.</li>
            <li> You use it like you would any other hairspray if that&#x27;s all your after, but I recommend getting your look totally perfectly in place, and i mean every hair, because when you coat your head down with this stuff there&#x27;s no moving it around after.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something much smaller when it came in, but wow the product really does work.</li>
            <li> If you want flowing, natural hair then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Will not do to much for a guy tho, unless you have a spiker to go with it such as Got2b Glued Spiking glue or Ice Spiker.</li>
            <li> Then, I called a professional hairdresser for advice and tried baking soda and cleansing shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The company changed the spray head design and the darn thing clogs soooo frequently, the spray pattern is all messed up.  </li>
            <li> This means you have double the product in your hair, which doesn&#x27;t really feel all that clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need a product I can depend on.18-$25 a can, but as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if the nozzle didn&#x27;t get clogged frequently.</li>
            <li> I am a 17 year old girl</li>
            <li> I want my hair to be soft and touchable, but without frizziness or heaviness....</li>
            <li> Nothing so far comes close.</li>
            <li> I took the chance that the same dude would not make two separate and distinct product lines but would instead simply repackage the one.  </li>
            <li> It literally holds your hair exactly in place where you want it and lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> I used to love this hairspray but NO MORE!  </li>
            <li> BUT the one big bugger is that inevitably, the nozzle spray gets clogged even after running hot water on it.</li>
            <li> Then I spray my whole head and if the hold is a little too stiff, run a wide toothed comb through it and you&#x27;ll have great hold and enough movement to not look plastered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone its low price as well!</li>
            <li> only complaint is that sometimes the nozzle gets clogged, so just make sure you run it under some water.</li>
            <li> The trade-off for the strong hold is that it can feel pretty uncomfortable if you do not wash it out.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it for 3 inch high bangs, those days are long gone, but I did want something that would keep my hair in place throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a spray like Joico \\&quot;ICE\\&quot; spray that they&#x27;ve apparently discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I frequently get overspray on my phone screen, and it only washes off with water.</li>
            <li> spent so much money on products that just dont work.</li>
            <li> my first reaction was that this would be the same as every other flimsy spray product.</li>
            <li> Your hair with out a doubt will not loose whatever shape you put it in.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair sharp the whole day.</li>
            <li> Beware: this stuff is very hard to get out of your hair, you may even experience pain if you try to rub shampoo and water into your hair too fast at first.</li>
            <li> If you do apply too much, that section will have a flattened, almost matted down, \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li> I usually use CHI Helmet Head, which is awesome, but I was hoping for a less expensive alternative.  </li>
            <li> No flat head!!</li>
            <li> Why would you spray water on your dry, fixed style?  </li>
            <li> I buy this hair spray exclusively cuz I have fine, thin short spiky hair.</li>
            <li> This will also cause the product to spray in multiple directions, with too little or too much</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter is a competitive cheerleader and this hairspray was recommended to me by several other cheer moms.  </li>
            <li> But when using too much of this stuff you certainly get that gluey texture which is not very desirable.</li>
            <li> use this stuff to help out with teasing, since my hair tends to fall flat.</li>
            <li> Even after a thorough wash when my hair was big and long i felt like some of it would still be there.</li>
            <li> I would say the benefits definitely outweigh the minor annoyance.</li>
            <li> Just take it slow at first when in the shower and it will eventually loosen up.</li>
            <li> I either use a dash of Kerastase Elixir Ultime or Fekkai&#x27;s glossing cream to leave my hair shiny, soft and smelling less like hairspray.</li>
            <li> The spray button is a little awkward to push and sometimes it gets clogged, but all in all, I am willing to put up with that because it is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> is that it goes on very wet, very direct to one small section and you have to be very careful you don&#x27;t apply too much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised by this spray - it is no better than regular spray on my hair.</li>
            <li> but i do not have really long spiked hair</li>
            <li> I used to use this product to keep my hair style in place because I my when long is a frizz machine.</li>
            <li> long I&#x27;m guessing), which I sometimes decide to put into a mohawk.</li>
            <li> and by works i mean really really works.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried max hold, super stiff, hard gel, even elmers glue.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like any of the other Got2be hairsprays.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as if your hair is frozen in place ALL DAY LONG!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to let all the spray dry and then brush it out, style and spray again.</li>
            <li> For a regular work day, this isn&#x27;t a bad alternative to the more expensive salon brands, but when it&#x27;s a special occasion, I pull out my Pravana.  </li>
            <li> For a regular work day, this isn&#x27;t a bad alternative to the more expensive salon brands, but when it&#x27;s a special occasion, I pull out my Pravana.  </li>
            <li> Just use on dry mohawk, dry it on and voila!</li>
            <li> even the got2b gel in the black or yellow tube just cant hold it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the nozzle does clog, but if you take the spray back to the store you got it from they will usually take it back if you didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It beats all other maximum hold hairspray and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and have a hard time keeping your hair scrunchy or surly all day then use this product, it is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> and I can fluff it up for volume and/or pull strands of hair into place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for a critque, but I have to say if you cosplay</li>
            <li> : Be careful if you have your phone in your bathroom with you.</li>
            <li> and i have a mohawk that is roughly 5 inches</li>
            <li> Hold your hair out angles and spray it down and it will stay if you let it dry in place.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve had such bad luck with hair spray keeping my hair up for more than two hours since I have long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This stuff willl hold your extreme bouffant or your rockabilly pompadors sky-high.</li>
            <li> Other products did not hold that</li>
            <li> I also keep it on hand if I am needing extra staying power for curls for an event, like a wedding, since I usually want my hair to stay put rather than moving around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and none hold u</li>
            <li> The only thing that I recommend is that you either put a small fan or keep your bathroom fan on when you use the spray if you use a lot.</li>
            <li> did read other reviews and comments, and the suggestion was made to spray the area and then dry the product with a blow dryer for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged woman who&#x27;s used this product for at least five years.  </li>
            <li> I would be seriously cautious about using this product with any other product and avoid using large amounts in thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Also the nozzle gets clocked frequently and it got very annoying for me but running under the sink in hot water fixed the issue.</li>
            <li> I am probably not the average consumer for this product</li>
            <li> But, because my hair is so heavy, it never wants to stay that way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s locked down.</li>
            <li> people might find the hold too extreme, but you can use it in layers or brush it out a little for less hold.</li>
            <li> When I use this spray, it gives my hair a slight stiffness</li>
            <li> This Freeze Spray holds as well as Helmet Head for less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m using my wand, my typical routine is to: curl, mist/spray</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and long that I have to spray my hair, tie it in hair ties, then spray it again so I can scrunch every part of it, but they stay in alllllll day!</li>
            <li> And the other Schwartzkopf hairspray is $30!!  </li>
            <li> This is definitely not a light hold.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nonetheless, if you want to set a hairstyle quickly, firmly, and with a minimum of fuss, the Blasting Freeze Spray is exemplary in its class.</li>
            <li> No permanent damage, but it&#x27;s still annoying to clean every time.</li>
            <li> have a 12 inch mohawk &amp; this works wonders, not good with humidity though for wet days</li>
            <li> BAM, rock hard hold in less than 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LOOONNGGG way, I promise!</li>
            <li> (You just need a little on the screen, DON&#x27;T submerge your phone in water!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s your hairspray for every style: sleek, smooth, messy, twisted, hard and/or totally crazy.</li>
            <li> it can  hold my hair in shape for a very long time, but it has a weird smell on it</li>
            <li> and this holds the shape without looking hard.</li>
            <li> its hard to get off the hands</li>
            <li> This spray holds my wavy, hard to hold hair in all weathers.  </li>
            <li> And if you use it sparingly (think misting), it will not leave a hard, crunchy curl.</li>
            <li> I can hardly complain.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s like 15 bucks a can sucks.</li>
            <li> At least I can find it nowhere.  </li>
            <li> Glued Blasting Freeze Spray is an aerosol spray version of their Styling Spiking Glue, and like that product, it provides a thick, gluelike stiffness to hair, but with the added convenience of aerosol</li>
            <li> &quot; they mean it-</li>
            <li> This is the review I wrote for a hair gel produced by this same company: ([[ASIN:B004FQK7DA</li>
            <li> get me wrong, this stuff WILL leave your hair hard if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for...</li>
            <li> and some were extremely difficult and sticky to apply and wash out.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s SO expensive.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO FIND IN STORES</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SORRY THAT</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG.</li>
            <li> The nozzle is a bit weird but it worked</li>
            <li> You can grab some hair and spray it on and then twist it into all kinds of crazy shapes.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and have to contend with terrible humidity and this spray rocks even through the worst of it.  </li>
            <li> AFTER RECEIVING THE PRODUCT, I FOUND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SPRAY.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> the worst product I have tried.  </li>
            <li> EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fabulous hair spray. Once you spray your hair holds.</li>
            <li> I tried so many &#x27;extra-hold&#x27; and &#x27;super-hold&#x27; - &#x27;maxium hold&#x27; - &#x27;extreme-hold&#x27; and &#x27;ultimate-hold&#x27; hairspray that are all the same: they suck and fall down. Even the new Elnett from l&#x27;oreal that&#x27;s like 15 bucks a can sucks. But this freeze blasting hairspray from got2b glued is awesome. You use it like you would any other hairspray if that&#x27;s all your after, but I recommend getting your look totally perfectly in place, and i mean every hair, because when you coat your head down with this stuff there&#x27;s no moving it around after. It&#x27;s locked down. It does brush out easily tho. You don&#x27;t see the hairspray at all in your hair. It doesn&#x27;t give it that &#x27;too much spray matted look&#x27; that most hairsprays give. This looks totally unsprayed even when you use tons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can is big. The bull-horn like nozzle is funny. This stuff willl hold your extreme bouffant or your rockabilly pompadors sky-high. You can grab some hair and spray it on and then twist it into all kinds of crazy shapes. Hold your hair out angles and spray it down and it will stay if you let it dry in place. I backcomb the hell out of my hair and do it up mile high with just a bit of this stuff. I love it. It&#x27;s cheap too! It&#x27;s your hairspray for every style: sleek, smooth, messy, twisted, hard and/or totally crazy. This stuff&#x27;s got you covered.</li>
            <li> this stuff works so good and lost a long time but i do not have really long spiked hair i just do a quick 2 second spray and i am good for the whole day. this isnt way cheaper than the store but ehh saving pennies saves dollars.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter is a competitive cheerleader and this hairspray was recommended to me by several other cheer moms.  I was happy with the price ($6) at my local Fred Meyer.  The girls have to wear a high ponytail, with a front poof, and this keeps the style in place while they are tumbling.  Would be ideal for ballet dancers and gymnasts as well. It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> Back when I had longer hair I used to use this product to keep my hair style in place because I my when long is a frizz machine. I swear my hair had a personal vendetta against me. But then one day, while scouring around looking for a product to tame my Lion&#x27;s mane, I came across this wonderful fella. I immediately bought it from the store and decided to give it a go. The hold is amazing and literally lasts until your decide to wash your hair. It is not for everyone however. If you want flowing, natural hair then this is not for you. If you want to keep your hair in place all day, then it is. I once spiked my bangs up and applied this and was able to play a two hour sweaty tennis match and my hair stayed exactly in tacked without any differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have cut my hair shorter I have no use for this anymore because Gatsby wax does fine for me but I am forever grateful for this product. The only limitations of this spray is that the smell isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant but I soon adjusted to it after the first week. Also like I have said this thing will turn your hair into a brick. I once had a friend stick her hands in and she was scared that it might have gotten stuck inside. Also the nozzle gets clocked frequently and it got very annoying for me but running under the sink in hot water fixed the issue. Just expect to clean the nozzle in between uses. Overall this is a great product for hard to hold styles ;).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear spikes in my hair. I just need hairspray. Got 2B Glued Blasting Freeze is the best hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used. It holds without the stickiness. My hair stays put, but I don&#x27;t feel like I have hair spray on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I need to brush my hair or restyle later, I don&#x27;t have to worry about residue flaking off. It doesn&#x27;t flake off. I can restyle as I please as if I had never sprayed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is the nozzle, which gets clogged after every spray. Just be sure to clean the nozzle before spraying (a quick flick with the fingernail is usually enough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a wonderful hair spray. It will take a lot to convince me to switch.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter who takes ballet and has bangs and is required to gel the bangs back and wear hair in a bun for class.  Other products did not hold that well and some were extremely difficult and sticky to apply and wash out.  This sprays on and is easy to use and is easy to wash out. Has a decent smell.</li>
            <li> This is the most indestructible hairspray on the market.  It will literally hold up to pretty much any kind of stress test.  I&#x27;ve even been to saunas that are super hot, and amazingly it holds my hair perfectly in place.  This is definitely not a light hold.  The trade-off for the strong hold is that it can feel pretty uncomfortable if you do not wash it out.  It&#x27;s best to avoid spraying it downwards towards the scalp as the high alcohol content can be irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> Got2b glued is really strong so when you use for something you absolutely HAVE to shower after and use A LOT of shampoo. I used this product for a cheerleading competition to keep my hair in a ponytail and it stayed REALLY well but I HAD to shower after to get everything out otherwise when you take the ponytail out it stays in a ponytail. other than showering afterwards it is a GREAT product. Yes, i recommend it if you don&#x27;t mind showering after every use of this product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair sharp the whole day. I get dandruff though.</li>
            <li> It does the deed well</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want a hairspray that will lock in your style. A little goes a LOOONNGGG way, I promise! The trick is to know how to use this stuff - otherwise you&#x27;re left with hair that literally looks &amp;#34;glued.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this stuff to help out with teasing, since my hair tends to fall flat. I also keep it on hand if I am needing extra staying power for curls for an event, like a wedding, since I usually want my hair to stay put rather than moving around. I don&#x27;t recommend this hairspray for every day styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that sometimes the nozzle gets clogged, so just make sure you run it under some water. That seems to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> Not a hair holder like I wanted.  It&#x27;s definitely a hair helper but don&#x27;t count on it for spiking.  I&#x27;m looking for a spray like Joico \\&quot;ICE\\&quot; spray that they&#x27;ve apparently discontinued.  At least I can find it nowhere.  I want a hair product that will cast my hair in concrete while still being water soluble.  Help from anyone who knows will be much appreciated and USED.  Tx!</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray I use. I have a ton of kinky-curly, thick hair that I love to style, especially in HUGE ways - faux hawks, pompadours, or just generally making it as big as I can for a pom-pom type of look. But, because my hair is so heavy, it never wants to stay that way. Unless I have this spray in it - I can literally flip my head upside down, spray, and my hair will stay sticking straight up even after I stand back up, yet it&#x27;s easy to work with. Both times I&#x27;ve done faux-hawk type styles, and I&#x27;ve taken out my hair clips (my hair is just beyond shoulder length), my hair has STAYED in its style, because the hold is just incredible. If you don&#x27;t need a MASSIVE hold, just hold the can away from a greater distance for a mist of spray. This stuff is also great to mold and style with, and I use it to tame flyaways fairly often. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t give me a greasy/wet or dryed out look, my hair just looks normal.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would freeze my hair in place, like the canister says.  Well, I did not get it here.  I use hairspray for volume, and after spraying, waiting, spraying again, etc., I got nothing from this product except a clumpy crown of hair.  This has got 2b the worst product I have tried.  Maybe this is nice for spraying your ponytail into place; I expected something more than that.</li>
            <li> i got this because i needed something strong to hold up my hair for a mohawk and it does its job either if i fan it up or liberty spike it.</li>
            <li> Holds hella good! Great stuff! and cheap and lasts a long time, but great quality also. Will not do to much for a guy tho, unless you have a spiker to go with it such as Got2b Glued Spiking glue or Ice Spiker. Will buy again...</li>
            <li> Got2B Glued Blasting Freeze Spray is an aerosol spray version of their Styling Spiking Glue, and like that product, it provides a thick, gluelike stiffness to hair, but with the added convenience of aerosol application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray function, while useful, is quirky: the nozzle clogs easily, and a cursory scrape of the nozzle mouth is often necessary to ensure a solid spray, and the spray sets exceedingly fast-so fast, I recommend combing the hair into the desired style before application, lest you need to use water as a solvent to stickily move the hair where you want it to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, if you want to set a hairstyle quickly, firmly, and with a minimum of fuss, the Blasting Freeze Spray is exemplary in its class.</li>
            <li> I will never stop using this hairspray, it&#x27;s works! It will keep any style! If you only like a flexible hold... this product is NOT for you. This will keep you hair in place during a hurricane.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the heavy duty so -called sprrays ..and NONE live up to the rep that GOT 2B GLUED has so far!  GREAT ,CHEAP , AND EASY!</li>
            <li> omg I bow down to this product my cosplays would be nothing without this product, it has amazing hold for all the spikes I have to do and it stays up for a long time&lt;br /&gt;two thumbs up</li>
            <li> I have a 10in Mohawk, this spray is the best spray for keeping up my mohawk, it kept up my hair for 4 days in a row once. And thats with going to concerts and sweating to death! Use this with a blow dryer and watch the magic happen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged woman who&#x27;s used this product for at least five years.  I first bought it when my teenage son needed products for all those goofy hair styles that kids that age wear.  I love this spray for numerous reasons.  First, it&#x27;s SO economical.  Secondly, I am sensitive to many fragrant products, and this leaves no odor in my hair at all. Thirdly, I love how the spray sets my hair in place. I have soft, fine hair. When I use this spray, it gives my hair a slight stiffness and I can fluff it up for volume and/or pull strands of hair into place.  Great for bangs. This is one of my all-time favorite beauty products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I used to use Big and Sexy hairspray but it&#x27;s SO expensive. This hairspray is just as good for holding a solid shape that won&#x27;t budge in a tornado. The only thing is - you have to clean the nozzle hole often because it easily clogs from dried hairspray.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair in shape and doesn&#x27;t make your hair like rocks. It does however smell like s*** so yeah. &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> This is a great product for cosplay. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily use at all. It takes a lot of scrubbing to rinse from your hair. However it certainly does its job.</li>
            <li> my job requires that i have my hair in a bun everyday and this hairspray really keeps my hair in line. overall good product:)</li>
            <li> The name might make you think of Mohawks...but in reality this is one great spray even if you like your hair to move and look natural. I have a mid length bob and this holds the shape without looking hard. My friends son recommended it, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Just use on dry mohawk, dry it on and voila! You will be charged and ready.  This stuff keeps my big 10&amp;#34; erected.</li>
            <li> Fulfills needs perfectly! Nothing is better than this product at the moment. Highly recommended to anyone its low price as well!</li>
            <li> Great hairspray for the &#x27;freeze need&#x27;.  This works.  and by works i mean really really works.  it freezes curls and hair in place and is the cheerleaders choice of hairspray even in hot conditions!</li>
            <li> Got2B Glued Blasting Freeze Spray is excellent for lace wigs to prevent shedding &amp; extend the life of the hair piece.  I recommend this product to all of my customers.  It&#x27;s best to seal your knots using this product after each wash.  I recommend purchasing this product from desire.</li>
            <li> Cosplayer approved. I use it to hold in place most of my spikes when I style my wigs. Works great and keeps it&#x27;s hold!</li>
            <li> I wear a man&#x27;s hair piece. The manufacturer told me that many guys were using Got2be glued spiking cream mixed in the palm with a blast of Freeze spray. This will hold my piece securely for 2 or 3 days and it&#x27;s water-soluble so you can slide it off when you shower. You have to try this!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting something much smaller when it came in, but wow the product really does work. I needed it to style a wig, and it was the greatest, easiest styled wig I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really NECESSARY or anything but it adds a nice crisp hold that stays even longer on your hair when you use the glue from the same company. Beware: this stuff is very hard to get out of your hair, you may even experience pain if you try to rub shampoo and water into your hair too fast at first. Just take it slow at first when in the shower and it will eventually loosen up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for a critque, but I have to say if you cosplay and you are doing spikes or anything abstract on a wig-- this is the best product you could buy. Very lovely, and I even let my friend use it on her wig and she was hooked! Great product!</li>
            <li> I style wigs, as well as having short &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; hair, myself. I use this for both things. It&#x27;s great for getting gravity-defying hair. On days that I get to that point of &amp;#34;my hair looks amazing&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t want it to lose it&#x27;s perfection throughout the day, I use the spray to keep it how it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make your hair stiff if you use too much, but I go more for how it looks than how it feels when I go out. I don&#x27;t really expect people to be running their fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Be careful if you have your phone in your bathroom with you. I frequently get overspray on my phone screen, and it only washes off with water. (You just need a little on the screen, DON&#x27;T submerge your phone in water!) No permanent damage, but it&#x27;s still annoying to clean every time.</li>
            <li> Ok, this stuff really holds to the point of not funny.  Used Halloween night with glitter spray.  I first tried two or three shampoos to wash out the glue of the spray.  Then, I called a professional hairdresser for advice and tried baking soda and cleansing shampoo.  After having very limited success, I went to the hairdresser who spent an hour trying degreaser, dawn dish liquid, strong shampoos, corn starch and so on.  Its almost out but not quite.  I would be seriously cautious about using this product with any other product and avoid using large amounts in thick hair.  I will not use again.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best hairspray on the market and Amazon does a great job delivering this item.  It literally holds your hair exactly in place where you want it and lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> I have made several attempts to spike my hair, but it continues to fall.  My daughter is going to help me get it right.  Can&#x27;t wait for the finall results!</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for several weeks and it has yet to hold my simple style.  My hair is medium thickness with a shoulder length smooth style and short bangs.  In no time at all any height or curl I want to stay has fallen out.  I&#x27;m very surprised by this spray - it is no better than regular spray on my hair.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO FIND IN STORES SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER AND MORE CONVENIENT TO ORDER IT ONLINE.  AFTER RECEIVING THE PRODUCT, I FOUND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SPRAY. BOTH CANS ARE LIKE THIS SO HERE THEY SIT ON A SHELF IN MY BATHROOM. I&#x27;M SORRY THAT I EVER ORDERED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> it can  hold my hair in shape for a very long time, but it has a weird smell on it</li>
            <li> I used to love this hairspray but NO MORE!  The company changed the spray head design and the darn thing clogs soooo frequently, the spray pattern is all messed up.  You wound up with hair spray (almost lacquer-like) in my eyes, on my forehead, everywhere but my hair.  The company should know better - a hard hold spray is thick and drys very hard, so they need a good spray head design and a cap, so it doesn&#x27;t clog so easily.</li>
            <li> me gusta mucho los spray y seguir&amp;iacute;a comprando mas y la gomina tambi&amp;eacute;n me encanta mucho sin eso no vivo</li>
            <li> This is a very affordable hairspray.  It has a strong hold, but combs right out.  My hairdresser uses it even though it is a pricey salon.  He thinks it is a great product.</li>
            <li> As a child of the 80&#x27;s where perms, 2 &amp; 3 inch high bangs and Aqua Net ruled the day,  I have to say I expected more from a product that describes itself as \\&quot;screaming hold for hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it for 3 inch high bangs, those days are long gone, but I did want something that would keep my hair in place throughout the day. I have short hair, it varies between something along the lines of a textured pixie to a longer \\&quot;messy\\&quot; look.  It all depends on where I&#x27;m at in the cycle of my latest haircut. I like to style, spray and go.  I do not like to make repeated visits to the bathroom to re-do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found with this product is that it goes on very wet, very direct to one small section and you have to be very careful you don&#x27;t apply too much.  If you do apply too much, that section will have a flattened, almost matted down, \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; look.  You&#x27;ll have to let all the spray dry and then brush it out, style and spray again. This means you have double the product in your hair, which doesn&#x27;t really feel all that clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the spray nozzle clogs easily and often.  This will also cause the product to spray in multiple directions, with too little or too much wherever your trying to actually apply it. Warm water will clean it out, but cleaning it every other day seems excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final result, when applied properly, is a light to moderate hold that may or may not survive a brisk wind walking from the car to the office. Your own personal experience will depend on what you&#x27;re trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read other reviews and comments, and the suggestion was made to spray the area and then dry the product with a blow dryer for a few seconds. I imagine this works great for spikes or mohawks or similar styles (I did the same for my bangs in the 80&#x27;s) but that isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m trying to achieve. I suppose it&#x27;s worth a shot though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricewise, it&#x27;s not unreasonable. My favorite hairspray, Pravana, runs about $18-$25 a can, but as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. For a regular work day, this isn&#x27;t a bad alternative to the more expensive salon brands, but when it&#x27;s a special occasion, I pull out my Pravana.  I need a product I can depend on.18-$25 a can, but as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for.

            <li> use this every day and have for several years now. holds hair in place no matter what mother  nature throws at you!</li>
            <li> I use this product for my mohawk and it works really great. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used. It works good with thinner hair, which is what I have. My friend with thicker hair said it didn&#x27;t work for her that well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I would give it 5 stars if the nozzle didn&#x27;t get clogged frequently. The hold is great, though.</li>
            <li> If you do cosplay wig styling this is a must. A little goes a long way.  Some of the best for getting a great spike look for other wise impossible to style looks.</li>
            <li> I buy this hair spray exclusively cuz I have fine, thin short spiky hair. BUT the one big bugger is that inevitably, the nozzle spray gets clogged even after running hot water on it. The company needs to redesign the nozzle to prevent this from happening. Good price though.</li>
            <li> Although I did not pay that close attention to size / 12 oz but once I recieved it, I was surprised how large it was and no doubt got more than my moneys worth, I marked the bottom where I got it from so when I run out, I&#x27;ll re buy again from same seller.</li>
            <li> By itself, the product doesn&#x27;t serve much purpose for guys. But with [[ASIN:B0009VO8RG Got 2B Glued Spiking Glue 6 oz.]] being applied and then this sprayed on. You have the greatest hair spiker in the world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to chip the dried up spray from the nozzle between uses so that you don&#x27;t accidentally spray it in your eye though. Lol.</li>
            <li> have a 12 inch mohawk &amp; this works wonders, not good with humidity though for wet days i&#x27;d suggest freeze it http://www.walmart.com/ip/12559404?www&#x3D;true&amp;productRedirect&#x3D;true</li>
            <li> Works better than anything and mine came with 20% more wich is awesome!!! I&#x27;ll be using this thing for the next couple of months for sure.</li>
            <li> you want your hair to stay ? I recommend this 100% . Your hair with out a doubt will not loose whatever shape you put it in. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years. This hair spray is so strong. The smell reminds me of beer, I don&#x27;t mind it. A lot comes in the can too and love the way its shaped like an air horn. !</li>
            <li> great product! it really holds. and the price is a good deal. i would reccomend this product for the person that needs a hold all day.</li>
            <li> i must say that this product is the best in its level i have ever seen. i am more than happy with buying it and thus this is the second time i am purchasing it from the same supplier. thank you guys for good and fast service. i hope indeed that you will go on this way ALWAYS!!!! thanks again</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Keeps my hair in place and spiked for hours, even a whole day</li>
            <li> I have longhair style and before using this product, I&#x27;ve been searching on the market to find a hairspray that could hold my hair in shape when I&#x27;m outdoor, but nothing work good as this one. It hold my hair style perfectly even in very strong wind. I love this and definitely will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great. it is litterally like glue. its hard to get off the hands but it sure does hold hair in place</li>
            <li> I am a 17 year old girl and i have a mohawk that is roughly 5 inches long.&lt;br /&gt;ive tried EVERYTHING to get it to stay, gels, pomades, waxes, sprays...&lt;br /&gt;ive spent so much money on products that just dont work. Ive tried max hold, super stiff, hard gel, even elmers glue. you name it, ive tried it. even the got2b gel in the black or yellow tube just cant hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that being said, i bought this on sale at my local supermarket for 3$ on sale. my first reaction was that this would be the same as every other flimsy spray product. I WAS WRONG. and WOW does this stuff really do it! i just hold the hair up, spray, give it a go with the comb to get it straight and then use the hairdryer for a few seconds. BAM, rock hard hold in less than 15 seconds. now my mohawk is simply gravity defying, perfectly fanned, and without the white residue some gels leave behind. this is truly the ONLY product that works flawlessly on mohawks or any vertical style you can dream of.&lt;br /&gt;my curly hair, which used to take upwards of an hour on good days to tame into a mohawk (with a less than a 5% success rate...)&lt;br /&gt;now takes me about 10 minutes to achieve an awe inspiring head of hair.</li>
            <li> It did not work any different than regular hairspray on my hair.</li>
            <li> Walmart stopped carrying this product.  I was so glad to find it in abundance on Amazon.com.  It is the only hairspray that keeps my fine hair (lots of it) in style without looking like a helmet head.  The spray button is a little awkward to push and sometimes it gets clogged, but all in all, I am willing to put up with that because it is a fantastic product.  I&#x27;ve tried other products and none hold u like got2b glued.</li>
            <li> The Walmarts, CVSs and Walgreen&#x27;s in my area no longer carry this product and I got worried because I used to see it all the time. I&#x27;m so happy I was still able to find it on Amazon. This spray doesn&#x27;t flake and it holds better than any other gel or mousse I have ever purchased. Spray on!</li>
            <li> Just to try something different I bought the Loreal Ellnet and though it keeps my hair looking shiny and healthy, the hold still isnt what this puppy can do.  For the price and results, this is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I usually use CHI Helmet Head, which is awesome, but I was hoping for a less expensive alternative.  Got2b is made by Schwartzkopf and I read in a magazine that Schwartzkopf (a different line by the same dude) hairspray was the very best, according to the hairdresser interviewed in InStyle.  I took the chance that the same dude would not make two separate and distinct product lines but would instead simply repackage the one.  Well this hairspray is my evidence that this is true.  This Freeze Spray holds as well as Helmet Head for less than half the price.  And the other Schwartzkopf hairspray is $30!!  Argh!  I feel like I&amp;#34;ve scored a coup!  The nozzle is a bit weird but it worked and I got used to it.  This spray holds my wavy, hard to hold hair in all weathers.  I live in Florida and have to contend with terrible humidity and this spray rocks even through the worst of it.  Unlike the other Got2be hairsprays, this one doesn&#x27;t contain water, which is a very good thing.  Why would you spray water on your dry, fixed style?  This is a good hairspray and a great buy if you want to freeze your style in place.  If you want softer hold, try Tresemme&#x27;s new runway collection Perfectly Undone hairspray, which give flexible, touchable hold even in high humidity or Nexxus Comb Thru, which gives brushable, soft hold that also works in any weather.  Tresemme&#x27;s hairspray runs about $6 and Nexxus is about $10.  Both live up to their claims and are excellent.  I personally don&#x27;t like any of the other Got2be hairsprays.  Only this one works like it&#x27;s supposed to.  But if you don&#x27;t want your style to move at all, ever, then this is the one for you.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Well I think &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; is the keyword here. I do particularly like how strong it is as it can be very useful and convenient. But when using too much of this stuff you certainly get that gluey texture which is not very desirable. Control of use is key. I know i am a sinner but sometimes i cant say no. Even i feel like 3 stars is too low though. 3.5 is more like it. I have bought this more than four times in my current 16 year long streak of having the best hair in the world. As i alluded to earlier, my issue is the glueyness. Even after a thorough wash when my hair was big and long i felt like some of it would still be there. Sometimes i like to have a great hair day and go a good 3 days with it before a wash, with this stuff it makes it more unlikely.</li>
            <li> I am probably not the average consumer for this product but I find it superb for my needs!  I have long, thick hair and I typically wear some kind of beach wave or light curl at the ends. I find this hairspray great for setting the curl while taming frizziness. And if you use it sparingly (think misting), it will not leave a hard, crunchy curl. I want my hair to be soft and touchable, but without frizziness or heaviness.... And this hairspray does just that! And trust me, I don&#x27;t skimp out when it comes to price of hair products. I&#x27;ve tried them all!  If I&#x27;m using my wand, my typical routine is to: curl, mist/spray and then right before I head out of the house I either use a dash of Kerastase Elixir Ultime or Fekkai&#x27;s glossing cream to leave my hair shiny, soft and smelling less like hairspray. 😊&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this stuff WILL leave your hair hard if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for... But  I wanted to share an alternate use as well.  One last comment in regards to clogging... Yes, it occasionaly happens but it&#x27;s a five second fix under hot water.  I would say the benefits definitely outweigh the minor annoyance. Considering I&#x27;m not paying top dollar for this hairspray... I can hardly complain. 👍</li>
            <li> This is the review I wrote for a hair gel produced by this same company: ([[ASIN:B004FQK7DA Got2b Ultra Glued Invincible Styling Gel, 6-Ounce (Pack of 2)]])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This hair gel is nothing short of amazing. I&#x27;m a female and I&#x27;ve got super thick hair cut into a pixie(the top is 4-5\\&quot; long I&#x27;m guessing), which I sometimes decide to put into a mohawk. No other type of gel I&#x27;ve used can own up to what this stuff does - and I also use the hairspray by this same brand, which I also HIGHLY recommend. My hair is rock solid with both of these products combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a volunteer firefighter/EMT and I cook part-time, and even through an 8 hour+ shift in a smoky, humid kitchen or running any type of call, this stuff will not budge(not counting helmet hair). Highly, highly recommend it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this one day after writing the above review, and I slept in my mohawk overnight - it didn&#x27;t budge. My favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t look like it has a ton of gel or hairspray in it, even though I used(what I thought was) quite a bit. It&#x27;s certainly crunchy when you touch it, but it&#x27;s able to move a bit in the wind and such without losing shape and still looks like clean hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed any flakes, either. This is incredible stuff.</li>
            <li> I have really really fine hair that is cut short.  I have tried every hairspray out there that says it is freeze spray and I think this works the best.  With most other hairsprays, my hair still falls flat if I get in the wind.  With this spray, it seems to keep its style even after windy situations.  So far I really like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Incredibly strong hold. Nothing so far comes close. I think this stuff will hold in hurricane force wind. \\&quot;oww, u hit me with ur hair\\&quot; strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every hairspray there is-from $2-$30 a bottle and nothing compares to this spray. When they say \\&quot;Freeze Hold\\&quot; they mean it- it&#x27;s as if your hair is frozen in place ALL DAY LONG! It beats all other maximum hold hairspray and it lasts a long time! I usually have a bottle for 3 or more months and I use it every day. You don&#x27;t have to use very much to get really strong hold and great hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people might find the hold too extreme, but you can use it in layers or brush it out a little for less hold. For me, I use it by spraying my roots [after teasing] and it keeps your teased hair full and big ALL DAY! No flat head!! Then I spray my whole head and if the hold is a little too stiff, run a wide toothed comb through it and you&#x27;ll have great hold and enough movement to not look plastered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nozzle can get covered in a film from the spray, but you can pick it off with your nail and keep on stylin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously the best and strongest hairspray ever. For the price it can&#x27;t be beat, forget salon quality because this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> My hair is nothing without this product! The first time I tried it I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve had such bad luck with hair spray keeping my hair up for more than two hours since I have long, thick hair. My hair is so thick and long that I have to spray my hair, tie it in hair ties, then spray it again so I can scrunch every part of it, but they stay in alllllll day! It even stays in the next day too when I don&#x27;t wash my hair when I shower. The only thing that I recommend is that you either put a small fan or keep your bathroom fan on when you use the spray if you use a lot. Since I have to use a large amount for my hair sometimes the smell of the spray gets in my nose and then my mouth gets the taste of the spray. Also the nozzle does clog, but if you take the spray back to the store you got it from they will usually take it back if you didn&#x27;t us to much or show it was clogged (experienced). I love this product and I couldn&#x27;t have nice scrunchy hair without it. My hair even gets shiny when I use this too and my color pops out more. If you have thick hair and have a hard time keeping your hair scrunchy or surly all day then use this product, it is worth the buy.</li>
