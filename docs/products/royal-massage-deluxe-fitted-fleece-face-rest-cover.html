            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and with a regular cover over it</li>
            <li> soft and fluffy, requires only a minimal adjustment after each client to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li> Pretty thin, especially after wash.</li>
            <li> Remember it is only the cover, so it is empty and you need to pillow to put inside!</li>
            <li> Definitely made a difference on my face cradle; my clients had less marks on their faces afterwards, but still had noticeable marks.</li>
            <li> It helps a little.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little to harsh.</li>
            <li> I use these under standard cotton or flannel face rest covers, which helps provide extra comfort and protection from getting the fleece excessively dirty from make-up and oils.</li>
            <li> a few times and has not shrunk or fallen apart.  </li>
            <li> used it for awhile now and its just as fluffy and comfy as the day i got it.</li>
            <li> This face rest is not as fluffy as pictured.  </li>
            <li> I never enjoy laying prone on a massage table, so anything that makes is easier is a plus.</li>
            <li> To fluffy and everyone one tells me they can&#x27;t breath when this is on the head rest.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about shrinkage, was in cold water, with a little bleach, and line dry it!</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting soft plush type of feel and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wanted to buy another but currently unavavilable! :(</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this cover would solve my problem of having too hard of a head rest, (face plate?</li>
            <li> Bad bad quality&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ended up paying money :(</li>

            <li> I work in a wellnes center with many massage therapist - discovered this wonderful little plus for your clients there and just had to have one for my Reiki healing room - my clients love it and I love anything that makes my clients happier.  very affordable and got here fast!</li>
            <li> soft and fluffy, requires only a minimal adjustment after each client to keep it in place.  very nice, especially for the price</li>
            <li> This has been a great addition to my massage table.  It helps keep the client&#x27;s face a little bit more comfortable when laying prone.  It is nice to have your face against something soft and pillow like, instead of just the regular face cradle.  I have washed it (not putting it in the dryer) a few times and has not shrunk or fallen apart.  I am happy with this product</li>
            <li> As described very comfortable!</li>
            <li> bought it to have as extra to the table and cradle set I already had.  used it for awhile now and its just as fluffy and comfy as the day i got it.</li>
            <li> Love this. More comfortable than normal towel</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this cover would solve my problem of having too hard of a head rest, (face plate? I&#x27;m an novice massage person) but it really does make a difference, and for 11.95, what a deal!</li>
            <li> No one likes &#x27;face cradle face&#x27; nor pressure to the face if you have sinus issues. Get this. It helps a little.</li>
            <li> Definitely made a difference on my face cradle; my clients had less marks on their faces afterwards, but still had noticeable marks. Clients also said it was more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This cover is made for the larger face cradles.  With very lax elastic, it slips and slides on mine.  Ended up paying money :( to have tighter? elastic put in.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister who&#x27;s studying massage.  The quality seems very good, but I haven&#x27;t seen how it holds up long-term.</li>
            <li> This face rest is not as fluffy as pictured.  I really need one so I will use it, but will order from another company for a thicker cover.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s irised right and it truly gets the job done. Works great on my bed</li>
            <li> This is a great face rest cover! If you&#x27;re worried about shrinkage, was in cold water, with a little bleach, and line dry it! I use these under standard cotton or flannel face rest covers, which helps provide extra comfort and protection from getting the fleece excessively dirty from make-up and oils. Great price, and functions well!</li>
            <li> great product makes bed more comfortable for my clients</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft! I never enjoy laying prone on a massage table, so anything that makes is easier is a plus.</li>
            <li> Great size. It&#x27;s not bulky, and it fits the face cradle and leaves enough room to breathe. I think it&#x27;s increased the clients&#x27; comfort.</li>
            <li> The product in itself is very nice and soft but I ordered it, thinking it was an actual pillow. Remember it is only the cover, so it is empty and you need to pillow to put inside!</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable. Easy to wash and dry!</li>
            <li> This is a great cushion for sensitive faces. Not everyone feels comfortable sticking their face in a face cradle but this makes it so much softer.</li>
            <li> Pretty thin, especially after wash. I guess I was expecting soft plush type of feel and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this and it fits nicely with cradle covers and over the face rest.  Had hoped for washing instructions....maybe I missed them in the original packaging...</li>

            <li> Incredibly comfortable, everyone that has had a massage when I have had this one the facerest have had nothing but good things to say.  Also, it is appealing to the eye, and so when someone sees this, they immediately feel like they are being pampered and that they will be comfortable while getting the massage, which helps to set them into a good state of mind to receive.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Nice and fluffy.  Prevents massage lines on the face on my clients. So glad I ordered 2.  1 for office and 1 for home use.</li>

            <li> I wanted something I could take to my acupuncturist. I don&#x27;t like the cover she uses, it&#x27;s a little to harsh. This is perfect!</li>
            <li> Bad bad quality&lt;br /&gt;Never buy it, it is simple waist of time and money&lt;br /&gt;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just never buy it again</li>
