            <li>Great transaction and arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li>the price is very cheap when I bought the item.</li>
            <li>Had one before and needed to order more.  </li>
            <li>But the color was nice and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>Cover girl does an excellent job with quality products, this is no different!</li>
            <li>Love this eye shadow.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>i love covergirl products</li>
            <li>love the way this shadow looks on my eyes</li>
            <li>Love this eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>Better than going to the pharmacy or grocery store.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and its easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Cant ask more for a free item.</li>
            <li>Blends well and applies easily though.</li>
            <li>It is a light color</li>
            <li>I say, I got this free??</li>
            <li>I got this cheap and would not buy again - picture smashing up a stick of chalk to powder dust and applying that.</li>
            <li>; the shipping was free.  </li>
            <li>It spreads quite smoothly and I would love to order more colors very soon.</li>
            <li>The color is a bit lighter than I thought but still a nice color to high light with.</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with Cover Girl cosmetics.</li>
            <li>And the price is right!</li>
            <li>This is a good color for eyeshadow but in each of the individual eyeshadow containers, the eyeshadow was cracked and crumbled.</li>
            <li>This is a great light color for everyday use, or you can use it in combination with a darker color for an evening look.</li>
            <li>I mainly go with more neutral colors when purchasing eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying it again once I ran out of the current one.  </li>
            <li>I received this item very quickly so prompt delivery is always appreciated.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>, I feel that this size is just right.</li>
            <li>Its very soft and the applicator brush is good enough to apply well.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>Would prefer more shimmer, especially since the color is so muted.</li>
            <li>The color is whiter than depicted but it is a pretty shade.</li>
            <li>I got it when Amazon was offering $1 or $2 (can&#x27;t really remember exactly) coupon and</li>
            <li>It takes some doing to build up color on the eyelid, but once on, I have to say with added dark liner, it is a nice effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, the day I bought this, Amazon had a coupon clip for the same value as that of the product and shipping free.</li>
            <li>It has a little bit of shimmer to the shadow and its just a nice soft ivory color</li>
            <li>but I love CoverGirl Eye Enhancers and wanted to try something new - works well blended with other colors</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I personally enjoy the natural look, sometimes even using to cover over my under eye dark circles!</li>
            <li>Arrived completely smashed like powder.</li>
            <li>, I feel it really helps to open up my eyes.</li>
            <li>Very neutral color that tends to blend in with my skin color, not really any shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>love this shadow but it came broken into a hundred pieces.</li>

            <li> I was not surprised at my satisfaction with this shadow.</li>
            <li> The shadow holds fairly well when I used a foundation base.</li>
            <li> Good eye shadow, works well for base coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores where I live so thank you, amazon!</li>
            <li> The formula doesn&#x27;t dry out or wear off or settle in the creases of the eye lid.</li>
            <li> Nice brow bone highlight cold!</li>
            <li> Does that mean it&#x27;s old?</li>
            <li> Was packed loosely in a box with other things...was not worth returning.</li>
            <li> However, the consistency is weird, very chalky, crumbly, and dry.</li>
            <li> Came in a powdery mess  All loose and damaged.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my eye shadow arrived all broken up, I thing due to packing (was just loosely banging around inside a HUGE box during shipping)</li>
            <li> My friends told me my eyes look shimmer and little</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting very hard to find at any store, as I understand CG is going to round pots of shadow instead of the square (per CVS employee).</li>
            <li> Gave it 3 stars because it arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> It arrived broken and never got a replacement.</li>
            <li> Product came as broken piece inside.</li>
            <li> The powder was broken</li>
            <li> With comments about product getting crumbled on arrival, I was very skeptical as to how it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want that to reflect badly on the product.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible..</li>

            <li> Good covergirl shadow.</li>
            <li> It is a light color but I love CoverGirl Eye Enhancers and wanted to try something new - works well blended with other colors</li>
            <li> I like the pan size to be big enough that I&#x27;m not struggling to get the shadow onto the brush, I feel that this size is just right. I also like that when I find a color I like I have a lot of it.  It has a little bit of shimmer to the shadow and its just a nice soft ivory color, I feel it really helps to open up my eyes. The shadow holds fairly well when I used a foundation base. Does not crease and last all day.</li>
            <li> Came in a powdery mess  All loose and damaged.  Must have been ancient and expired product to be that damaged on arrival.</li>
            <li> It arrived broken and never got a replacement. But the color was nice and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is a great light color for everyday use, or you can use it in combination with a darker color for an evening look. CoverGirl never dissapoints me. I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeshadow! It&#x27;s a great base with no creasing at all. And the price is right! It&#x27;s hard to find in stores where I live so thank you, amazon!</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to eye lighter for years. It&#x27;s getting very hard to find at any store, as I understand CG is going to round pots of shadow instead of the square (per CVS employee). I absolutely LOVE this color!</li>

            <li> Horrible..Product came as broken piece inside. Since I bought it in $0.09, I did not bother to return instead of throwing it in trash can.</li>
            <li> I mainly go with more neutral colors when purchasing eye shadow. This color has worked out great</li>
            <li> Very fair, nude color. I personally enjoy the natural look, sometimes even using to cover over my under eye dark circles! Unfortunately my eye shadow arrived all broken up, I thing due to packing (was just loosely banging around inside a HUGE box during shipping) but I didn&#x27;t want that to reflect badly on the product.
