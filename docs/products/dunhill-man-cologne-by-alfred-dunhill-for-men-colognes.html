            <li>Amazing perfume and delivery!</li>
            <li>great price good timing</li>
            <li>It is impeccably svelte, and for me, a go-to fragrance for any business-formal occasion - meetings with clients or executives, presentations, interviews.</li>
            <li>Dunhill is the best smelling toilette spray for men, women love it.</li>
            <li>Item arrived in great shape and I am very pleased with the aroma.  </li>
            <li>, is so good  </li>
            <li>it smells really good to me 2)</li>
            <li>it smells really good to the women in my life.  </li>
            <li>Its still good, though not as good as i remembered.</li>
            <li>always loved this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Simply one of the best i like Dunhill products and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li>This fragrance has a light and elegant scent perfect for summer.</li>
            <li>I immediately thought of Amazon and to my delight, was able to find it here!</li>
            <li>Dunhill Man wasn&#x27;t impressive at first spray, I admit.</li>
            <li>Even if one has many pleasant scents, nothing can replace the kind of cologne that completes a well-dressed individual/man.</li>
            <li>Always get complimented all the time from females about how nice I smell, Not too played out either.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful light scent that won&#x27;t smell soapy or cheap.  </li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>A nice warm weather scent.</li>
            <li>Mostly just business-formal and business-casual attire, then of course, something for family outings or just to smell nice around the house.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never run across a lady (especially a sophisticated, classy one) who doesn&#x27;t comment favorably about Dunhill Man.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, I realized this linear cologne with pleasant sillage, clear projection and confident all day wear is a splendid gift.</li>
            <li>I love the way my man smells in this.  </li>
            <li>i absolutely love this scent for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>Stock up while you can if you wear it or want more of it for the man in your life...</li>
            <li>Using it for 3 years ago and now still love it.</li>
            <li>Better than any brand that i have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most favorite perfume that I like .</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not a snob about it; I love Montale oudhs</li>
            <li>It may be considered &#x27;sexy&#x27; but not warm/intimate, as most of those &#x27;reds&#x27; would use more ambergris and spice notes, cinammon or cardamom.</li>
            <li>More of an diluted version...</li>
            <li>I have been a Dunhill user for many years</li>
            <li>My fianc√© and I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>May need to order more to stock up since it&#x27;s no longer being manufactured.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend bought this cologne for me and now it is my favorite of all time.</li>
            <li>guys gotta have this one for sure.</li>
            <li>Love love this smell.</li>
            <li>The original is a really nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool and ladies love the smell of it.:)</li>
            <li>The sillage and longevity are both excellent for a synthetic designer fragrance, pretty darn near an \\&quot;all-day\\&quot; fragrance when applied to fabric.</li>
            <li>its sweet and fresh but smells soo soo good</li>
            <li>Sometimes it takes a while to appreciate a fine fragrance.</li>
            <li>not too powerful or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>We always buy this fragrance, however this time it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original....</li>
            <li>Have enjoyed this cologne for many years, along with many compliments daily.  </li>
            <li>Its a woodsy, spicy, clean scent and its not overpowering.</li>
            <li>it has a light scent but very fragrant.it&#x27;s not over powering like most men cologne.</li>
            <li>This original Dunhill scent is by far my favorite men&#x27;s cologne of all time!  </li>
            <li>This fragrance has turned me into a fan of dunhill fragrances with this one being my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite but it is very pricey.  </li>
            <li>This is as good for day time business wear as for a romantic evening out.</li>
            <li>Good for the office when you need a scent that is not too big.</li>
            <li>I own more than 50 designer colognes (my favorite designers being Armani (by far), Bvlgari, Burberry, Christian Dior, Gucci).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unique and worth trying, I get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li>Dunhill is smooth and elegant not pungent or remindful of \\&quot;cheap aftershave\\&quot; like most other fragrances these days.  </li>
            <li>a clean and fresh smell with a hint of sweetness and spice to it.</li>
            <li>Great aroma and is subtle not like most of the men&#x27;s cologne these days.</li>
            <li>I (and also my wife...) love the very masculine smell of it.</li>
            <li>I have all kinds of colognes - Aqua, Fresh, Citrus, Woody, Musky, Spicy etc.</li>
            <li>But Dunhill has it&#x27;s own merits aside from being what I would call in the same cologne &amp;#34;family&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>I have bought this perfume more than 10 times from various sellers and I am completely familiar with the smell.</li>
            <li>I am a mens cologne whore and this has to be in my all time top 5, probably near the top of that short list too.</li>
            <li>It is a crisp refreshing scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm and definitely doesn&#x27;t carry the dominant musk smell that so many associate with masculine colognes.</li>
            <li>Please stay away from this wonderful fragrance as I fear it will become harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most pleasant, sophisticated and high quality colognes for men that will be universally appreciated - especially by discerning people who like classy sophisticated (as opposed to dark or loud) fragrances and if it suits your chemistry you will be complimented by women (and men) all day.</li>
            <li>Very fresh, clean, masculine, sophisticated and soothing - not overpowering but lasts a long time (on me).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy who&#x27;s secure enough with your manhood to sometimes use a little cologne, this is a great</li>
            <li>Actually I think it is not being produced any more.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite after Armania Mania (which is from paradise).</li>
            <li>Thanks Dunhill and Amazon!  </li>
            <li>the first one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You cannot go wrong with this fragrance and the price was perfect.</li>
            <li>It has been my favorite for several years!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and every woman I meet feels the same way.  </li>
            <li>Dunill for Man has a sweet floral top note with a sweet, sophisticated musky dry down.</li>
            <li>Product is unassuming and yet always gets positive attention.</li>
            <li>All of which is to say, I have a significant wardrobe, broad tastes in fragrances, and experience.</li>
            <li>I am an avid fragrance collector with an almost embarrassingly large collection of fragrances, including a number of high-end fragrances (numerous selections from Montale, Creeds, Amouage, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, and other high-quality perfumeries), foreign imports including many attars and oudhs, and many, many synthetic designer fragrances.</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>This scent is very manly.  </li>
            <li>Just about every one went straight to the Dunhill Man.  </li>
            <li>Two things I really like about</li>
            <li>but some of my very favorites are $10 to $50 per bottle.</li>
            <li>A very refined, understated scent.</li>
            <li>Clean, mature and professional, indeed.</li>
            <li>Too simple and straightforward: lemon, cedar and sandalwood scenting like a lone candle.</li>
            <li>I have received more comments on this cologne than any other I have ever worn.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I&#x27;ve already purchased a new bottle, sitting on the shelf for the moment</li>
            <li>Classic.</li>
            <li>It is a classic that&#x27;s not overwheming.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this is a truly great fragrance and a must-have for any professional man who takes his fragrance wardrobe seriously!</li>
            <li>This has a high oil content......  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>and this was a different color and smell than the original authentic dunhill i have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering but very masculine scent.</li>
            <li>This was my first, and will be my last online cologne purchase.</li>
            <li>If you like a masculine smelling fragrance with earthy undertones, this is not for you!</li>
            <li>I have always had a sensitive sense of smell, even when I compare the old bottle to the new</li>
            <li>A little on who I am (as that matters in terms of what your relevant wardrobe is).</li>
            <li>One of my old standbys.</li>
            <li>I remember when this cologne was at least double what it is now, so I&#x27;m loving the price I got this for.  </li>
            <li>A little too sweet and understated for winter.</li>
            <li>it is an elegant and complex cologne that begins with a subtle blend of spice and citrus the smoothly transitions into</li>
            <li>He really likes Dunhill fragrances because they last a long time but are not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a father and husband, in his 30s, middle class professional.</li>
            <li>recently got married, so I&#x27;m careful about wearing it, but it&#x27;s one of my &amp;#34;safe bets&amp;#34; when I consider using a cologne.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine wore this one night, and I thought he had found a new source of Grey Flannel!</li>
            <li>I discovered Dunhill Man by walking into several Macy&#x27;s in my area and asking the women behind the fragrance counter what their favorite fragrance was.  </li>
            <li>It does have a citrusy-floral top note, the base note is more sandalwood, and although it doesn&#x27;t show up in the pyramid, I swear the combination smells like a \\&quot;dark lilac\\&quot;.</li>

            <li> All of which is to say, I have a significant wardrobe, broad tastes in fragrances, and experience.</li>
            <li> I am an avid fragrance collector with an almost embarrassingly large collection of fragrances, including a number of high-end fragrances (numerous selections from Montale, Creeds, Amouage, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, and other high-quality perfumeries), foreign imports including many attars and oudhs, and many, many synthetic designer fragrances.</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> This scent is very manly.  </li>
            <li> Just about every one went straight to the Dunhill Man.  </li>
            <li> Two things I really like about</li>
            <li> but some of my very favorites are $10 to $50 per bottle.</li>
            <li> A very refined, understated scent.</li>
            <li> Clean, mature and professional, indeed.</li>
            <li> Too simple and straightforward: lemon, cedar and sandalwood scenting like a lone candle.</li>
            <li> I have received more comments on this cologne than any other I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I&#x27;ve already purchased a new bottle, sitting on the shelf for the moment</li>
            <li> Classic.</li>
            <li> It is a classic that&#x27;s not overwheming.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this is a truly great fragrance and a must-have for any professional man who takes his fragrance wardrobe seriously!</li>
            <li> This has a high oil content......  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> and this was a different color and smell than the original authentic dunhill i have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering but very masculine scent.</li>
            <li> This was my first, and will be my last online cologne purchase.</li>
            <li> If you like a masculine smelling fragrance with earthy undertones, this is not for you!</li>
            <li> I have always had a sensitive sense of smell, even when I compare the old bottle to the new</li>
            <li> A little on who I am (as that matters in terms of what your relevant wardrobe is).</li>
            <li> One of my old standbys.</li>
            <li> I remember when this cologne was at least double what it is now, so I&#x27;m loving the price I got this for.  </li>
            <li> A little too sweet and understated for winter.</li>
            <li> it is an elegant and complex cologne that begins with a subtle blend of spice and citrus the smoothly transitions into</li>
            <li> He really likes Dunhill fragrances because they last a long time but are not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a father and husband, in his 30s, middle class professional.</li>
            <li> recently got married, so I&#x27;m careful about wearing it, but it&#x27;s one of my &amp;#34;safe bets&amp;#34; when I consider using a cologne.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine wore this one night, and I thought he had found a new source of Grey Flannel!</li>
            <li> I discovered Dunhill Man by walking into several Macy&#x27;s in my area and asking the women behind the fragrance counter what their favorite fragrance was.  </li>
            <li> It does have a citrusy-floral top note, the base note is more sandalwood, and although it doesn&#x27;t show up in the pyramid, I swear the combination smells like a \\&quot;dark lilac\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I usually wear this one for the evening out, not so much the day time.</li>
            <li> Not a professional, but also not a layman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays in your cloths for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not normally found in department stores.</li>
            <li> The perfume cap is totally loose.</li>
            <li> It is the same quality as previous purchases of Dunhill sprays.  </li>
            <li> Waaaay too weak to be real cologne.</li>
            <li> Just with it would last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> However, it could be too clean for night time party wear for some because its absolutely not the dark, heavy, spicy type that some prefer for &#x27;upping&#x27; their seductive game on a night out.</li>
            <li> i received my package sooner than expected, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years, and it seems to keep getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li> Not much need for evening formal wear.</li>
            <li> Of course they have a lot of scents and I am careful to get the one I prefer.</li>
            <li> They like my other fragrances, but they request me to wear the Dunhill.</li>
            <li> Would recommend other to use it.</li>
            <li> or other flower, and sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Watered down, or expired.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of some of the other Dunhill fragrances, but Dunhill Man is among my all-time favorites.</li>
            <li> Hard to get and getting harder.  </li>
            <li> This is not the type of cologne that you will pick up once in a while for a change - you will want to wear it everyday and buy again and again for yourself and as gift.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to this for a few years.</li>
            <li> This one is really fake.</li>
            <li> I was cheated and misled and ripped off from purchasing this Dunhill Cologne - I received fake artificial Dunhill cologne.</li>
            <li> Base note is musk and balsam.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very good choise I can&#x27;t complaing at all  I like it so much, is so good  very happy u  recomend  it</li>
            <li> Great scent that lingers.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has turned me into a fan of dunhill fragrances with this one being my absolute favorite. I (and also my wife...) love the very masculine smell of it.</li>
            <li> great price good timing</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite but it is very pricey.  Actually I think it is not being produced any more.</li>
            <li> I own more than 50 designer colognes (my favorite designers being Armani (by far), Bvlgari, Burberry, Christian Dior, Gucci). This is my second favorite after Armania Mania (which is from paradise). I have all kinds of colognes - Aqua, Fresh, Citrus, Woody, Musky, Spicy etc. Dunill for Man has a sweet floral top note with a sweet, sophisticated musky dry down. Base note is musk and balsam. Very fresh, clean, masculine, sophisticated and soothing - not overpowering but lasts a long time (on me). This is as good for day time business wear as for a romantic evening out. However, it could be too clean for night time party wear for some because its absolutely not the dark, heavy, spicy type that some prefer for &#x27;upping&#x27; their seductive game on a night out. This is one of the most pleasant, sophisticated and high quality colognes for men that will be universally appreciated - especially by discerning people who like classy sophisticated (as opposed to dark or loud) fragrances and if it suits your chemistry you will be complimented by women (and men) all day. This is not the type of cologne that you will pick up once in a while for a change - you will want to wear it everyday and buy again and again for yourself and as gift.</li>
            <li> I love the way my man smells in this.  I get him some every year for Christmas.  Its a woodsy, spicy, clean scent and its not overpowering.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this scent for my boyfriend. it has a light scent but very fragrant.it&#x27;s not over powering like most men cologne. i find it upsetting to know that it is discontinued. which means if i can find it i have to stock up.... i received my package sooner than expected, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> Dunhill discontinued this fragrance.  As of this writing Amazon still has it at a great price.  Stock up while you can if you wear it or want more of it for the man in your life...</li>
            <li> This original Dunhill scent is by far my favorite men&#x27;s cologne of all time!  When I found out I could no longer buy it at a retail outlet I was very disappointed.  I immediately thought of Amazon and to my delight, was able to find it here! My husband smells wonderful again!  Thanks Dunhill and Amazon!  You&#x27;re a perfect pair!</li>
            <li> great price and value !</li>
            <li> i happened upon this fragrance while browsing, took a brief whiff of it and bought it IMMEDIATELY.  it is an elegant and complex cologne that begins with a subtle blend of spice and citrus the smoothly transitions into musk-like tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;prospective buyers may want to reference scents like Kenneth Cole Signature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, delivered on-time!</li>
            <li> Using it for 3 years ago and now still love it. Better than any brand that i have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This scent is very manly.  When you smell in on a man in passing, it makes you turn your head to see who is wearing it.  It is a great scent for fall and winter!</li>
            <li> This cologne rocks!!  I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years, and it seems to keep getting harder to find.  I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on this stuff, and the women love it!!!  The upside is that this gets cheaper as time goes on.  I remember when this cologne was at least double what it is now, so I&#x27;m loving the price I got this for.  This has a high oil content......  You don&#x27;t need to bathe in this stuff, it has staying power and the bottle will last for quite a while.  I will be getting another bottle of this soon just to have it on hand.</li>
            <li> Dunhill is smooth and elegant not pungent or remindful of \\&quot;cheap aftershave\\&quot; like most other fragrances these days.  I highly recommend it.  Even if one has many pleasant scents, nothing can replace the kind of cologne that completes a well-dressed individual/man.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most favorite perfume that I like . It&#x27;s cool and ladies love the smell of it.:)</li>
            <li> Classic. Always get complimented all the time from females about how nice I smell, Not too played out either. I&#x27;m stuck on it!</li>
            <li> Great price, great scent.</li>
            <li> Perfect blend of scents for men</li>
            <li> I discovered Dunhill Man by walking into several Macy&#x27;s in my area and asking the women behind the fragrance counter what their favorite fragrance was.  Just about every one went straight to the Dunhill Man.  It has a wonderful light scent that won&#x27;t smell soapy or cheap.  Two things I really like about the fragrance is 1) it smells really good to me 2) it smells really good to the women in my life.  They like my other fragrances, but they request me to wear the Dunhill.</li>
            <li> It is a classic that&#x27;s not overwheming. Not normally found in department stores. It is now a part of my personal items and I will not reveal to anyone.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes a while to appreciate a fine fragrance. Dunhill Man wasn&#x27;t impressive at first spray, I admit. Too simple and straightforward: lemon, cedar and sandalwood scenting like a lone candle. However, I realized this linear cologne with pleasant sillage, clear projection and confident all day wear is a splendid gift. Who needs tricks as the notes evolve with each bottle in a collection? Clean, mature and professional, indeed. I reach for it often.</li>
            <li> wonderful smell, lifts you up.</li>
            <li> The Dunhill spray (brown) for men is a great product. The dilivery was on time or sooner. I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Waaaay too weak to be real cologne. Watered down, or expired. This was my first, and will be my last online cologne purchase.</li>
            <li> Simply one of the best i like Dunhill products and this is one of the best. Give it a try you wont be disaapointed</li>
            <li> A little on who I am (as that matters in terms of what your relevant wardrobe is). I&#x27;m a father and husband, in his 30s, middle class professional. I don&#x27;t go out and party. Not much need for evening formal wear. Mostly just business-formal and business-casual attire, then of course, something for family outings or just to smell nice around the house. I am an avid fragrance collector with an almost embarrassingly large collection of fragrances, including a number of high-end fragrances (numerous selections from Montale, Creeds, Amouage, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, and other high-quality perfumeries), foreign imports including many attars and oudhs, and many, many synthetic designer fragrances. I have some of the best stuff out there but I&#x27;m not a snob about it; I love Montale oudhs but some of my very favorites are $10 to $50 per bottle. All of which is to say, I have a significant wardrobe, broad tastes in fragrances, and experience. Not a professional, but also not a layman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of some of the other Dunhill fragrances, but Dunhill Man is among my all-time favorites. It does have a citrusy-floral top note, the base note is more sandalwood, and although it doesn&#x27;t show up in the pyramid, I swear the combination smells like a \\&quot;dark lilac\\&quot;. It is impeccably svelte, and for me, a go-to fragrance for any business-formal occasion - meetings with clients or executives, presentations, interviews. The sillage and longevity are both excellent for a synthetic designer fragrance, pretty darn near an \\&quot;all-day\\&quot; fragrance when applied to fabric. I like it so much that I&#x27;ve already purchased a new bottle, sitting on the shelf for the moment the first one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would also be terrific for formal evenings. It may be considered &#x27;sexy&#x27; but not warm/intimate, as most of those &#x27;reds&#x27; would use more ambergris and spice notes, cinammon or cardamom. I&#x27;m not too fond of those and despise Dunhill Red for that reason. Nevertheless, this is a truly great fragrance and a must-have for any professional man who takes his fragrance wardrobe seriously!</li>
            <li> Hard to get and getting harder.  Great aroma and is subtle not like most of the men&#x27;s cologne these days.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine wore this one night, and I thought he had found a new source of Grey Flannel! But Dunhill has it&#x27;s own merits aside from being what I would call in the same cologne &amp;#34;family&amp;#34;...wears well, and is not overpowering or too flowery.</li>
            <li> We always buy this fragrance, however this time it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original.... More of an diluted version... The original is a really nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was cheated and misled and ripped off from purchasing this Dunhill Cologne - I received fake artificial Dunhill cologne. I have been a Dunhill user for many years and this was a different color and smell than the original authentic dunhill i have used in the past. I demand a refund. I demand service and my money back.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day. He really likes Dunhill fragrances because they last a long time but are not overpowering. This one is a definite keeper!</li>
            <li> My fianc√© and I love this cologne. May need to order more to stock up since it&#x27;s no longer being manufactured.</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume and delivery!</li>
            <li> Item arrived in great shape and I am very pleased with the aroma.  It is the same quality as previous purchases of Dunhill sprays.  Of course they have a lot of scents and I am careful to get the one I prefer.</li>
            <li> I like it. It stays in your cloths for a long time. Very good perfume looking to its price in amazon.</li>
            <li> This item is fake for sure. The perfume cap is totally loose. I have bought this perfume more than 10 times from various sellers and I am completely familiar with the smell. This one is really fake. Do not buy it from this site.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000C212OY B000C212OY]]</li>
            <li> Its still good, though not as good as i remembered. Its smell a bit weaker now. Donno, maybe its just me</li>
            <li> Not overpowering but very masculine scent. I usually wear this one for the evening out, not so much the day time. Couple pumps keeps through the night. At amazon&#x27;s price I think this is a deal.</li>
            <li> One of my old standbys. Product is unassuming and yet always gets positive attention.</li>
            <li> Great, long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li> nice. not too powerful or overwhelming. on the sweeter side. i like it.</li>
            <li> I used this perfume for my Friday&#x27;s party. Everyone ask which perfume is this as soon as I enter the party. Would recommend other to use it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy who&#x27;s secure enough with your manhood to sometimes use a little cologne, this is a great one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never run across a lady (especially a sophisticated, classy one) who doesn&#x27;t comment favorably about Dunhill Man.&lt;br /&gt;I recently got married, so I&#x27;m careful about wearing it, but it&#x27;s one of my &amp;#34;safe bets&amp;#34; when I consider using a cologne.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a light and elegant scent perfect for summer. You cannot go wrong with this fragrance and the price was perfect.</li>
            <li> Great scent under dog cologne</li>
            <li> this makes my husband smell delicious&lt;br /&gt; its sweet and fresh but smells soo soo good, you wont be sorry :)</li>
            <li> I have received more comments on this cologne than any other I have ever worn. It has been my favorite for several years!</li>
            <li> Dunhill is the best smelling toilette spray for men, women love it. Women always ask what are you wearing that smells great.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this cologne for me and now it is my favorite of all time. a clean and fresh smell with a hint of sweetness and spice to it. guys gotta have this one for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and every woman I meet feels the same way.  Just with it would last a little longer.  It is a crisp refreshing scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm and definitely doesn&#x27;t carry the dominant musk smell that so many associate with masculine colognes.</li>
            <li> I though it is just a perfume, but when I open the box, the product came with a 2.5 Ounces perfume and lostion. It is a gift set! Good price for this product!!</li>
            <li> Please stay away from this wonderful fragrance as I fear it will become harder and harder to find. I am a mens cologne whore and this has to be in my all time top 5, probably near the top of that short list too. If you like a masculine smelling fragrance with earthy undertones, this is not for you!</li>
            <li> always loved this fragrance. it&#x27;s unique and worth trying, I get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> What every man needs...</li>
            <li> Just the scent I remembered</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband on his birthday to replace one that he had used up.  He likes it and so do I.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed this cologne for many years, along with many compliments daily.  I think the manufacturer has changed. As the scent seems very different to me. I have always had a sensitive sense of smell, even when I compare the old bottle to the new it is different.</li>
            <li> Love love this smell. I think I&#x27;ll stick to this for a few years.</li>
            <li> A very refined, understated scent. A powdery mixture of citrus, musk, lavender? or other flower, and sandalwood. I get 5 or so hours out of this. A little too sweet and understated for winter. A nice warm weather scent. Good for the office when you need a scent that is not too big.</li>
