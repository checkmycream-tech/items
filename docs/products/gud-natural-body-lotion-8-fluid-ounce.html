            <li>Absolutely love this lotion!</li>
            <li>I personally love the scent, too!</li>
            <li>This is the one that is my ALL TIME FAVORITE!  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Warm Vanilla Sugar body lotion from Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>
            <li>get so many compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>it smells great and smells clean.  </li>
            <li>She thinks it would be suitable for all females or anyone wanting something nice.</li>
            <li>However, it was very strong smelling.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>This is such an awesome smelling lotion.</li>
            <li>but it still does not smell quite so magical as the shampoo does.</li>
            <li>Smells great and really moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>I found more on amazon.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>This lotion soothes my knuckles better than intensive moisturizing with A&amp;D ointment.</li>
            <li>The lotion does its job and the copy is cute beyond belief but the scent makes me nauseous.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a nice light feel and scent.  </li>
            <li>My favorite scented lotion</li>
            <li>this is by far my favorite smell and feel of body lotion, it&#x27;s non greasy and makes your skin feel and smell great.</li>
            <li>- it has a light and more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; vanilla smell (it does say rice milk on it)</li>
            <li>Loved this lotion so much that I bought the body wash and separate hand cream.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, but it&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li>This smells great and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly, so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards.</li>
            <li>The tube is easy to squeeze and the product doesn&#x27;t pour out.</li>
            <li>If you like a strong flowery smelling lotion, than this is for you.  </li>
            <li>Boom, it works wonderfully without it weighing it all down.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I also use it for a light moisturizer for my hair.</li>
            <li>This lotion&#x27;s scent is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Scent makes me super nauseous and it doesn&#x27;t wash away easily.</li>
            <li>The vanilla flame has a nice mellow scent - barely sweet with a little spice, a nice light lingering scent since i don&#x27;t handle a lot of fragrance well.  </li>
            <li>#34;What are you wearing?&amp;#34;  I also love that this lotion is very creamy and emollient.  </li>
            <li>Have had several friends try a &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; and they all loved the scent.  </li>
            <li>I love it and HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>Rite Aid sells out of these rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s made w/ natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I think it has a fresh, airy sent.</li>
            <li>- they are both pretty strongly scented but sweet and still pretty for her (way too much for me, though).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely good quality lotion, they just need to tone it down on the smelly part.</li>
            <li>Lotion absorbs nicely into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or too dry after.  </li>
            <li>Once absorbed, skin is soft, not sticky, and lightly scented.</li>
            <li>Was surprised to have experienced such a powerful reaction to a fairly pure and natural product.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a big fan of the Burt&#x27;s Bees line of products, so i decided to try this and now love the G&amp;uuml;d line.  </li>
            <li>The texture is great; thick, creamy, silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This taught me a lesson about buying something scented without smelling it first.  </li>
            <li>The strength of the smell wears off quickly though and it becomes more subtle and sweet rather quickly.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft but not greasy or scratchy</li>
            <li>The scent is strong enough</li>
            <li>It makes my hands feel very silky and my skin altogether.</li>
            <li>I bought this just because I dig the smell of the shampoo so much.</li>
            <li>You can get just as much as you need.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this scent and brand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After application, it feels kinda sticky, but that goes away after it absorbs, which it does really well.</li>
            <li>It smells like a cross between sandalwood and vanilla and is rich and creamy, yet never greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of pretty natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I figured if it&#x27;s good for your skin and nails, my hair is no different since it&#x27;s protein and dead cells anyhow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>As far as the lotion itself goes, it works really well, and it isn&#x27;t greasy or slimy feeling.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin, even very rough places silky and smelling fantastic.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that&#x27;s the case for this one :)</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft, moisturized</li>
            <li>I like to use natural products.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that it is natural.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft without being greasy and the smell is heaven.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I primarily use raw shea butter as my skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have pretty coarse long hair</li>
            <li>Got it on a whim, love this vanilla scent - it&#x27;s not liked &amp;#34;baked goods&amp;#34; vanilla, or french vanilla</li>
            <li>However, it REALLY irritated my skin, leaving itchy red streaks--bad enough that I could see the outline of my fingers where I rubbed it on my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>My knuckles and webbing in between my fingers are very sensitive and become red and cracked all the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never heard of this product before until I saw it in my local Kroger in the natural products aisle.</li>
            <li>is because Rite Aid is completely out of this lotion as I bought the last bottle.  </li>
            <li>and I disliked it the first time I put it on.</li>

            <li> and I disliked it the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li> it has a very strong scent - it&#x27;s just not vanilla! :(</li>
            <li> Similarly, it appears to go on a little thickly when you first put it on</li>
            <li> My skin, especially my hands, still feel dry and tight after using it.</li>
            <li> Like CRAZY strong.</li>
            <li> I actually bought mine at Rite Aid and paid a little more due to tax, but it was the same base price.</li>
            <li> Which was unbeatable by any other.</li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble with dry skin since switching to this brand.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little oily, greasy for a minute after applying, then she said it can even feel a little sticky  (on wet or dry skin) but that after it absorbs that you forget it was.  </li>
            <li> a little peppery almost...</li>
            <li> the lotion works just fine on my skin, i just can&#x27;t deal with the smell. :(</li>
            <li> but the scent is way too heavy.</li>
            <li> so not sure if it&#x27;s that.  </li>
            <li> this is probably because I have hair on my arms, and it just feels weird having lotion dry on hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally the worst vanilla scent ever, in my view, AND it&#x27;s so strong that when my boyfriend told me I had to wash it off, even after 2 rounds of washing, it still made both of us gag.  </li>
            <li> Hard to describe,</li>
            <li> She says it is thick creamy.  </li>
            <li> Hand cream is really thick.  </li>
            <li> Although I like how thick and creamy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the pink bottle of Gud Lotion though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically have reactions to scented lotions, but this was a disappointing exception.</li>
            <li> (as bath and body works lotion tends to make me feel greasy and lotions from victoria secret make me feel scratchy)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people think it smells bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad this was discontinued.</li>
            <li> i was so disappointed to smell this lotion.</li>
            <li> I hate when you get attached to a scent</li>

            <li> This is such an awesome smelling lotion. It&#x27;s made of pretty natural ingredients. You can find it in Stop &amp; Shop but sometimes they don&#x27;t carry the specific sent so I ordered on Amazon</li>
            <li> If you like a strong flowery smelling lotion, than this is for you.  Yuck- I&#x27;ll be throwing this out.</li>
            <li> Scent makes me super nauseous and it doesn&#x27;t wash away easily. Great at moisturizing skin but the scent is way too heavy. Was surprised to have experienced such a powerful reaction to a fairly pure and natural product.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells fantastic.  I receive compliments all the time and people are always asking me &amp;#34;What are you wearing?&amp;#34;  I also love that this lotion is very creamy and emollient.  I have not had any trouble with dry skin since switching to this brand.  Vanilla Flame will be a stable in morning routine for years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of this product before until I saw it in my local Kroger in the natural products aisle. It makes my hands feel very silky and my skin altogether. I strictly use it for my hands and for the scent when I&#x27;m out and about. I primarily use raw shea butter as my skin moisturizer. I also use it for a light moisturizer for my hair. I have pretty coarse long hair and I used to do this as a teenager cause I figured if it&#x27;s good for your skin and nails, my hair is no different since it&#x27;s protein and dead cells anyhow. Boom, it works wonderfully without it weighing it all down. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> This smells great and leaves my skin soft and smooth. It absorbs very quickly, so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards.</li>
            <li> I bought this just because I dig the smell of the shampoo so much. It smells different... a little peppery almost... and I disliked it the first time I put it on. The strength of the smell wears off quickly though and it becomes more subtle and sweet rather quickly. After that I decided I like it but it still does not smell quite so magical as the shampoo does. Similarly, it appears to go on a little thickly when you first put it on but it absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft but not greasy or scratchy (as bath and body works lotion tends to make me feel greasy and lotions from victoria secret make me feel scratchy)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a big fan of the Burt&#x27;s Bees line of products, so i decided to try this and now love the G&amp;uuml;d line.  my daughter and i both use it - shampoo/conditioner, body lotion, shower gel, and body spray - she prefers the cherry blossom and pear - they are both pretty strongly scented but sweet and still pretty for her (way too much for me, though).  The vanilla flame has a nice mellow scent - barely sweet with a little spice, a nice light lingering scent since i don&#x27;t handle a lot of fragrance well.  I even use the body spray as perfume because it&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like a kid wearing fruity sprays.</li>
            <li> This lotion is delightful! It smells like a cross between sandalwood and vanilla and is rich and creamy, yet never greasy. It leaves my skin, even very rough places silky and smelling fantastic. I put it on at night for aromatherapy purposes. I can&#x27;t recommend enough!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hand lotions I have owned.  Smells great and really moisturizes.  Thank goodness I found more on amazon.</li>
            <li> ok. My wife purchased this for herself and our daughters because of the price they were offered at.  Which was unbeatable by any other. She says it is thick creamy.  The tube is easy to squeeze and the product doesn&#x27;t pour out. You can get just as much as you need. It feels a little oily, greasy for a minute after applying, then she said it can even feel a little sticky  (on wet or dry skin) but that after it absorbs that you forget it was.  It leaves your skin feeling soft, moisturized and she enjoys the scent. It isn&#x27;t overpowering but just lingering enough to be noticed.  My wife said she didn&#x27;t notice this was a Burts Bees Product my youngest daughter pointed that out. She would purchase again and would try different scents. She thinks it would be suitable for all females or anyone wanting something nice.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion! Got it on a whim, love this vanilla scent - it&#x27;s not liked &amp;#34;baked goods&amp;#34; vanilla, or french vanilla - it has a light and more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; vanilla smell (it does say rice milk on it) so not sure if it&#x27;s that.  I feel like when I put this lotion on after a shower or later in the day, it lasts, and the smell lasts on my skin.  Lotion absorbs nicely into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or too dry after.  Have had several friends try a &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; and they all loved the scent.  I wish they came in larger quantities.  Loved this lotion so much that I bought the body wash and separate hand cream.  Hand cream is really thick.  I absolutely recommend this scent and brand.  Love that it&#x27;s made w/ natural ingredients.  Only bummer is that none of the local grocery stores or retailers are carrying this scent anymore (as of June/July 2014)! I hate when you get attached to a scent and then it&#x27;s discontinued.  Not sure if that&#x27;s the case for this one :)</li>
            <li> this is by far my favorite smell and feel of body lotion, it&#x27;s non greasy and makes your skin feel and smell great. It smells like a mixture of vanilla and cedar wood. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> My knuckles and webbing in between my fingers are very sensitive and become red and cracked all the time. This lotion soothes my knuckles better than intensive moisturizing with A&amp;D ointment. I personally love the scent, too!</li>
            <li> I like to use natural products. This smells great and soothes my skin. I have it on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance. I use it on my feet before bed and the smell lulls me to sleep.</li>
            <li> I actually bought mine at Rite Aid and paid a little more due to tax, but it was the same base price. I luv the smell and my husband luvs it too.  Rite Aid sells out of these rather quickly.  I like the fact there are no petro chemicals that clog pores - I even put it on my face. The scent is strong enough so you don&#x27;t have to put on perfume - it smells great and smells clean.  I&#x27;d definately recommend to others and the only reason I&#x27;m purchasing on the Amazon site is because Rite Aid is completely out of this lotion as I bought the last bottle.  I&#x27;m not too crazy about the pink bottle of Gud Lotion though.</li>
            <li> The lotion does its job and the copy is cute beyond belief but the scent makes me nauseous. I prefer the Warm Vanilla Sugar body lotion from Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>
            <li> This lotion&#x27;s scent is fantastic.  Hard to describe, but it&#x27;s not grandma vanilla.  I don&#x27;t find it overpowering (and I use it on my hands and arms like 10 times a day).  The texture is great; thick, creamy, silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After application, it feels kinda sticky, but that goes away after it absorbs, which it does really well. (I feel like this is probably because I have hair on my arms, and it just feels weird having lotion dry on hair. Whatever, TMI, I know.)  Once absorbed, skin is soft, not sticky, and lightly scented.</li>
            <li> smells great and doesnt leave a greasy feeling after.. win win</li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice light feel and scent.  However, it REALLY irritated my skin, leaving itchy red streaks--bad enough that I could see the outline of my fingers where I rubbed it on my shoulders.  I don&#x27;t typically have reactions to scented lotions, but this was a disappointing exception.</li>
            <li> I tried it once, it is a GREAT quality moisturizer. However, it was very strong smelling. Like CRAZY strong. I tolerated it for a bit, tried it again, and can&#x27;t handle it. My nose and eyes BURNED for over an hour after putting it on. I had to wash it off vigorously. It smells like something a back alley hollywood hooker would wear to cover up the stank. Pardon my French and all that.</li>
            <li> Seems like I&#x27;m having the opposite reaction of everyone else to this product.  I&#x27;m not sure why people think it smells bad.  I think it has a fresh, airy sent. My issue with it is it doesn&#x27;t work that great.  My skin, especially my hands, still feel dry and tight after using it. Maybe I need something thicker as it seems my hands are always in water, whether I&#x27;m washing them or doing the dishes/cleaning.  I do like the fact that it is natural.</li>
            <li> Although I like how thick and creamy this lotion is, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent. It is semi overpowering. It smells good, but it&#x27;s just too much. As far as the lotion itself goes, it works really well, and it isn&#x27;t greasy or slimy feeling. It&#x27;s definitely good quality lotion, they just need to tone it down on the smelly part.</li>
            <li> This taught me a lesson about buying something scented without smelling it first.  It&#x27;s literally the worst vanilla scent ever, in my view, AND it&#x27;s so strong that when my boyfriend told me I had to wash it off, even after 2 rounds of washing, it still made both of us gag.  UGGGGGGG!  I am returning it ASAP.</li>
            <li> My favorite scented lotion</li>
            <li> i was so disappointed to smell this lotion. in my opinion, it smells nothing like vanilla anything. it has a very strong scent - it&#x27;s just not vanilla! :( the lotion works just fine on my skin, i just can&#x27;t deal with the smell. :(</li>
            <li> This is the one that is my ALL TIME FAVORITE!  It leaves my skin soft without being greasy and the smell is heaven.&lt;br /&gt;I get so many compliments on how good I smell. It&#x27;s a perfect  and I have no need for perfume. I love it and HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad this was discontinued.</li>
