            <li> Only thing I did not like is that it was cheaper to buy 2 bottles at 1.75 oz instead of 1 bottle at 3.4 which was was kind of stupid.</li>
            <li> Amazon a trusted site where if you find what your looking for thru them, it usually cheaper, faster and highly secure with you information that you wont want the criminal to get a hold of.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this scent other than to describe it as manly.  I can&#x27;t see a man who wears skinny jeans sporting this product, rather, it&#x27;s for someone who uses an axe to split wood for evening fire pits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it coupled with the same brand aftershave and it gives me a fresh and clean smell.  The cologne has pretty good staying power (I used some last night and I can still smell it slightly on my hand in the morning).</li>
            <li> The Stetson came in good time, is nice, smells great.</li>
            <li> Super!  The item was shipped fast and came when they said it would.  The picture described the item and the information give was a good description what I was buying. The item is easy to use and took little effort to install. Please with product and seller</li>
            <li> I just love Stetson products! I wear their boots, hat, and colone. I&#x27;m thinki&#x27;n...I should have been a cowboy, ride my pony on a castle drive, steali&#x27;n young girls hearts....oh, I should have been a cowboy</li>
            <li> It goes real well with the other set for my husbands Christmas and was easy to order and get it at my door..</li>
            <li> While wearing it, people constantly tell me &amp;#34;you smell great.&amp;#34;  While different scents smell different on other people, I&#x27;ve found the one to stick with.</li>
            <li> This Stetson cologne splash is great.  It&#x27;s a nice size and the smell is very nice.  I also picked us the deodorant, which is also great!  I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> i like the cologne very much it works very well i use it everyday at home i just love it</li>
            <li> Amazon a trusted site where if you find what your looking for thru them, it usually cheaper, faster and highly secure with you information that you wont want the criminal to get a hold of.</li>
            <li> This was not exactly as advertised.  Although it was advertised as &amp;#34;Cologne Splash&amp;#34;, it turned out to actually be aftershave.  Nice bottle, prompt, secure shipping, but not what was promised.  I eventually gave it as a gift, and I&#x27;ll avoid that particular Amazon supplier in the future.</li>

A former friend pointed out to me that some colognes stay with you longer than others because they react more favorably with you body chemistry, which sounds logical. For price, size, and availability, this has done well for me.</li>
            <li> Long lasting cologne.</li>
            <li> great item but no box</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband one year as stocking stuffer.  Loved the scent and he kept getting asked what he was wearing.He&#x27;s been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> Purchased 4 1.75 oz bottles . 4 were received. 2 bottles appeared to be tampered with, to the extent that the liquid had no fragrance and the liquid did not have the same amber color as that others.</li>
            <li> I recieved the after shave, when I ordered the Cologne.</li>
            <li> WTH, NO Box and appears to have been used...  Also it is after shave in a cologne bottle...</li>
            <li> aftershave not cologne</li>
            <li> Paid for cologne, got aftershave instead.  Husband uses the cologne all the time.  Also did not come in a box.  He threw it out, it&#x27;s NOT cologne, IT&#x27;S AFTERSHAVE!</li>
            <li> Bought this for one of my best friends, he loved it! Only thing I did not like is that it was cheaper to buy 2 bottles at 1.75 oz instead of 1 bottle at 3.4 which was was kind of stupid.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as expected, was not damaged, and it is the only cologne my husband uses!  It smells wonderful on him!!!  I just follow my nose!! LOL</li>
