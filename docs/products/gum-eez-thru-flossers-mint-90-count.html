            <li>Has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>These are the best out their, they don&#x27;t break easily</li>
            <li>My dentist says it&#x27;s not as good as using the string roll</li>
            <li>Good product&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy</li>
            <li>but I consider that good - it needs to &#x27;pick&#x27; things so blunt won&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>anymore thank you so much good job</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>Combining them with an existing order just made good sense to me.</li>
            <li>The flossers are excellent quality, rarely break in use.  </li>
            <li>very nice, strong and good price</li>
            <li>I love these flossers!</li>
            <li>Just love them!</li>
            <li>These are my husband&#x27;s favorite flossers!</li>
            <li>Floss works great, however the pick part bends easily and breaks off in your teeth.</li>
            <li>These are hands down the best floss pics and best value.</li>
            <li>Honestly feels like the kind of material a 99cent toy would have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li>The nice mint taste helps my mouth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>I think they are cheaper here than the stores but to be honest</li>
            <li>Honest.  </li>
            <li>Maybe good for more separated teeth.</li>
            <li>They also have a nice mint flavor.</li>
            <li>These are the absolute best on the market.</li>
            <li>I can do it while commuting or watching TV because with one hand, it&#x27;s fairly discreet and easy.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use and get a lot of gunk out from between the teeth.</li>
            <li>the rest are very strong.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>3 stars because it does not slide very easily between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This was by far the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of floss picks, and these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the strong flossers--all others break for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The string itself is okay, i guess, though not as sturdy as Plackers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>these are the best flosspicks ever, and are the only one that have 100% chance of not breaking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the ones you can get at most stores...</li>
            <li>Some of the better flossers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>but I say it&#x27;s better to use this than not floss at all.</li>
            <li>Safe purchase.</li>
            <li>I was blown away how much better</li>
            <li>Make sure to get GUM Eez-Thu.  </li>
            <li>Within a couple weeks they went through the pack I gave them and ordered more from amazon.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more on me than the floss picks.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE floss sticks, and I carry them on my person at all times.</li>
            <li>Cannot beat the price. :)</li>
            <li>After owning these I tend to floss more often.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands of flossers----</li>
            <li>These really work great</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for many years.</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>Too many of them break with just one use.  </li>
            <li>My favorite flossers.</li>
            <li>Gum Eez-Thru Flossers Mint, 90 count is ok for the price.</li>
            <li>In 3x90 days, I&#x27;ll order some more.</li>
            <li>These are also comfortable (they aren&#x27;t the silky tape kind that I used to like, but I don&#x27;t miss it after using these).</li>
            <li>I tried them all and these are simply the best.</li>
            <li>Using for many years.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Better than floss or toothpicks.</li>
            <li>My dentist said my teeth are better than ever.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Others are much better.</li>
            <li>Love these...wish they had them 30 years ago...</li>
            <li>I have one crown that gives me the most problems with these, it tends to break them</li>
            <li>you think of all the problems you can develop by not practicing good oral hygiene, these are so worth it.</li>
            <li>Love these flossers..</li>
            <li>The 6th one was able to do all my teeth, but 5 broke almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy any more of these.</li>
            <li>that don&#x27;t break on me :)</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very strong.  </li>
            <li>These Flossers are strong and easy to handle!  </li>
            <li>This was great to get in the large packages, good price, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>just okay. doesn&#x27;t glide easily between teeth</li>
            <li>and I always did, just buy these disposable flossers and enjoy healthy teeth.</li>
            <li>good price, fast shipping, etc</li>
            <li>Loved them so much I ordered three bags.  </li>
            <li>Many others have floss that is too slippery to clean teeth well.  </li>
            <li>they are strong and don&#x27;t break so easy</li>
            <li>I keep them all over the house for easy access.</li>
            <li>Easy 5 stars...</li>
            <li>The easy way to floss</li>
            <li>I keep a package at work and at home for easy access when needed.</li>
            <li>the mint flavor is very mild</li>
            <li>These are strong and will get the job done.</li>
            <li>They use strong floss that doesn&#x27;t break under pressure.</li>
            <li>But is is strong floss.</li>
            <li>Strong and dependable, never had one break yet.</li>
            <li>Sturdy with strong strings.</li>
            <li>biggest problem is the cheap plastic GUM used.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Gum Eez from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>Flossing is so much more fun with these.  </li>
            <li>Your mouth feels so much better being freshly flossed.</li>
            <li>(I have learned to use my mouth to floss hands free).</li>
            <li>I prefer to have thicker floss material than these provide, but these are effective and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Liked them so much, I bought the 3 pack.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure whether to laugh or frown, so</li>
            <li>So buy buy buy these, and enjoy healthier teeth and gums, and don&#x27;t worry that you&#x27;re going to be carted out to the hospital with puncture wounds in your hands.  </li>
            <li>and I still get as great a floss as I would using regular string.</li>
            <li>These are very nice, we like the pick end of this better than any other brand we have tried.</li>
            <li>About a year ago these guys switched manufacturers and the quality temporarily took a significant hit.</li>
            <li>clean teeth.    </li>
            <li>They are strong and rarely break</li>
            <li>Thread is strong and thickness is just right.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product because it contains a toothpick, which is useful for removing plaque from the teeth, as well as for cleaning in between the teeth after meals.</li>
            <li>These little devices keep him happy and are easy for me to use.</li>
            <li>Product as described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The mild mint flavor is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>that wont break to quickly</li>
            <li>They rarely break and the floss has enough friction to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>They work great for flossing and I really like the tooth pick on the back side.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quickly, and they were what I wanted.</li>
            <li>but most normal flosses work as well.  </li>
            <li>Besides from that, they are very sturdy unlike some flossers that break easily.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy!!</li>
            <li>I use these everyday and so happy to find a pack value here instead of buying just one pack at the grocery store or pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Worth the hassle of having to get them online</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few flosses but this has been the best for me so far</li>
            <li>They have a mint flavoring which leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>These rarely break.</li>
            <li>They rarely break in use and have never stabbed myself using them like someone else suggested on their review.</li>
            <li>but they rarely broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The floss in these floss sticks is shred resistant, is far superior to other many brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li>These are super fantastic and something I cannot live without.</li>
            <li>The floss is extra strong and they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>The pick is just the right shape.</li>
            <li>The wide opening is great and the string is nice and tight.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use, comfortable and make flossing in the back a breeze.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use, and more durable than some of the other brands we have tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I need to compare them to Target High Performance and DentTek Xtra Clean.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable too.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable also.</li>
            <li>They floss far more than with regular string floss - probably because it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li>I will most likely continue buying them from a retail store.</li>
            <li>Still working on flossing more regularly, but</li>
            <li>Well, no, it doesn&#x27;t really make flossing fun, but these are working pretty well.  </li>
            <li>and this was the first bag to be unsatisfactory;  The floss came off the holder on the first tooth&#x27;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different brands of flossers and for some reason, GUM flossers have been disappearing from our retailers&#x27; shelves, so I&#x27;ve had to resort to buying them online.</li>
            <li>best flossers ever and so hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li>These say &amp;#34;with EXTRA STRONG FLOSS&amp;#34; on the package; I guess I have extra strong teeth and some tight spacing in places because I seem to go thru these things fairly</li>
            <li>While I suppose pretty much all dental floss works equally well (when used properly) I find I can use these much more effectively than traditional floss.</li>
            <li>It works great if not better than the old variety.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these flossers for a few years now and was really glad I found them on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>nothing much to say about this product besides:&lt;br /&gt;it is very durable, and it does its job</li>
            <li>They changed to a much stronger &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; taste.  </li>
            <li>I like the price, I like the fact that you get 90 count, however I dont like the flossing thread much</li>
            <li>but these are really sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier on the fingers than wrapping floss string around them.  </li>
            <li>These are the only things on the market that allow me to do so comfortably and without any hassle.  </li>
            <li>This might sound gross, but he can reuse these a couple times during the day, and they hold up well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I ask, really.</li>
            <li>I was almost discouraged and was ready to give up flossing altogether.</li>
            <li>I buy these because my teeth are very close together</li>
            <li>Use to buy from the grocery store, but so much cheaper online through Amazon.</li>
            <li>They glide smoothly and they actually make me look forward to flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work and were shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t rip or brake while flossing</li>
            <li>Nice flossers, deep enough for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Work much better than other brands we have tried.  </li>
            <li>Does the job much better than other brands I have purchased at the store.</li>
            <li>Now, I have a mouth full of expensive teeth, and flossing is more important than ever</li>
            <li>I have tried many other flossers.</li>
            <li>These dont break or snap like most other brands.</li>
            <li>This allows me to more easily get between all my teeth and even though I&#x27;ve had the floss begin to shred it hasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li>I became an avid (near obsessive) flosser b/c of the Plackers line.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I used to buy these and loved them, but this time around they are not good.  </li>
            <li>Pretty soon I was completely hooked.</li>
            <li>nothing matches this particular brand and model.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Unlike them, it is not so easy to prick your fingers with the sharp end.</li>
            <li>The pick side of the flosser is incredibly useful for scratching plaque off the gumlines and the front and back of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but well worth it when it comes to your dental health and overall health.</li>
            <li>I prefer flossers over regular floss as I feel it gives me a little more control and better quality flossing, particularly for harder to reach teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never had one break on me like some other cheap brands.</li>
            <li>Tried other brands but they are all too soft to hold the shape and easy to bend.</li>
            <li>&quot; I decided to compare them with the Gum-Eez, my favorite flossers, on my very tight front teeth.  </li>
            <li>, it is a bit too hard, and doesnt get through easily, but it gets the work done!</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase on amazon, could not be soon enough.</li>
            <li>that being said these work very well, the floss is thick enough that they really do a good job of cleaning, they are also very smooth so there is not a real issue working them into tight gaps...</li>
            <li>They are perfect to dislodge those random bits of food.&lt;br /&gt;Try some; at $.076 each, they are half the price of others.&lt;br /&gt;See:</li>
            <li>I have tried cheaper brands to save a little but they either break, aren&#x27;t as comfortable, etc..</li>
            <li>The frame feels more rigid, the floss doesn&#x27;t rip out of the frame, and the pick doesn&#x27;t dull or bend.  </li>
            <li>The idea I like because I have a hard time fitting my fingers in my mouth.</li>
            <li>63 years old and still have all 32...</li>
            <li>I have a couple defected teeth where food gets caught frequently, so</li>
            <li>far as flossing, this is all I use.  </li>
            <li>(no stores near me seem to carry this brand).</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Where seme brands break after picking two or three teeth these last the whole job.</li>
            <li>I always keep at least three packs stocked and just clickity click amazon to get more as needed.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t strip or snap like the Dentek ones which are complete junk.</li>
            <li>Then a very forceful hygienist gave me a Reach Flosser handle for daily use, to solve my biggest objections</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy so they can make it through your entire mouth without breaking.</li>
            <li>Strongest flossers I&#x27;ve used, so far.</li>
            <li>However, within a few months, they resolved all the quality issues and they are back to working better than ever.</li>
            <li>The pointy end is super sharp though so watch out for that!</li>
            <li>Well, they were certainly cheap, and pretty tough.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise the nice thing about this particular brand is that the other end has a solid toothpick which can actually remove plaque buildup due to its rigidity</li>
            <li>Exact same product, just a third of the price !!!</li>
            <li>This one, though... most times I had to push so hard that when the floss finally snapped through, it felt like I was trying to cheese-cutter my gums to death.</li>
            <li>If you have a good (old) batch and one of the bad new batches, look closely you can clearly see how the floss is no longer attached correctly.  </li>
            <li>The floss breaks easily and the sharp stem of the plastic at the other end is unusable.  </li>
            <li>The floss is to thick to fit between my teeth.</li>
            <li>This model of GUM flossers is constructed of thick plastic that does not bend, and the floss is strong enough to resist stretching and shredding.  </li>
            <li>Seriously I have tried so many different floss sticks from different brands</li>
            <li>This product could have a higher grade of floss, the floss lasts through about half of your mouth/teeth!</li>
            <li>-- they are durable, really don&#x27;t shred, and actually get in between your teeth -- even the tight ones.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> These are the best out their, they don&#x27;t break easily</li>
            <li> My dentist says it&#x27;s not as good as using the string roll</li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy</li>
            <li> but I consider that good - it needs to &#x27;pick&#x27; things so blunt won&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> anymore thank you so much good job</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> Combining them with an existing order just made good sense to me.</li>
            <li> The flossers are excellent quality, rarely break in use.  </li>
            <li> very nice, strong and good price</li>
            <li> I love these flossers!</li>
            <li> Just love them!</li>
            <li> These are my husband&#x27;s favorite flossers!</li>
            <li> Floss works great, however the pick part bends easily and breaks off in your teeth.</li>
            <li> These are hands down the best floss pics and best value.</li>
            <li> Honestly feels like the kind of material a 99cent toy would have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li> The nice mint taste helps my mouth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I think they are cheaper here than the stores but to be honest</li>
            <li> Honest.  </li>
            <li> Maybe good for more separated teeth.</li>
            <li> They also have a nice mint flavor.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best on the market.</li>
            <li> I can do it while commuting or watching TV because with one hand, it&#x27;s fairly discreet and easy.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use and get a lot of gunk out from between the teeth.</li>
            <li> the rest are very strong.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> 3 stars because it does not slide very easily between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This was by far the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of floss picks, and these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the strong flossers--all others break for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The string itself is okay, i guess, though not as sturdy as Plackers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> these are the best flosspicks ever, and are the only one that have 100% chance of not breaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the ones you can get at most stores...</li>
            <li> Some of the better flossers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> but I say it&#x27;s better to use this than not floss at all.</li>
            <li> Safe purchase.</li>
            <li> I was blown away how much better</li>
            <li> Make sure to get GUM Eez-Thu.  </li>
            <li> Within a couple weeks they went through the pack I gave them and ordered more from amazon.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more on me than the floss picks.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE floss sticks, and I carry them on my person at all times.</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price. :)</li>
            <li> After owning these I tend to floss more often.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of flossers----</li>
            <li> These really work great</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for many years.</li>
            <li> I love these things.</li>
            <li> Too many of them break with just one use.  </li>
            <li> My favorite flossers.</li>
            <li> Gum Eez-Thru Flossers Mint, 90 count is ok for the price.</li>
            <li> In 3x90 days, I&#x27;ll order some more.</li>
            <li> These are also comfortable (they aren&#x27;t the silky tape kind that I used to like, but I don&#x27;t miss it after using these).</li>
            <li> I tried them all and these are simply the best.</li>
            <li> Using for many years.</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> Better than floss or toothpicks.</li>
            <li> My dentist said my teeth are better than ever.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Others are much better.</li>
            <li> Love these...wish they had them 30 years ago...</li>
            <li> I have one crown that gives me the most problems with these, it tends to break them</li>
            <li> you think of all the problems you can develop by not practicing good oral hygiene, these are so worth it.</li>
            <li> Love these flossers..</li>
            <li> The 6th one was able to do all my teeth, but 5 broke almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any more of these.</li>
            <li> that don&#x27;t break on me :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very strong.  </li>
            <li> These Flossers are strong and easy to handle!  </li>
            <li> This was great to get in the large packages, good price, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> just okay. doesn&#x27;t glide easily between teeth</li>
            <li> and I always did, just buy these disposable flossers and enjoy healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> good price, fast shipping, etc</li>
            <li> Loved them so much I ordered three bags.  </li>
            <li> Many others have floss that is too slippery to clean teeth well.  </li>
            <li> they are strong and don&#x27;t break so easy</li>
            <li> I keep them all over the house for easy access.</li>
            <li> Easy 5 stars...</li>
            <li> The easy way to floss</li>
            <li> I keep a package at work and at home for easy access when needed.</li>
            <li> the mint flavor is very mild</li>
            <li> These are strong and will get the job done.</li>
            <li> They use strong floss that doesn&#x27;t break under pressure.</li>
            <li> But is is strong floss.</li>
            <li> Strong and dependable, never had one break yet.</li>
            <li> Sturdy with strong strings.</li>
            <li> biggest problem is the cheap plastic GUM used.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Gum Eez from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> Flossing is so much more fun with these.  </li>
            <li> Your mouth feels so much better being freshly flossed.</li>
            <li> (I have learned to use my mouth to floss hands free).</li>
            <li> I prefer to have thicker floss material than these provide, but these are effective and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Liked them so much, I bought the 3 pack.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure whether to laugh or frown, so</li>
            <li> So buy buy buy these, and enjoy healthier teeth and gums, and don&#x27;t worry that you&#x27;re going to be carted out to the hospital with puncture wounds in your hands.  </li>
            <li> and I still get as great a floss as I would using regular string.</li>
            <li> These are very nice, we like the pick end of this better than any other brand we have tried.</li>
            <li> About a year ago these guys switched manufacturers and the quality temporarily took a significant hit.</li>
            <li> clean teeth.    </li>
            <li> They are strong and rarely break</li>
            <li> Thread is strong and thickness is just right.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product because it contains a toothpick, which is useful for removing plaque from the teeth, as well as for cleaning in between the teeth after meals.</li>
            <li> These little devices keep him happy and are easy for me to use.</li>
            <li> Product as described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> The mild mint flavor is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> that wont break to quickly</li>
            <li> They rarely break and the floss has enough friction to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> They work great for flossing and I really like the tooth pick on the back side.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Delivered quickly, and they were what I wanted.</li>
            <li> but most normal flosses work as well.  </li>
            <li> Besides from that, they are very sturdy unlike some flossers that break easily.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy!!</li>
            <li> I use these everyday and so happy to find a pack value here instead of buying just one pack at the grocery store or pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Worth the hassle of having to get them online</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few flosses but this has been the best for me so far</li>
            <li> They have a mint flavoring which leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
            <li> These rarely break.</li>
            <li> They rarely break in use and have never stabbed myself using them like someone else suggested on their review.</li>
            <li> but they rarely broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The floss in these floss sticks is shred resistant, is far superior to other many brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li> These are super fantastic and something I cannot live without.</li>
            <li> The floss is extra strong and they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> The pick is just the right shape.</li>
            <li> The wide opening is great and the string is nice and tight.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use, comfortable and make flossing in the back a breeze.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use, and more durable than some of the other brands we have tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, I need to compare them to Target High Performance and DentTek Xtra Clean.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable too.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable also.</li>
            <li> They floss far more than with regular string floss - probably because it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li> I will most likely continue buying them from a retail store.</li>
            <li> Still working on flossing more regularly, but</li>
            <li> Well, no, it doesn&#x27;t really make flossing fun, but these are working pretty well.  </li>
            <li> and this was the first bag to be unsatisfactory;  The floss came off the holder on the first tooth&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different brands of flossers and for some reason, GUM flossers have been disappearing from our retailers&#x27; shelves, so I&#x27;ve had to resort to buying them online.</li>
            <li> best flossers ever and so hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> These say &amp;#34;with EXTRA STRONG FLOSS&amp;#34; on the package; I guess I have extra strong teeth and some tight spacing in places because I seem to go thru these things fairly</li>
            <li> While I suppose pretty much all dental floss works equally well (when used properly) I find I can use these much more effectively than traditional floss.</li>
            <li> It works great if not better than the old variety.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these flossers for a few years now and was really glad I found them on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> nothing much to say about this product besides:&lt;br /&gt;it is very durable, and it does its job</li>
            <li> They changed to a much stronger &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; taste.  </li>
            <li> I like the price, I like the fact that you get 90 count, however I dont like the flossing thread much</li>
            <li> but these are really sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier on the fingers than wrapping floss string around them.  </li>
            <li> These are the only things on the market that allow me to do so comfortably and without any hassle.  </li>
            <li> This might sound gross, but he can reuse these a couple times during the day, and they hold up well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I ask, really.</li>
            <li> I was almost discouraged and was ready to give up flossing altogether.</li>
            <li> I buy these because my teeth are very close together</li>
            <li> Use to buy from the grocery store, but so much cheaper online through Amazon.</li>
            <li> They glide smoothly and they actually make me look forward to flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work and were shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t rip or brake while flossing</li>
            <li> Nice flossers, deep enough for my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Work much better than other brands we have tried.  </li>
            <li> Does the job much better than other brands I have purchased at the store.</li>
            <li> Now, I have a mouth full of expensive teeth, and flossing is more important than ever</li>
            <li> I have tried many other flossers.</li>
            <li> These dont break or snap like most other brands.</li>
            <li> This allows me to more easily get between all my teeth and even though I&#x27;ve had the floss begin to shred it hasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> I became an avid (near obsessive) flosser b/c of the Plackers line.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I used to buy these and loved them, but this time around they are not good.  </li>
            <li> Pretty soon I was completely hooked.</li>
            <li> nothing matches this particular brand and model.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Unlike them, it is not so easy to prick your fingers with the sharp end.</li>
            <li> The pick side of the flosser is incredibly useful for scratching plaque off the gumlines and the front and back of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but well worth it when it comes to your dental health and overall health.</li>
            <li> I prefer flossers over regular floss as I feel it gives me a little more control and better quality flossing, particularly for harder to reach teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never had one break on me like some other cheap brands.</li>
            <li> Tried other brands but they are all too soft to hold the shape and easy to bend.</li>
            <li> &quot; I decided to compare them with the Gum-Eez, my favorite flossers, on my very tight front teeth.  </li>
            <li> , it is a bit too hard, and doesnt get through easily, but it gets the work done!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase on amazon, could not be soon enough.</li>
            <li> that being said these work very well, the floss is thick enough that they really do a good job of cleaning, they are also very smooth so there is not a real issue working them into tight gaps...</li>
            <li> They are perfect to dislodge those random bits of food.&lt;br /&gt;Try some; at $.076 each, they are half the price of others.&lt;br /&gt;See:</li>
            <li> I have tried cheaper brands to save a little but they either break, aren&#x27;t as comfortable, etc..</li>
            <li> The frame feels more rigid, the floss doesn&#x27;t rip out of the frame, and the pick doesn&#x27;t dull or bend.  </li>
            <li> The idea I like because I have a hard time fitting my fingers in my mouth.</li>
            <li> 63 years old and still have all 32...</li>
            <li> I have a couple defected teeth where food gets caught frequently, so</li>
            <li> far as flossing, this is all I use.  </li>
            <li> (no stores near me seem to carry this brand).</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Where seme brands break after picking two or three teeth these last the whole job.</li>
            <li> I always keep at least three packs stocked and just clickity click amazon to get more as needed.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t strip or snap like the Dentek ones which are complete junk.</li>
            <li> Then a very forceful hygienist gave me a Reach Flosser handle for daily use, to solve my biggest objections</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy so they can make it through your entire mouth without breaking.</li>
            <li> Strongest flossers I&#x27;ve used, so far.</li>
            <li> However, within a few months, they resolved all the quality issues and they are back to working better than ever.</li>
            <li> The pointy end is super sharp though so watch out for that!</li>
            <li> Well, they were certainly cheap, and pretty tough.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise the nice thing about this particular brand is that the other end has a solid toothpick which can actually remove plaque buildup due to its rigidity</li>
            <li> Exact same product, just a third of the price !!!</li>
            <li> This one, though... most times I had to push so hard that when the floss finally snapped through, it felt like I was trying to cheese-cutter my gums to death.</li>
            <li> If you have a good (old) batch and one of the bad new batches, look closely you can clearly see how the floss is no longer attached correctly.  </li>
            <li> The floss breaks easily and the sharp stem of the plastic at the other end is unusable.  </li>
            <li> The floss is to thick to fit between my teeth.</li>
            <li> This model of GUM flossers is constructed of thick plastic that does not bend, and the floss is strong enough to resist stretching and shredding.  </li>
            <li> Seriously I have tried so many different floss sticks from different brands</li>
            <li> This product could have a higher grade of floss, the floss lasts through about half of your mouth/teeth!</li>
            <li> -- they are durable, really don&#x27;t shred, and actually get in between your teeth -- even the tight ones.  </li>
            <li> those are flimsy, and the floss pretty much frays or stretches to the point of being useless in seconds.  </li>
            <li> I keep the Reach with my daily supplies, and carry the smaller (3\\&quot; long) Gum flossers in the desk and auto.</li>
            <li> For me, they work no where close to as well as the flat ribbon flossers.  </li>
            <li> Must have for those have trouble using normal floss.</li>
            <li> and I injured my gum by poking it too far down.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t find time to floss regularly, stick a pack in your car or next to your remote.</li>
            <li> most were disappointing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However at 90 count per bag and using maybe 6 of these a day on average, then one bag will last 15 days or about 2 weeks, and the 3-bag pack should last me around 6 weeks or 45 days.</li>
            <li> A good alternative to string floss if you find yourself skipping flossing because you hate to floss.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have very narrow spaces between my teeth, and I definitely prefer the soft ribbon flosses (Glide or whatever?)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust any other brand of floss picks, these are very sturdy and the floss never rips; they even come with a small carrying case.</li>
            <li> One flosser does the jobs vs having to use SEVERAL flossers from the other \\&quot;leading\\&quot; brands.  </li>
            <li> With the returned quality, I still recommend these above any other brand.  </li>
            <li> GUM is the only way to go however, other brands are inferior, I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> Finally, I don&#x27;t use the sharp pointy end</li>
            <li> The floss seems to be thicker than the brand that I am used to; the mint is pretty weak.</li>
            <li> Panic pursued as if we were trapped in the desert with only one jug of water left.</li>
            <li> I realized, my family and I literally could not live without them.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time with normal floss</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the complexity of dental floss and trying to angle it to reach every single tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem with every other brand I&#x27;ve tried is that they break like crazy - every single flosser doesn&#x27;t make it through more than a quarter of my teeth -</li>
            <li> Yeah I am completely addicted but whats funny is one day I was visiting my family</li>
            <li> The floss comes loose from one end on a lot for me</li>
            <li> They are sturdy, the floss doesn&#x27;t come loose.</li>
            <li> These are much stronger &amp; easier to use than any other types of dental floss I have tried -- even other brands that look just like it, down to the green coloring.</li>
            <li> as minty as previously from same manufacturer</li>
            <li> This is the only product that stands up to my tightly spaced teeth.</li>
            <li> I find it incredibly bitter (menthol-like)</li>
            <li> I tried flossers a few years back</li>
            <li> Also, not as messy as standard floss, which keeps your hands cleaner.</li>
            <li> As I expected.</li>
            <li> I felt being able to instantly remove annoying food that was stuck in my gums.</li>
            <li> Why on earth would the handle be so pointy and sharp?</li>
            <li> and I just don&#x27;t  want to try other flosses anymore.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shred like some other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The floss portion doesn&#x27;t fray as it does with some other brands, and the toothpick on the other end works well.</li>
            <li> Every other brand comes apart.</li>
            <li> The pick end is quite sharp</li>
            <li> Yes the ends are sharp, to massage your gums.  </li>
            <li> Had to order from Amazon since everyone around me sells the other brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different types of flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started off with weak fragile flossers which which would break when trying to press it through the crevice between teeth.</li>
            <li> I use two picks a day, once in the morning and the other at night.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t bother with other brands.</li>
            <li> I was tired of those picks that break so easily, especially in between the back teeth that are closer together.</li>
            <li> I am not very good using regular floss and these are the sturdiest picks you will find.</li>
            <li> No other ones could come close to get into tight teeth hard to find these around here</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;toothpick&amp;#34; side is firm enough to get into the crevices, and the floss side is firm and thick enough to remove food from in between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Plackers broke, on average, after five teeth.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was a bit slow considering it was coming from the same state, but the product was as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just because flossing is necessary doesn&#x27;t mean I do it.  </li>
            <li> Same product as I can buy locally, but less expensive with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are really tight</li>
            <li> Because it was messy, uncomfortable, prone to breakage, and sometimes drew blood (and I never asked the dentist if that was normal).</li>
            <li> Leaves a little minty taste, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I get nothing but compliments about how little plaque I have whenever I visit the dentist now.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been keeping up with flossing because it&#x27;s so time-consuming and messy.  </li>
            <li> I had a few packs of ones that broke every time.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I&#x27;ve tested quite a few.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few and the string always breaks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a strong piece of floss at one end that doesn&#x27;t break with normal use (although I did get a bad batch once that had probably 15 bad ones).  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is that on the crown they don&#x27;t break in the middle, like some other brands do, instead the string pulls out of one side of the pick, thus making it as useless as if it had broken down the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unbelievable, what a waste.</li>
            <li> However the flossing thread is pretty darn thick, and it was unpleasant trying to cram it in between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the packaging changed, I did not received the &amp;#34;Eez-Thru&amp;#34; branded packaging.</li>
            <li> After years with braces, my teeth are quite close together, making it hard for floss picks to work, but these never lose their strength nor floss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard and not something you would want to put in the mouth.</li>
            <li> I now floss at least 2-3 times a day because of floss sticks...</li>
            <li> The thread doesn&#x27;t break, but it is too thick to &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; (my fave) between molars.</li>
            <li> The pick end is also too thick to be used interdentally.</li>
            <li> The string is too thick.</li>
            <li> I floss on a regular basis and tend to get very annoyed when I have to deal with broken floss.</li>
            <li> These also solved some other random problems.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to use regular floss.</li>
            <li> The floss is not good.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no danger of stabbing yourself.  </li>
            <li> Now we are all addicted.</li>
            <li> Completely addicted.</li>
            <li> If you hate using regular floss</li>
            <li> 4 out of 5 flosses break off and basically they are useless.  </li>
            <li> Bought the 3pack of 90 each, so a bit bummed they are difficult for me to use.</li>
            <li> The floss detaches, making them useless</li>
            <li> I hate the ones angled to the side because when I want to floss my molars, it&#x27;s really hard to reach.</li>
            <li> I read the review by the person who kept stabbing their hand on these flossers.  </li>
            <li> it also does not have an overly artificial flavor.</li>
            <li> Finally, I am addicted to amazon because I hate driving to the store when I can just click one button and have my stuff here in a couple days.</li>
            <li> We mistakenly bought these instead of our usual flossers and it makes flossing miserable.</li>
            <li> and it has made the product impossible for me to use.</li>
            <li> Too bad that Amazon itself does not carry them, and</li>
            <li> nothing bad to say about this product</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the quality of these flosses...:-(</li>
            <li> do not break like crap off brands.</li>
            <li> and they broke and  hated them.  </li>
            <li> I hated flossing.</li>
            <li> I used to chew my pens and they would get nasty, as a kid I remember in class</li>
            <li> Have tried others and they are awful. ..</li>
            <li> These flossers are horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality control.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only product that stands up to my tightly spaced teeth. 63 years old and still have all 32...</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase on amazon, could not be soon enough. If it werent for this I&#x27;d never floss.</li>
            <li> These are durable and don&#x27;t break. This is the only brand I found that does not break.</li>
            <li> Product as described and shipped quickly. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of so-called \\&quot;shred resistant\\&quot; flosser, and they all failed to deliver. Not this time! This model of GUM flossers is constructed of thick plastic that does not bend, and the floss is strong enough to resist stretching and shredding.  One flosser does the jobs vs having to use SEVERAL flossers from the other \\&quot;leading\\&quot; brands.  Too bad that Amazon itself does not carry them, and I cannot use my PRIME benefits. I will most likely continue buying them from a retail store.</li>
            <li> These are the ONLY flossies we are allowed to buy now.  We&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different brands and they always break!  It is GUM or nothin for us!</li>
            <li> After years with braces, my teeth are quite close together, making it hard for floss picks to work, but these never lose their strength nor floss.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the packaging changed, I did not received the &amp;#34;Eez-Thru&amp;#34; branded packaging. However, the ones I received appeared to be the same product in a newer packaging. It works great if not better than the old variety. I floss on a regular basis and tend to get very annoyed when I have to deal with broken floss. These are strong and will get the job done.</li>
            <li> I became an avid (near obsessive) flosser b/c of the Plackers line.&lt;br /&gt;My wife picked up this brand and they just don&#x27;t measure up.&lt;br /&gt;The string itself is okay, i guess, though not as sturdy as Plackers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem is the cheap plastic GUM used.  Honestly feels like the kind of material a 99cent toy would have.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard and not something you would want to put in the mouth.</li>
            <li> These are GREAT.  I have a couple defected teeth where food gets caught frequently, so I use these several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as flossing, this is all I use.  I don&#x27;t do the 2 foot string thing.  The mild mint flavor is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> the only floss pick that I can use that wont break to quickly</li>
            <li> Excellent floss sticks!</li>
            <li> these are the best flosspicks ever, and are the only one that have 100% chance of not breaking.</li>
            <li> nothing much to say about this product besides:&lt;br /&gt;it is very durable, and it does its job</li>
            <li> Best on the market....I go out of my way to buy these...no breakage!</li>
            <li> I used to buy these and loved them, but this time around they are not good.  4 out of 5 flosses break off and basically they are useless.  Disappointed in the quality of these flosses...:-(</li>
            <li> These look like the same product in the store but they are not! They are cheaper and you get what you pay for.  The floss breaks easily and the sharp stem of the plastic at the other end is unusable.  The tip is like a razor. Run away, don&#x27;t walk.</li>
            <li> I have tried many a floss pick and these are the BEST ! They use strong floss that doesn&#x27;t break under pressure. Keep a bag in the house and the car.</li>
            <li> I think I may have reviewed these before, but anyway...  Work much better than other brands we have tried.  Only brand that doesn&#x27;t break often for us.  Nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li> A good alternative to string floss if you find yourself skipping flossing because you hate to floss.</li>
            <li> I like these the best.  They rarely break and the floss has enough friction to do a good job.  Many others have floss that is too slippery to clean teeth well.  UPDATE: They changed to a much stronger &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; taste.  I find it incredibly bitter (menthol-like) and it has made the product impossible for me to use.</li>
            <li> I got come of these as a sample at my last dental appointment.  I haven&#x27;t been keeping up with flossing because it&#x27;s so time-consuming and messy.  These make flossing every day a snap.  Best of all, THESE are the ones you want.  I&#x27;ve tried the ones you can get at most stores...those are flimsy, and the floss pretty much frays or stretches to the point of being useless in seconds.  I use about 3-4 to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With THESE, I use only one, and I never have a hassle with the floss doing its job.  Worth the hassle of having to get them online (no stores near me seem to carry this brand).</li>
            <li> The dentist insists that I floss every day. These little devices keep him happy and are easy for me to use. Here is another example of a product that I can no longer expect to find at the local drugstore on a regular basis. So I turned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> The floss is not good. It shreds after a quarter of my mouth. I make do for the rest and then have to grab another to do my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> Best bang for the buck. Never had one break on me like some other cheap brands.</li>
            <li> good price, fast shipping, etc</li>
            <li> I like the price, I like the fact that you get 90 count, however I dont like the flossing thread much, it is a bit too hard, and doesnt get through easily, but it gets the work done!</li>
            <li> I love these flossers! The &amp;#34;toothpick&amp;#34; side is firm enough to get into the crevices, and the floss side is firm and thick enough to remove food from in between your teeth. great price too!</li>
            <li> Some of the better flossers I&#x27;ve used. The floss comes loose from one end on a lot for me but these are really sturdy.</li>
            <li> Why on earth would the handle be so pointy and sharp? It sticks my hand! Besides from that, they are very sturdy unlike some flossers that break easily.</li>
            <li> My teeth are really tight and I have all of them including wisdom teeth,  This allows me to more easily get between all my teeth and even though I&#x27;ve had the floss begin to shred it hasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> The floss is to thick to fit between my teeth. But is is strong floss.</li>
            <li> Does the job much better than other brands I have purchased at the store.</li>
            <li> they are strong and don&#x27;t break so easy</li>
            <li> My dentist says it&#x27;s not as good as using the string roll but I say it&#x27;s better to use this than not floss at all. I keep them on my side table by the TV so I remember to use them after meals. The nice mint taste helps my mouth feel cleaner. The price is very reasonable too.</li>
            <li> these are the bet flossers out there. nothing matches this particular brand and model. so when the local store runs out i turn online instead of having to find a alternate brick store. very happy.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I tried flossers a few years back and they broke and  hated them.  I received a free sample of Gum Eez from my dentist.  Loved them so much I ordered three bags.  Flossing is so much more fun with these.  It&#x27;s so much easier on the fingers than wrapping floss string around them.  The mint is an added plus.  It&#x27;s worth the cost.  I keep them all over the house for easy access.</li>
            <li> Where seme brands break after picking two or three teeth these last the whole job. I have tried almost all of this brands and these are the best. Safe purchase.</li>
            <li> Edit: December 14, 2015: On behalf of the reviews claiming these no longer work / break. I have been using 2-5 flossers per day for the last 3 years. About a year ago these guys switched manufacturers and the quality temporarily took a significant hit. I had a few packs of ones that broke every time. However, within a few months, they resolved all the quality issues and they are back to working better than ever. With the returned quality, I still recommend these above any other brand.  One day I found a pack of flossers in the back of my drawer and tried them out. I was blown away how much better I felt being able to instantly remove annoying food that was stuck in my gums. I started using them every day, then after every meal, then starting bringing them with me and using them every time I ate. Pretty soon I was completely hooked. Your mouth feels so much better being freshly flossed. Of course I ran out and ended up trying every brand CVS had. This was by far the best. Make sure to get GUM Eez-Thu.  So I started keeping them in the bathroom, at my desk, in the kitchen, in my travel bathroom bag, in my car, in my wallet. Yeah I am completely addicted but whats funny is one day I was visiting my family and we had ribs. I offered them some flossers.  Within a couple weeks they went through the pack I gave them and ordered more from amazon. Now we are all addicted. On a ski trip we had they forgot to bring some and I only had 10 left in my travel supplies. Panic pursued as if we were trapped in the desert with only one jug of water left. I gave my family one each and kept the rest for myself. It was then I realized, my family and I literally could not live without them. If for some reason all flossers stopped being sold, I would buy floss, plastic, molds, etc and make them myself.  These also solved some other random problems. I used to chew my pens and they would get nasty, as a kid I remember in class some ink exploded in my mouth. Anyways now I just chew on flossers and floss my teeth (I have learned to use my mouth to floss hands free). It has solved what was probably an oral fixation as Freud would put it. They actually help me focus and stay productive. Finally, I am addicted to amazon because I hate driving to the store when I can just click one button and have my stuff here in a couple days. I always keep at least three packs stocked and just clickity click amazon to get more as needed. I think they are cheaper here than the stores but to be honest I never even go to stores anymore except for produce and stuff like that.  Highly recommended. Did change life. Completely addicted.</li>
            <li> I prefer to have thicker floss material than these provide, but these are effective and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few flosses but this has been the best for me so far and I just don&#x27;t  want to try other flosses anymore. Very sturdy!! Just love them!</li>
            <li> The best flossers ever.  Strong and dependable, never had one break yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of floss picks, and these are by far the best.  The frame feels more rigid, the floss doesn&#x27;t rip out of the frame, and the pick doesn&#x27;t dull or bend.  Liked them so much, I bought the 3 pack.  Still working on flossing more regularly, but that&#x27;s more on me than the floss picks.</li>
            <li> The thread doesn&#x27;t break, but it is too thick to &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; (my fave) between molars. The pick end is also too thick to be used interdentally. Has a pleasant taste. Bought the 3pack of 90 each, so a bit bummed they are difficult for me to use.</li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy</li>
            <li> THESE ARE THE BEST. Seriously I have tried so many different floss sticks from different brands and I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how these guys don&#x27;t ever break or stretch or get stuck in between your teeth. They have a mint flavoring which leaves your mouth fresh. I LOVE THESE floss sticks, and I carry them on my person at all times.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these flossing aids; they&#x27;re great for removing food particles that are stuck to the teeth.</li>
            <li> Received the product on time as stated.  This flosser is the only brand that we buy since it is sturdy and the string does not snap from the plastic.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> very nice, strong and good price</li>
            <li> The best floss.  The floss never breaks</li>
            <li> Thread is strong and thickness is just right. Comfortable. The pick is just the right shape. Cannot beat the price. :)</li>
            <li> Just because flossing is necessary doesn&#x27;t mean I do it.  These are the only things on the market that allow me to do so comfortably and without any hassle.  They&#x27;re sturdy and don&#x27;t shred or fall apart like others I&#x27;ve tried.  The pointy end is super sharp though so watch out for that!</li>
            <li> These work for me the best. I hate the ones angled to the side because when I want to floss my molars, it&#x27;s really hard to reach. And with regular floss string, they just slip off my fingers. After owning these I tend to floss more often.</li>
            <li> Gum produces quality dental items and these flossers are no exception. The price for the pack of 3 is excellent.</li>
            <li> Great!! I like these.</li>
            <li> item as described, no complaints, this is the best floss company</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of flossers---- most were disappointing.  These really work great -- they are durable, really don&#x27;t shred, and actually get in between your teeth -- even the tight ones.  These are the ONLY ones I will buy now.</li>
            <li> I love these and I think it was a great deal as well!</li>
            <li> These are hands down the best floss pics and best value. They don&#x27;t strip or snap like the Dentek ones which are complete junk. Easy 5 stars...no brainer</li>
            <li> I carry them everywhere and use constantly. The easy way to floss and I get great checkups. I&#x27;ve been using them for many years. GUM is the only way to go however, other brands are inferior, I&#x27;ve tried them all. I threw away a bag of Oral B&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Great product and value! Doesn&#x27;t shred like some other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust any other brand of floss picks, these are very sturdy and the floss never rips; they even come with a small carrying case.</li>
            <li> do not break like crap off brands. very good quality.</li>
            <li> I love these things. They work great for flossing and I really like the tooth pick on the back side. I use these all the time I keep a pack at home, one in the car, and one at the office.</li>
            <li> I was surprized my wife also likes this item</li>
            <li> Best flossers out there. I will only buy these</li>
            <li> Too many of them break with just one use.  The floss detaches, making them useless</li>
            <li> These are my husband&#x27;s favorite flossers! He is a constant flosser, probably multiple times a day (can&#x27;t say the same for myself!). This might sound gross, but he can reuse these a couple times during the day, and they hold up well. The floss portion doesn&#x27;t fray as it does with some other brands, and the toothpick on the other end works well. We wouldn&#x27;t buy anything but Gum brand!</li>
            <li> I hated flossing. For years, the dentist would solemnly instruct me how flossing was in my best interest, I would take the crummy dispenser and promise to use it. Did not happen. Because it was messy, uncomfortable, prone to breakage, and sometimes drew blood (and I never asked the dentist if that was normal). Then a very forceful hygienist gave me a Reach Flosser handle for daily use, to solve my biggest objections and I used it. Now, I have a mouth full of expensive teeth, and flossing is more important than ever (just never use a ToothPick!). I keep the Reach with my daily supplies, and carry the smaller (3\\&quot; long) Gum flossers in the desk and auto. They are perfect to dislodge those random bits of food.&lt;br /&gt;Try some; at $.076 each, they are half the price of others.&lt;br /&gt;See: [[ASIN:B0017TU2HE Reach Access Flosser]]</li>
            <li> FINALLY a flosser whose floss stays in tach. Every other brand comes apart. The string actually stays in this one, therefore making it usable. Leaves a little minty taste, but not overpowering. Plastic is sturdy. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> We like this brand of flossers.  They are sturdy, the floss doesn&#x27;t come loose. The pick end is quite sharp but I consider that good - it needs to &#x27;pick&#x27; things so blunt won&#x27;t do it.  Couldn&#x27;t find them in local stores so we tried others, and went back to these.</li>
            <li> My favorite flossers. I am not very good using regular floss and these are the sturdiest picks you will find. Trust me, I&#x27;ve tested quite a few.</li>
            <li> Gum Eez-Thru Flossers Mint, 90 count is ok for the price. No MINT taste as advertised but as a flosser, it does the trick. For the price,the product is acceptable.</li>
            <li> I really only bought these online because my local CVS ran out.  Shipping was a bit slow considering it was coming from the same state, but the product was as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong piece of floss at one end that doesn&#x27;t break with normal use (although I did get a bad batch once that had probably 15 bad ones).  Otherwise the nice thing about this particular brand is that the other end has a solid toothpick which can actually remove plaque buildup due to its rigidity</li>
            <li> works as advertise. nothing bad to say about this product</li>
            <li> I read the review by the person who kept stabbing their hand on these flossers.  Wasn&#x27;t sure whether to laugh or frown, so instead I chose to write a review.  These flossers are excellent.  There is absolutely no danger of stabbing yourself.  Yes the ends are sharp, to massage your gums.  You hold the flosser on the side and use it.  The flossers are excellent quality, rarely break in use.  I buy these in bulk and my kids use these (youngest user is 6) and no one has ever stabbed themselves.  They floss far more than with regular string floss - probably because it&#x27;s so easy.  Pick up a flosser.  Floss.  Toss.  Voila...clean teeth.    So buy buy buy these, and enjoy healthier teeth and gums, and don&#x27;t worry that you&#x27;re going to be carted out to the hospital with puncture wounds in your hands.  Won&#x27;t happen. Honest.  I promise.</li>
            <li> The string is too thick. Maybe good for more separated teeth.</li>
            <li> The best flossers out there. These rarely break.</li>
            <li> Well, no, it doesn&#x27;t really make flossing fun, but these are working pretty well.  Sturdy - I can feel them snap between my teeth.  Arrived quickly.  In 3x90 days, I&#x27;ll order some more.</li>
            <li> This is the best quality and value you can get when it comes to floss picks. These are sturdy enough that you can floss between all of your teeth without the string ever breaking. I was tired of those picks that break so easily, especially in between the back teeth that are closer together. These are also comfortable (they aren&#x27;t the silky tape kind that I used to like, but I don&#x27;t miss it after using these). Look no further, these will do the job.</li>
            <li> the best way to floss and it doesn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> I tried them all and these are simply the best. Using for many years.</li>
            <li> These are great quality. Made the mistake of buying cheaper ones...in the trash they went.</li>
            <li> Floss works great, however the pick part bends easily and breaks off in your teeth. Low quality plastic</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. As advertised</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of flossers that don&#x27;t shred while using.  Had to order from Amazon since everyone around me sells the other brand.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly, and they were what I wanted.</li>
            <li> These are very nice, we like the pick end of this better than any other brand we have tried. The wide opening is great and the string is nice and tight. Good product.</li>
            <li> I love these.  The floss holds up going through all of my teeth and doesn&#x27;t fray.</li>
            <li> I love these. Better than floss or toothpicks.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use, and more durable than some of the other brands we have tried.  My kids&#x27; dentist commented on the noticeable improvement he saw when they started using these.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these from CVS, tried them online. Exact same product, just a third of the price !!!</li>
            <li> These are the best flossers out there. Others tend to break, but in a pack of 90, I might break only 1 or 2 of these. Have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using these flossers for years and this was the first bag to be unsatisfactory;  The floss came off the holder on the first tooth&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have tried many other flossers. This is the only brand that the actual floss does not shred apart after using. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These (GUM) are the best type of dental floss picks. Sturdy with strong strings.</li>
            <li> I did not know anything about this product or what to expect. The idea I like because I have a hard time fitting my fingers in my mouth. This product could have a higher grade of floss, the floss lasts through about half of your mouth/teeth!</li>
            <li> These are much stronger &amp; easier to use than any other types of dental floss I have tried -- even other brands that look just like it, down to the green coloring. Unlike them, it is not so easy to prick your fingers with the sharp end.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time with normal floss so these picks are my dental savior! They are very easy to use and get a lot of gunk out from between the teeth. They are very sturdy so they can make it through your entire mouth without breaking. Truly all I can ask for from this awesome product!</li>
            <li> Nice flossers, deep enough for my teeth.  Durable enough so there are no issues with breaking/fraying, but thin enough to easily fit between all of my teeth.  4 stars instead of 5 because I don&#x27;t taste any mint at all.  That said, I&#x27;d stil lbuy these again</li>
            <li> product as described, delivery as promised.</li>
            <li> These Flossers are strong and easy to handle!  Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> These dont break or snap like most other brands.</li>
            <li> best flossers ever and so hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> Great product! Easy to use and very strong.  I keep a package at work and at home for easy access when needed.</li>
            <li> Strongest flossers I&#x27;ve used, so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different brands of flossers and for some reason, GUM flossers have been disappearing from our retailers&#x27; shelves, so I&#x27;ve had to resort to buying them online. One out of every pack breaks and the rest are very strong. The problem with every other brand I&#x27;ve tried is that they break like crazy - every single flosser doesn&#x27;t make it through more than a quarter of my teeth - it&#x27;s unbelievable, what a waste. I&#x27;ve also tried the picks that just poke stuff out from between your teeth and I injured my gum by poking it too far down. My dentist said my teeth are better than ever. I can do it while commuting or watching TV because with one hand, it&#x27;s fairly discreet and easy. If you can&#x27;t find time to floss regularly, stick a pack in your car or next to your remote. Finally, I don&#x27;t use the sharp pointy end so I don&#x27;t know how that affects teeth but I&#x27;m guessing you shouldn&#x27;t use that regularly as it could scratch your enamel and give you &amp;#34;paper cuts&amp;#34; on your teeth - ask your dentist.</li>
            <li> For me, they work no where close to as well as the flat ribbon flossers.  I thought that was what I was ordering by looking at the photo when I placed my order.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product because it contains a toothpick, which is useful for removing plaque from the teeth, as well as for cleaning in between the teeth after meals. Also, not as messy as standard floss, which keeps your hands cleaner.</li>
            <li> Love these. They don&#x27;t break and fray..I will DEFINATLEY  buy these again! Have tried others and they are awful. ..</li>
            <li> These do not fray. They just don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s all I ask, really. The bonus here is the minty flavor.</li>
            <li> These have an excellent quality. They rarely break in use and have never stabbed myself using them like someone else suggested on their review. They also have a nice mint flavor. I use these everyday and so happy to find a pack value here instead of buying just one pack at the grocery store or pharmacy.</li>
            <li> The floss seems to be thicker than the brand that I am used to; the mint is pretty weak.</li>
            <li> These are the best out their, they don&#x27;t break easily</li>
            <li> Best flossers out there.</li>
            <li> While I suppose pretty much all dental floss works equally well (when used properly) I find I can use these much more effectively than traditional floss. These are easy to use, comfortable and make flossing in the back a breeze. I get nothing but compliments about how little plaque I have whenever I visit the dentist now. I have tried cheaper brands to save a little but they either break, aren&#x27;t as comfortable, etc.. Just buy these I say.</li>
            <li> Must like, since I use these every day and then some.</li>
            <li> These are a great product.  I have used these for over 2 years.  The price is very reasonable also.</li>
            <li> These are the best floss picks ever. No other ones could come close to get into tight teeth hard to find these around here anymore thank you so much good job five stars</li>
            <li> Product was as described and arrived on time. No problems or issues.</li>
            <li> Based on the claim by Plackers Micro Mint of \\&quot;world&#x27;s strongest floss,\\&quot; I decided to compare them with the Gum-Eez, my favorite flossers, on my very tight front teeth.  Plackers broke, on average, after five teeth.  GUM shredded enough by 11 teeth for me to stop but they rarely broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner - GUM Eez-Thru Extra Strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I need to compare them to Target High Performance and DentTek Xtra Clean.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I use these all the time but the floss pulls out of the plastic at one end in this batch.</li>
            <li> I have crowded teeth and this is the only dentals that work for me.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the strong flossers--all others break for me.  This was great to get in the large packages, good price, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Others are much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different types of flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started off with weak fragile flossers which which would break when trying to press it through the crevice between teeth. I was almost discouraged and was ready to give up flossing altogether. I couldn&#x27;t stand the complexity of dental floss and trying to angle it to reach every single tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up the G-U-M flossers at a local pharmacy store 5 years ago. The flossers appeared sturdy. So I gave them a shot, and well 5 years later, I&#x27;m still using them. I use two picks a day, once in the morning and the other at night. I break 1 pick for every 150 used. The pick side of the flosser is incredibly useful for scratching plaque off the gumlines and the front and back of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the best flossers. Buy a pack and try it yourself.</li>
            <li> Love these...wish they had them 30 years ago...I now floss at least 2-3 times a day because of floss sticks...I have one crown that gives me the most problems with these, it tends to break them so I save it last...that being said these work very well, the floss is thick enough that they really do a good job of cleaning, they are also very smooth so there is not a real issue working them into tight gaps...my only complaint is that on the crown they don&#x27;t break in the middle, like some other brands do, instead the string pulls out of one side of the pick, thus making it as useless as if it had broken down the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the mint flavor is very mild which I like...it also does not have an overly artificial flavor.</li>
            <li> These flossers are great, and the floss lasts for the duration of my flossing session. Others have frayed on me before I&#x27;m finished flossing, but not these!</li>
            <li> If you have any dental work these break!</li>
            <li> These are super fantastic and something I cannot live without. If you hate using regular floss and I always did, just buy these disposable flossers and enjoy healthy teeth. They&#x27;re more expensive than floss but well worth it when it comes to your dental health and overall health. I guarantee it&#x27;ll be easier to get your kids to floss too.&lt;br /&gt;When you think of all the problems you can develop by not practicing good oral hygiene, these are so worth it. I think if everyone used them, dentists would go out of business.&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t bother with other brands. I&#x27;ve tried a few and the string always breaks. These are the absolute best on the market.</li>
            <li> I buy these because my teeth are very close together and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to use regular floss. These are amazing! They are strong and rarely break and I still get as great a floss as I would using regular string.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shred even in the tightest spots1</li>
            <li> Love these flossers..The floss is extra strong and they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Use to buy from the grocery store, but so much cheaper online through Amazon. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> These flossers are horrible. We mistakenly bought these instead of our usual flossers and it makes flossing miserable. It doesn&#x27;t glide through the teeth and they&#x27;ll break before I&#x27;m even halfway done. SKIP THESE and get the Oral-B Advantage Floss Picks. They glide smoothly and they actually make me look forward to flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028K3J26/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00</li>
            <li> The floss in these floss sticks is shred resistant, is far superior to other many brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  I carry them in my purse. I also leave them in my office drawer at work.  My teeth can always count on Gum Eez.</li>
            <li> These say &amp;#34;with EXTRA STRONG FLOSS&amp;#34; on the package; I guess I have extra strong teeth and some tight spacing in places because I seem to go thru these things fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;However at 90 count per bag and using maybe 6 of these a day on average, then one bag will last 15 days or about 2 weeks, and the 3-bag pack should last me around 6 weeks or 45 days. So I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> just okay. doesn&#x27;t glide easily between teeth</li>
            <li> As I expected. A very good product.</li>
            <li> Happy gums, happy mouth!&lt;br /&gt;Best priced&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, and works as intended.&lt;br /&gt;RP</li>
            <li> Must have for those have trouble using normal floss. Tried other brands but they are all too soft to hold the shape and easy to bend. This is the best with no competition in sight.</li>
            <li> Well, they were certainly cheap, and pretty tough.  However the flossing thread is pretty darn thick, and it was unpleasant trying to cram it in between my teeth.  Granted, I have very narrow spaces between my teeth, and I definitely prefer the soft ribbon flosses (Glide or whatever?) -- but most normal flosses work as well.  This one, though... most times I had to push so hard that when the floss finally snapped through, it felt like I was trying to cheese-cutter my gums to death.</li>
            <li> I prefer flossers over regular floss as I feel it gives me a little more control and better quality flossing, particularly for harder to reach teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Re-sealable packaging&lt;br /&gt;-Sturdy&lt;br /&gt;-Minty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not as minty as previously from same manufacturer</li>
            <li> They work and were shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Talk about a great price. Keep these at work, at home, and in my car for flossing wherever I am.</li>
            <li> 3 stars because it does not slide very easily between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these flossers for a few years now and was really glad I found them on Amazon!  Same product as I can buy locally, but less expensive with Amazon.  Combining them with an existing order just made good sense to me.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t rip or brake while flossing</li>
            <li> Works like it is supposed to!</li>
            <li> They no longer work-they break. The floss string always breaks off. I&#x27;ve used these for years, but now more than 2/3rds of these fail almost immediately. If you have a good (old) batch and one of the bad new batches, look closely you can clearly see how the floss is no longer attached correctly.  I&#x27;ve just used six to floss my teeth once. The 6th one was able to do all my teeth, but 5 broke almost immediately. Terrible quality control.    I won&#x27;t buy any more of these. They no longer work.</li>
            <li> These flossers are awesome!  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for 2 years now and they&#x27;re the only one&#x27;s that don&#x27;t break on me :)</li>
            <li> best quality flosser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
