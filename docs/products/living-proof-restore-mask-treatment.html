            <li>This is not as good as the leave-in treatment product I purchased from this line.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you have chronically oily/greasy hair, this would be good.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>and it makes my hair feel and look so healthy!</li>
            <li>Excellent for my hair great improvement over other mask I used for my hair.  </li>
            <li>wanted to love this, but it honestly didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li>I love Jennifer Aniston and have liked my Sephora samples of this line so decided to order the shampoo, conditioner starter kit and this mask.  </li>
            <li>It no longer looks like straw and is much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I do love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make the decision if I want to buy more when this jar is almost gone.</li>
            <li>I have hair that needed some love.  </li>
            <li>I have re bought it several times, and will continue to, the best!!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the product.....</li>
            <li>Hair feels more luxurious after one treatment.</li>
            <li>Fast shipper, great mask.</li>
            <li>I get better conditioning with drug-store brands.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love everything productLiving Proof makes.</li>
            <li>I love Living Proof hair care line.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product made by Livingproof.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have been reading reviews etc on this product for 2 months now and finally decided to buy it and VERY happy that I did!</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Added a healthy shine and an all over healthy look that I so needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been just as satisfied with Pantene/Loreal or any drugstore brand</li>
            <li>After my latest bleach session my hair stylist recommended this so as a good girl I bought it right away.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I love the scent, it&#x27;s not too strong, somewhat citrusy.</li>
            <li>I have fine color treated hair, and I love how my hair looks and feels after using this product.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but it well worth it for special occasions to have gorgeous hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have super dry hair then this might be a good option for you, but in my experience it wasn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>I do both highlights and lowlights in my hair, preferring to be more on the blonder side (they do have more fun, trust me), and this helps counter the damage done by the highlights.  </li>
            <li>Not for people with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I think HOW you use it is a huge factor in the end result.</li>
            <li>Washing hair every day is a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The smell is great but it leaves my hair drier than if I just use my regular Fekkai conditioner (not even the mask!).  </li>
            <li>This mask treatment leaves my hair feeling so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>My main factor was the price but the  when you think about it, if like my family, you spend more then that going out to eat!</li>
            <li>I really love this product is the first I&#x27;ve ever tried from this brand</li>
            <li>and I was really excited to buy it and try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the 40+ price tag!</li>
            <li>Great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>It really works and makes your hair feel so much better.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t believe I will be purchasing the full size.  </li>
            <li>I bought the full line</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Living Proof for about a year now, and it does exactly what it says it will!  </li>
            <li>you are able to wet your hair, apply mask, cover with shower cap and let it sit longer, you might have better results, but I am satisified so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the hefty price tag.</li>
            <li>Being that it&#x27;s 40 dollars or so, I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price tag.  </li>
            <li>Product also came very fast.</li>
            <li>As I get older I need to use more of this type of stuff to have young looking hair.  </li>
            <li>I received this mask as a complimentary gift at a salon where I get full blonde highlights on my mostly straight fine almost waist-length hair, and after using it twice, I would not ever buy this.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Not so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several hair masks and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>After one application, I could feel my hair was so much healthier!  </li>
            <li>No expensive toxic treatments for me, just a Living Proof hair mask once a month</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was sad!&lt;br /&gt;The masks of kerastase are much better and cost the same .</li>
            <li>Note: this product is NOT a hair conditioner, shampoo first, apply mask for about 5 minutes, rinse, apply conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I put two quarter size amounts in, and the second time I added on a handful more of the mask thinking it would work better, but got the same results.</li>
            <li>deep treatment is better in effectiveness and price.</li>
            <li>Great for my blonde, at times dry hair.</li>
            <li>This made my curls a bit more flat and</li>
            <li>I dislike that flat look for my hair, and prefer a bit more volume.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft, manageable and shiny!</li>
            <li>I was still Scepticl as my hair is very processed but on my  first use,  my hair was transformed.  </li>
            <li>I have a super curly, dry, damaged hair and this has truly given my hair great strength, shine and a lot less frizz.</li>
            <li>Had good hopes for this product, but not very good at what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li>We have fine African American/wavy/curly/texturized</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that I get hi and low lights on.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how little product you need to get amazing results.</li>
            <li>My fine, color-treated desert- and chlorine-exposed hair, with extensions, has really responded to weekly use, so I will definitely purchase this again in about a year...</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It really hydrates your hair.</li>
            <li>Wet hair is more susceptible to breakage.</li>
            <li>Much has been said about this mask</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>You can tell the high prices are meant to fund the marketing campaign!</li>
            <li>thank you so much.</li>
            <li>This entire RESTORE line actually coats the hair with a moisturizing shampoo, the mask makes stripped hair incredibly shiny and soft and the daily moisturing cream makes the hair softer and splits</li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft and healthy after only one use!</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time this morning and WOW what a difference!</li>
            <li>This really gives my hair new life.</li>
            <li>Still have more than half the tub.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these products and can&#x27;t  wait to receive the rest of my order.  </li>
            <li>High recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have extremely long, fine hair (nearly to the waist).</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t really worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>Add in natural thinning of hair as I get older and</li>
            <li>I get my hair professionally colored every four weeks</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and bouncy even after the effects of hair straightening tools, bleaching etc.  </li>
            <li>Much prefer the Salerm protein treatments and conditioner plus regular ole infusium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been bleached, dyed and more in the last few years.  </li>
            <li>I would caution people with fine or thin hair to not use very much.</li>
            <li>My hair was actually more dry and limp after using this.</li>
            <li>There are other hair masks out there that do a much better job of moisturizing hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I live where it can be quite dry and windy in the fall/winter, this helps keep my hair hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li>and my hair feels SO soft and is starting to regain its shine again!</li>
            <li>My hair is this long completely on purpose and the ends are not split.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li>I put it in my damp hair and then let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>thin, fine, damaged, you name it, I have it.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Save your money and try another hair mask..</li>
            <li> I bought this because i have hair  like jennifer aniston and because  she only endorses products that work. I was still Scepticl as my hair is very processed but on my  first use,  my hair was transformed.  I would highly recommend these products and can&#x27;t  wait to receive the rest of my order.  I wish  i could post  a picture of my hair after just one treatment.</li>
            <li> Noticed immediate difference</li>
            <li> This does wonders for my dry dyed hair.  It no longer looks like straw and is much more manageable. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from the Dr Oz show and I found that it does do what it claims.  My hair is color treated.  I usually color my hair every 4 -5 weeks by the third or fourth week, when the roots grow out my hair becomes dry lifeless and unmanageable.  This time at the fourth week I put this product on it and unbelievably it restored my hair.  No more split ends, the shine was back and it felt silky soft to the touch.  It&#x27;s just as if I colored it, but without the hair color.  Now I can go twice as long without putting the hair color in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave some to my grown daughter to try and she LOVES it too.  She couldn&#x27;t believe how something could repair her split ends and change her hair texture so drastically.  I&#x27;m not rich and this product is a bit pricey, so me and my daughter are putting our money together and buying another jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we found that we don&#x27;t need to use it twice a week as it says on the jar &#x27;cause it worked the 1st time we put it on.  One other thing, the reason  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I think in the process of restoring my hair it makes some hair fall out, not too much just a few strands, but at my age (53), my hair is already thinning and I can&#x27;t afford any additional hair loss.  Anyway I think I will continue to use it because the pros outweigh the cons.[[ASIN:B005G7QK9C Living Proof Restore Mask Treatment 8 oz]]</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. I had been debating on buying it for some time, but I finally got it and have only used it a few times, but can already tell the difference in my hair. Product also came very fast.</li>
            <li> Expensive hype from s celebrity, not worth the money. My hair was actually more dry and limp after using this. Not for people with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great and does a good job on restoring your hairs softness that lasts.</li>
            <li> Guess I expected to. Notice a difference considering the price. Not so much!</li>
            <li> Only used twice but my African American hair still is dry. Do not know after 6 mo of use it will it make a difference</li>
            <li> I do love this product.  As I get older I need to use more of this type of stuff to have young looking hair.  Don&#x27;t use every time but once a week.</li>
            <li> I use this treatment about once a week. I get my hair professionally colored every four weeks and once every three months I get a body perm, so lots of chemicals on my hair. Add in natural thinning of hair as I get older and it can have an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wet my hair in the shower, then apply mask and let it sit on hair while I shave my legs etc. I wish I had time to let it sit on my hair longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are able to wet your hair, apply mask, cover with shower cap and let it sit longer, you might have better results, but I am satisified so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make the decision if I want to buy more when this jar is almost gone.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft but I haven&#x27;t really noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li> There are other hair masks out there that do a much better job of moisturizing hair without weighing it down. I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the hefty price tag.</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Leaves hair soft and silly. Great for my blonde, at times dry hair.</li>
            <li> Saw this on Dr Oz and gave it a try. It really works and makes your hair feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several hair masks and this is my favorite. It increases the softness of my hair and manages split ends. The scent is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is truly the best hair product ever created for damaged hair.  Leaves hair soft and bouncy even after the effects of hair straightening tools, bleaching etc.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> hair turn oily after use</li>
            <li> This is not as good as the leave-in treatment product I purchased from this line.  It does an acceptable job of moisturizing my hair but I still prefer my Fekkai or Kerastase conditioners to this product.  I doubt I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have hair that needed some love.  It&#x27;s been bleached, dyed and more in the last few years.  After my latest bleach session my hair stylist recommended this so as a good girl I bought it right away.  After one application, I could feel my hair was so much healthier!  I use this whenever I wash my hair, I mix half mask treatment with half regular conditioner.  It rules, I&#x27;m a lover for life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a sample of this product and I don&#x27;t believe I will be purchasing the full size.  Being that it&#x27;s 40 dollars or so, I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price tag.  I put it in my damp hair and then let it dry naturally.  It definitely weighed down my hair, which is naturally curly and full-looking.  This made my curls a bit more flat and my scalp a bit oily.  If you have super dry hair then this might be a good option for you, but in my experience it wasn&#x27;t great.  I dislike that flat look for my hair, and prefer a bit more volume.</li>
            <li> Awesome, one of the best masks I have used. I have fine color treated hair, and I love how my hair looks and feels after using this product. I have re bought it several times, and will continue to, the best!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the last 2 months and have not notice any difference in my hair. For the price of it I will not be buying this product again. Does not live up to its price!</li>
            <li> This really gives my hair new life.</li>
            <li> My hair drinks this up. It really hydrates your hair. Only need to use once every other week, so is lasting a while.</li>
            <li> I started reading mixed reviews. Some people loved it, others hated it. Might I add I think HOW you use it is a huge factor in the end result. My hair was so dry after a chemical treatment that a hairstylist &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34;, that when I blow dried my hair caught fire!!!!!!...that dry and damaged it was. I have been using this product for the last two weeks, twice a week and my hair feels SO soft and is starting to regain its shine again! I really love this product is the first I&#x27;ve ever tried from this brand and definitely I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I try to use it once every two weeks. Makes my thick hair smooth and fluffy.</li>
            <li> Love the product.....Great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Received a sample pack of this deep hair conditioner and noticed immediate results, so I bought the jar.  My fine, color-treated desert- and chlorine-exposed hair, with extensions, has really responded to weekly use, so I will definitely purchase this again in about a year...that&#x27;s how little product you need to get amazing results.Hair feels more luxurious after one treatment.</li>
            <li> This is one of my go-to hair products. I have extremely long, fine hair (nearly to the waist). My hair is this long completely on purpose and the ends are not split. There are several methods I use to allow the hair to grow this way without being forced to cut it and this mask is one of them. These days I usually focus on using this product on the ends (bottom half) and regular conditioner at the roots. Also, just in general I only wash my hair every few days and use dry shampoo in between. Washing hair every day is a huge mistake. Detangle hair while it&#x27;s dry before washing then comb mask through your hair. This allows even distribution that your fingers won&#x27;t manage and won&#x27;t yank hairs out by detangling wet hair. Wet hair is more susceptible to breakage. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Fast shipper, great mask.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product.  I used it one time and I could tell the difference with my hair.  It makes my hair look thicker and shinier.  I use it once a week.  I will continue to buy this product.  It is expensive, but being that you only use it once a week, the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this and was asked by multiple people if I had received a keratin treatment! No expensive toxic treatments for me, just a Living Proof hair mask once a month and I&#x27;m set. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love living proof!! Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I have a super curly, dry, damaged hair and this has truly given my hair great strength, shine and a lot less frizz. It is great!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  I have medium thickness hair with ombre highlighted ends. The ends of my hair were slightly dry before I tried this product and after one use... ONE.... my hair was straw like, tangly and DRIER than before I used it!  While the consistency is very thick, after washing it out, my hair was squeaky clean.....that should not be the case for a deep conditioner.  Perhaps if you have chronically oily/greasy hair, this would be good.  However, if you&#x27;re already dry, this is NOT A GOOD PRODUCT!  I even bought the Restore Shampoo and am returning that as well... what a joke of a product for the EXPENSIVE price!  I get better conditioning with drug-store brands.</li>
            <li> Much has been said about this mask and I was really excited to buy it and try it.&lt;br /&gt;However was a major disappointment .&lt;br /&gt;I used twice and what I observed was not a soft, shiny hair. My hair was literally hard and became difficult to comb and detangle after rinsing . I was sad!&lt;br /&gt;The masks of kerastase are much better and cost the same .</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! Because of this product I bought the entire line of &amp;#34;living proof&amp;#34; products, however non of the rest of the line come close to this product! Fanatastic</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful product.  Selected by More magazine as one of the best beauty products...that is how I learned about it.  This product restores a beautiful shine to my color treated hair.  Note: this product is NOT a hair conditioner, shampoo first, apply mask for about 5 minutes, rinse, apply conditioner.  I cannot believe how great this product makes my hair look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;Seller is prompt and product arrives well packaged.  High recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 2 months ago. Still have more than half the tub. It&#x27;s bigger than you think. I love this product. You use a quarter size amount comb thro let sit for 5 minutes and rince and you are done. You don&#x27;t need conditioner the days you choose to use it. They say every 2 to 3 days. I will always have this product.</li>
            <li> I love everything productLiving Proof makes. Nothing else compares in making my thin colored treated hair have body and manageability!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but it well worth it for special occasions to have gorgeous hair.  I hate putting product in my hair - I run my fingers through my hair often and dislike curl cream or hairspray.  This mega conditioner gives you hair that looks and feels like you&#x27;ve never had a frizzy day in your life.  My hair is thick and very coarse and absorbs a lot of conditioner without flattening or being weighed down.  I would caution people with fine or thin hair to not use very much.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my hair great improvement over other mask I used for my hair.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Living Proof for about a year now, and it does exactly what it says it will!  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> best conditioner ever after i use it everyone asks me if I got my hair done  ....  love it</li>
            <li> Great product for restoring shine and smoothing out your hair.  I use it once every 7-10 days and have noticed a big improvement in the overall appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love Living Proof hair care line.  It is expensive, but a small amount goes a long way and the difference it makes in my hair is amazing.  I have never had another product work as well as this one, so I&#x27;d highly recommend it!  Leaves my hair super soft, manageable and shiny!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the great reviews on Amazon, however, this product did NOTHING to improve my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Per the directions, I washed my hair with shampoo, applied the product to my hair for and left it in for 5 mins, rinsed and applied my hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not improve my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have seriously messed up hair: thin, fine, damaged, you name it, I have it.  This mask makes my hair look and feel great, and that makes me feel great!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product made by Livingproof. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and have seen a major difference in the way my hair feels since using it.  I do both highlights and lowlights in my hair, preferring to be more on the blonder side (they do have more fun, trust me), and this helps counter the damage done by the highlights.  Additionally, I live where it can be quite dry and windy in the fall/winter, this helps keep my hair hydrated and soft.  Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Had good hopes for this product, but not very good at what it claims to do.  Never answered my request t return it, so I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, made my hair feel &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34;.  Throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I use it twice a week and it makes my hair feel and look so healthy!</li>
            <li> Bought two rounds of the masque plus the six week restore treatment for myself and daughter. We have fine African American/wavy/curly/texturized hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love this, but it honestly didn&#x27;t do a thing. Much prefer the Salerm protein treatments and conditioner plus regular ole infusium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t waste my money again.</li>
            <li> Made a big difference in my hair.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been reading reviews etc on this product for 2 months now and finally decided to buy it and VERY happy that I did! I have fine hair that I get hi and low lights on. I started to notice that it has stated breaking and the ends have almost a fried look to it. I used this product for the first time this morning and WOW what a difference! My hair after one use looks thicker, fuller and healther.... I can&#x27;t believe the difference! I wish I had purchased it 2 months ago! So, I recommend to anyone thats on the fence like I was, go ahead and purchase it! My main factor was the price but the  when you think about it, if like my family, you spend more then that going out to eat!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Added a healthy shine and an all over healthy look that I so needed. Would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I received this mask as a complimentary gift at a salon where I get full blonde highlights on my mostly straight fine almost waist-length hair, and after using it twice, I would not ever buy this. The first time I used it I put two quarter size amounts in, and the second time I added on a handful more of the mask thinking it would work better, but got the same results. It made my hair feel incredibly dry and stuck together like rope, and impossible to comb without risking breakage. I had to coat my hair with my aveda leave-in conditioner in order to get a wide-tooth comb through it. This did not suit my type of hair at all. Telling it like it happened just might spare some people the trouble of experiencing the same thing. Nexxus Humectress deep treatment is better in effectiveness and price.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t really worth the extra money.  I&#x27;ve been just as satisfied with Pantene/Loreal or any drugstore brand&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe the hype about this product.  Save your money.  I thought it was quite overpriced.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  I love Jennifer Aniston and have liked my Sephora samples of this line so decided to order the shampoo, conditioner starter kit and this mask.  The smell is great but it leaves my hair drier than if I just use my regular Fekkai conditioner (not even the mask!).  I usually use Fekkai shampoo and conditioner and Kerastase hair masks, and prefer those products.  You can tell the high prices are meant to fund the marketing campaign!</li>
            <li> This mask treatment leaves my hair feeling so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> and OMG the price! thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I have damaged, striped, crunchy AA hair that has been chemically treated. This entire RESTORE line actually coats the hair with a moisturizing shampoo, the mask makes stripped hair incredibly shiny and soft and the daily moisturing cream makes the hair softer and splits/breaks less. I bought the full line and I noticed the difference. Stops the acceleration of dry, breaking hair. Worth the 40+ price tag!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! My hair felt so soft and healthy after only one use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the mask a couple of times. I love the scent, it&#x27;s not too strong, somewhat citrusy. I&#x27;m not sure how useful it is at restoring hair to the virgin state, my hair isn&#x27;t in a bad condition, so after using it, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of a difference. I do notice that my hair, which usually takes really long to dry, dries quite quickly when I use the mask. I did read something about the description that the mask forms a protective layer over the hair, maybe that&#x27;s why.</li>
