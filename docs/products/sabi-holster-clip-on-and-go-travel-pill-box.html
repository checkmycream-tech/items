            <li>It is a great idea, but needs some modification.</li>
            <li>It has three compartments, so it is great for separating things out by time of day too.</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>OK, I must admit: I bought this for the awesome ID (Industrial Design).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is nice to have design be a feature in something as trivial as a pill container!</li>
            <li>It is so much better than carrying around pill bottles in my purse, takes up no space, and the separate compartments are great!</li>
            <li>of course she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>3 fit perfect.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good sized pill box and it functions well.</li>
            <li>Why aren&#x27;t more companies applying intelligent design to every day objects?</li>
            <li>I have to resist calling this a pill box because it is so much more than that!</li>

            <li>expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>I clip it in my purse and it&#x27;s very secure</li>
            <li>I love things that are modular and help me get things done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars when they offer more color options.</li>
            <li>Materials and finish are top notch.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the fact that this holster fits in my pocket</li>
            <li>and I will be able to take a moments notice.</li>
            <li>So I knew as soon as I got the Sabi Holster pill holder in for review, it would be the perfect christmas present for my mom and</li>
            <li>I wish it had more compartments</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sexy.</li>
            <li>I think it would be better if the cap just popped out instead of sliding out.    </li>
            <li>read more about reviews here    </li>
            <li>I love this pill box.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>fast lol.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for carrying your pills around in daily or over a vacation period.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very cool looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and easy to open/close.</li>
            <li>and I can easily find it without having to look every where.</li>
            <li>All in all, it is convenient and really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Convenient and easy to use - doesn&#x27;t take up any room in my purse</li>
            <li>Maybe something that is easily camouflaged as something else...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to do.  </li>
            <li>Three compartments make it easy to sort your pills.</li>
            <li>The Sabi holster is easy and convenient.</li>
            <li>so I could attach it securely to my purse, via a locking caribineer, but don&#x27;t see this design as very useful, since the top  piece comes off so easily.</li>
            <li>Good quality, easy to get the right pills out at the right time.  </li>
            <li>It is nice looking, sturdy, and works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>but it works fine</li>
            <li>The pill organizer slides out to easily (in my opinion) to feel secure about clipping on to anything.</li>
            <li>It certainly looks nice.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy accessible.</li>
            <li>Not designed for larger supplements, but i manage to fit what i need in it, it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great item to have especially if you are an all day goer, like I am.</li>
            <li>The Holster is a great way to take your daily vitamins and pills with you on the go.  </li>
            <li>And you have a light load (say, 3 capsules per day), you&#x27;ll do just</li>
            <li>You can fit a week&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And since I rarely take more than 1 a day, this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can fit 18 in this puppy.</li>
            <li>And cheap.</li>
            <li>On the Go travel pill box works great if you put it in a purse, bag, something physical that it can attach to (it even works well clipped to a sturdy shirt pocket).</li>
            <li>But overall great for emergencies and great when it comes to physically clipping it on to something.</li>
            <li>This one was fantastic for the days I am hiking.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to clean</li>
            <li>absolutely the best pill box - fits my bag, really well made i absolutely love it and use it all the time, actually i did not expect to use it that often</li>
            <li>Sabi has taken a very mundane product and made it beautiful and interesting.</li>
            <li>it holds up to three days worth of pills for me and it is easy to carry.</li>
            <li>True to advertisement.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>my full review here:</li>
            <li>have cool product lust.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>The pill compartment slides into the case and stays pretty secure</li>
            <li>Third one I&#x27;ve bought love them!  </li>
            <li>And this is pretty cool</li>
            <li>Love it for on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size for slipping into a purse pocket or something similar.</li>
            <li>pills and have had numerous occasions where it came in handy.</li>
            <li>But filling it and throwing it in your bag is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>lid is a easy snap on lid with easy access to the inner cartridge that holds pills of all shapes and sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know I have the pills I need right on me.  </li>
            <li>right on</li>
            <li>Why bring your full 7 day pill case on a weekend getaway when this one is smaller, more portable and convenient.</li>
            <li>Great little product!  </li>
            <li>Overall, great product for everyday use, stylish, comfortable and convenient for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li>and she said this would be the perfect thing to take on her trips since her trips are only a few days</li>
            <li>product allows her to now carry around only one days worth of pills, in a convenient and stylish package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hold very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering my friend one because she takes high dollar pills and is always carrying the full bottle around instead of just what she</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good little case for when I need to take my medication with me for a day trip or something.</li>
            <li>This eliminated the need to have many different pill bottles in my purse taking up so much space!  </li>
            <li>- this puppy rocks the larger doses elegantly.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would actually use this</li>
            <li>The separate compartments let you know exactly what you have taken or forgotten.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of their products as they hit the market.</li>
            <li>If I put my pills in in exactly the right way, they fit, but just barely.  </li>
            <li>received the large pill box, which has three compartments - a small one on the top with a flip top lid, and a medium and large one in the body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had occasions where the the top has come open and my pills have fallen on the floor and in my pocket (very embarrassing).</li>
            <li>Perhaps a flip release like the lid would work better to open the whole box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I only recommend products I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>

            <li>Nothing fancy but the first really usable portable pill case I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>It has three compartments, and they are big enough compartments to fit more than 1 pill.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to open and close</li>
            <li>It holds all my daily pills and its easy to use, it just slightly large for my pocket.</li>
            <li>If you load this up daily with your pills it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Very handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.</li>

            <li>really appreciate the benefits of this slide-out design.</li>
            <li>It is very well-designed and convenient in use.</li>
            <li>Now I am not embarrassed to pull it out of my bag and sometimes thanks to the metal clip I even put it on my desk</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really enjoys how durable and convenient it is..</li>
            <li>Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for</li>
            <li>There is no need to dig around through a purse, backpack, or bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for</li>
            <li>/&gt;The little tray slides out easily, and the top pops open.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of us with a serious capsule load, this is good for 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size is good and big enough to hold my daily meds at work.</li>
            <li>It is nice that is small and you can just put it in a bag or pocket.</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s always good to have a back up vitamin for those days when there wasn&#x27;t enough coffee in the world to wake me up enough to remember to take</li>
            <li>The most important thing to me is that if you drop it, it won&#x27;t pop open and spill your pills all over the floor; it seems hard to believe, but that fact is actually pretty unheard of in pill organizers until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Sabi - really love this little item.</li>
            <li>Highly portable, well made.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for someone wanting to carry one days worth of medications taken at three different times during the day.</li>
            <li>However the pill capacity is greatly over exaggerated.</li>
            <li>Works well for normal sized pills.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite pill boxes for everyday use is this HOLSTER clip-and-go pill carrier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to open, but won&#x27;t open in my bag alone and can be clipped on anywhere.</li>
            <li>compartments are big enough to hold a few pills in each one, and the top one is really convenient for a quickly needed headache release or aspirin if you have heart</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit in my pocket but large enough to fit all of my medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors of the box are blue and while, very nice and non- irritating.</li>
            <li>It totally functions and serves its purpose, but if you need a portable pill box, you want a little more variety in what it looks like.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t give this pill box 5 stars because, although it was easy for me to open, I can see someone with arthritis or other issues with their hands having difficulty squeezing the release mechanism to access their medicine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I prefer not to clip Sabi Clip-and-go pill carrier onto bags or pockets because we have little kids, I find that it is a very useful feature.</li>
            <li>I end up staying somewhere overnight unexpectedly.</li>
            <li>so people don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m naturally this nutty.</li>
            <li>I was using an old mint tin before and when the pill numbers were off</li>
            <li>This three-compartment daily pill box (2 compartments in the slide-out cartridge, plus one “secret compartment” under the cap) is the perfect pill box for the heavy pill, vitamin or supplement user who is always on the go.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This three-compartment daily pill box (2 compartments in the slide-out cartridge, plus one “secret compartment” under the cap) is the perfect pill box for the heavy pill, vitamin or supplement user on the go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;FYI, their website shows a new product coming which will include 7 of these clip-on organizers, each labeled with a day of the week, each tucked into a carrying case that will look similar to the large pill organizer they currently offer.</li>
            <li>This way he isn&#x27;t carrying the whole pill bottle and its small to put in a pocket while he walks with his walker&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s small enough to fit in a purse</li>
            <li>I could barely squeeze 1 into each of the chambers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this pill carrier as I can put a few days worth in it and just toss it in my messenger bag and not have to worry about it opening up on me.</li>
            <li>so I owudl always know which side was &amp;#34;UP&amp;#34; with regards to the compartments, I still found that I often opened it when it was UPSIDE DOWN, and spilled out the contenst of that first compartment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, at about $8.99, this is actually quite affordable for a true designer product (though some of Sabi&#x27;s other products in this line are more expensive).</li>
            <li>This little holster is prefect for my needs it holds just the right amount of pills and has 3 compartments to divide the different pills.</li>
            <li>Compared with every single other hideous and embarrassing pill container that has ever been made, for the first time I&#x27;m actually not embarrassed to pull out my pills in front of people -- in fact, I almost want to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one carrier I got at pharmacy was nice but had such a plain design and made me feel that I have serious medical problems, though I needed it just for taking vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;Sabi</li>

            <li> So I knew as soon as I got the Sabi Holster pill holder in for review, it would be the perfect christmas present for my mom and</li>
            <li> I wish it had more compartments</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sexy.</li>
            <li> I think it would be better if the cap just popped out instead of sliding out.    </li>
            <li> read more about reviews here    </li>
            <li> I love this pill box.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> fast lol.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for carrying your pills around in daily or over a vacation period.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very cool looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and easy to open/close.</li>
            <li> and I can easily find it without having to look every where.</li>
            <li> All in all, it is convenient and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use - doesn&#x27;t take up any room in my purse</li>
            <li> Maybe something that is easily camouflaged as something else...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to do.  </li>
            <li> Three compartments make it easy to sort your pills.</li>
            <li> The Sabi holster is easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> so I could attach it securely to my purse, via a locking caribineer, but don&#x27;t see this design as very useful, since the top  piece comes off so easily.</li>
            <li> Good quality, easy to get the right pills out at the right time.  </li>
            <li> It is nice looking, sturdy, and works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> but it works fine</li>
            <li> The pill organizer slides out to easily (in my opinion) to feel secure about clipping on to anything.</li>
            <li> It certainly looks nice.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy accessible.</li>
            <li> Not designed for larger supplements, but i manage to fit what i need in it, it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great item to have especially if you are an all day goer, like I am.</li>
            <li> The Holster is a great way to take your daily vitamins and pills with you on the go.  </li>
            <li> And you have a light load (say, 3 capsules per day), you&#x27;ll do just</li>
            <li> You can fit a week&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And since I rarely take more than 1 a day, this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can fit 18 in this puppy.</li>
            <li> And cheap.</li>
            <li> On the Go travel pill box works great if you put it in a purse, bag, something physical that it can attach to (it even works well clipped to a sturdy shirt pocket).</li>
            <li> But overall great for emergencies and great when it comes to physically clipping it on to something.</li>
            <li> This one was fantastic for the days I am hiking.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to clean</li>
            <li> absolutely the best pill box - fits my bag, really well made i absolutely love it and use it all the time, actually i did not expect to use it that often</li>
            <li> Sabi has taken a very mundane product and made it beautiful and interesting.</li>
            <li> it holds up to three days worth of pills for me and it is easy to carry.</li>
            <li> True to advertisement.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>

            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> The pill compartment slides into the case and stays pretty secure</li>
            <li> Third one I&#x27;ve bought love them!  </li>
            <li> And this is pretty cool</li>
            <li> Love it for on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size for slipping into a purse pocket or something similar.</li>
            <li> pills and have had numerous occasions where it came in handy.</li>
            <li> But filling it and throwing it in your bag is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> lid is a easy snap on lid with easy access to the inner cartridge that holds pills of all shapes and sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know I have the pills I need right on me.  </li>
            <li> right on</li>
            <li> Why bring your full 7 day pill case on a weekend getaway when this one is smaller, more portable and convenient.</li>
            <li> Great little product!  </li>
            <li> Overall, great product for everyday use, stylish, comfortable and convenient for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li> and she said this would be the perfect thing to take on her trips since her trips are only a few days</li>
            <li> product allows her to now carry around only one days worth of pills, in a convenient and stylish package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hold very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering my friend one because she takes high dollar pills and is always carrying the full bottle around instead of just what she</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good little case for when I need to take my medication with me for a day trip or something.</li>
            <li> This eliminated the need to have many different pill bottles in my purse taking up so much space!  </li>
            <li> - this puppy rocks the larger doses elegantly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would actually use this</li>
            <li> The separate compartments let you know exactly what you have taken or forgotten.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of their products as they hit the market.</li>
            <li> If I put my pills in in exactly the right way, they fit, but just barely.  </li>
            <li> received the large pill box, which has three compartments - a small one on the top with a flip top lid, and a medium and large one in the body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had occasions where the the top has come open and my pills have fallen on the floor and in my pocket (very embarrassing).</li>
            <li> Perhaps a flip release like the lid would work better to open the whole box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I only recommend products I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>

            <li> Nothing fancy but the first really usable portable pill case I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> It has three compartments, and they are big enough compartments to fit more than 1 pill.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to open and close</li>
            <li> It holds all my daily pills and its easy to use, it just slightly large for my pocket.</li>
            <li> If you load this up daily with your pills it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Very handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.</li>

            <li> really appreciate the benefits of this slide-out design.</li>
            <li> It is very well-designed and convenient in use.</li>
            <li> Now I am not embarrassed to pull it out of my bag and sometimes thanks to the metal clip I even put it on my desk</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really enjoys how durable and convenient it is..</li>

            <li> /&gt;The little tray slides out easily, and the top pops open.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those of us with a serious capsule load, this is good for 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The size is good and big enough to hold my daily meds at work.</li>
            <li> It is nice that is small and you can just put it in a bag or pocket.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s always good to have a back up vitamin for those days when there wasn&#x27;t enough coffee in the world to wake me up enough to remember to take</li>
            <li> The most important thing to me is that if you drop it, it won&#x27;t pop open and spill your pills all over the floor; it seems hard to believe, but that fact is actually pretty unheard of in pill organizers until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Sabi - really love this little item.</li>
            <li> Highly portable, well made.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for someone wanting to carry one days worth of medications taken at three different times during the day.</li>
            <li> However the pill capacity is greatly over exaggerated.</li>
            <li> Works well for normal sized pills.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite pill boxes for everyday use is this HOLSTER clip-and-go pill carrier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to open, but won&#x27;t open in my bag alone and can be clipped on anywhere.</li>
            <li> compartments are big enough to hold a few pills in each one, and the top one is really convenient for a quickly needed headache release or aspirin if you have heart</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in my pocket but large enough to fit all of my medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors of the box are blue and while, very nice and non- irritating.</li>
            <li> It totally functions and serves its purpose, but if you need a portable pill box, you want a little more variety in what it looks like.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t give this pill box 5 stars because, although it was easy for me to open, I can see someone with arthritis or other issues with their hands having difficulty squeezing the release mechanism to access their medicine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I prefer not to clip Sabi Clip-and-go pill carrier onto bags or pockets because we have little kids, I find that it is a very useful feature.</li>
            <li> I end up staying somewhere overnight unexpectedly.</li>
            <li> so people don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m naturally this nutty.</li>
            <li> I was using an old mint tin before and when the pill numbers were off</li>
            <li> This three-compartment daily pill box (2 compartments in the slide-out cartridge, plus one “secret compartment” under the cap) is the perfect pill box for the heavy pill, vitamin or supplement user who is always on the go.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This three-compartment daily pill box (2 compartments in the slide-out cartridge, plus one “secret compartment” under the cap) is the perfect pill box for the heavy pill, vitamin or supplement user on the go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;FYI, their website shows a new product coming which will include 7 of these clip-on organizers, each labeled with a day of the week, each tucked into a carrying case that will look similar to the large pill organizer they currently offer.</li>
            <li> This way he isn&#x27;t carrying the whole pill bottle and its small to put in a pocket while he walks with his walker&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s small enough to fit in a purse</li>
            <li> I could barely squeeze 1 into each of the chambers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this pill carrier as I can put a few days worth in it and just toss it in my messenger bag and not have to worry about it opening up on me.</li>
            <li> so I owudl always know which side was &amp;#34;UP&amp;#34; with regards to the compartments, I still found that I often opened it when it was UPSIDE DOWN, and spilled out the contenst of that first compartment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, at about $8.99, this is actually quite affordable for a true designer product (though some of Sabi&#x27;s other products in this line are more expensive).</li>
            <li> This little holster is prefect for my needs it holds just the right amount of pills and has 3 compartments to divide the different pills.</li>
            <li> Compared with every single other hideous and embarrassing pill container that has ever been made, for the first time I&#x27;m actually not embarrassed to pull out my pills in front of people -- in fact, I almost want to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one carrier I got at pharmacy was nice but had such a plain design and made me feel that I have serious medical problems, though I needed it just for taking vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;Sabi</li>
            <li> one flaw that I noticed is that the drawer does not seem to want to stay attached to it&#x27;s frame, so when you pull the drawer to the third compartment, the whole drawer usually comes out of the Holster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is probably just me,  but the problem persisted so long that I don&#x27;t use this anymore.</li>
            <li> However, this is not for long term storage.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for long term storage you&#x27;ll want to skip out on this, but for my purposes it works well.  </li>
            <li> But I do regularly carry around Tylenol and other pills like that-</li>
            <li> It is not perfect for me as my vitamins and supplements do not fit inside, but that is okay.  </li>
            <li> but big enough to hold the pills you need for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any pills bigger than a men&#x27;s one a day will not fit into the individual slots.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandmother for christmas, as she usually carries around a big bulky 7 day pill box in her purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the design and am looking forward to getting some of their other products</li>
            <li> it serve the average nutritional supplement user?&lt;br /&gt;Depends on what you consider \\&quot;average\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neat idea, although not air tight.</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t have to waste time fishing around for it in my bag...</li>
            <li> everyone always asks why i would waste money on buying this, then asks me where to get it.</li>
            <li> I went back to my ugly old prescription container -- at least the lid can close tightly.</li>
            <li> I take over 40 pills a day due to Congestive Heart Failure.  </li>
            <li> Very tight design, reminds me of something OXO would make.  </li>
            <li> you have 3 small (0-size capsules) or 6 medium sized tablets, you&#x27;ll get by just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> point is this: The product rocks for the small</li>
            <li> sure if this is an intended feature or not, but it could be annoying if you are trying to use one hand to slide the drawer out, and it comes all the way out!</li>
            <li> I put this pill container in my purse pocket because it is relatively small</li>
            <li> He loves that it is small.  </li>
            <li> Other pill cases with compartments I have seen had a bad tendency to pop open in my pocket</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a &#x27;click&#x27; stop when you close it, so I am afraid the inner sleeve will slide out.</li>
            <li> Very small and convenient.  </li>
            <li> For any woman who is tired of lugging around all kinds of bottles in their purse, this is the solution!</li>
            <li> The problem arises when you just casually want to put the box in your pocket.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see it wasn&#x27;t an airtight seal</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The size is good and big enough to hold my daily meds at work. It has three sections to put your meds in. Cost is reasonable..</li>
            <li> Perfect for carrying on bike rides</li>
            <li> If you load this up daily with your pills it&#x27;s fine. It certainly looks nice. But I need something that I can keep in my bag to hold a backup supply that might not be used for weeks. Since this is not airtight it lets in moisture and the pills don&#x27;t last. I went back to my ugly old prescription container -- at least the lid can close tightly.</li>
            <li> I love things that are modular and help me get things done. This little holster is prefect for my needs it holds just the right amount of pills and has 3 compartments to divide the different pills. It&#x27;s easy to open, but won&#x27;t open in my bag alone and can be clipped on anywhere. Was waiting for this for years! Thank you!</li>
            <li> True to advertisement. Well made.</li>
            <li> Works well for normal sized pills. Good quality, easy to get the right pills out at the right time.  I would highly recommend for someone wanting to carry one days worth of medications taken at three different times during the day.</li>
            <li> I bought this and folio for my grandparents and they are both a big fan.  Very tight design, reminds me of something OXO would make.  I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars when they offer more color options.</li>
            <li> Great design. Highly portable, well made. Why aren&#x27;t more companies applying intelligent design to every day objects? Thanks Sabi - really love this little item. It is a bit smaller than I thought, but that is solely my fault. I pop this in my daily carry and my med kit when traveling. It&#x27;s compact and easy to open/close. Materials and finish are top notch. Hats off to Sabi.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fact that this holster fits in my pocket and I can have my daily medications with me all day and I will be able to take a moments notice. This is a great item to have especially if you are an all day goer, like I am. I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I picked this pill box because of the attractive design (i.e., doesn&#x27;t look like a pill box).  It is nice looking, sturdy, and works pretty well.  I knocked off 1 star only because I wish it was just tiny bit DEEPER (manufacturer please note!).  If I put my pills in in exactly the right way, they fit, but just barely.  Maybe they could offer the same design in a slightly larger size?</li>
            <li> Not designed for larger supplements, but i manage to fit what i need in it, it works great.</li>
            <li> My mom is a vitamin junkie. So I knew as soon as I got the Sabi Holster pill holder in for review, it would be the perfect christmas present for my mom and of course she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sabi pil holder is for those who need to carry a larger number of pills, or larger sized pills, in style, each day. This three-compartment daily pill box (2 compartments in the slide-out cartridge, plus one “secret compartment” under the cap) is the perfect pill box for the heavy pill, vitamin or supplement user who is always on the go.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid is a easy snap on lid with easy access to the inner cartridge that holds pills of all shapes and sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom travels alot for her job and likes to bring all her vitamins with her and she said this would be the perfect thing to take on her trips since her trips are only a few days long.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small enough to fit in a purse but big enough to hold the pills you need for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to open and close so if you need a pill holder for on the go, this one is for you!</li>
            <li> The Holster is a great way to take your daily vitamins and pills with you on the go.  No fuss.  Very small and convenient.  The cover fits snuggly so no worries in having this come open in your purse or men&#x27;s shirt pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review here: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

            <li> This eliminated the need to have many different pill bottles in my purse taking up so much space!  I wish it had more compartments but it works fine and I put two types of pills in one spot if I need to... keeps me from carrying so much junk in my purse.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good little case for when I need to take my medication with me for a day trip or something. It fits nicely in the pocket of my purse and I can easily find it without having to look every where. The pill compartment slides into the case and stays pretty secure so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my pills falling out in case I don&#x27;t remember to put it back in the pocket of my purse. All in all, it is convenient and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> OK, I must admit: I bought this for the awesome ID (Industrial Design).&lt;br /&gt;I have cool product lust. And this is pretty cool looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Yes. It&#x27;s elegant.&lt;br /&gt;Well designed.&lt;br /&gt;Even pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it serve the average nutritional supplement user?&lt;br /&gt;Depends on what you consider \\&quot;average\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have 3 small (0-size capsules) or 6 medium sized tablets, you&#x27;ll get by just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of us with a serious capsule load, this is good for 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we&#x27;re not average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you bought this for your medicines. And you have a light load (say, 3 capsules per day), you&#x27;ll do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;My Armour Thyroid, 2 grain tablets? You can fit a week&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My [[ASIN:B00J2GO0RW HyperFocus DRIVE for FOCUS and MOTIVATION.]]? I could barely squeeze 1 into each of the chambers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My [[ASIN:B008QNGHM8 HappyCaps - Mood-Enhancing, Brain Boosters]]? 3 fit perfect. And since I rarely take more than 1 a day, this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the part I like: It&#x27;s a beautiful package. And the internal slider is smooth and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My [[ASIN:B0032BH76O NOW Foods Vitamin D3 5000 Iu]]? I can fit 18 in this puppy. Enough for 2 weeks worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is this: The product rocks for the small doses.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s beautiful. Even innocuous. Nobody would ever suspect you&#x27;re carrying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for larger capsules and pills, head for the [[ASIN:B00JK6DDEK Holster Grande - Extra-large clip-and-go pill box]] - this puppy rocks the larger doses elegantly. And is not much bigger than the one reviewed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma? Geek? Nitroglycerine freak?&lt;br /&gt;Get the SABI. It&#x27;s sexy. And cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a great pill case to keep in your pocket but it doesn&#x27;t hold very much. I think it would be better if the cap just popped out instead of sliding out.    read more about reviews here    [...]</li>
            <li> Third one I&#x27;ve bought love them!  Great for clipping inside a purse or backpack!</li>
            <li> This three-compartment daily pill box (2 compartments in the slide-out cartridge, plus one “secret compartment” under the cap) is the perfect pill box for the heavy pill, vitamin or supplement user on the go.</li>
            <li> Good product. As described and serves purpose. I use it for travel and it fits perfectly in my back pack pencil holder.</li>
            <li> There are times I don&#x27;t want to carry my purse but have to have my medications on me at all times and this is perfect for that! Small enough to fit in my pocket but large enough to fit all of my medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

            <li> Convenient and easy to use - doesn&#x27;t take up any room in my purse and it&#x27;s very cool looking. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great little product!  Sometimes simplicity is the key to convenience!  It&#x27;s great with something just works!!  This piece combines convenience with cleanliness.  2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It is nice that is small and you can just put it in a bag or pocket. Having the clip makes it nice so it&#x27;s easy accessible. Love it for on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

            <li> I needed to carry some of my critical meds with me in case I end up staying somewhere overnight unexpectedly. This was just the ticket.</li>
            <li> Very handy for traveling!</li>
            <li> This has been the best thing for my father in law to use when we take him to lunch. This way he isn&#x27;t carrying the whole pill bottle and its small to put in a pocket while he walks with his walker&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

            <li> I have to resist calling this a pill box because it is so much more than that! I especially love the side clip on the holster because it allows me to clip it to literally anything &amp; I don&#x27;t have to waste time fishing around for it in my bag... Unlike those dated &amp; sterile pill containers, Sabi&#x27;s product is truly designed with functionality &amp; personality in mind. This is a must for those who carry pills with them on regular basis.</li>
            <li> This Sabi On the Go travel pill box works great if you put it in a purse, bag, something physical that it can attach to (it even works well clipped to a sturdy shirt pocket). The problem arises when you just casually want to put the box in your pocket. I&#x27;ve had occasions where the the top has come open and my pills have fallen on the floor and in my pocket (very embarrassing). But overall great for emergencies and great when it comes to physically clipping it on to something. It is an innovative product, but its not perfect.</li>
            <li> I take over 40 pills a day due to Congestive Heart Failure.  I&#x27;m ALWAYS forgetting to take my morning medications with me if I go somewhere for breakfast or just get up and go.  The Holster clips securely in my purse and not only holds my morning medications, but also some of my as needed medications.  I&#x27;m ordering my friend one because she takes high dollar pills and is always carrying the full bottle around instead of just what she needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I&lt;br /&gt;have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.</li>
            <li> I think that the biggest thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was the look of the design. It totally functions and serves its purpose, but if you need a portable pill box, you want a little more variety in what it looks like. Maybe something that is easily camouflaged as something else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I&#x27;m not to the point where I have to carry around 12 pills so people don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m naturally this nutty. But I do regularly carry around Tylenol and other pills like that- plus it&#x27;s always good to have a back up vitamin for those days when there wasn&#x27;t enough coffee in the world to wake me up enough to remember to take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compartments are big enough to hold a few pills in each one, and the top one is really convenient for a quickly needed headache release or aspirin if you have heart issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little tray slides out easily, and the top pops open. It&#x27;s the perfect size for slipping into a purse pocket or something similar. For a pocket, it takes me back to the days of pocket protectors so I personally wouldn&#x27;t slip it into mine. But that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good sized pill box and it functions well. I&#x27;d say go ahead and grab it for your pill box needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an honest review*</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandmother for christmas, as she usually carries around a big bulky 7 day pill box in her purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product allows her to now carry around only one days worth of pills, in a convenient and stylish package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one flaw that I noticed is that the drawer does not seem to want to stay attached to it&#x27;s frame, so when you pull the drawer to the third compartment, the whole drawer usually comes out of the Holster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this is an intended feature or not, but it could be annoying if you are trying to use one hand to slide the drawer out, and it comes all the way out!</li>
            <li> absolutely the best pill box - fits my bag, really well made i absolutely love it and use it all the time, actually i did not expect to use it that often but i am! best yet - it doesn&#x27;t look like a pill box so it&#x27;s another benefit.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would actually use this but I filled it with extra &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; pills and have had numerous occasions where it came in handy. I never used the clip. I just tossed the thing in my bag. The pill organizer slides out to easily (in my opinion) to feel secure about clipping on to anything. Btw, who would clip something like this on? And what would you clip it to? A shirt pocket? It&#x27;s too big for something like that. But filling it and throwing it in your bag is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy but the first really usable portable pill case I&#x27;ve seen.  The separate compartments let you know exactly what you have taken or forgotten. I was using an old mint tin before and when the pill numbers were off I never knew if I had forgotten some that day or days before. Other pill cases with compartments I have seen had a bad tendency to pop open in my pocket</li>
            <li> Sabi has taken a very mundane product and made it beautiful and interesting. Their products look like what Apple would design if they went into the medicine organizing business, and the quality of the materials is impressive as well. Compared with every single other hideous and embarrassing pill container that has ever been made, for the first time I&#x27;m actually not embarrassed to pull out my pills in front of people -- in fact, I almost want to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate the benefits of this slide-out design. The most important thing to me is that if you drop it, it won&#x27;t pop open and spill your pills all over the floor; it seems hard to believe, but that fact is actually pretty unheard of in pill organizers until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, at about $8.99, this is actually quite affordable for a true designer product (though some of Sabi&#x27;s other products in this line are more expensive). I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of their products as they hit the market. They&#x27;re really wonderful things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, their website shows a new product coming which will include 7 of these clip-on organizers, each labeled with a day of the week, each tucked into a carrying case that will look similar to the large pill organizer they currently offer.</li>
            <li> The Holster was designed so that you can clip it and go anywhere. My daughter would use it on her jeans. You can either hook it to your belt loop or simply just clip it on your pocket. Works the same with your purse or diaper bag. Very handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I love this pill box.  it holds up to three days worth of pills for me and it is easy to carry.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a &#x27;click&#x27; stop when you close it, so I am afraid the inner sleeve will slide out.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Should of bought 2</li>
            <li> This is probably just me,  but the problem persisted so long that I don&#x27;t use this anymore. Even though I tried to close the lid so I owudl always know which side was &amp;#34;UP&amp;#34; with regards to the compartments, I still found that I often opened it when it was UPSIDE DOWN, and spilled out the contenst of that first compartment. I got this so I could attach it securely to my purse, via a locking caribineer, but don&#x27;t see this design as very useful, since the top  piece comes off so easily. It is a great idea, but needs some modification.</li>
            <li> I personally have issues with keeping any clips on my pockets; they all fall off.  This pill box fell off too but it&#x27;s not a fault in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the large pill box, which has three compartments - a small one on the top with a flip top lid, and a medium and large one in the body.  It took me a minute to figure out how to open the pill box; I wasn&#x27;t squeezing the release mechanism properly.  Now that I know what I&#x27;m doing it&#x27;s easy to do.  I carry the pill box in my purse since the clip doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give this pill box 5 stars because, although it was easy for me to open, I can see someone with arthritis or other issues with their hands having difficulty squeezing the release mechanism to access their medicine.  Perhaps a flip release like the lid would work better to open the whole box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item as an advertorial on Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite pill boxes for everyday use is this HOLSTER clip-and-go pill carrier. I used to carry my pills in kinder eggs and candy containers trying to disguise somehow that I need to take medications. The one carrier I got at pharmacy was nice but had such a plain design and made me feel that I have serious medical problems, though I needed it just for taking vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;Sabi daily pill clip container is another story. It is very well-designed and convenient in use. Three compartments make it easy to sort your pills. Now I am not embarrassed to pull it out of my bag and sometimes thanks to the metal clip I even put it on my desk stand not to forget to take. Sabi Clip-and-go pill carrier consists of two parts, one is a tray with three compartments and second part is a cover. You just need to slide and take pill(s) you need. The colors of the box are blue and while, very nice and non- irritating. I also like that trays are not transparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I prefer not to clip Sabi Clip-and-go pill carrier onto bags or pockets because we have little kids, I find that it is a very useful feature. I put this pill container in my purse pocket because it is relatively small -96mm x 26mm x 22mm. Overall, great product for everyday use, stylish, comfortable and convenient for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> convenient for &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34;. I clip it in my purse and it&#x27;s very secure, it doesn&#x27;t slide out (unless you pull it).</li>
            <li> The Sabi holster is easy and convenient. Why bring your full 7 day pill case on a weekend getaway when this one is smaller, more portable and convenient. It has three compartments, and they are big enough compartments to fit more than 1 pill. You can click it on your shirt pocket, jean pocket, in the car... anywhere you need! My boyfriend really enjoys how durable and convenient it is..</li>
            <li> This one was fantastic for the days I am hiking.  I know I have the pills I need right on me.  I also keep it in the car hooks right on so I have it.  I use this one for my asprin so when i over do a work out I know I can get to them fast lol.

            <li> Neat idea, although not air tight. This is perfect for carrying your pills around in daily or over a vacation period. However, this is not for long term storage. I bought it to throw in my backpack for some pain relievers for backpacking. I was disappointed to see it wasn&#x27;t an airtight seal</li>
            <li> everyone always asks why i would waste money on buying this, then asks me where to get it. it is nice to have design be a feature in something as trivial as a pill container! i want more!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my husband to keep his medication in and clip it in his laptop bag.  There is no need to carry pill bottles in his bag.  He loves that it is small.  It is not perfect for me as my vitamins and supplements do not fit inside, but that is okay.  I like the clip.  You can clip it on something and always know where it is.  There is no need to dig around through a purse, backpack, or bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

            <li> I love this! It is so much better than carrying around pill bottles in my purse, takes up no space, and the separate compartments are great! For any woman who is tired of lugging around all kinds of bottles in their purse, this is the solution! It has three compartments, so it is great for separating things out by time of day too.</li>
            <li> Looks great and in theory is a wonderful idea. However the pill capacity is greatly over exaggerated. Any pills bigger than a men&#x27;s one a day will not fit into the individual slots.</li>
            <li> I bought this organizer to carry whatever medicines I need to take, as well as some pain medications for emergencies.  If you&#x27;re looking for long term storage you&#x27;ll want to skip out on this, but for my purposes it works well.  Its easy to clean and I&#x27;ve never had it open accidentally in my pocket or while on my belt.</li>
            <li> I like this pill carrier as I can put a few days worth in it and just toss it in my messenger bag and not have to worry about it opening up on me. I like the design and am looking forward to getting some of their other products</li>
            <li> This was nearly perfect for me. It holds all my daily pills and its easy to use, it just slightly large for my pocket.</li>
