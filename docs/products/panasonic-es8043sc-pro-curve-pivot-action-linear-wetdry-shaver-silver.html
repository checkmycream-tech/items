            <li>Best of all, it gives a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>The best part is the battery still keeps a good charge.  </li>
            <li>My DH says he is very happy with this shaver, since he is not one to give anything a good rating, that is saying a lot.</li>
            <li>But I wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li>Great accessories  </li>
            <li>great cleaning that can be done anywhere</li>
            <li>Also, I read through a lot of reviews about this razor not doing so great on the neck.</li>
            <li>I use this on my head and my face and it works great for both.  </li>
            <li>I shave my face and my head with this razor, and it does a great job on both.  </li>
            <li>Also the popup trimmer is great for edging my goatee.  </li>
            <li>But the Panasonic is great.</li>
            <li>The razor works great.  </li>

            <li>This is a great shaver.</li>

            <li>From day one it felt great and never made my skin irriated at all.  </li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>We are both extremely happy with the performance of this razor.</li>
            <li>and it was great.  </li>
            <li>I got it in record time and it works great.  </li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>Read some of the reviews on Amazon, bought this shaver and it gives a really great shave.  </li>
            <li>The fact that the shaver&#x27;s head pivots and \\&quot;curves\\&quot; makes it great.  </li>
            <li>Forget the fact that this model costs around $65.00 it is three times cheaper than the Braun, it is $115.00 cheaper than my Norelco and it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver for the money.</li>
            <li>The system that works best for me is to soften my whiskers with warm water and soap, rinse, then apply a 50/50 mix of shaving gel and penetrating lotion.</li>
            <li>and I realized how great this product is.  </li>
            <li>This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but give this great shaver 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Does a great job.    </li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>, close shave - no nicks, no irritation, just a great close shave.</li>
            <li>it works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I have never replaced the blades and it still cuts great.</li>
            <li>Still a great shaver.</li>
            <li>It is so great to see that the company keeps improving them.</li>
            <li>One month of experience with the ES8043SC is happy.</li>
            <li>Great to find a shaver that gives you a shave as close as a manual razor.</li>
            <li>The linear motor is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product!  </li>
            <li>Simply amazing!</li>
            <li>Best feedback with most LEDs.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get the best results if you don&#x27;t go more than 3 days between shaves.</li>
            <li>I prefer the 3 blade system but this unit is ok at best for the price.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned the latest Braun 8985 and it was excellent, while it lasted...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been much more impressed with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Great product, great feel, quick charge, excellent razor wet/dry close shave.</li>
            <li>it looks cool and sounds great, and feels good in your hand!!!</li>
            <li>Pro:  +Almost asclose a shave  +good sideburn trimmer  </li>
            <li>-good</li>
            <li>Well it still is a good razor.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor because of the fact that it was wet/dry and had good reviews for the price.</li>
            <li>For the price and product I believe this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>but it is all good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shaver for over two years now and just realized that it&#x27;s not quite as good as I thought.</li>
            <li>He really loved that I bought this gift  for him.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do as good a job as my ES726.  </li>
            <li>I was honestly wanting to like this, after all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try the Panasonic based on all of the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I must add that I loved shaving with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Alright there are plenty of good reviews here</li>
            <li>Good looking unit that works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I thought that I would have some problems because of my fair skin</li>
            <li>The razor does have a charge gauge (in percent) to give you a good idea</li>
            <li>It provides a close, comfortable shave, the battery life is excellent (2-3 weeks), and in the over 2 years I&#x27;ve owned it</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good thing Panasonic has been around for decades)</li>
            <li>the shave is so darn good.</li>
            <li>Good performance, long-lasting battery charge, durable, performs just as advertised.</li>
            <li>Amazon it really good too.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t bore you with the details, but the linear is superior in every way.  </li>
            <li>Good shaver for the money.</li>
            <li>Shaves as good as braun and doesn&#x27;t burn face like remington.</li>
            <li>Really good on neck hairs.</li>
            <li>got a good deal on the shaver.</li>
            <li>The problem is the shave quality is not as good as I am used to and it PULLS HAIRS.  </li>
            <li>It gave me years of good shaving.</li>
            <li>Good cut.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a fair test before writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>it feels sooooo good.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>This review is also for all the head shavers out there that need a good quality razor for getting bald.</li>
            <li>How do I know this Panasonic is a good razor?</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s just as good as my Mach3.  </li>
            <li>Good shaver</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good around my chin and jaw</li>
            <li>He tried my husbands linear shaver and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>I have not used one as good as this before.</li>
            <li>NOT SO GOOD.  </li>
            <li>IMHO none hold a candle to this sleek, well desingned and crafted exceptional razor.</li>
            <li>This does an exceptional job on your head.</li>
            <li>First,the equipment: exceptionally well engineered for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li>The reliability is fine, noise is not an issue and shave quality is very good.</li>
            <li>The idea of using an electric shaver is very appealing  -</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li>The battery life is great (way better than my Remington).</li>
            <li>It shaves great, cleaning is a snap seeing how it is waterproof, all you have to do is pop the top off and rinse it under the faucet.</li>
            <li>Probably but I am very satisfied for the moment.  </li>
            <li>in all I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this product in the weeks since I bought it</li>
            <li>Great service and will save your favorite shaver or any appliance that uses rechargable batteries.</li>
            <li>Cleans real easy.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did, because this razor is great.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this model.</li>
            <li>&quot; you&#x27;ll be very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Great shave, not too noisy, great battery life and one of the best designs I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I love Panasonic!    </li>
            <li>But the first shave was so close it impressed me to the fullest.</li>
            <li>love it! .</li>
            <li>You can be sure it won&#x27;t be a Panasonic!</li>
            <li>This shaver seems to be well constructed and has great features like wet/dry use and easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, easy to use, and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Let me be honest, the Norelco Cool Skin works great and gets a good head/face shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>This was a great razor for $40.00.  Close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Smooth cut, great power and durable.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic Razor is AS GOOD or even better than the Braun.  </li>
            <li>I focused on the brands I trusted most to still deliver good engineering, metal foils and electronics regardless where they were made</li>
            <li>Best shave, close and fast  </li>
            <li>nice  - ease of cleaning  - smoothness of cut *</li>
            <li>It is a nice upgrade from the Braun I had.  </li>
            <li>Well, this electric got it nice and close, seems even below skin level.</li>
            <li>It trims sideburns and my neck nicely.  </li>
            <li>I am the kind of guy that gets a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon.</li>
            <li>Was used to a braun shaver but this item is really nice..</li>
            <li>I bought a really nice Panasonic \\&quot;Smooth Operator\\&quot; razor years ago, and it&#x27;s been GREAT.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Pros of the Pro-Curve: pivoting head, better shave than blades, ability to shave in the shower, good price.</li>
            <li>Then my Panasonic arrived and I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the look of the razor and was not expecting much.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve liked them all.  </li>
            <li>I looked up online reviews and liked what I saw about this razor.  </li>
            <li>It is great to just leave it running and stick in the shower spray for clean up.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Panasonic may sell very good shavers, but they&#x27;re probably in the higher price range.  </li>
            <li>at this time, I am not worried about it, I am very satisfied with this Panasonic, and don&#x27;t think it can get any better.</li>
            <li>Unit arrived quickly (one day) from Amazon and works great.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very easy to handle.    </li>
            <li>oh, and the price is just right!!!</li>
            <li>For the cost and free shipping, this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>I love the shaver, it gives me a nice close shave and the fact</li>
            <li>This is far and away the best electric shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I can say this Panasonic is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This is the best one so far.  </li>
            <li>Helpful hints: use a liquid pre-shave (the gooey kind works better than lectric-shave) or shave in the shower   and use shower gel instead of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Many features like a locking/unlocking head are nice to have.  </li>
            <li>This great product is a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>The shaver is light with a good ergonomic handle.  </li>
            <li>But after three or four shaves I notice the hairs it invariably misses are still growing wildly (mostly on my neck) and look to be seeking an ingrown kind of experience.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best thing I did was find a source that repairs or rebuilds or was able to get parts for my old Panasonic ES7003.</li>
            <li>This razor cuts better each time you use it and cleans very easily.</li>
            <li>So while I thought this would save me time, it actually takes me more time to shave than with my Mach3 and some nice shaving cream like Trumper&#x27;s Limes (great stuff!)</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a pretty great electric razor.  </li>
            <li>No adjustment time needed for me, the first time I used it I got a great shave with no discomfort all all.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad shaver, fits the hand well, but does not shave as close as the Braun 360 razor I have, but a good razor.  </li>
            <li>I like to keep my head shaved very close and keep it clean looking, the Panasonic is the best for this.</li>
            <li>Just works fine!</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to use, and my skin is in better shape after shaving than when I use a manual blade.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light to handle, and the pivoting head truly does conform to your face/neck line thus allowing for a more efficient shave.</li>
            <li>Gives a very good &#x27;wet&#x27; shave--nearly as good as a blade.    </li>
            <li>Charger:  Its HUGE!  </li>
            <li>However; I am more than satisfied with the Panasonic and have been using for one month.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using rotary style electric razors for more than 15 years.</li>
            <li>it is perfect and simple.</li>
            <li>It also helps to pull the scalp against the grain in order to stand up the stubble better and let the razor get a better bite.</li>
            <li>I dont think you can beat a Gillette Mach 3 or better razor anyway</li>
            <li>It helps as people said to dedicate a a minute or more to running the shaver over the skin in different directions and pulling the looser neck skin a bit to engage the blades but the shave quality and speed are excellent.</li>
            <li>Claiming 50% more surface area than before with three rings on each head.     </li>
            <li>I went for the top (well almost, mine didn&#x27;t have the cleaning station).</li>
            <li>and it vibrated more in my hand.    </li>
            <li>This foil shaver works okay in the shower</li>
            <li>lasted 4 months, fell apart, pinched a lot, not close any more.</li>
            <li>Does a better job than the braun, but not the miracle shaver I hoped for.     </li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will produce even better results as my skin and beard</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about time I introduce him to the Panasonic.  :-)</li>
            <li>when it cute* - see below    </li>
            <li>for the money, the $[...] norelco was a better razor.</li>
            <li>Plus there is the environmental aspects of not throwing blades away that make the electric more appealing..     </li>
            <li>It gives a nice close shave and is fairly comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It sure is a lot more convenient, and cheaper, than blades and shaving cream, over time.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Planned yes for sure no longer returnable.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that this razor is not all that it seems to be and many reviewers are trying to make it seem like it is \\&quot;the ultimate\\&quot; razor which it is not.</li>
            <li>I looked at many options and read many reviews before deciding to buy the Panasonic ES8043.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>This razor shaves as close as my ES726 but is even more comfortable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;First of all, I love being able to lather up and shave.</li>
            <li>After a year or so, it got louder and didn&#x27;t like being woke up in the mornings. :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sideburn trimmer is OK.</li>
            <li>I like the Braun trimmers much better.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d gladly tell everyone about this shaver.    </li>
            <li>This one seems to take longer and more passes to get all the stubble.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a blade fan, but have even tried the Gilette fusion and I am quicker but more bleeding with this.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Use and maintenance make it a worthwhile addition to my morning routine.</li>
            <li>I can get more than 10 shaves out of the battery</li>
            <li>Just simply the best.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging stand and therefore doesn&#x27;t have a safe way to \\&quot;store\\&quot;</li>
            <li>If I wait longer than that, it doesn&#x27;t cut well and requires many passes to cut the hair.    </li>
            <li>razor is much better than most others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased</li>
            <li>I used a Norelco rotary for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Since it is a wet-dry razor, you won&#x27;t be able to shave with the power cord plugged in -- lest some yahoo attempts a corded shave while sitting in the tub.    </li>
            <li>This is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>I thought the pivoting head was more of a gimmick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very much impressed with Amazon&#x27;s return policy and just ordered this 2nd one from them.</li>
            <li>This is my 5th electric shaver, and definitely the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I also found that it gets better has your face adapts and gets used to it.</li>
            <li>Overall... excellent product.</li>
            <li>Could there be a better shaver out there, maybe</li>
            <li>It shaves OK</li>
            <li>After using this for 2-3 weeks, I don&#x27;t dread shaving any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Panasonic Wet/Dry owner for many years and love the ability to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is a breeze, and being able to use it in the shower is something some people may like (I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, probably won&#x27;t since I don&#x27;t have a mirror in there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used another wet/dry Panasonic before that although I don&#x27;t have it any more to give it&#x27;s model number.</li>
            <li>it is more than I dreamed.</li>
            <li>And they didn&#x27;t work any better.  </li>
            <li>The pop up is better for side burns though.</li>
            <li>I have used Panasonic wet/dry shavers in the shower for years now, and have always been pleased.</li>
            <li>If you want to start using an electric in the shower, get one of these models, you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>After years of shaving with a blade, I decided about six months ago to switch to an electric, because I thought it would be better for my eczema-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even think about a rotary, I&#x27;m 100% sure you&#x27;ll love the linear.  </li>
            <li>Get a wet/dry - - these are great for the shower which gets the shave very close to a blade when used in with soap &amp; water.</li>
            <li>I have used Remington and Norelco before and have not been satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>Heavier beards might require a bit more time, but I have not found this to be significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought by spending more money I would get a better shaver.  </li>
            <li>This one works much better.</li>
            <li>so it may work better that way</li>
            <li>Depending on where it is stored, it&#x27;s more susceptible to damage.</li>
            <li>I have nicked myself once or twice but not severely, and it&#x27;s more of a fluke.</li>
            <li>This razor shaves better than any razor I have ever owned</li>
            <li>I have been using them for 15 years and can not find anything better...</li>
            <li>I found the Panasonics to be the most durable, while still providing a close shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with purchase.  </li>
            <li>, it works well too, but you have to do more pass-bys in order to get stragglers.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Sure, I probably should replace them here some time soon.</li>
            <li>Because(phillips norelco makes to many models, and the models I have tried have week motors, maybe the exception is the $100 to $200 ones.  </li>
            <li>So this panasonic buzzy razor works ok.</li>
            <li>It takes 5 minutes at most to shave my head in the shower with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>But the Panasonic is better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the closeness of the razor.</li>
            <li>Also recommended is baby oil or \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; shaving oil for better performance.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews here, and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The form factor is much more ergonomic than my Braun.  </li>
            <li>I did not think that I would ever be able to say that about a electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Many people warned me against electrics</li>
            <li>I thought it would be great using it in the shower to really get a close shave....</li>
            <li>I have owned many Panasonic wet/dry razors through the years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many and now regret it.</li>
            <li>Each one got better, except for this purchase.</li>
            <li>I use it with shaving cream most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Many years of use and it still works like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>We are definetly in love with this one, (and i think his skin apreciates it too).</li>
            <li>but I find I get a better shave elsewhere</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m never going to lather up before hand because that&#x27;s specifically what I&#x27;m trying to avoid, more as a time saver than anything else.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for about a decade now and this is the best one i&#x27;ve had so far... very smooth, very comfortable to hold, quiet (compared with others i&#x27;ve had), great battery life.</li>
            <li>It does sound like a bumblebee, but since it cuts so nice, that part is easy to forget.    </li>
            <li>Very clean shave.     </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cleaning up pretty good like that.</li>
            <li>But the best results for me have been to use it dry.</li>
            <li>It cleans up easy by just popping off the foil head and running the blades under the tap, or you can do a more thorough job with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still as strong today as it was when I purchased it more than four years ago.</li>
            <li>I have not gotten to that point yet, but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash.</li>
            <li>This is honestly the first time I&#x27;ve been so impressed with a product that I came back to write a review.  </li>
            <li>Battery lasts about a week before recharge needed so far (6-10 minutes)  Ability to clean with hand soup and running water is very nice and cost effective.  </li>
            <li>you prefer not to purchase the bulky cleaning station (from the ES8077S model), the manual suggests an alternative method to clean -- using liquid soap and water; this would be convenient when on the road! &lt;</li>
            <li>Being able to clean it with liquid soap and water makes this a better and cheaper choice than the cleaning stand models which require detergent packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; however it&#x27;s close enough, very good</li>
            <li>That makes my neck much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>in all though, I think Panasonic gives a closer, more comfortable shave than the Braun.</li>
            <li>This razor will leave most of your skin just as smooth as a blade.    </li>
            <li>but it makes shaving easier, more comfortable, and produces a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>It is the closest, fastest, and most comfortable shaver I have used.  </li>
            <li>Razor works great so far.  </li>
            <li>When I bought my second about 2 years ago, I also bought the latest greatest rotary and did a side-by-side comparison because the rotary advertisments are so compelling.    </li>
            <li>For example, the 8077, in addition to the cleaning station, has a more detailed battery-charge readout.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, you can NOT use the shaver while it is being charged.  </li>
            <li>That has completely gone away and now my face feels great after shaving.  </li>
            <li>This one delivers a closer, more comfortable shave, and the charge lasts a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>*(&amp; that is smooth, like perfect, blade-eque smooth, except one tiny ridge along the jaw bone</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t need it as it said the charge was good.</li>
            <li>The cleaning process is very easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Dry shaving was almost just as good with performance still superior to Norelco.    </li>
            <li>My fiancé has found a new love for touching my face, and I seem to be getting more kisses too!</li>
            <li>other than those complaints, this baby is great!!!!</li>
            <li>Overall a good razor!</li>
            <li>The Panasonic seems much more straightforward: There are blades, they move, they cut your beard.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you can clean it by just popping off the top and holding it under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>Still this was the easy task...</li>
            <li>The easy winner: Panny    Done.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily.  </li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li>It cleans easily and the batteries are long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>Cleans easily with water.</li>
            <li>A bit more involved to get really clean</li>
            <li>Easy to use, shaves close, and has a lot of extras that are not found on lady&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li>But that was easily mastered, and I&#x27;ve had no problems since then.  </li>
            <li>to make sure it gets clean.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy though.  </li>
            <li>It recharges fast, feels light and good grip.  </li>
            <li>Plus, cleaning it with liquid soap is easier and more efficient than trying to brush the heads clean.</li>
            <li>I found that Panasonic easily outclasses Bruan, Remington and Norelco.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- can easily be cleaned with water&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy handling, Charge lasts almost forever,VERY close shave.</li>
            <li>This is an easy review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed a technique of working out from the top of my head, where I&#x27;m already bald for good, in circular motions and doing those circles in both directions to work against the grain whichever way it goes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and at a good price.</li>
            <li>This razor cuts very cleanly and rarely requires more than two passes over one area.  </li>
            <li>Hmm still it cut pretty darn nice.</li>
            <li>Top rated makes you feel cool  </li>
            <li>, I prefer the soap myself, a cool, refreshing blend of citrus and Vit E cream designed to combat pimples, tooth decay and plugged pores.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that I can honestly say shaves as close as a Razor can shave.</li>
            <li>So far this razor has been successful in resolving all my shaving needs.</li>
            <li>This model is the first I have used with the movable head, and it it a nice addition to help prevent accidental razor burn.  </li>
            <li>, I prefer the soap myself, a cool, refreshing blend of citrus and Vit E cream designed to combat pimples, tooth decay and plugged pores.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>in all, I would recommend this shaver for anyone looking for a good, clean, fast shave day after day (which I guess is everyone).</li>
            <li>Hands down best electric on the market.  </li>
            <li>I use the shaver dry with pre-shave most of the time, but it&#x27;s especially effective after a shower or hot face wash.      </li>
            <li>but this new Panasonic is superior.  </li>
            <li>After shaving with a blade for about two weeks, I was delighted to get my new shaver.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic Vortex is relatively light, and easy to hold/grip.</li>
            <li>The shaver works fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, compact, and easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li>but it just takes many more passes to get what the older ones were able to shave off.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but is not as convenient.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it pays for itself in less then a year.  </li>
            <li>The shave is fine if you use a pre-conditioner.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>With this 8043 model the trimmer works fine for sideburns, but you can&#x27;t use it on the rest of your face or neck.    </li>
            <li>have a light to medium growth of hair on my face and am able to get a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>quick call to Amazon and the $10.00 was refunded with no questions!</li>
            <li>Quickly, I knew this Panasonic is a better all around razor and shaves closer than the Norelco.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of picking up longer curly whiskers and gives a close enough shave for me with great comfort shaving through fresh soap and water.</li>
            <li>Very good from the first shave, a bit better than my old Braun but much cheaper and better battery.</li>
            <li>And really, even if I do a very good job and the result is very smooth, within 5-6 hours, the hair is growing back and noticeable to the touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always owned Brauns, but I wanted a good new shaver that I could quickly and easily use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The charger is HUGE</li>
            <li>and I like that - a comfortable shave and easy to clean the razor.</li>
            <li>So, rest assured, the Amazon reviews here are quite accurate.  </li>
            <li>The wet/dry functionality of this device makes it extremely easy to keep clean.    </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why consumer reports did not rank this as a must have item.</li>
            <li>+Light  +Li-ion battery  </li>
            <li>Great sideburn trimmer, now a solid flip up design    </li>
            <li>I also appreciate how easy it is to clean - just a rinse, or a bit of soap and a rinse - and done.</li>
            <li>Overall great choice.</li>
            <li>: The head of the shaver adjusts smoothly to the contours of my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Came with a cheap travel bag.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li>thinking that people would think I work for Panasonic, ranting about such a great product, but to tell the truth, they could hire me today</li>
            <li>It is easy as all get out to clean.</li>
            <li>(I have a light beard.)</li>
            <li>Cons:  1)  Feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>These W&amp;D razors are worth the money and the convenience of being able to shave in the shower compared to the blades that now cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>easy clean up.  </li>
            <li>bought this one and it turned out to be a light weight cheapo plastic razor.</li>
            <li>This thing is cheap.</li>
            <li>2 minutes gets me smooth, without a hint of razor burn.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with the Pro-Curve because of the pivoting head and have experienced the same quality of shaves.</li>
            <li>It did such a great job I bought my Dad one.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Genuinely as close as a blade&lt;</li>
            <li>Oh and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds a charge forever.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a cheap 3 head shaver with this one.</li>
            <li>I thought i could shave at the speed of light :|</li>
            <li>Easy to clean out.  </li>
            <li>It is light and durable.</li>
            <li>It was comfortable from Day</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those are the issues that are important to me in an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I have bone-dry skin and develop a light peach-fuzz beard in 3 to 4 days.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic gives me a smoothly shaved surface over my cheeks, jawbone and neck.  </li>
            <li>but, I genuinely like the shave.</li>
            <li>I will repeat, razor close, completely smooth.     </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>I am too cheap to buy some to try.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was free and prompt.  </li>
            <li>, it gets the hair realy close to the skin, and it&#x27;s realy easy to clean.</li>
            <li>HAVE TO USE A SLOWER SHAVER LIKE A CHEAP REMINGTON.  </li>
            <li>With the Vortex, I was able to shave cleanly in one quick pass.</li>
            <li>This is awesome, my husband has not sensitive skin, but extremely sensitive, and this is the first shaver that he&#x27;s been able to use without any kind of irritation on his face</li>
            <li>Not too worried, more power right?</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, if you are one of the many emerging head shavers, I would suggest this one.  </li>
            <li>I loved the dual-head 8066, and it stayed sharp and effective for five years on my medium beard.  </li>
            <li>But also it feels very powerful.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been irritated after shaving, which is very nice - no red bumps, no friction burns.  </li>
            <li>During the first 2 weeks I had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old Gillette, but today officially I was able to through my Gillette away for good.</li>
            <li>Pretty much it was all good.</li>
            <li>Basically, the shave was almost perfect the first time I used this thing when shaving wet with cream.</li>
            <li>Keeping it wet and lathered makes the shave more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The razor itself is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t do it without some significant cooperation from the operator.</li>
            <li>(pretty sure)  +Quietest  </li>
            <li>I have a heavier beard than most, and I&#x27;d say this shaver comes pretty close to a blades performance.</li>
            <li>Even the hair trimmer works well and is easily accessible.    </li>
            <li>The reviews were somewhat more positive, the shaver was somewhat higher in the popularity ratings, and the shaver design was distinctly more stylish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can run it through the water to clean</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any soap to clean the blades</li>
            <li>so rinse clean</li>
            <li>There are cheaper models in Panasonic&#x27;s lineup, but they lack the 13,000 RPM motor, which is key to the excellent performance this unit offers.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Turbo clean mode.</li>
            <li>It takes 2 seconds to clean this shaver with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Its pretty cool shaving with an electric and being able to use shaving get.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had zero issues with clean up.  </li>
            <li>and it gets clean.  </li>
            <li>Also, the blades on the 8066 came off easily to clean, (and store under the pyramid).  </li>
            <li>Takes 1 - 2 swipes over an area of my face to get it clean.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had a quieter sound to it, but he is done so quickly I can bear with it.</li>
            <li>Dry shave - great on face.    </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a slip of paper Panasonic puts in on how to clean the razor using hand soap and running water.  </li>
            <li>Not having a charging stand is a plus because the razor stays cleaner and no stand to clean.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a breeze to clean.  </li>
            <li>Very close, very smooth.  </li>
            <li>This new one is not as good as my old one but better than the alternative brands like Braun and Norelco.</li>
            <li>(so special stand)  </li>
            <li>It has a special 17000rpm cleaning mode (\\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; - what doesn&#x27;t use that moniker these days?)</li>
            <li>:  Right out of the box, I used my shaver for about a month before charging!</li>
            <li>but so far the main shaving head does sucha great job on my neck</li>
            <li>It is also superior to the older Panasonic ES8092 which was much heavier with shorter battery life.  </li>
            <li>Very fast, extremely easy to clean, just some liquid soap</li>
            <li>The wet shave is great</li>
            <li>the wet shaves are great.  </li>
            <li>It gives a quick fairly clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Arc IV which I would love to try and see how much improvement Panasonic has made in the two generations of shavers they have released since I purchased this unit.    </li>
            <li>good quality overall    </li>
            <li>This Panasonic received good ratings and was priced relatively low (compared to Braun for instance).  </li>
            <li>--TRUE</li>
            <li>Overall, a good value for the money, and performs as well as the 300 dollar Braun (which I had).</li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic Linear shaver for several years with good results.</li>
            <li>Actually, just about all good electric razors are hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say that it is a good purchase if you aren&#x27;t looking to spend a ton of money on a fancier one.</li>
            <li>Overall, I feel it&#x27;s a good razor for the price.</li>
            <li>However, I cannot say enough good things about this Panasonic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver will only give you a good shave if you spend a lot of time going over problem areas (neck and chin for me).  </li>
            <li>If you need a quick and clean shave, you will not get one with this razor.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t emphasis enough how good this razor has been.</li>
            <li>I began using the Norelco 7735X Cool Skin, electric razor.</li>
            <li>After buying cheap junk, it is definitely worth the money paid.</li>
            <li>but this is an overall superior razor</li>
            <li>Before I purchased this style of shaver, my cabinets were full of electric shaver rejects.  </li>
            <li>Kind of surprising for how small it is.</li>
            <li>If my face actually adapts, I can only imagine performance being better, even though it&#x27;s already good as it is!    </li>
            <li>I worry about buying a new razor because the reviews don&#x27;t sound as good on the new ones.</li>
            <li>Well a little while ago I began searching for an electric razor to shave my head, it had to be fairly inexpensive and able to shave razor close.</li>
            <li>The razor holds a charge for weeks, which is good because you get to keep the charging cable (which is clunky and heavy) stored away most of the time.</li>
            <li>razor has no issues with being drenched and it charges up quick and holds the charge for 5-6 (head)shaves.</li>
            <li>Quickly shaved one side of my face.</li>
            <li>With that said, this is a good solid shaver at an affordable price and it&#x27;s definitely worth looking at.</li>
            <li>(TM) Panasonic Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver is a cordless razor designed for men with medium to light weight baldness on top of their head.</li>
            <li>Super Shaver.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a lithium battery which gives it more power and more time between charges, probably the only shaver under $125 to come with this battery.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver to replace an older Panasonic (Model ES7018) that had served me well for many years.  </li>
            <li>This is only the second electric razor I have owned, so maybe it&#x27;s not saying a lot to claim it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews of many different razors I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li>Fast, light, comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>I had an ES4026 prior to this unit and it worked ok, but I like the ES8043 much better.  </li>
            <li>(TM) Panasonic Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver is a cordless razor designed for men with medium to light weight baldness on top of their head.</li>
            <li>a bit more high pitched</li>
            <li>Been using it for the past 3 weeks and seems like a very good razor.  </li>
            <li>This is an older model 8043 avoid it like the plague!!!</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd Panasonic linear shaver I have owned and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have owned 2 other Panasonic shavers before this one, and this is by far the best bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li>, it can be charged any time you want, and it lasts a good long time and does not lose shaving speed until the battery is fully depleted.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a good long time.  </li>
            <li>I also love the fact that I can clean the shaver using any soft soap and water instead of having to buy \\&quot;special\\&quot; cleansers for an automatic gizmo than is a countertop space hog.    </li>
            <li>Overall a great product that I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this product and and even after 2 years the blades are still sharp and the battery is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my new Panasonic shaver for a month now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used Panasonic and this new design is even better.  </li>
            <li>and I found that for just $15 more I could get this model brand new from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It arived in less time than given and was in great shape.</li>
            <li>Actually, its good because its about the exact width of my sideburns,</li>
            <li>It was good (dry shaver)</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for around 7-10 days worth of shaves and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>The battery life is fantastic -- on a full charge on Sunday, I can use it for a whole week without any perceptible loss of power.  </li>
            <li>Shaving dry is good ...</li>
            <li>Turbo Cleaning Mode (available on our Pivot Action Shavers) is used for quick and easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used razors most of my 60years, except when I was too young, and this shaver does the job a lot closer and faster and without the cuts!  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend dropping the dough to buy this premium jap-built peice of shaving artillery!!!  </li>
            <li>Although Panasonic insists that it may take a month to adapt to it, I feel like I&#x27;ve already gotten used to it; I think it&#x27;s because after suffering from the Norelco all this time, the Panasonic is a revelation in comparison, even on the first try!  </li>
            <li>And their return policy is within the first 30 days!  </li>
            <li>Several of the design features are very nice - very quiet, light, ergo friendly.  </li>
            <li>The razor is comfortable in my rather large hand.  </li>
            <li>I have to cover some spots 2 or 3 times to get a clean shave, but I consider that normal for an electric and the end result is comfortable and</li>
            <li>The charge lasts a good amount of time with a little light indicating when it needs recharging.</li>
            <li>Braun might work just as well as this shaver, but I have always liked Panasonic a little better.</li>
            <li>It provided a very close and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to apply cream or soup; it shaves gently and smoothly without pulling hair.</li>
            <li>Of course the real issue is the resultant tribute to a supremely close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and so far I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>nice short hair, lets bring out the Braun again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Worth it.\\</li>
            <li>Granted you&#x27;re not supposed to drive and shave, but the old razor didn&#x27;t need to be paid attention to to get all the spots, this one requires more attention than I have in the morning</li>
            <li>With the old school way of shaving, I am one to shave in the shower as I find I get a better shave.</li>
            <li>but I did not find it useful.     </li>
            <li>So I figured it was worth a try since after about 6 months</li>
            <li>This shaver is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>But using it was a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>Self-cleaning under running water (with hand soap) appears to be simple and effective.    </li>
            <li>I keep looking for some flaw in the design or function of this shaver, but I honestly can&#x27;t find any, except perhaps that my local stores don&#x27;t stock replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>I can get a very close shave, so close my beard isn&#x27;t rough, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite razor by far.</li>
            <li>For the price this ES8043SC model is well worth it.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t work worth a flip.    </li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the genuine Panasonic replacement blades looked exactly like the \\&quot;screen\\&quot; blade design of the first aftermarket pair.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was always pleased with the old one, but hoping it wasn&#x27;t just a fluke...</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.    </li>
            <li>I rarely use the turbo power mode.</li>
            <li>I have a Braun too that I use for sensitive areas (neck)etc and love it also.</li>
            <li>Wet shave - good on face.    </li>
            <li>As many of you do, I love to scour reviews carefully before making a selection on anything (which is why we use Amazon).  </li>
            <li>i need to charge it more frequently.</li>
            <li>This razor is an exceptionally good razor when used wet with shaving cream or soap.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny though.</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer works fine, but I do miss the one in my older model.    </li>
            <li>if the replacement parts are a litlle more than other brands, I will gladly pay it.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said elsewhere, the type of electric shaver -- rotary or foil -- that works best for you will totally depend on your skin type and your beard.</li>
            <li>it does require multiple passes to get a clean shave, but it does a better job than rotaries I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I would right now say that it rivals the Mach 3 but not quite as close in those areas.</li>
            <li>Right after I shaved it looked like I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow already.</li>
            <li>right after, I notice no change.  </li>
            <li>Man were they right.  </li>
            <li>think I made the right decision.</li>
            <li>The chin, neck, and right below your ears will take a beating.  </li>
            <li>first of all it didn&#x27;t fit in my hand very well.</li>
            <li>It pretty much is as smooth as when I use a real razor.    </li>
            <li>Using this razor was like coming home; it gives me a close, clean, fast shave (with the assistance of shaving oil)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get a decent shave from this shaver, even though I have a light beard.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver, and the first couple of times I used it its been pretty good...definitely not as close as a regular razr but for an electric one it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>Very easily it gets red bumps and irritated skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like mowing a lawn; if you keep it trimmed it is very easy to cut it the next time.</li>
            <li>the motor sound takes some getting used to, as it is a high pitched whine.</li>
            <li>, the motor&#x27;s sound makes a high whining noise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting better results in less time and with more convenience than I got with blades.</li>
            <li>These shavers provide an excellent shave either wet (with gel shaving cream) or dry.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, but after testing it for almost a month I decided to return it for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>first night I used it, I had not shaved the day before (a rare occasion).</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and fast shave due to not having to go over areas more than once or twice.</li>
            <li>Small price to pay for a great shave.</li>
            <li>It also has a very flexible head with comfortable spring action to reach under the chin and jawline areas for a completely smooth shave.</li>
            <li>My Norelco came with a nice leather bag and had a tight fit around my razor.  </li>
            <li>It works fine except for being very loud.  </li>
            <li>Cuts clean and comfortable, but can leave stubble if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>+Best on slightly longer hairs that are laying flat    Con:  </li>
            <li>It is important to alow your skin to get used to your new razor (about 2 weeks).    </li>
            <li>My husband loves the swift, smooth, close, once-over shave he gets with  his new Panasonic ES8043SC shaver.  </li>
            <li>Being two years old the battery is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Panasonic makes a great electric shaver, this is the second one for me in the last sixteen years.</li>
            <li>but I can easily overlook that for the performance and convenience Panasonic offers in this product.</li>
            <li>It either chews it up like cheap hamburger (back of the neck), or can&#x27;t give a smooth shave (under the chin).  </li>
            <li>The shaver was made with excellent quality - no cheap parts, has a very solid feel.  </li>
            <li>I gave this razor 3 stars because it does cut, but not as easy and gentle as older Panny models.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and the lady friend likes the extra counter space.</li>
            <li>I use wet shaving and find I can get a good close shave much faster than before.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I love this powerful yet quiet shaver.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is so much smoother and quieter and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean -- just open it up and run some water over it, no brushes or fancy docking stations required.  </li>
            <li>He had always used an old fashioned razor and found the shaver easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Just a reminder that if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.</li>
            <li>Not as close as manual razor but considering how fast and smooth the whole procedure is I am pleased overall.    </li>
            <li>Still very much acceptable.</li>
            <li>This unit isn&#x27;t difficult to use, one can recharge it quite conveniently near the sink top, comes in its own handy \\&quot;egg top\\&quot; (TM) case.</li>
            <li>This unit isn&#x27;t difficult to use, one can recharge it quite conveniently near the sink top, comes in its own handy &amp;#34;egg top&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>(Anyone remember the full size trimmers on the older models with Linear motors?</li>
            <li>This model, the ES8043, gives the same great, quick, close shave as my other Panasonics.  </li>
            <li>But the new model does look very cool and &#x60;high tech&#x27;.     </li>
            <li>By contrast, before this I owned probably a half-dozen Brauns over the years and never had one able to last longer than about 2 years before the motor would quit or the battery would die or something of that nature.</li>
            <li>I have been using an electric razor for many years and have had just about every brand including some lesser know brands like Sunbeam.  </li>
            <li>After about 15 minutes, the job is pretty well done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of curious about how a rotary would perform because I ended up doing a rotary thing with mine manually.</li>
            <li>First off...</li>
            <li>Better take one last look....</li>
            <li>Panasonic first.</li>
            <li>maybe with enough time training your skin it would be better?</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to get under my jaw and around my adams apple without a lot of contortion and extra time.</li>
            <li>The last electric razor I had was a top of the line</li>
            <li>Overall, I have been quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The one downside that I can think of is that this shaver is pretty noisy.</li>
            <li>I replaced the first one once the battery eventually died.</li>
            <li>First thing I did when I received this unit</li>
            <li>After my shave, my skin got a bit irritated at first use.  </li>
            <li>This one feels very solid in the hand and the motor is powerful enough to give a good shave.    </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t abandon it, but I will buy the top of the line Norelco again next time.</li>
            <li>my 4 day growth is pretty substantial.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely satisfied, and not looking to go back to blades.</li>
            <li>I have owned many different razors in my time.  </li>
            <li>First, if this is your first electric, realize that your face is gonna be tender for a while as your not used to it.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me say that this thing shaves closer than the Mach 3 in some areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to a Norelco triple rotary shaver, which performs better.  </li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have defected in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I began, under the side burn, I felt absolutely no hair pull of any kind.</li>
            <li>This was my first wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>My first electric shaver was a Panasonic (that was over 15 years ago).  </li>
            <li>It then entered turbo cleaning mode, shut off and repeated this cycle until the battery was drained many hours later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also still on my first charge.  </li>
            <li>My latest one finally gave up so I decided to try this Panasonic for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They give a close shave without a burn, the blades last a long time and the floating head is great.</li>
            <li>But actually I like the Panasonics and have a ES8807 which I love.</li>
            <li>This was my first try at the linear razor from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>No expensive refills to hassle over.</li>
            <li>and they assure you will love the Panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut.</li>
            <li>Cuts about 99% of my face and 95% of my neck on the first pass.</li>
            <li>For many years now I have been using a relatively simple Panasonic ES7016 wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li>First, some background...</li>
            <li>The movable nature of the top third of the shaver doesn&#x27;t do anything for me, and I keep it locked.  </li>
            <li>I also have to make more passes over the same place to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li>They shave better and last longer.</li>
            <li>This is the second Panasonic cordless wet-dry shaver I&#x27;ve owned - the 1st one lasted 10 years - this one is even better than my 1st one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this razor about 2 months now, so my face is pretty well adjusted to the switch from a blade shave (Gillette Fusion).  </li>
            <li>I decided not to get anything with a charging stand or a self-cleaning system, since these appeared to be something of a nuisance, cost more, and did not add to the overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lack of an LCD screen showing remaining charge is pretty irrelevant--I might as well ask for one showing weather reports.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Now turn the power on again under the running water once more for another ten seconds</li>
            <li>Which is why I purchased it in the first place.</li>
            <li>For the first 3 weeks use in the shower with lather or sink.</li>
            <li>This is important to me as I have sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>It holds a charge today as well as it did when I first bought it (about three-four weeks).</li>
            <li>I actually think the Panasonic shaves my head better than my face.</li>
            <li>Actually, the Norelco contours your head better than the Panasonic, but the Panasonic shaves quicker and a closer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only the first day, but I&#x27;m confident I won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li>That trimmer felt flimsy the first day I used it, and I knew that would be the first part to go.</li>
            <li>Funny, they say, \\&quot;give it a 30 day tryout so your face can get used to it.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I have not been happy with electric shavers in the past but sometimes want something that will give a fast shave&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This Panasonic does a good job shaving, but the trimmer is only good for sideburns, it does a poor job timming mustaches.  </li>
            <li>It takes much longer to get a good shave with it if you have substantial growth to mow down.    </li>
            <li>I have only used the dry function for shaving, and it provides a great shave.</li>
            <li>I always cut my neck when I shave with blades -- and I do mean always, even using the superior Mach 3 -- and the Norelco gives me a pretty good razor burn on my neck unless I&#x27;m very careful.  </li>
            <li>but once my skin adjusted I was fine and am able to shave with it everyday....</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s product line can be broken down into three categories based on battery type -- NiCad, NiMH, and Lithium Ion with Lithium Ion being the latest and best.  </li>
            <li>-a bit more irritation (more passes)  -Hard to cut along a line (beard shaping)  -iffy sideburn trimmer (fell all the time)    </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m yet to try it wet), it still feels like shaving with a regular blade and cream(and of course without the blood-loss and irritation lol).      </li>
            <li>Gave this promising well reviewed shaver a good try (about 3 months), but it&#x27;s inability to provide a close shave, particularly in the chin and neck areas, combined with receiving frequent bleeding cuts, made me toss it into the drawer for no further use.  </li>
            <li>The wet/dry feature also allows the people to throughly clean out  the razor with soap, water and the natural rotation of the blades.    </li>
            <li>Its very fast and shaves very close</li>
            <li>I bought this one based on the positive reviews it received.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews on this shaver, I believed the consensus that you don&#x27;t need to purchase the costlier Panasonic models.</li>
            <li>I also found that once my skin adjusted, my shaving goes much quicker than it first took...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll flip up the straight blade piece and get pretty close with that.  </li>
            <li>All of them were okay, but they always took so long</li>
            <li>There is hope yet for our survival as I base my conclusion solely on the benefits of being able to finally enjoy without hassel or fear \\&quot;The Joy Of Shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This shaver is not only a great value, but it shaves extremely well for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The linear motor is far superior to other motors.  </li>
            <li>I told my wife I should give this shaver a fair chance and do my usual pre shave with my Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>The shaver is superior to any Braun shaver I have ever had in the past, and I had about 4 or 5 of those, but I would always spend a lot of money on the foils ($25-40 each).  </li>
            <li>Someone said that it was loud, and I don&#x27;t find that to be true.  </li>
            <li>The handling is very smooth and it seems to almost grip my face without a single nick.  </li>
            <li>It actually cuts better than the older models.  </li>
            <li>- Has a special high-speed mode to make cleaning blades easier  - sharp blades, strong motor,</li>
            <li>This razor does the first two significantly better than the Norelco (even when it was new) and the noise factor, while not nearly as quiet as the Norelco, is acceptable to me.  </li>
            <li>Also, the popup trimmer in the older model was much wider and more solid.</li>
            <li>and it seems to stand up to be cut better when dry.  </li>
            <li>For its good shave, low level of irritation, long battery life, and wet/dry flexibility, this razor gets 4.5* from me.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter, more delicate, and seems more &#x60;plasticy&#x27; when compared to my older model.  </li>
            <li>and it certainly prohibits multi tasking.</li>
            <li>It has a problem getting certain areas....</li>
            <li>I certainly would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I also owned a Norelco Smart Touch, but I have sent that to my son.</li>
            <li>, i would certainly buy another if i needed too.</li>
            <li>It does hold a charge for 2+ weeks, it does have a nice feel, and it doesn&#x27;t pull or yank hairs due to high speed.  </li>
            <li>I thought the Braun Advantage did a good job, but this does even better with a whole lot less mess and noise.  </li>
            <li>When your face is damp the shaver doesn&#x27;t glide across your face as easy and it is difficult to get a good shave, though I haven&#x27;t tried it yet fully lathered</li>
            <li>The cleaning/drying system is really cool looking and seems to work well, but, after the coolness wears off you&#x27;re left with a mediocre razor that makes straight edges feel like the greatest invention since television.  </li>
            <li>The hair was not only gone, but seemed to get grinded up into fine particles like dirt.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaver has performed just fine for me over the last 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Out of the box, my first impression was that the ES8043 was a lot cheaper built than my older Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes have to really work hard to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>It shaves clean and close in less time than any I&#x27;ve owned, and its shape and weight makes it comfortable to use.     </li>
            <li>In wet mode with shaving gel, it is almost a match for Gillette&#x27;s vibrating razors; there is somewhat more skin irritation in this mode, but it&#x27;s not to an unusual degree.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely amazed with how close this shaver gets.  </li>
            <li>My face feels as smooth as when using shaving cream and a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic wet/dry razor out shaves them all including the highly touted Braun!</li>
            <li>It makes for a very close non-abrasive shave.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as much work rinsing an electric shaver as a blade so to me</li>
            <li>+indicator for time to replace cutting block  +best pivoting head  </li>
            <li>+Much quieter than Braun  </li>
            <li>Who wants to pay $60 for 4 months use.</li>
            <li>Nothing can quite match a straight blade, but this is without a doubt</li>
            <li>Women, if you want a real shaver, stay away from those \\&quot;for women\\&quot; shavers that look like kid toys.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the way this razor treats my neck.</li>
            <li>This dealer was very promp in sendig this shaver.</li>
            <li>I think you can depend on them, Thanks</li>
            <li>I can get my head cue ball smooth without suffering the inevitable nicks and cuts of head shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li>This is the environmental stuff we really should be worried about.</li>
            <li>, it just doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>so I suspect that the product might work very well for others with straighter whiskers.</li>
            <li>Only con - cheap travel bag.</li>
            <li>This shaver shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>it works real well.</li>
            <li>It gives a much closer shave...</li>
            <li>My boyfriend said he really likes it because it shaves his face very well.  </li>
            <li>And as always Amazon provides fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t give anything close to a real razor shave, as Panasonic and some customers claim.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as close as a straight blade.</li>
            <li>- It really doesn&#x27;t deliver a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Do you ever make on of those online purchases that really exceed your expectations.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic is much lighter, cleans easier, and shaves much  closer.</li>
            <li>and it makes dealing with them much easier.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a real pain to bring it along.  </li>
            <li>you see, i am really, really hairy in the crotch area.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Having an electric razor that I can use in or out of the shower has been a real treat.</li>
            <li>It is a very close shave</li>
            <li>Plus, I am getting a very close shave.</li>
            <li>am convinced that Panasonic has really come close to a blade shave.  </li>
            <li>I shave with lather and it is very confortable.  </li>
            <li>It holds a battery charge much longer than you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li>It shaves really close.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, low noise,</li>
            <li>The only complaints I have are:  1) with the cheap travel bag, which does not hold the charger.</li>
            <li>two exchanges I decided to try the norelco 8140XL (speed XL)rotaries, and while they shaved really close, they tore up my neck.</li>
            <li>They shave MUCH faster than the Braun and Norelcos.</li>
            <li>It shaves incredibly fast anyway.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>I have an unusual shaving situation.</li>
            <li>and  didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li>I expected more from Panasonic but this shaver just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>For the money spent it does an ok job.  </li>
            <li>With the ES8043SC I can do the whole job with just the shaver.</li>
            <li>but, it hasn&#x27;t really been a problem.</li>
            <li>and it is much quieter.  </li>
            <li>By comparison, the Norelco will really chew up my neck if I want to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>and they said they would send me out a stand free of charge, however 3-4 weeks later</li>
            <li>Like others, I carefully went thru many reviews before choosing to buy this shaver from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>The shaver even has a light to show you when the batteries are going low.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended in all regards!  </li>
            <li>A real eye opener.  </li>
            <li>angle(30deg)which gives a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>My hair grows fast and I just shave my head in the shower every day.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I shave against the grain on my head to get a really close shave, and this baby of a shaver does get razor close.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>I am finding out that the hair on your head grows much faster than on your face.  </li>
            <li>the shaver works really well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this thing.  </li>
            <li>Stick with the straight razors.  </li>
            <li>Something else that I really like about this razor is the way you can lock the shave head in position or switch over to one that can give and pivot with the contours you are shaving.</li>
            <li>After much work with it this morning, I felt like I had a five o&#x27; clock shadow stepping out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always shaved AFTER showering when my beard is ready.  </li>
            <li>So, after much studying these types of forums I got me a Panasonic ES8043.</li>
            <li>I will wash it out on occasion and don&#x27;t use it in the shower very often, but man is this thing durable.</li>
            <li>Only oddity is the sound it makes when running,</li>
            <li>it cut better than my old braun, ther are some areas (especially on my neck)</li>
            <li>The 360 Complete had new Gillette tech, a really cool looking foil patter, and</li>
            <li>Since he refused to shave more than 2 or 3 times a week due to his sensitive skin, I thought maybe this would be worth a try.</li>
            <li>, I thought, not buying new blades from Panasonic in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I am new to head shaving, so it took me quite a while to get a satisfactory shave the first time.  </li>
            <li>but I had an OLD Panasonic model which was right in the ball park...</li>
            <li>It cleans easily, and has a surprisingly long charge.</li>
            <li>so I looked at other shavers at a reasonable price that received better reviews and this is the item I purchased.  </li>
            <li>Braun a big name in the foil shaver market and apparently the top rated by a certain consumer mag.</li>
            <li>agree with other reviewers that the speed and pivot head are advantages; the speed in particular makes for a very comfortable and fast shave.</li>
            <li>Clean up is a snap, soap and water; none of the soaking the heads in a special cleaner and spaying down the razor like Norelco made you do.</li>
            <li>c) if you look at the product photo, the blue areas on either side of the main handle are rubber, and it feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is now squeakly clean and ready for the next shave.</li>
            <li>Close shave (I&#x27;ve used other shavers this is better) but don&#x27;t tell&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally made the jump after almost seven years with the original Mach 3.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s better than the other&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this Panasonic Linear would be better than the other ones that I&#x27;ve used over the years.  </li>
            <li>I will continue buying the Panasonic over any Braun shaver, as it has been my personal experience the Panasonic is a better shaver and higher quality product for my daily shaving usage needs.</li>
            <li>There is no need for the added-expense cleaning kit, as it cleans itself with soap and water, unlike many other models.     </li>
            <li>The first one was a little better than the ES7016</li>
            <li>The original blades actually looked like blades.  </li>
            <li>many electric razors sold in the US are crippled of their multivoltage capability; counterpart models sold in other continents often do have multivoltage capability</li>
            <li>Occasionally, I find that the charge won&#x27;t last a full week, even with my fairly light beard.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the shave is fantastic -- especially if used with some pre-shave gel, it gives a very close, comfortable shave without leaving my skin dry or irritated.   </li>
            <li>Shaver noise was much quieter than my older model.</li>
            <li>I have to go over spots on my neck 4-5 times different ways to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>My beard is heavy and the results are nothing short of remarkable.</li>
            <li>The main advantage is that it provides a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>In addition the motor is sealed so you can take this in the shower (don&#x27;t tell your wife or you&#x27;ll never see it again) and can clean it with simple soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Ergonomics of the shaver are very well done, it is nice to hold, the cushion/pivoting of the shave head is neither too firm nor too soft, and overall, this is just a fantastic buy.  </li>
            <li>It is much sharper and a more modern design than previous models.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a wet shave and probably won&#x27;t, but the dry shave is really good for the price.  </li>
            <li>It cut fast, and closer than my previous Panny, much better than the Norelco.</li>
            <li>: It is fairly good shaver, that works quickly, wet or dry.    </li>
            <li>Pros  - Head flexes back and forth to makes shaver follow contour of your face  - Wet/dry operation makes it easy to clean and shave wet  </li>
            <li>I also liked the pop-up trimmer, not more cuts trying to shave my mustache.</li>
            <li>The replacement cutter and foil cost about 75% of the cost of a brand new shaver!  </li>
            <li>It is light, comfortable to use, and shaves closer than a blade in hard to get to places and almost as close elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>This razor when it was new was fast and did not require a touch up with a razor.</li>
            <li>This new shaver is much improved over the older one.  </li>
            <li>Overall, using this electric razor is far cheaper than Gillette models that rake in huge profit on their blades.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;- sturdy casing, easy to hold with wet hands</li>
            <li>Decent,</li>
            <li>I have now had this particular shaver over two years.</li>
            <li>One of the main features that won me over.</li>
            <li>I have tried most of the so called \\&quot;leading\\&quot; and I might add much more expensive razors with fancy submerged cleaning attachments.</li>
            <li>I first bought it, it was pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>so I will keep mine quick and simple.    </li>
            <li>I used an electric shaver several years back, it was one of the top of the line Norelco with the incorporated gel.</li>
            <li>Feels solid, not too loud (higher-pitched motor sound, not lawn-motory).</li>
            <li>Second speed, this thing vibrates rotates at an unreal speed, giving a quick shave.</li>
            <li>but it does a decent job for the price.     </li>
            <li>I had an older Panasonic linear shaver before, and it served me well for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>Above the chin was okay, but below the chin proved to be problematic as multiple passes would have to be done to clip the whiskers, causing visible skin irritation.    </li>
            <li>I have always used foil-type shavers and bought this Panasonic as an \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to my older Braun Syncro.  </li>
            <li>but it takes abt 20 minutes to get a decent shave, of course in shower.</li>
            <li>Battery seems to last longer between charges than indicated in the manual, but maybe that&#x27;s just because shaving is so quick.</li>
            <li>however it broke and this one had decent reviews</li>
            <li>Decent buzzing shaver.  </li>
            <li>Also, being able to rinse it with tap water is better than having to use expensive cleaning cartridges.  </li>
            <li>This one does a fairly decent job on the face, but once you go south of the mouth say your prayers.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s one of the main reason I buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li>- Cannot shave while charging(while conn.to elect.outlet)  - Pivot head moves smoothly but feels a bit on the &#x27;loose&#x27; side(as if it will     eventually break off - time will tell)    </li>
            <li>Probably can avoid if you use shaving gel (I got lazy and just went for water, but using gel it is smooth and super close).  </li>
            <li>I actually did lightly scrape myself lightly with it on my adam&#x27;s apple on the first use due to using too much pressure on that raised area, so it&#x27;s definitely getting close and it requires a bit of technique.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>With this said, I regret not getting the cheaper ES4026 that was highly recommended by consumer reports.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to guess a high end</li>
            <li>Well placed highly responsive controls that cover all requirements.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic still lives high on my list for quality products.  </li>
            <li>Highly Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>In dry mode, it is about as good as a generic three-blade system such as that from CVS.</li>
            <li>I like that I can clean it with ordinary liquid soap and do not need to buy special cleanser.</li>
            <li>previous shaver, a Norelco, was going on the blink after many years of usage and I was keen to try out something new,  </li>
            <li>wow!!</li>
            <li>I can also shave faster with the Panasonic but the Norelco contours my face and head a little better.     </li>
            <li>More importantly, it pops out from the side whereas the trimmer on the ES8066 (and other Panasonic and Braun razors I&#x27;ve used) can be aligned with the foil and can be used at the same time as the foil cutter over your entire face.  </li>
            <li>Fired it up...and loud, MUCH louder than the Norelco, even louder than the Panny...</li>
            <li>Cons  - Sometimes need to go over area several times to get a smooth shave, but I think this is a limitation of electric shavers in general rather than a fault of this product    </li>
            <li>I do recommend it as even if you don&#x27;t use it to clean the razor, you can use it to dry it, it will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent them from rusting when air drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always shaved dry and got a clean cut with no pulls.</li>
            <li>It shaves closer than the old Panasonic, and the tilting head really does help the head follow the shape of my face.  </li>
            <li>After a few uses, my skin was able to adjust.</li>
            <li>The water helps to cool the scalp because the manual hand motion and especially the electric action of the Panasonic will heat up the scalp.  </li>
            <li>but it takes a few more strokes to get around the neck.  </li>
            <li>I found its better to shave everyday and keep it trimmed.</li>
            <li>So in a nutshell, based on my experience with Panasonic shavers, you would be pleased both short and long term with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It gives a good close shave with out irritating the skin.  </li>
            <li>Besides, it&#x27;s not a hassle to grab the razor out of the medicine cabinet and make a single pass along my neck to clean up any misses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>An all seasons wet or dry duty kind of animal with respected heritage.</li>
            <li>I hope people are smart enough to read the bad reviews more than the good ones.  </li>
            <li>I kept thinking that I wasn&#x27;t using it right, but I&#x27;ve tried every direction and always end up the same.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts a long time and it recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>However if shaving dry it is just a mundane adequate, my old Norelco was better.</li>
            <li>The shave in all areas of my face was extremely close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But now, I use the Pro Curve every other day, and it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>Without returning the Braun I got the new Panny.</li>
            <li>You can use a bit of hand soap (per the instructions) in the cleaning foils and it will lather out, then you rinse it off, and it&#x27;s like new again.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;mn now using the new 5 blade Gillette Fusion</li>
            <li>Yes, it does take time for your skin to adjust to a new razor.</li>
            <li>The instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30 days to get used to any new shaving method</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep the new one</li>
            <li>This new Panasonic</li>
            <li>I have had the new shaver for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Being fed up with the lackluster performance of the Norelcos, I decided that I needed to get a new electric razor.    </li>
            <li>so I thought I would give it a try with all the new technology,  it has been reviewed as the sharpest shave on the market.</li>
            <li>It also will not shave while plugged in, which bothers me a bit, but really isn&#x27;t an issue because it charges fast and holds a charge for several weeks.  </li>
            <li>It was a good starter electric shaver until I found out she spent $180.00 After it started to die and after replacing the heads a few times I decided to part with it.</li>
            <li>Please note that any electric razor requires at least 10 days use in order to properly condition the skin so that you can have a good shave with</li>
            <li>Actually, I couldn&#x27;t believe how close a shave it gives, better then I ever expected, since I never used an electric shavor at all before.</li>
            <li>Knowing this might happen, I was very gentle with the second razor, but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be cold without the beard, but change is good, right?      </li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves this razor; apparently it gives a much closer shave than any electric razor</li>
            <li>The shaver is loud!  </li>
            <li>This is the EXACT same model as the ES8077 without the cleaning block (see my review of it under that model).</li>
            <li>First, I trimmed 1/3 of my face with a Conair trimmer and used the ES8043&#x27;s pop-up trimmer for another third.</li>
            <li>, I would guess might have achieved maybe 1/3rd the speed, and that&#x27;s probably only for the first minute or so of shaving before the battery looses a bit of its edge.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted for nearly 5-years, as battery would only last about 4-5mins after charging - I only had to replace the foil once, primarily my fault when I dropped it in the sink.  </li>
            <li>The charger kept breaking on me (once in the first month [11/2006], then another time 4 months later [3/2007]).</li>
            <li>My wife dropped my first one, I purched the same model again.</li>
            <li>So, I returned the first pair and bought a second pair, this time from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>that gives a better shave but has too small a head.  </li>
            <li>then settled for the ES8043 model which I understand is the exact same thing as the models that have the charger stand</li>
            <li>The first died only because I dropped it.  </li>
            <li>over, I wanted a shaver that could be cleaned easily with a little water and soap.  </li>
            <li>clean the excess water with a soft cloth being careful not to touch the cutter heads.</li>
            <li>I went up and down twice, with light pressure and could not believe what I saw.</li>
            <li>I rise it under tap water to clean it out after every other shave.</li>
            <li>To clean up I use a line of liquid soap along the center of the razor and turn it on under running water and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li>As you can see very few cons and many pros.  </li>
            <li>I found no other brand of shaver that gave me the same close, easy shave as that early Panasonic, so I recently went for this newer model after analyzing reviews.      </li>
            <li>I ordered new replacement batteries and fixed it myself.</li>
            <li>For the past month shaving is fast and pain free again.</li>
            <li>This shaver cuts very close wet or dry, cleans easily and seems to hold a charge forever.</li>
            <li>The Braun it is replacing was half the price and worked fine for nearly five years and included a charging station.  </li>
            <li>He has used the rotary bladed kind in the past that left him with lots of irritation.</li>
            <li>Looks nice, not too big nor small.</li>
            <li>It cleans-up easily, but you have to empty the cuttings and clean the head every other or every third day.</li>
            <li>After reading numerous positive reviews, I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the razor is no more irritating and more effective than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I think the Norelco worked well when I first bought it, but the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; heads become clogged with hair fairly quickly and can be difficult to clean.</li>
            <li>What especially impresses me about the new shaver is its ability to cut neck hairs very closely.  </li>
            <li>A great little wet or dry rechargeable shaver for the money.  </li>
            <li>I love the wet dry feature, which allows me to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>I also like being able to use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Not only did it give me a much better shave than my previous rotaries</li>
            <li>I have owned several panasonic razors and thought they were much better than the Braun razor I used previously.</li>
            <li>The ergonomics of the ES8043 was very comfortable and though the shaver felt awfully delicate in my hands</li>
            <li>My second Braun would actually freeze up on my face while shaving because it just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to cut through my beard.  </li>
            <li>Comes with a cloth bag as a travel case, a little cheap.</li>
            <li>The noise level is significantly lower than my previous electric shavers, though quite a bit louder than my blades except for my weeping and wailing when I cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>It made quick work of the other side of my face as well.</li>
            <li>Sure the blades are getting dull and I should upgrade but the battery (and the blades) have paid for them</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is very good, but it takes very long to clean (2-3 hrs) and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, but it does grow a bit sideways on the neck, and this handles just as good as any other new foil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This works even better in the shower than dry, which surprised me a bit, but I guess it makes sense due to additional lubrication.  </li>
            <li>I was not particularly interested in lots of extras, just a razor that would give a very close shave, quickly and quietly.  </li>
            <li>Recently I started shaving at my gym in the morning, using a two blade disposable razor and was surprised to find that I was getting a much closer shave than with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old 8017 Panasonic Linear shaver with a fixed head with the 8043 and it blows the old model away.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic shaver is clearly the winner hands-down on economics.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 30 days now and</li>
            <li>It is loud, but that&#x27;s not a problem for me.  </li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>i guess these things are almost indestructible, but i just had to get rid of the old model b/c it was getting gunky.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet and fast.  </li>
            <li>and it gets nearly as close as a razor does.  </li>
            <li>The following review is because I found it excruciating to find an electric razor that really truly met all my needs.</li>
            <li>, 360 Complete.     </li>
            <li>I still find myself finishing my shave with my old rotary (Norelco).  </li>
            <li>This was an upgrade over a 1 1/2 year old braun.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s quite loud  -</li>
            <li>It only took about 4 shaves to really get used to using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be on a completely electric shaving system</li>
            <li>Had an old Norelco with three rotating blades and was looking for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>and she recommended using some of that old fashion shaving powder instead of a razor.</li>
            <li>I think they do a better job, at least for me.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of switching from disposable blades to this razor, you will probably be pleasantly surprised at just how close it can cut.  </li>
            <li>but I cut my shaving time considerably with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>especially on those really  humid days......</li>
            <li>I have used this razor for 1 month and find it shaves faster and closer than my old Grundig.</li>
            <li>I have curly whiskers and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s the same.  </li>
            <li>I really like using my Panasonic shaver, this is my second one (ES8043).  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old cuss, having shaved for over 50 years, and I&#x27;ve owned every make of electric imaginable (even a Ronson).  </li>
            <li>Near the end of its blade life I have to touch up frequantly</li>
            <li>B0009DT342 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver]]</li>
            <li>After receiving the razor and trying it for about a month I was completely sold on this razor.</li>
            <li>I still prefer the old style blades and the feel of the 8066.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned nearly every shaver brand over the years</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how close it shaves.</li>
            <li>have used the shaver on beards ranging from one day to three days old.</li>
            <li>Although I cut myself once, it was only because I was using too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Before I would shave with the electric and have to go back over everything with a razor to get even a reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li>a month old Amazon won&#x27;t accept a return either.</li>
            <li>It does not do the job nearly as well as my old ES7003 Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Has a cleaning option and it completely cleans all hair and residue off on the foil and the blades.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t need charging very often and when it does it only takes 30 min max.</li>
            <li>The motor is way too loud.</li>
            <li>My scalp is a bit lumpy, so the pivot action is a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I had no trouble getting used to it.  </li>
            <li>Today it just stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>, I shall be sticking with my old buddy.</li>
            <li>I preferred the old model&#x27;s charging stand</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer feels sturdier than my old ES8162, so</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll charge up the old ES8162, replace the blades and use another trimmer for a while.</li>
            <li>B0009DT342 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver]]</li>
            <li>was surprised how well this shaves.</li>
            <li>own beard is thick in places and the hairs themselves tend to be quite coarse.</li>
            <li>The Norelco does do a good job, don&#x27;t get me wrong here.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little noisy, and have to push hard many times to shave clean.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with my boyfriend because his face can look  and feel pretty rough, but after using this shaver his face is very soft.</li>
            <li>I did notice a big performance boost from my new razor and I am completely satisifed with the new purchase.</li>
            <li>Based on reviews, I went with the ES-8043SC, only to discover that the new shaver has the new version blades.  </li>
            <li>Fastest, middle quiet, cheapest of the bunch, able to clean itself with no special stand, and finally wet or dry capable.</li>
            <li>Since then I tried other brands, assuming that other companies who specialized in this market would have developed better performing products.  </li>
            <li>The newer version tends to shave more closely in a single pass and holds a charge for at least an entire week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  </li>
            <li>I still can shave more of my face, especially the concave areas, slightly closer with blades than this electric, but it&#x27;s close enough and faster.    </li>
            <li>+Only with full, in the shower Wet capability (not even tested...still won)  +</li>
            <li>On the other hand, in other, more fleshy areas like the neck and cheek, its not quite so close.</li>
            <li>I hand&#x27;t used it for about a week following the full recharge, but I would have expected it to retain energy when not in use.  </li>
            <li>I had several othe electric shavers in the past including a wet/dry Panasonic but this one is so much better.    </li>
            <li>It holds a charge for over a week, and recharges quickly, so that is one less thing to leave out on the counter.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on amazon for the other electronic razors I knew I made the right choice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, I highly recommend this razor based on my personal experience.</li>
            <li>I love that is sooo easy to clean, which was one of the things I hated in my last electric.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8043SC wet/dry shaver has met my expectations - set rather high from prior reviews.</li>
            <li>Who knows, they may design a shaver that operates at such a high rpm rate that you just have to hold it up to your face and it will sonically(is that a word?)</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s because it just has such high rpm.</li>
            <li>The slide up trimmer was excellent for those difficult neck hairs that lay down flat to the skin.</li>
            <li>Blades just cost too much right now, and they don&#x27;t last long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Dry shaves are ordinary and not really any better than many other razors--but</li>
            <li>It is easy to recharge and clean and does not require expensive refills on lotions and such to use.</li>
            <li>My first wet shave electric razor</li>
            <li>This thing shaves at least as close as my blades (Gillette Sensor Excell), with more consistent results and less chance of cuts.  </li>
            <li>I always enjoyed Braun razors, but their foils wear out quick and they&#x27;re expensive to replace!</li>
            <li>When the battery on my last one would no longer hold a charge, I decided to try something new, and purchase this Panasonic wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li>They say to give it 30 days for your face and beard to acclimate to the new shaver, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to be necessary.  </li>
            <li>I am expecting the new one I bought to last about 2 to 3 years.    </li>
            <li>I was dismayed to find that the new blades were totally different than the originals on the 8066.      </li>
            <li>I purchased the Panasonic after trying out a new braun to replace my last one.  </li>
            <li>Easier to clean and can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Can be used wet or dry, and is a snap to clean.</li>
            <li>At least for my face, and the way I shave, the side-to-side tilt is much more helpful, especially for the chin, neck and moustache areas.  </li>
            <li>If I have any complaints they are the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a digital display to let you know how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if I wet my face maybe 5 minutes before I launch the Panasonic it really helps, because just electric on bone-dry doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>how much charge remains and the razor will charge up in 5-10 minutes sufficient to do a single shave.    </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with the skin irritation and the shave is much closer than I ever remember going around in circles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Folks, this shaver has produced an EXTREMELY close shave, with no irritation at all, and no uncomfortable pulling sensation that Norelco&#x27;s \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; method sometimes produces.</li>
            <li>Follows every curve, no sharp edges.</li>
            <li>MAJOR advantage is that it cleans with soap and water...</li>
            <li>So here we are in 2008 and found myself struggling to shave without major touch ups with a disposal blade.</li>
            <li>I have a $10.00 shaver purchased from a major drug store (advertised \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>I usually shave right after I take a shower, and my old Braun wouldn&#x27;t cut cleanly until I fully dried off.</li>
            <li>Sharp, close shaving, pivot head, easy clean, holds a long charge, less expensive than a number of other razors, I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Another plus is that the main shaving head is maybe 20% wider than other models that I&#x27;ve used, and much wider than an earlier Panasonic wet/dry that I had - helps me shave my face in fewer passes.      </li>
            <li>If there are any missed spots I usually shave them after the shower to clean my head up.</li>
            <li>I continued to use the old, original blades for another two years, (removing them daily and keeping them stored under a small pyramid</li>
            <li>I generally get about 4-5 face and head shaves on a charge.  </li>
            <li>it did not irritate my face in the least and my face and neck were smooth like when I shaved with the bladed razors.</li>
            <li>I used a cheap Norelco in the past, and think I&#x27;m going back.</li>
            <li>clear of this device unless you have stubble like a porcupine, it&#x27;s like French kissing jaws.  </li>
            <li>THIS SHAVER IS QUIET AND CUTS LONG HAIR VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning on this was also harder as the rotary area wasn&#x27;t very streamlined.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Speed: For my old shaver, I had to take several passes, and yet still missed stubs here and there.</li>
            <li>It does take fewer passes than my old norelco, but overall it seems like a slower but closer shave.</li>
            <li>Earlier Panasonic models I&#x27;ve owned were not as loud, and I would not recommend this model to anyone.</li>
            <li>So I took it back and got the Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver.  </li>
            <li>Also as an added bonus, my wife says that it&#x27;s gently enough for her to allow me to shave her \\&quot;sensitive</li>
            <li>No complaints so far after 2 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>Only maintains a charge for 3 shaves and then is completely discharged.</li>
            <li>Finally, when the screen on the 8066 developed a hole, I was faced with a choice.  </li>
            <li>Shaving wet is where this razor really shines.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace an old Panasonic wet/dry shaver when it finally died.  </li>
            <li>In any case, I was amazed three years ago by the ES8162, which shaved so close it almost hurt my skin if I was not careful.</li>
            <li>I had an old model of Panasonic shaver which provided me with 7 years of service until the battery died recently.</li>
            <li>For those with heavy, thick set beards, full of skin scruff and fleas, this works wonders after a few moments in the warm shower with a cream of pea soup nearby.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too.</li>
            <li>For those with heavy, thick set beards, full of skin scruff and fleas, this works wonders after a few moments in the warm shower with a cream of pea soup nearby.</li>
            <li>It truly is a different product with its extremely fast cutting head and it shaves very closely, very quickly and with almost no pressure.   </li>
            <li>Panasonic just released several new shavers such as the  Panasonic ES-LA63-S</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for few days, and I&#x27;ve used it both dry and with a light lather of shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>This new shaver is better than the first and less expensive.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturer tells you to shave with it for a month before you rate the results; they say that is how long it takes your face to get use to a new shaving system.  </li>
            <li>Came with a nice little hard case for travel.</li>
            <li>I use it dry, right after my shower, but wet the neck area, this seems to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that the blades seem to be really fine</li>
            <li>It cuts much closer than any other shaver I have owned and it even gets the hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Granted, they do say this has the sharpest blades in the market, but do we really need them to be soooo sharp that they cut skin??    </li>
            <li>The speed and sharp blades make fast work out of anything.</li>
            <li>Expectations duly lowered, I turned the shaver on, was momentarily surprised by the high frequency buzz that comes with 13,000 oscillations a minute, and ran the shaver down my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is sad because my neck is the most sensitive part to shave.</li>
            <li>Floating heads with firm or soft ride really make the difference where the linear activated blades meet the whiskers.  </li>
            <li>I had been using an older Panasonic fixed head wet-dry shaver in the wet mode for several years, but the battery finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>I have a thick beard and a job that requires me to have a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>My skin was a little irritated at first</li>
            <li>A little \\&quot;warm\\&quot; feeling the first week.     </li>
            <li>I had a little irritation on my neck the first time, but none since.  </li>
            <li>Doing away with tiny brush cleaning is a major advance for those of us who have dexterity problems.  </li>
            <li>Buying new replacement blades only worked for so long.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t, at least so far when I inspect the blades right before doing this and</li>
            <li>This quickly changed, and after only about 10 shaves, it is taking me no more than five minutes.  </li>
            <li>The motor is fast yet quiet, and using the cleaning mode with a little dab of hand soap is much more appealing and convenient than needing/using the base station (bulk) and cleaning fluid ($$$) -- especially for travel.</li>
            <li>Starting way back when I was 14 years old I shaved strictly with bladed razors of various brands and styles.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s long gone, I still prefer my old ES-8066.</li>
            <li>I have a long, angular face, and the skin on my neck tends to be quite sensitive.</li>
            <li>After that first round I was done.</li>
            <li>Upon my first few weeks this thing tore up my face as the manual stated might happen...  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter and doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as past panasonic razors I&#x27;ve owned, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Caution: for the first few times you use this, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to have something like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver about a month and a half ago based largely on the reviews.</li>
            <li>It seems to give a closer shave dry, although if shaving in a steamy bathroom or hot hotel room, wet is the only way to go.    </li>
            <li>I used it both wet and dry and the results were pretty similar.</li>
            <li>This particular shaver, I purchased from Amazon about a year ago after having tried other Panasonic shavers.  </li>
            <li>this is to be expected, as all new shavers cause the razor burn problem that ususally goes away after a month or so of use.  </li>
            <li>The on/off button is right where my thumb usually rests, and I continually switch it off accidentally.    </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a leightweight cheap little thing that should sell for about $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not $79.99!!!</li>
            <li>My previous Panasonic razor would have cost almost as much just for the foil and cutter replacements.</li>
            <li>Dry works better for me because it is less time consuming and not so messy with the dripping shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The heads don&#x27;t pivot up and down as much as the Braun, but once again, time will tell if this is necessary.</li>
            <li>I usually shave dry, but other reviewers say shaving with soap is even better.  </li>
            <li>That said, this shaver is on the large side and it&#x27;s a little pricey,  </li>
            <li>It works extremely well both wet and dry, although I have come to prefer dry as I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I researched electric shavers thinking I could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer.</li>
            <li>The main difference is the 13K-rpm motor which is much quieter with less vibration and noise than my previous shavers, plus the blade</li>
            <li>The lithium battery is likely to last much longer than the previous ni-cad units.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that you can if you want use a little shaving cream while you shave.</li>
            <li>For those of you who have never used an electric razor, this style of razor (linear) gives a much closer shave than the 3 blade rotor razors at the cost of a little comfort.  </li>
            <li>and it takes me a little while to do my whole face.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s due for some new blades.</li>
            <li>It took him a little while to get used to using it, but now he shaves nearly every day!!!</li>
            <li>if you hold down the power button for a few seconds, it turns the motor on in &#x27;ultrasonic&#x27; mode for about 10 seconds, which is supposed to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li>So, I am raving about his product, but every good has its bad...</li>

            <li> great cleaning that can be done anywhere</li>
            <li> Also, I read through a lot of reviews about this razor not doing so great on the neck.</li>
            <li> I use this on my head and my face and it works great for both.  </li>
            <li> I shave my face and my head with this razor, and it does a great job on both.  </li>

            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> Read some of the reviews on Amazon, bought this shaver and it gives a really great shave.  </li>
            <li> The fact that the shaver&#x27;s head pivots and \\&quot;curves\\&quot; makes it great.  </li>
            <li> Forget the fact that this model costs around $65.00 it is three times cheaper than the Braun, it is $115.00 cheaper than my Norelco and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> The system that works best for me is to soften my whiskers with warm water and soap, rinse, then apply a 50/50 mix of shaving gel and penetrating lotion.</li>
            <li> and I realized how great this product is.  </li>
            <li> This was a great purchase.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll get the best results if you don&#x27;t go more than 3 days between shaves.</li>
            <li> I prefer the 3 blade system but this unit is ok at best for the price.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned the latest Braun 8985 and it was excellent, while it lasted...</li>

            <li> I purchased this razor because of the fact that it was wet/dry and had good reviews for the price.</li>
            <li> For the price and product I believe this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> but it is all good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for over two years now and just realized that it&#x27;s not quite as good as I thought.</li>
            <li> He really loved that I bought this gift  for him.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do as good a job as my ES726.  </li>
            <li> I was honestly wanting to like this, after all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try the Panasonic based on all of the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I must add that I loved shaving with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Alright there are plenty of good reviews here</li>
            <li> Good looking unit that works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I thought that I would have some problems because of my fair skin</li>
            <li> The razor does have a charge gauge (in percent) to give you a good idea</li>
            <li> It provides a close, comfortable shave, the battery life is excellent (2-3 weeks), and in the over 2 years I&#x27;ve owned it</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good thing Panasonic has been around for decades)</li>
            <li> the shave is so darn good.</li>
            <li> Good performance, long-lasting battery charge, durable, performs just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Amazon it really good too.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t bore you with the details, but the linear is superior in every way.  </li>
            <li> Good shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> Shaves as good as braun and doesn&#x27;t burn face like remington.</li>
            <li> Really good on neck hairs.</li>
            <li> got a good deal on the shaver.</li>
            <li> The problem is the shave quality is not as good as I am used to and it PULLS HAIRS.  </li>
            <li> It gave me years of good shaving.</li>
            <li> Good cut.  </li>
            <li> Good battery life</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a fair test before writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> it feels sooooo good.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it</li>
            <li> This review is also for all the head shavers out there that need a good quality razor for getting bald.</li>
            <li> How do I know this Panasonic is a good razor?</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s just as good as my Mach3.  </li>
            <li> Good shaver</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good around my chin and jaw</li>
            <li> He tried my husbands linear shaver and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> I have not used one as good as this before.</li>
            <li> NOT SO GOOD.  </li>
            <li> IMHO none hold a candle to this sleek, well desingned and crafted exceptional razor.</li>
            <li> This does an exceptional job on your head.</li>
            <li> First,the equipment: exceptionally well engineered for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li> The reliability is fine, noise is not an issue and shave quality is very good.</li>
            <li> The idea of using an electric shaver is very appealing  -</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li> The battery life is great (way better than my Remington).</li>
            <li> It shaves great, cleaning is a snap seeing how it is waterproof, all you have to do is pop the top off and rinse it under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Probably but I am very satisfied for the moment.  </li>
            <li> in all I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this product in the weeks since I bought it</li>
            <li> Great service and will save your favorite shaver or any appliance that uses rechargable batteries.</li>
            <li> Cleans real easy.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I did, because this razor is great.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this model.</li>
            <li> &quot; you&#x27;ll be very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great shave, not too noisy, great battery life and one of the best designs I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I love Panasonic!    </li>
            <li> But the first shave was so close it impressed me to the fullest.</li>
            <li> love it! .</li>
            <li> You can be sure it won&#x27;t be a Panasonic!</li>
            <li> This shaver seems to be well constructed and has great features like wet/dry use and easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to use, and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Let me be honest, the Norelco Cool Skin works great and gets a good head/face shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> This was a great razor for $40.00.  Close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> Smooth cut, great power and durable.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic Razor is AS GOOD or even better than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I focused on the brands I trusted most to still deliver good engineering, metal foils and electronics regardless where they were made</li>
            <li> Best shave, close and fast  </li>
            <li> nice  - ease of cleaning  - smoothness of cut *</li>
            <li> It is a nice upgrade from the Braun I had.  </li>
            <li> Well, this electric got it nice and close, seems even below skin level.</li>
            <li> It trims sideburns and my neck nicely.  </li>
            <li> I am the kind of guy that gets a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon.</li>
            <li> Was used to a braun shaver but this item is really nice..</li>
            <li> I bought a really nice Panasonic \\&quot;Smooth Operator\\&quot; razor years ago, and it&#x27;s been GREAT.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Pros of the Pro-Curve: pivoting head, better shave than blades, ability to shave in the shower, good price.</li>
            <li> Then my Panasonic arrived and I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the look of the razor and was not expecting much.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve liked them all.  </li>
            <li> I looked up online reviews and liked what I saw about this razor.  </li>
            <li> It is great to just leave it running and stick in the shower spray for clean up.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Panasonic may sell very good shavers, but they&#x27;re probably in the higher price range.  </li>
            <li> at this time, I am not worried about it, I am very satisfied with this Panasonic, and don&#x27;t think it can get any better.</li>
            <li> Unit arrived quickly (one day) from Amazon and works great.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very easy to handle.    </li>
            <li> oh, and the price is just right!!!</li>
            <li> For the cost and free shipping, this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I love the shaver, it gives me a nice close shave and the fact</li>
            <li> This is far and away the best electric shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I can say this Panasonic is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> This is the best one so far.  </li>
            <li> Helpful hints: use a liquid pre-shave (the gooey kind works better than lectric-shave) or shave in the shower   and use shower gel instead of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Many features like a locking/unlocking head are nice to have.  </li>
            <li> This great product is a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> The shaver is light with a good ergonomic handle.  </li>
            <li> But after three or four shaves I notice the hairs it invariably misses are still growing wildly (mostly on my neck) and look to be seeking an ingrown kind of experience.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Best thing I did was find a source that repairs or rebuilds or was able to get parts for my old Panasonic ES7003.</li>
            <li> This razor cuts better each time you use it and cleans very easily.</li>
            <li> So while I thought this would save me time, it actually takes me more time to shave than with my Mach3 and some nice shaving cream like Trumper&#x27;s Limes (great stuff!)</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a pretty great electric razor.  </li>
            <li> No adjustment time needed for me, the first time I used it I got a great shave with no discomfort all all.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad shaver, fits the hand well, but does not shave as close as the Braun 360 razor I have, but a good razor.  </li>
            <li> I like to keep my head shaved very close and keep it clean looking, the Panasonic is the best for this.</li>
            <li> Just works fine!</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to use, and my skin is in better shape after shaving than when I use a manual blade.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light to handle, and the pivoting head truly does conform to your face/neck line thus allowing for a more efficient shave.</li>
            <li> Gives a very good &#x27;wet&#x27; shave--nearly as good as a blade.    </li>
            <li> Charger:  Its HUGE!  </li>
            <li> However; I am more than satisfied with the Panasonic and have been using for one month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rotary style electric razors for more than 15 years.</li>
            <li> it is perfect and simple.</li>
            <li> It also helps to pull the scalp against the grain in order to stand up the stubble better and let the razor get a better bite.</li>
            <li> I dont think you can beat a Gillette Mach 3 or better razor anyway</li>
            <li> It helps as people said to dedicate a a minute or more to running the shaver over the skin in different directions and pulling the looser neck skin a bit to engage the blades but the shave quality and speed are excellent.</li>
            <li> Claiming 50% more surface area than before with three rings on each head.     </li>
            <li> I went for the top (well almost, mine didn&#x27;t have the cleaning station).</li>
            <li> and it vibrated more in my hand.    </li>
            <li> This foil shaver works okay in the shower</li>
            <li> lasted 4 months, fell apart, pinched a lot, not close any more.</li>
            <li> Does a better job than the braun, but not the miracle shaver I hoped for.     </li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will produce even better results as my skin and beard</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about time I introduce him to the Panasonic.  :-)</li>
            <li> when it cute* - see below    </li>
            <li> for the money, the $[...] norelco was a better razor.</li>
            <li> Plus there is the environmental aspects of not throwing blades away that make the electric more appealing..     </li>
            <li> It gives a nice close shave and is fairly comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It sure is a lot more convenient, and cheaper, than blades and shaving cream, over time.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Planned yes for sure no longer returnable.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this razor is not all that it seems to be and many reviewers are trying to make it seem like it is \\&quot;the ultimate\\&quot; razor which it is not.</li>
            <li> I looked at many options and read many reviews before deciding to buy the Panasonic ES8043.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves as close as my ES726 but is even more comfortable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;First of all, I love being able to lather up and shave.</li>
            <li> After a year or so, it got louder and didn&#x27;t like being woke up in the mornings. :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sideburn trimmer is OK.</li>
            <li> I like the Braun trimmers much better.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d gladly tell everyone about this shaver.    </li>
            <li> This one seems to take longer and more passes to get all the stubble.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a blade fan, but have even tried the Gilette fusion and I am quicker but more bleeding with this.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Use and maintenance make it a worthwhile addition to my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I can get more than 10 shaves out of the battery</li>
            <li> Just simply the best.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging stand and therefore doesn&#x27;t have a safe way to \\&quot;store\\&quot;</li>
            <li> If I wait longer than that, it doesn&#x27;t cut well and requires many passes to cut the hair.    </li>
            <li> razor is much better than most others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased</li>
            <li> I used a Norelco rotary for many years.  </li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> Since it is a wet-dry razor, you won&#x27;t be able to shave with the power cord plugged in -- lest some yahoo attempts a corded shave while sitting in the tub.    </li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I thought the pivoting head was more of a gimmick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very much impressed with Amazon&#x27;s return policy and just ordered this 2nd one from them.</li>
            <li> This is my 5th electric shaver, and definitely the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I also found that it gets better has your face adapts and gets used to it.</li>
            <li> Overall... excellent product.</li>
            <li> Could there be a better shaver out there, maybe</li>
            <li> It shaves OK</li>
            <li> After using this for 2-3 weeks, I don&#x27;t dread shaving any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Panasonic Wet/Dry owner for many years and love the ability to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a breeze, and being able to use it in the shower is something some people may like (I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, probably won&#x27;t since I don&#x27;t have a mirror in there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used another wet/dry Panasonic before that although I don&#x27;t have it any more to give it&#x27;s model number.</li>
            <li> it is more than I dreamed.</li>
            <li> And they didn&#x27;t work any better.  </li>
            <li> The pop up is better for side burns though.</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic wet/dry shavers in the shower for years now, and have always been pleased.</li>
            <li> If you want to start using an electric in the shower, get one of these models, you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> After years of shaving with a blade, I decided about six months ago to switch to an electric, because I thought it would be better for my eczema-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even think about a rotary, I&#x27;m 100% sure you&#x27;ll love the linear.  </li>
            <li> Get a wet/dry - - these are great for the shower which gets the shave very close to a blade when used in with soap &amp; water.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington and Norelco before and have not been satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> Heavier beards might require a bit more time, but I have not found this to be significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought by spending more money I would get a better shaver.  </li>
            <li> This one works much better.</li>
            <li> so it may work better that way</li>
            <li> Depending on where it is stored, it&#x27;s more susceptible to damage.</li>
            <li> I have nicked myself once or twice but not severely, and it&#x27;s more of a fluke.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves better than any razor I have ever owned</li>
            <li> I have been using them for 15 years and can not find anything better...</li>
            <li> I found the Panasonics to be the most durable, while still providing a close shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with purchase.  </li>
            <li> , it works well too, but you have to do more pass-bys in order to get stragglers.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Sure, I probably should replace them here some time soon.</li>
            <li> Because(phillips norelco makes to many models, and the models I have tried have week motors, maybe the exception is the $100 to $200 ones.  </li>
            <li> So this panasonic buzzy razor works ok.</li>
            <li> It takes 5 minutes at most to shave my head in the shower with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> But the Panasonic is better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the closeness of the razor.</li>
            <li> Also recommended is baby oil or \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; shaving oil for better performance.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews here, and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> The form factor is much more ergonomic than my Braun.  </li>
            <li> I did not think that I would ever be able to say that about a electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Many people warned me against electrics</li>
            <li> I thought it would be great using it in the shower to really get a close shave....</li>
            <li> I have owned many Panasonic wet/dry razors through the years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many and now regret it.</li>
            <li> Each one got better, except for this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use it with shaving cream most of the time.  </li>
            <li> Many years of use and it still works like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> We are definetly in love with this one, (and i think his skin apreciates it too).</li>
            <li> but I find I get a better shave elsewhere</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m never going to lather up before hand because that&#x27;s specifically what I&#x27;m trying to avoid, more as a time saver than anything else.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for about a decade now and this is the best one i&#x27;ve had so far... very smooth, very comfortable to hold, quiet (compared with others i&#x27;ve had), great battery life.</li>
            <li> It does sound like a bumblebee, but since it cuts so nice, that part is easy to forget.    </li>
            <li> Very clean shave.     </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cleaning up pretty good like that.</li>
            <li> But the best results for me have been to use it dry.</li>
            <li> It cleans up easy by just popping off the foil head and running the blades under the tap, or you can do a more thorough job with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still as strong today as it was when I purchased it more than four years ago.</li>
            <li> I have not gotten to that point yet, but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the first time I&#x27;ve been so impressed with a product that I came back to write a review.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts about a week before recharge needed so far (6-10 minutes)  Ability to clean with hand soup and running water is very nice and cost effective.  </li>
            <li> you prefer not to purchase the bulky cleaning station (from the ES8077S model), the manual suggests an alternative method to clean -- using liquid soap and water; this would be convenient when on the road! &lt;</li>
            <li> Being able to clean it with liquid soap and water makes this a better and cheaper choice than the cleaning stand models which require detergent packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; however it&#x27;s close enough, very good</li>
            <li> That makes my neck much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> in all though, I think Panasonic gives a closer, more comfortable shave than the Braun.</li>
            <li> This razor will leave most of your skin just as smooth as a blade.    </li>
            <li> but it makes shaving easier, more comfortable, and produces a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> It is the closest, fastest, and most comfortable shaver I have used.  </li>
            <li> Razor works great so far.  </li>
            <li> When I bought my second about 2 years ago, I also bought the latest greatest rotary and did a side-by-side comparison because the rotary advertisments are so compelling.    </li>
            <li> For example, the 8077, in addition to the cleaning station, has a more detailed battery-charge readout.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, you can NOT use the shaver while it is being charged.  </li>
            <li> That has completely gone away and now my face feels great after shaving.  </li>
            <li> This one delivers a closer, more comfortable shave, and the charge lasts a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> *(&amp; that is smooth, like perfect, blade-eque smooth, except one tiny ridge along the jaw bone</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t need it as it said the charge was good.</li>
            <li> The cleaning process is very easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Dry shaving was almost just as good with performance still superior to Norelco.    </li>
            <li> My fiancé has found a new love for touching my face, and I seem to be getting more kisses too!</li>
            <li> other than those complaints, this baby is great!!!!</li>
            <li> Overall a good razor!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic seems much more straightforward: There are blades, they move, they cut your beard.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can clean it by just popping off the top and holding it under the faucet.  </li>
            <li> Still this was the easy task...</li>
            <li> The easy winner: Panny    Done.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily.  </li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li> It cleans easily and the batteries are long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> Cleans easily with water.</li>
            <li> A bit more involved to get really clean</li>
            <li> Easy to use, shaves close, and has a lot of extras that are not found on lady&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li> But that was easily mastered, and I&#x27;ve had no problems since then.  </li>
            <li> to make sure it gets clean.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy though.  </li>
            <li> It recharges fast, feels light and good grip.  </li>
            <li> Plus, cleaning it with liquid soap is easier and more efficient than trying to brush the heads clean.</li>
            <li> I found that Panasonic easily outclasses Bruan, Remington and Norelco.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- can easily be cleaned with water&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy handling, Charge lasts almost forever,VERY close shave.</li>
            <li> This is an easy review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed a technique of working out from the top of my head, where I&#x27;m already bald for good, in circular motions and doing those circles in both directions to work against the grain whichever way it goes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and at a good price.</li>
            <li> This razor cuts very cleanly and rarely requires more than two passes over one area.  </li>
            <li> Hmm still it cut pretty darn nice.</li>
            <li> Top rated makes you feel cool  </li>
            <li> , I prefer the soap myself, a cool, refreshing blend of citrus and Vit E cream designed to combat pimples, tooth decay and plugged pores.</li>
            <li> This is the first one that I can honestly say shaves as close as a Razor can shave.</li>
            <li> So far this razor has been successful in resolving all my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> This model is the first I have used with the movable head, and it it a nice addition to help prevent accidental razor burn.  </li>
            <li> , I prefer the soap myself, a cool, refreshing blend of citrus and Vit E cream designed to combat pimples, tooth decay and plugged pores.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> in all, I would recommend this shaver for anyone looking for a good, clean, fast shave day after day (which I guess is everyone).</li>
            <li> Hands down best electric on the market.  </li>
            <li> I use the shaver dry with pre-shave most of the time, but it&#x27;s especially effective after a shower or hot face wash.      </li>
            <li> but this new Panasonic is superior.  </li>
            <li> After shaving with a blade for about two weeks, I was delighted to get my new shaver.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic Vortex is relatively light, and easy to hold/grip.</li>
            <li> The shaver works fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, compact, and easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li> but it just takes many more passes to get what the older ones were able to shave off.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but is not as convenient.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, it pays for itself in less then a year.  </li>
            <li> The shave is fine if you use a pre-conditioner.</li>
            <li> and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> With this 8043 model the trimmer works fine for sideburns, but you can&#x27;t use it on the rest of your face or neck.    </li>
            <li> have a light to medium growth of hair on my face and am able to get a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> quick call to Amazon and the $10.00 was refunded with no questions!</li>
            <li> Quickly, I knew this Panasonic is a better all around razor and shaves closer than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of picking up longer curly whiskers and gives a close enough shave for me with great comfort shaving through fresh soap and water.</li>
            <li> Very good from the first shave, a bit better than my old Braun but much cheaper and better battery.</li>
            <li> And really, even if I do a very good job and the result is very smooth, within 5-6 hours, the hair is growing back and noticeable to the touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always owned Brauns, but I wanted a good new shaver that I could quickly and easily use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The charger is HUGE</li>
            <li> and I like that - a comfortable shave and easy to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> So, rest assured, the Amazon reviews here are quite accurate.  </li>
            <li> The wet/dry functionality of this device makes it extremely easy to keep clean.    </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why consumer reports did not rank this as a must have item.</li>
            <li> +Light  +Li-ion battery  </li>
            <li> Great sideburn trimmer, now a solid flip up design    </li>
            <li> I also appreciate how easy it is to clean - just a rinse, or a bit of soap and a rinse - and done.</li>
            <li> Overall great choice.</li>
            <li> : The head of the shaver adjusts smoothly to the contours of my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Came with a cheap travel bag.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li> thinking that people would think I work for Panasonic, ranting about such a great product, but to tell the truth, they could hire me today</li>
            <li> It is easy as all get out to clean.</li>
            <li> (I have a light beard.)</li>
            <li> Cons:  1)  Feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> These W&amp;D razors are worth the money and the convenience of being able to shave in the shower compared to the blades that now cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> easy clean up.  </li>
            <li> bought this one and it turned out to be a light weight cheapo plastic razor.</li>
            <li> This thing is cheap.</li>
            <li> 2 minutes gets me smooth, without a hint of razor burn.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with the Pro-Curve because of the pivoting head and have experienced the same quality of shaves.</li>
            <li> It did such a great job I bought my Dad one.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> Genuinely as close as a blade&lt;</li>
            <li> Oh and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds a charge forever.  </li>
            <li> I replaced a cheap 3 head shaver with this one.</li>
            <li> I thought i could shave at the speed of light :|</li>
            <li> Easy to clean out.  </li>
            <li> It is light and durable.</li>
            <li> It was comfortable from Day</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those are the issues that are important to me in an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I have bone-dry skin and develop a light peach-fuzz beard in 3 to 4 days.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic gives me a smoothly shaved surface over my cheeks, jawbone and neck.  </li>
            <li> but, I genuinely like the shave.</li>
            <li> I will repeat, razor close, completely smooth.     </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> I am too cheap to buy some to try.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was free and prompt.  </li>
            <li> , it gets the hair realy close to the skin, and it&#x27;s realy easy to clean.</li>
            <li> HAVE TO USE A SLOWER SHAVER LIKE A CHEAP REMINGTON.  </li>
            <li> With the Vortex, I was able to shave cleanly in one quick pass.</li>
            <li> This is awesome, my husband has not sensitive skin, but extremely sensitive, and this is the first shaver that he&#x27;s been able to use without any kind of irritation on his face</li>
            <li> Not too worried, more power right?</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, if you are one of the many emerging head shavers, I would suggest this one.  </li>
            <li> I loved the dual-head 8066, and it stayed sharp and effective for five years on my medium beard.  </li>
            <li> But also it feels very powerful.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been irritated after shaving, which is very nice - no red bumps, no friction burns.  </li>
            <li> During the first 2 weeks I had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old Gillette, but today officially I was able to through my Gillette away for good.</li>
            <li> Pretty much it was all good.</li>
            <li> Basically, the shave was almost perfect the first time I used this thing when shaving wet with cream.</li>
            <li> Keeping it wet and lathered makes the shave more pleasant.  </li>
            <li> The razor itself is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t do it without some significant cooperation from the operator.</li>
            <li> (pretty sure)  +Quietest  </li>
            <li> I have a heavier beard than most, and I&#x27;d say this shaver comes pretty close to a blades performance.</li>
            <li> Even the hair trimmer works well and is easily accessible.    </li>
            <li> The reviews were somewhat more positive, the shaver was somewhat higher in the popularity ratings, and the shaver design was distinctly more stylish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can run it through the water to clean</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any soap to clean the blades</li>
            <li> so rinse clean</li>
            <li> There are cheaper models in Panasonic&#x27;s lineup, but they lack the 13,000 RPM motor, which is key to the excellent performance this unit offers.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Turbo clean mode.</li>
            <li> It takes 2 seconds to clean this shaver with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Its pretty cool shaving with an electric and being able to use shaving get.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had zero issues with clean up.  </li>
            <li> and it gets clean.  </li>
            <li> Also, the blades on the 8066 came off easily to clean, (and store under the pyramid).  </li>
            <li> Takes 1 - 2 swipes over an area of my face to get it clean.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had a quieter sound to it, but he is done so quickly I can bear with it.</li>
            <li> Dry shave - great on face.    </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slip of paper Panasonic puts in on how to clean the razor using hand soap and running water.  </li>
            <li> Not having a charging stand is a plus because the razor stays cleaner and no stand to clean.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a breeze to clean.  </li>
            <li> Very close, very smooth.  </li>
            <li> This new one is not as good as my old one but better than the alternative brands like Braun and Norelco.</li>
            <li> (so special stand)  </li>
            <li> It has a special 17000rpm cleaning mode (\\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; - what doesn&#x27;t use that moniker these days?)</li>
            <li> :  Right out of the box, I used my shaver for about a month before charging!</li>
            <li> but so far the main shaving head does sucha great job on my neck</li>
            <li> It is also superior to the older Panasonic ES8092 which was much heavier with shorter battery life.  </li>
            <li> Very fast, extremely easy to clean, just some liquid soap</li>
            <li> The wet shave is great</li>
            <li> the wet shaves are great.  </li>
            <li> It gives a quick fairly clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Arc IV which I would love to try and see how much improvement Panasonic has made in the two generations of shavers they have released since I purchased this unit.    </li>
            <li> good quality overall    </li>
            <li> This Panasonic received good ratings and was priced relatively low (compared to Braun for instance).  </li>
            <li> --TRUE</li>
            <li> Overall, a good value for the money, and performs as well as the 300 dollar Braun (which I had).</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic Linear shaver for several years with good results.</li>
            <li> Actually, just about all good electric razors are hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say that it is a good purchase if you aren&#x27;t looking to spend a ton of money on a fancier one.</li>
            <li> Overall, I feel it&#x27;s a good razor for the price.</li>
            <li> However, I cannot say enough good things about this Panasonic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver will only give you a good shave if you spend a lot of time going over problem areas (neck and chin for me).  </li>
            <li> If you need a quick and clean shave, you will not get one with this razor.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t emphasis enough how good this razor has been.</li>
            <li> I began using the Norelco 7735X Cool Skin, electric razor.</li>
            <li> After buying cheap junk, it is definitely worth the money paid.</li>
            <li> but this is an overall superior razor</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this style of shaver, my cabinets were full of electric shaver rejects.  </li>
            <li> Kind of surprising for how small it is.</li>
            <li> If my face actually adapts, I can only imagine performance being better, even though it&#x27;s already good as it is!    </li>
            <li> I worry about buying a new razor because the reviews don&#x27;t sound as good on the new ones.</li>
            <li> Well a little while ago I began searching for an electric razor to shave my head, it had to be fairly inexpensive and able to shave razor close.</li>
            <li> The razor holds a charge for weeks, which is good because you get to keep the charging cable (which is clunky and heavy) stored away most of the time.</li>
            <li> razor has no issues with being drenched and it charges up quick and holds the charge for 5-6 (head)shaves.</li>
            <li> Quickly shaved one side of my face.</li>
            <li> With that said, this is a good solid shaver at an affordable price and it&#x27;s definitely worth looking at.</li>
            <li> (TM) Panasonic Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver is a cordless razor designed for men with medium to light weight baldness on top of their head.</li>
            <li> Super Shaver.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a lithium battery which gives it more power and more time between charges, probably the only shaver under $125 to come with this battery.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace an older Panasonic (Model ES7018) that had served me well for many years.  </li>
            <li> This is only the second electric razor I have owned, so maybe it&#x27;s not saying a lot to claim it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews of many different razors I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li> Fast, light, comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> I had an ES4026 prior to this unit and it worked ok, but I like the ES8043 much better.  </li>
            <li> (TM) Panasonic Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver is a cordless razor designed for men with medium to light weight baldness on top of their head.</li>
            <li> a bit more high pitched</li>
            <li> Been using it for the past 3 weeks and seems like a very good razor.  </li>
            <li> This is an older model 8043 avoid it like the plague!!!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Panasonic linear shaver I have owned and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 other Panasonic shavers before this one, and this is by far the best bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li> , it can be charged any time you want, and it lasts a good long time and does not lose shaving speed until the battery is fully depleted.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a good long time.  </li>
            <li> I also love the fact that I can clean the shaver using any soft soap and water instead of having to buy \\&quot;special\\&quot; cleansers for an automatic gizmo than is a countertop space hog.    </li>
            <li> Overall a great product that I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this product and and even after 2 years the blades are still sharp and the battery is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my new Panasonic shaver for a month now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Panasonic and this new design is even better.  </li>
            <li> and I found that for just $15 more I could get this model brand new from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It arived in less time than given and was in great shape.</li>
            <li> Actually, its good because its about the exact width of my sideburns,</li>
            <li> It was good (dry shaver)</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for around 7-10 days worth of shaves and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> The battery life is fantastic -- on a full charge on Sunday, I can use it for a whole week without any perceptible loss of power.  </li>
            <li> Shaving dry is good ...</li>
            <li> Turbo Cleaning Mode (available on our Pivot Action Shavers) is used for quick and easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used razors most of my 60years, except when I was too young, and this shaver does the job a lot closer and faster and without the cuts!  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend dropping the dough to buy this premium jap-built peice of shaving artillery!!!  </li>
            <li> Although Panasonic insists that it may take a month to adapt to it, I feel like I&#x27;ve already gotten used to it; I think it&#x27;s because after suffering from the Norelco all this time, the Panasonic is a revelation in comparison, even on the first try!  </li>
            <li> And their return policy is within the first 30 days!  </li>
            <li> Several of the design features are very nice - very quiet, light, ergo friendly.  </li>
            <li> The razor is comfortable in my rather large hand.  </li>
            <li> I have to cover some spots 2 or 3 times to get a clean shave, but I consider that normal for an electric and the end result is comfortable and</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a good amount of time with a little light indicating when it needs recharging.</li>
            <li> Braun might work just as well as this shaver, but I have always liked Panasonic a little better.</li>
            <li> It provided a very close and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to apply cream or soup; it shaves gently and smoothly without pulling hair.</li>
            <li> Of course the real issue is the resultant tribute to a supremely close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and so far I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> nice short hair, lets bring out the Braun again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Worth it.\\</li>
            <li> Granted you&#x27;re not supposed to drive and shave, but the old razor didn&#x27;t need to be paid attention to to get all the spots, this one requires more attention than I have in the morning</li>
            <li> With the old school way of shaving, I am one to shave in the shower as I find I get a better shave.</li>
            <li> but I did not find it useful.     </li>
            <li> So I figured it was worth a try since after about 6 months</li>
            <li> This shaver is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> But using it was a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> Self-cleaning under running water (with hand soap) appears to be simple and effective.    </li>
            <li> I keep looking for some flaw in the design or function of this shaver, but I honestly can&#x27;t find any, except perhaps that my local stores don&#x27;t stock replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> I can get a very close shave, so close my beard isn&#x27;t rough, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my favorite razor by far.</li>
            <li> For the price this ES8043SC model is well worth it.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work worth a flip.    </li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the genuine Panasonic replacement blades looked exactly like the \\&quot;screen\\&quot; blade design of the first aftermarket pair.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I was always pleased with the old one, but hoping it wasn&#x27;t just a fluke...</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.    </li>
            <li> I rarely use the turbo power mode.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun too that I use for sensitive areas (neck)etc and love it also.</li>
            <li> Wet shave - good on face.    </li>
            <li> As many of you do, I love to scour reviews carefully before making a selection on anything (which is why we use Amazon).  </li>
            <li> i need to charge it more frequently.</li>
            <li> This razor is an exceptionally good razor when used wet with shaving cream or soap.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny though.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer works fine, but I do miss the one in my older model.    </li>
            <li> if the replacement parts are a litlle more than other brands, I will gladly pay it.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said elsewhere, the type of electric shaver -- rotary or foil -- that works best for you will totally depend on your skin type and your beard.</li>
            <li> it does require multiple passes to get a clean shave, but it does a better job than rotaries I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I would right now say that it rivals the Mach 3 but not quite as close in those areas.</li>
            <li> Right after I shaved it looked like I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow already.</li>
            <li> right after, I notice no change.  </li>
            <li> Man were they right.  </li>
            <li> think I made the right decision.</li>
            <li> The chin, neck, and right below your ears will take a beating.  </li>
            <li> first of all it didn&#x27;t fit in my hand very well.</li>
            <li> It pretty much is as smooth as when I use a real razor.    </li>
            <li> Using this razor was like coming home; it gives me a close, clean, fast shave (with the assistance of shaving oil)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get a decent shave from this shaver, even though I have a light beard.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver, and the first couple of times I used it its been pretty good...definitely not as close as a regular razr but for an electric one it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> Very easily it gets red bumps and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like mowing a lawn; if you keep it trimmed it is very easy to cut it the next time.</li>
            <li> the motor sound takes some getting used to, as it is a high pitched whine.</li>
            <li> , the motor&#x27;s sound makes a high whining noise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting better results in less time and with more convenience than I got with blades.</li>
            <li> These shavers provide an excellent shave either wet (with gel shaving cream) or dry.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but after testing it for almost a month I decided to return it for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> first night I used it, I had not shaved the day before (a rare occasion).</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and fast shave due to not having to go over areas more than once or twice.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for a great shave.</li>
            <li> It also has a very flexible head with comfortable spring action to reach under the chin and jawline areas for a completely smooth shave.</li>
            <li> My Norelco came with a nice leather bag and had a tight fit around my razor.  </li>
            <li> It works fine except for being very loud.  </li>
            <li> Cuts clean and comfortable, but can leave stubble if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> +Best on slightly longer hairs that are laying flat    Con:  </li>
            <li> It is important to alow your skin to get used to your new razor (about 2 weeks).    </li>
            <li> My husband loves the swift, smooth, close, once-over shave he gets with  his new Panasonic ES8043SC shaver.  </li>
            <li> Being two years old the battery is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Panasonic makes a great electric shaver, this is the second one for me in the last sixteen years.</li>
            <li> but I can easily overlook that for the performance and convenience Panasonic offers in this product.</li>
            <li> It either chews it up like cheap hamburger (back of the neck), or can&#x27;t give a smooth shave (under the chin).  </li>
            <li> The shaver was made with excellent quality - no cheap parts, has a very solid feel.  </li>
            <li> I gave this razor 3 stars because it does cut, but not as easy and gentle as older Panny models.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and the lady friend likes the extra counter space.</li>
            <li> I use wet shaving and find I can get a good close shave much faster than before.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I love this powerful yet quiet shaver.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is so much smoother and quieter and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean -- just open it up and run some water over it, no brushes or fancy docking stations required.  </li>
            <li> He had always used an old fashioned razor and found the shaver easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Just a reminder that if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.</li>
            <li> Not as close as manual razor but considering how fast and smooth the whole procedure is I am pleased overall.    </li>
            <li> Still very much acceptable.</li>
            <li> This unit isn&#x27;t difficult to use, one can recharge it quite conveniently near the sink top, comes in its own handy \\&quot;egg top\\&quot; (TM) case.</li>
            <li> This unit isn&#x27;t difficult to use, one can recharge it quite conveniently near the sink top, comes in its own handy &amp;#34;egg top&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> (Anyone remember the full size trimmers on the older models with Linear motors?</li>
            <li> This model, the ES8043, gives the same great, quick, close shave as my other Panasonics.  </li>
            <li> But the new model does look very cool and &#x60;high tech&#x27;.     </li>
            <li> By contrast, before this I owned probably a half-dozen Brauns over the years and never had one able to last longer than about 2 years before the motor would quit or the battery would die or something of that nature.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric razor for many years and have had just about every brand including some lesser know brands like Sunbeam.  </li>
            <li> After about 15 minutes, the job is pretty well done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of curious about how a rotary would perform because I ended up doing a rotary thing with mine manually.</li>
            <li> First off...</li>
            <li> Better take one last look....</li>
            <li> Panasonic first.</li>
            <li> maybe with enough time training your skin it would be better?</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to get under my jaw and around my adams apple without a lot of contortion and extra time.</li>
            <li> The last electric razor I had was a top of the line</li>
            <li> Overall, I have been quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The one downside that I can think of is that this shaver is pretty noisy.</li>
            <li> I replaced the first one once the battery eventually died.</li>
            <li> First thing I did when I received this unit</li>
            <li> After my shave, my skin got a bit irritated at first use.  </li>
            <li> This one feels very solid in the hand and the motor is powerful enough to give a good shave.    </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t abandon it, but I will buy the top of the line Norelco again next time.</li>
            <li> my 4 day growth is pretty substantial.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely satisfied, and not looking to go back to blades.</li>
            <li> I have owned many different razors in my time.  </li>
            <li> First, if this is your first electric, realize that your face is gonna be tender for a while as your not used to it.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that this thing shaves closer than the Mach 3 in some areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to a Norelco triple rotary shaver, which performs better.  </li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have defected in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I began, under the side burn, I felt absolutely no hair pull of any kind.</li>
            <li> This was my first wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> My first electric shaver was a Panasonic (that was over 15 years ago).  </li>
            <li> It then entered turbo cleaning mode, shut off and repeated this cycle until the battery was drained many hours later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also still on my first charge.  </li>
            <li> My latest one finally gave up so I decided to try this Panasonic for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They give a close shave without a burn, the blades last a long time and the floating head is great.</li>
            <li> But actually I like the Panasonics and have a ES8807 which I love.</li>
            <li> This was my first try at the linear razor from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> No expensive refills to hassle over.</li>
            <li> and they assure you will love the Panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut.</li>
            <li> Cuts about 99% of my face and 95% of my neck on the first pass.</li>
            <li> For many years now I have been using a relatively simple Panasonic ES7016 wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li> First, some background...</li>
            <li> The movable nature of the top third of the shaver doesn&#x27;t do anything for me, and I keep it locked.  </li>
            <li> I also have to make more passes over the same place to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> They shave better and last longer.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic cordless wet-dry shaver I&#x27;ve owned - the 1st one lasted 10 years - this one is even better than my 1st one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor about 2 months now, so my face is pretty well adjusted to the switch from a blade shave (Gillette Fusion).  </li>
            <li> I decided not to get anything with a charging stand or a self-cleaning system, since these appeared to be something of a nuisance, cost more, and did not add to the overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lack of an LCD screen showing remaining charge is pretty irrelevant--I might as well ask for one showing weather reports.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Now turn the power on again under the running water once more for another ten seconds</li>
            <li> Which is why I purchased it in the first place.</li>
            <li> For the first 3 weeks use in the shower with lather or sink.</li>
            <li> This is important to me as I have sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> It holds a charge today as well as it did when I first bought it (about three-four weeks).</li>
            <li> I actually think the Panasonic shaves my head better than my face.</li>
            <li> Actually, the Norelco contours your head better than the Panasonic, but the Panasonic shaves quicker and a closer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only the first day, but I&#x27;m confident I won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> That trimmer felt flimsy the first day I used it, and I knew that would be the first part to go.</li>
            <li> Funny, they say, \\&quot;give it a 30 day tryout so your face can get used to it.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I have not been happy with electric shavers in the past but sometimes want something that will give a fast shave&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Panasonic does a good job shaving, but the trimmer is only good for sideburns, it does a poor job timming mustaches.  </li>
            <li> It takes much longer to get a good shave with it if you have substantial growth to mow down.    </li>
            <li> I have only used the dry function for shaving, and it provides a great shave.</li>
            <li> I always cut my neck when I shave with blades -- and I do mean always, even using the superior Mach 3 -- and the Norelco gives me a pretty good razor burn on my neck unless I&#x27;m very careful.  </li>
            <li> but once my skin adjusted I was fine and am able to shave with it everyday....</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s product line can be broken down into three categories based on battery type -- NiCad, NiMH, and Lithium Ion with Lithium Ion being the latest and best.  </li>
            <li> -a bit more irritation (more passes)  -Hard to cut along a line (beard shaping)  -iffy sideburn trimmer (fell all the time)    </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m yet to try it wet), it still feels like shaving with a regular blade and cream(and of course without the blood-loss and irritation lol).      </li>
            <li> Gave this promising well reviewed shaver a good try (about 3 months), but it&#x27;s inability to provide a close shave, particularly in the chin and neck areas, combined with receiving frequent bleeding cuts, made me toss it into the drawer for no further use.  </li>
            <li> The wet/dry feature also allows the people to throughly clean out  the razor with soap, water and the natural rotation of the blades.    </li>
            <li> Its very fast and shaves very close</li>
            <li> I bought this one based on the positive reviews it received.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews on this shaver, I believed the consensus that you don&#x27;t need to purchase the costlier Panasonic models.</li>
            <li> I also found that once my skin adjusted, my shaving goes much quicker than it first took...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll flip up the straight blade piece and get pretty close with that.  </li>
            <li> All of them were okay, but they always took so long</li>
            <li> There is hope yet for our survival as I base my conclusion solely on the benefits of being able to finally enjoy without hassel or fear \\&quot;The Joy Of Shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This shaver is not only a great value, but it shaves extremely well for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The linear motor is far superior to other motors.  </li>
            <li> I told my wife I should give this shaver a fair chance and do my usual pre shave with my Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver is superior to any Braun shaver I have ever had in the past, and I had about 4 or 5 of those, but I would always spend a lot of money on the foils ($25-40 each).  </li>
            <li> Someone said that it was loud, and I don&#x27;t find that to be true.  </li>
            <li> The handling is very smooth and it seems to almost grip my face without a single nick.  </li>
            <li> It actually cuts better than the older models.  </li>
            <li> - Has a special high-speed mode to make cleaning blades easier  - sharp blades, strong motor,</li>
            <li> This razor does the first two significantly better than the Norelco (even when it was new) and the noise factor, while not nearly as quiet as the Norelco, is acceptable to me.  </li>
            <li> Also, the popup trimmer in the older model was much wider and more solid.</li>
            <li> and it seems to stand up to be cut better when dry.  </li>
            <li> For its good shave, low level of irritation, long battery life, and wet/dry flexibility, this razor gets 4.5* from me.  </li>
            <li> It is lighter, more delicate, and seems more &#x60;plasticy&#x27; when compared to my older model.  </li>
            <li> and it certainly prohibits multi tasking.</li>
            <li> It has a problem getting certain areas....</li>
            <li> I certainly would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I also owned a Norelco Smart Touch, but I have sent that to my son.</li>
            <li> , i would certainly buy another if i needed too.</li>
            <li> It does hold a charge for 2+ weeks, it does have a nice feel, and it doesn&#x27;t pull or yank hairs due to high speed.  </li>
            <li> I thought the Braun Advantage did a good job, but this does even better with a whole lot less mess and noise.  </li>
            <li> When your face is damp the shaver doesn&#x27;t glide across your face as easy and it is difficult to get a good shave, though I haven&#x27;t tried it yet fully lathered</li>
            <li> The cleaning/drying system is really cool looking and seems to work well, but, after the coolness wears off you&#x27;re left with a mediocre razor that makes straight edges feel like the greatest invention since television.  </li>
            <li> The hair was not only gone, but seemed to get grinded up into fine particles like dirt.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver has performed just fine for me over the last 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Out of the box, my first impression was that the ES8043 was a lot cheaper built than my older Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes have to really work hard to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves clean and close in less time than any I&#x27;ve owned, and its shape and weight makes it comfortable to use.     </li>
            <li> In wet mode with shaving gel, it is almost a match for Gillette&#x27;s vibrating razors; there is somewhat more skin irritation in this mode, but it&#x27;s not to an unusual degree.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely amazed with how close this shaver gets.  </li>
            <li> My face feels as smooth as when using shaving cream and a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic wet/dry razor out shaves them all including the highly touted Braun!</li>
            <li> It makes for a very close non-abrasive shave.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as much work rinsing an electric shaver as a blade so to me</li>
            <li> +indicator for time to replace cutting block  +best pivoting head  </li>
            <li> +Much quieter than Braun  </li>
            <li> Who wants to pay $60 for 4 months use.</li>
            <li> Nothing can quite match a straight blade, but this is without a doubt</li>
            <li> Women, if you want a real shaver, stay away from those \\&quot;for women\\&quot; shavers that look like kid toys.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the way this razor treats my neck.</li>
            <li> This dealer was very promp in sendig this shaver.</li>
            <li> I think you can depend on them, Thanks</li>
            <li> I can get my head cue ball smooth without suffering the inevitable nicks and cuts of head shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> This is the environmental stuff we really should be worried about.</li>
            <li> , it just doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> so I suspect that the product might work very well for others with straighter whiskers.</li>
            <li> Only con - cheap travel bag.</li>
            <li> This shaver shaves very close.  </li>
            <li> it works real well.</li>
            <li> It gives a much closer shave...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend said he really likes it because it shaves his face very well.  </li>
            <li> And as always Amazon provides fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t give anything close to a real razor shave, as Panasonic and some customers claim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as close as a straight blade.</li>
            <li> - It really doesn&#x27;t deliver a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Do you ever make on of those online purchases that really exceed your expectations.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic is much lighter, cleans easier, and shaves much  closer.</li>
            <li> and it makes dealing with them much easier.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a real pain to bring it along.  </li>
            <li> you see, i am really, really hairy in the crotch area.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Having an electric razor that I can use in or out of the shower has been a real treat.</li>
            <li> It is a very close shave</li>
            <li> Plus, I am getting a very close shave.</li>
            <li> am convinced that Panasonic has really come close to a blade shave.  </li>
            <li> I shave with lather and it is very confortable.  </li>
            <li> It holds a battery charge much longer than you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li> It shaves really close.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, low noise,</li>
            <li> The only complaints I have are:  1) with the cheap travel bag, which does not hold the charger.</li>
            <li> two exchanges I decided to try the norelco 8140XL (speed XL)rotaries, and while they shaved really close, they tore up my neck.</li>
            <li> They shave MUCH faster than the Braun and Norelcos.</li>
            <li> It shaves incredibly fast anyway.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> I have an unusual shaving situation.</li>
            <li> and  didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li> I expected more from Panasonic but this shaver just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> For the money spent it does an ok job.  </li>
            <li> With the ES8043SC I can do the whole job with just the shaver.</li>
            <li> but, it hasn&#x27;t really been a problem.</li>
            <li> and it is much quieter.  </li>
            <li> By comparison, the Norelco will really chew up my neck if I want to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> and they said they would send me out a stand free of charge, however 3-4 weeks later</li>
            <li> Like others, I carefully went thru many reviews before choosing to buy this shaver from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> The shaver even has a light to show you when the batteries are going low.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended in all regards!  </li>
            <li> A real eye opener.  </li>
            <li> angle(30deg)which gives a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> My hair grows fast and I just shave my head in the shower every day.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I shave against the grain on my head to get a really close shave, and this baby of a shaver does get razor close.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> I am finding out that the hair on your head grows much faster than on your face.  </li>
            <li> the shaver works really well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this thing.  </li>
            <li> Stick with the straight razors.  </li>
            <li> Something else that I really like about this razor is the way you can lock the shave head in position or switch over to one that can give and pivot with the contours you are shaving.</li>
            <li> After much work with it this morning, I felt like I had a five o&#x27; clock shadow stepping out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always shaved AFTER showering when my beard is ready.  </li>
            <li> So, after much studying these types of forums I got me a Panasonic ES8043.</li>
            <li> I will wash it out on occasion and don&#x27;t use it in the shower very often, but man is this thing durable.</li>
            <li> Only oddity is the sound it makes when running,</li>
            <li> it cut better than my old braun, ther are some areas (especially on my neck)</li>
            <li> The 360 Complete had new Gillette tech, a really cool looking foil patter, and</li>
            <li> Since he refused to shave more than 2 or 3 times a week due to his sensitive skin, I thought maybe this would be worth a try.</li>
            <li> , I thought, not buying new blades from Panasonic in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I am new to head shaving, so it took me quite a while to get a satisfactory shave the first time.  </li>
            <li> but I had an OLD Panasonic model which was right in the ball park...</li>
            <li> It cleans easily, and has a surprisingly long charge.</li>
            <li> so I looked at other shavers at a reasonable price that received better reviews and this is the item I purchased.  </li>
            <li> Braun a big name in the foil shaver market and apparently the top rated by a certain consumer mag.</li>
            <li> agree with other reviewers that the speed and pivot head are advantages; the speed in particular makes for a very comfortable and fast shave.</li>
            <li> Clean up is a snap, soap and water; none of the soaking the heads in a special cleaner and spaying down the razor like Norelco made you do.</li>
            <li> c) if you look at the product photo, the blue areas on either side of the main handle are rubber, and it feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is now squeakly clean and ready for the next shave.</li>
            <li> Close shave (I&#x27;ve used other shavers this is better) but don&#x27;t tell&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally made the jump after almost seven years with the original Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s better than the other&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this Panasonic Linear would be better than the other ones that I&#x27;ve used over the years.  </li>
            <li> I will continue buying the Panasonic over any Braun shaver, as it has been my personal experience the Panasonic is a better shaver and higher quality product for my daily shaving usage needs.</li>
            <li> There is no need for the added-expense cleaning kit, as it cleans itself with soap and water, unlike many other models.     </li>
            <li> The first one was a little better than the ES7016</li>
            <li> The original blades actually looked like blades.  </li>
            <li> many electric razors sold in the US are crippled of their multivoltage capability; counterpart models sold in other continents often do have multivoltage capability</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I find that the charge won&#x27;t last a full week, even with my fairly light beard.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the shave is fantastic -- especially if used with some pre-shave gel, it gives a very close, comfortable shave without leaving my skin dry or irritated.   </li>
            <li> Shaver noise was much quieter than my older model.</li>
            <li> I have to go over spots on my neck 4-5 times different ways to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> My beard is heavy and the results are nothing short of remarkable.</li>
            <li> The main advantage is that it provides a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> In addition the motor is sealed so you can take this in the shower (don&#x27;t tell your wife or you&#x27;ll never see it again) and can clean it with simple soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Ergonomics of the shaver are very well done, it is nice to hold, the cushion/pivoting of the shave head is neither too firm nor too soft, and overall, this is just a fantastic buy.  </li>
            <li> It is much sharper and a more modern design than previous models.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a wet shave and probably won&#x27;t, but the dry shave is really good for the price.  </li>
            <li> It cut fast, and closer than my previous Panny, much better than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> : It is fairly good shaver, that works quickly, wet or dry.    </li>
            <li> Pros  - Head flexes back and forth to makes shaver follow contour of your face  - Wet/dry operation makes it easy to clean and shave wet  </li>
            <li> I also liked the pop-up trimmer, not more cuts trying to shave my mustache.</li>
            <li> The replacement cutter and foil cost about 75% of the cost of a brand new shaver!  </li>
            <li> It is light, comfortable to use, and shaves closer than a blade in hard to get to places and almost as close elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> This razor when it was new was fast and did not require a touch up with a razor.</li>
            <li> This new shaver is much improved over the older one.  </li>
            <li> Overall, using this electric razor is far cheaper than Gillette models that rake in huge profit on their blades.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- sturdy casing, easy to hold with wet hands</li>
            <li> Decent,</li>
            <li> I have now had this particular shaver over two years.</li>
            <li> One of the main features that won me over.</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the so called \\&quot;leading\\&quot; and I might add much more expensive razors with fancy submerged cleaning attachments.</li>
            <li> I first bought it, it was pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> so I will keep mine quick and simple.    </li>
            <li> I used an electric shaver several years back, it was one of the top of the line Norelco with the incorporated gel.</li>
            <li> Feels solid, not too loud (higher-pitched motor sound, not lawn-motory).</li>
            <li> Second speed, this thing vibrates rotates at an unreal speed, giving a quick shave.</li>
            <li> but it does a decent job for the price.     </li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic linear shaver before, and it served me well for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> Above the chin was okay, but below the chin proved to be problematic as multiple passes would have to be done to clip the whiskers, causing visible skin irritation.    </li>
            <li> I have always used foil-type shavers and bought this Panasonic as an \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to my older Braun Syncro.  </li>
            <li> but it takes abt 20 minutes to get a decent shave, of course in shower.</li>
            <li> Battery seems to last longer between charges than indicated in the manual, but maybe that&#x27;s just because shaving is so quick.</li>
            <li> however it broke and this one had decent reviews</li>
            <li> Decent buzzing shaver.  </li>
            <li> Also, being able to rinse it with tap water is better than having to use expensive cleaning cartridges.  </li>
            <li> This one does a fairly decent job on the face, but once you go south of the mouth say your prayers.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s one of the main reason I buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> - Cannot shave while charging(while conn.to elect.outlet)  - Pivot head moves smoothly but feels a bit on the &#x27;loose&#x27; side(as if it will     eventually break off - time will tell)    </li>
            <li> Probably can avoid if you use shaving gel (I got lazy and just went for water, but using gel it is smooth and super close).  </li>
            <li> I actually did lightly scrape myself lightly with it on my adam&#x27;s apple on the first use due to using too much pressure on that raised area, so it&#x27;s definitely getting close and it requires a bit of technique.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> With this said, I regret not getting the cheaper ES4026 that was highly recommended by consumer reports.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to guess a high end</li>
            <li> Well placed highly responsive controls that cover all requirements.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic still lives high on my list for quality products.  </li>
            <li> Highly Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> In dry mode, it is about as good as a generic three-blade system such as that from CVS.</li>
            <li> I like that I can clean it with ordinary liquid soap and do not need to buy special cleanser.</li>
            <li> previous shaver, a Norelco, was going on the blink after many years of usage and I was keen to try out something new,  </li>
            <li> wow!!</li>
            <li> I can also shave faster with the Panasonic but the Norelco contours my face and head a little better.     </li>
            <li> More importantly, it pops out from the side whereas the trimmer on the ES8066 (and other Panasonic and Braun razors I&#x27;ve used) can be aligned with the foil and can be used at the same time as the foil cutter over your entire face.  </li>
            <li> Fired it up...and loud, MUCH louder than the Norelco, even louder than the Panny...</li>
            <li> Cons  - Sometimes need to go over area several times to get a smooth shave, but I think this is a limitation of electric shavers in general rather than a fault of this product    </li>
            <li> I do recommend it as even if you don&#x27;t use it to clean the razor, you can use it to dry it, it will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent them from rusting when air drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always shaved dry and got a clean cut with no pulls.</li>
            <li> It shaves closer than the old Panasonic, and the tilting head really does help the head follow the shape of my face.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, my skin was able to adjust.</li>
            <li> The water helps to cool the scalp because the manual hand motion and especially the electric action of the Panasonic will heat up the scalp.  </li>
            <li> but it takes a few more strokes to get around the neck.  </li>
            <li> I found its better to shave everyday and keep it trimmed.</li>
            <li> So in a nutshell, based on my experience with Panasonic shavers, you would be pleased both short and long term with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It gives a good close shave with out irritating the skin.  </li>
            <li> Besides, it&#x27;s not a hassle to grab the razor out of the medicine cabinet and make a single pass along my neck to clean up any misses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> An all seasons wet or dry duty kind of animal with respected heritage.</li>
            <li> I hope people are smart enough to read the bad reviews more than the good ones.  </li>
            <li> I kept thinking that I wasn&#x27;t using it right, but I&#x27;ve tried every direction and always end up the same.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time and it recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> However if shaving dry it is just a mundane adequate, my old Norelco was better.</li>
            <li> The shave in all areas of my face was extremely close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But now, I use the Pro Curve every other day, and it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> Without returning the Braun I got the new Panny.</li>
            <li> You can use a bit of hand soap (per the instructions) in the cleaning foils and it will lather out, then you rinse it off, and it&#x27;s like new again.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;mn now using the new 5 blade Gillette Fusion</li>
            <li> Yes, it does take time for your skin to adjust to a new razor.</li>
            <li> The instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30 days to get used to any new shaving method</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep the new one</li>
            <li> This new Panasonic</li>
            <li> I have had the new shaver for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Being fed up with the lackluster performance of the Norelcos, I decided that I needed to get a new electric razor.    </li>
            <li> so I thought I would give it a try with all the new technology,  it has been reviewed as the sharpest shave on the market.</li>
            <li> It also will not shave while plugged in, which bothers me a bit, but really isn&#x27;t an issue because it charges fast and holds a charge for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> It was a good starter electric shaver until I found out she spent $180.00 After it started to die and after replacing the heads a few times I decided to part with it.</li>
            <li> Please note that any electric razor requires at least 10 days use in order to properly condition the skin so that you can have a good shave with</li>
            <li> Actually, I couldn&#x27;t believe how close a shave it gives, better then I ever expected, since I never used an electric shavor at all before.</li>
            <li> Knowing this might happen, I was very gentle with the second razor, but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be cold without the beard, but change is good, right?      </li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this razor; apparently it gives a much closer shave than any electric razor</li>
            <li> The shaver is loud!  </li>
            <li> This is the EXACT same model as the ES8077 without the cleaning block (see my review of it under that model).</li>
            <li> First, I trimmed 1/3 of my face with a Conair trimmer and used the ES8043&#x27;s pop-up trimmer for another third.</li>
            <li> , I would guess might have achieved maybe 1/3rd the speed, and that&#x27;s probably only for the first minute or so of shaving before the battery looses a bit of its edge.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted for nearly 5-years, as battery would only last about 4-5mins after charging - I only had to replace the foil once, primarily my fault when I dropped it in the sink.  </li>
            <li> The charger kept breaking on me (once in the first month [11/2006], then another time 4 months later [3/2007]).</li>
            <li> My wife dropped my first one, I purched the same model again.</li>
            <li> So, I returned the first pair and bought a second pair, this time from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> that gives a better shave but has too small a head.  </li>
            <li> then settled for the ES8043 model which I understand is the exact same thing as the models that have the charger stand</li>
            <li> The first died only because I dropped it.  </li>
            <li> over, I wanted a shaver that could be cleaned easily with a little water and soap.  </li>
            <li> clean the excess water with a soft cloth being careful not to touch the cutter heads.</li>
            <li> I went up and down twice, with light pressure and could not believe what I saw.</li>
            <li> I rise it under tap water to clean it out after every other shave.</li>
            <li> To clean up I use a line of liquid soap along the center of the razor and turn it on under running water and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> As you can see very few cons and many pros.  </li>
            <li> I found no other brand of shaver that gave me the same close, easy shave as that early Panasonic, so I recently went for this newer model after analyzing reviews.      </li>
            <li> I ordered new replacement batteries and fixed it myself.</li>
            <li> For the past month shaving is fast and pain free again.</li>
            <li> This shaver cuts very close wet or dry, cleans easily and seems to hold a charge forever.</li>
            <li> The Braun it is replacing was half the price and worked fine for nearly five years and included a charging station.  </li>
            <li> He has used the rotary bladed kind in the past that left him with lots of irritation.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, not too big nor small.</li>
            <li> It cleans-up easily, but you have to empty the cuttings and clean the head every other or every third day.</li>
            <li> After reading numerous positive reviews, I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the razor is no more irritating and more effective than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I think the Norelco worked well when I first bought it, but the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; heads become clogged with hair fairly quickly and can be difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> What especially impresses me about the new shaver is its ability to cut neck hairs very closely.  </li>
            <li> A great little wet or dry rechargeable shaver for the money.  </li>
            <li> I love the wet dry feature, which allows me to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> I also like being able to use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Not only did it give me a much better shave than my previous rotaries</li>
            <li> I have owned several panasonic razors and thought they were much better than the Braun razor I used previously.</li>
            <li> The ergonomics of the ES8043 was very comfortable and though the shaver felt awfully delicate in my hands</li>
            <li> My second Braun would actually freeze up on my face while shaving because it just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to cut through my beard.  </li>
            <li> Comes with a cloth bag as a travel case, a little cheap.</li>
            <li> The noise level is significantly lower than my previous electric shavers, though quite a bit louder than my blades except for my weeping and wailing when I cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> It made quick work of the other side of my face as well.</li>
            <li> Sure the blades are getting dull and I should upgrade but the battery (and the blades) have paid for them</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is very good, but it takes very long to clean (2-3 hrs) and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, but it does grow a bit sideways on the neck, and this handles just as good as any other new foil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This works even better in the shower than dry, which surprised me a bit, but I guess it makes sense due to additional lubrication.  </li>
            <li> I was not particularly interested in lots of extras, just a razor that would give a very close shave, quickly and quietly.  </li>
            <li> Recently I started shaving at my gym in the morning, using a two blade disposable razor and was surprised to find that I was getting a much closer shave than with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old 8017 Panasonic Linear shaver with a fixed head with the 8043 and it blows the old model away.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver is clearly the winner hands-down on economics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 30 days now and</li>
            <li> It is loud, but that&#x27;s not a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> WOW....</li>
            <li> i guess these things are almost indestructible, but i just had to get rid of the old model b/c it was getting gunky.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet and fast.  </li>
            <li> and it gets nearly as close as a razor does.  </li>
            <li> The following review is because I found it excruciating to find an electric razor that really truly met all my needs.</li>
            <li> , 360 Complete.     </li>
            <li> I still find myself finishing my shave with my old rotary (Norelco).  </li>
            <li> This was an upgrade over a 1 1/2 year old braun.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s quite loud  -</li>
            <li> It only took about 4 shaves to really get used to using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be on a completely electric shaving system</li>
            <li> Had an old Norelco with three rotating blades and was looking for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> and she recommended using some of that old fashion shaving powder instead of a razor.</li>
            <li> I think they do a better job, at least for me.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of switching from disposable blades to this razor, you will probably be pleasantly surprised at just how close it can cut.  </li>
            <li> but I cut my shaving time considerably with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> especially on those really  humid days......</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for 1 month and find it shaves faster and closer than my old Grundig.</li>
            <li> I have curly whiskers and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Really, it&#x27;s the same.  </li>
            <li> I really like using my Panasonic shaver, this is my second one (ES8043).  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old cuss, having shaved for over 50 years, and I&#x27;ve owned every make of electric imaginable (even a Ronson).  </li>
            <li> Near the end of its blade life I have to touch up frequantly</li>
            <li> B0009DT342 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver]]</li>
            <li> After receiving the razor and trying it for about a month I was completely sold on this razor.</li>
            <li> I still prefer the old style blades and the feel of the 8066.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned nearly every shaver brand over the years</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how close it shaves.</li>
            <li> have used the shaver on beards ranging from one day to three days old.</li>
            <li> Although I cut myself once, it was only because I was using too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> Before I would shave with the electric and have to go back over everything with a razor to get even a reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li> a month old Amazon won&#x27;t accept a return either.</li>
            <li> It does not do the job nearly as well as my old ES7003 Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Has a cleaning option and it completely cleans all hair and residue off on the foil and the blades.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t need charging very often and when it does it only takes 30 min max.</li>
            <li> The motor is way too loud.</li>
            <li> My scalp is a bit lumpy, so the pivot action is a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I had no trouble getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> Today it just stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> , I shall be sticking with my old buddy.</li>
            <li> I preferred the old model&#x27;s charging stand</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer feels sturdier than my old ES8162, so</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll charge up the old ES8162, replace the blades and use another trimmer for a while.</li>
            <li> B0009DT342 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver]]</li>
            <li> was surprised how well this shaves.</li>
            <li> own beard is thick in places and the hairs themselves tend to be quite coarse.</li>
            <li> The Norelco does do a good job, don&#x27;t get me wrong here.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little noisy, and have to push hard many times to shave clean.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with my boyfriend because his face can look  and feel pretty rough, but after using this shaver his face is very soft.</li>
            <li> I did notice a big performance boost from my new razor and I am completely satisifed with the new purchase.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews, I went with the ES-8043SC, only to discover that the new shaver has the new version blades.  </li>
            <li> Fastest, middle quiet, cheapest of the bunch, able to clean itself with no special stand, and finally wet or dry capable.</li>
            <li> Since then I tried other brands, assuming that other companies who specialized in this market would have developed better performing products.  </li>
            <li> The newer version tends to shave more closely in a single pass and holds a charge for at least an entire week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  </li>
            <li> I still can shave more of my face, especially the concave areas, slightly closer with blades than this electric, but it&#x27;s close enough and faster.    </li>
            <li> +Only with full, in the shower Wet capability (not even tested...still won)  +</li>
            <li> On the other hand, in other, more fleshy areas like the neck and cheek, its not quite so close.</li>
            <li> I hand&#x27;t used it for about a week following the full recharge, but I would have expected it to retain energy when not in use.  </li>
            <li> I had several othe electric shavers in the past including a wet/dry Panasonic but this one is so much better.    </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for over a week, and recharges quickly, so that is one less thing to leave out on the counter.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on amazon for the other electronic razors I knew I made the right choice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, I highly recommend this razor based on my personal experience.</li>
            <li> I love that is sooo easy to clean, which was one of the things I hated in my last electric.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8043SC wet/dry shaver has met my expectations - set rather high from prior reviews.</li>
            <li> Who knows, they may design a shaver that operates at such a high rpm rate that you just have to hold it up to your face and it will sonically(is that a word?)</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s because it just has such high rpm.</li>
            <li> The slide up trimmer was excellent for those difficult neck hairs that lay down flat to the skin.</li>
            <li> Blades just cost too much right now, and they don&#x27;t last long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Dry shaves are ordinary and not really any better than many other razors--but</li>
            <li> It is easy to recharge and clean and does not require expensive refills on lotions and such to use.</li>
            <li> My first wet shave electric razor</li>
            <li> This thing shaves at least as close as my blades (Gillette Sensor Excell), with more consistent results and less chance of cuts.  </li>
            <li> I always enjoyed Braun razors, but their foils wear out quick and they&#x27;re expensive to replace!</li>
            <li> When the battery on my last one would no longer hold a charge, I decided to try something new, and purchase this Panasonic wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> They say to give it 30 days for your face and beard to acclimate to the new shaver, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to be necessary.  </li>
            <li> I am expecting the new one I bought to last about 2 to 3 years.    </li>
            <li> I was dismayed to find that the new blades were totally different than the originals on the 8066.      </li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic after trying out a new braun to replace my last one.  </li>
            <li> Easier to clean and can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Can be used wet or dry, and is a snap to clean.</li>
            <li> At least for my face, and the way I shave, the side-to-side tilt is much more helpful, especially for the chin, neck and moustache areas.  </li>
            <li> If I have any complaints they are the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a digital display to let you know how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if I wet my face maybe 5 minutes before I launch the Panasonic it really helps, because just electric on bone-dry doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> how much charge remains and the razor will charge up in 5-10 minutes sufficient to do a single shave.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with the skin irritation and the shave is much closer than I ever remember going around in circles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Folks, this shaver has produced an EXTREMELY close shave, with no irritation at all, and no uncomfortable pulling sensation that Norelco&#x27;s \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; method sometimes produces.</li>
            <li> Follows every curve, no sharp edges.</li>
            <li> MAJOR advantage is that it cleans with soap and water...</li>
            <li> So here we are in 2008 and found myself struggling to shave without major touch ups with a disposal blade.</li>
            <li> I have a $10.00 shaver purchased from a major drug store (advertised \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> I usually shave right after I take a shower, and my old Braun wouldn&#x27;t cut cleanly until I fully dried off.</li>
            <li> Sharp, close shaving, pivot head, easy clean, holds a long charge, less expensive than a number of other razors, I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Another plus is that the main shaving head is maybe 20% wider than other models that I&#x27;ve used, and much wider than an earlier Panasonic wet/dry that I had - helps me shave my face in fewer passes.      </li>
            <li> If there are any missed spots I usually shave them after the shower to clean my head up.</li>
            <li> I continued to use the old, original blades for another two years, (removing them daily and keeping them stored under a small pyramid</li>
            <li> I generally get about 4-5 face and head shaves on a charge.  </li>
            <li> it did not irritate my face in the least and my face and neck were smooth like when I shaved with the bladed razors.</li>
            <li> I used a cheap Norelco in the past, and think I&#x27;m going back.</li>
            <li> clear of this device unless you have stubble like a porcupine, it&#x27;s like French kissing jaws.  </li>
            <li> THIS SHAVER IS QUIET AND CUTS LONG HAIR VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning on this was also harder as the rotary area wasn&#x27;t very streamlined.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Speed: For my old shaver, I had to take several passes, and yet still missed stubs here and there.</li>
            <li> It does take fewer passes than my old norelco, but overall it seems like a slower but closer shave.</li>
            <li> Earlier Panasonic models I&#x27;ve owned were not as loud, and I would not recommend this model to anyone.</li>
            <li> So I took it back and got the Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver.  </li>
            <li> Also as an added bonus, my wife says that it&#x27;s gently enough for her to allow me to shave her \\&quot;sensitive</li>
            <li> No complaints so far after 2 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> Only maintains a charge for 3 shaves and then is completely discharged.</li>
            <li> Finally, when the screen on the 8066 developed a hole, I was faced with a choice.  </li>
            <li> Shaving wet is where this razor really shines.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace an old Panasonic wet/dry shaver when it finally died.  </li>
            <li> In any case, I was amazed three years ago by the ES8162, which shaved so close it almost hurt my skin if I was not careful.</li>
            <li> I had an old model of Panasonic shaver which provided me with 7 years of service until the battery died recently.</li>
            <li> For those with heavy, thick set beards, full of skin scruff and fleas, this works wonders after a few moments in the warm shower with a cream of pea soup nearby.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too.</li>
            <li> For those with heavy, thick set beards, full of skin scruff and fleas, this works wonders after a few moments in the warm shower with a cream of pea soup nearby.</li>
            <li> It truly is a different product with its extremely fast cutting head and it shaves very closely, very quickly and with almost no pressure.   </li>
            <li> Panasonic just released several new shavers such as the  Panasonic ES-LA63-S</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for few days, and I&#x27;ve used it both dry and with a light lather of shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> This new shaver is better than the first and less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer tells you to shave with it for a month before you rate the results; they say that is how long it takes your face to get use to a new shaving system.  </li>
            <li> Came with a nice little hard case for travel.</li>
            <li> I use it dry, right after my shower, but wet the neck area, this seems to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the blades seem to be really fine</li>
            <li> It cuts much closer than any other shaver I have owned and it even gets the hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Granted, they do say this has the sharpest blades in the market, but do we really need them to be soooo sharp that they cut skin??    </li>
            <li> The speed and sharp blades make fast work out of anything.</li>
            <li> Expectations duly lowered, I turned the shaver on, was momentarily surprised by the high frequency buzz that comes with 13,000 oscillations a minute, and ran the shaver down my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is sad because my neck is the most sensitive part to shave.</li>
            <li> Floating heads with firm or soft ride really make the difference where the linear activated blades meet the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I had been using an older Panasonic fixed head wet-dry shaver in the wet mode for several years, but the battery finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and a job that requires me to have a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> My skin was a little irritated at first</li>
            <li> A little \\&quot;warm\\&quot; feeling the first week.     </li>
            <li> I had a little irritation on my neck the first time, but none since.  </li>
            <li> Doing away with tiny brush cleaning is a major advance for those of us who have dexterity problems.  </li>
            <li> Buying new replacement blades only worked for so long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t, at least so far when I inspect the blades right before doing this and</li>
            <li> This quickly changed, and after only about 10 shaves, it is taking me no more than five minutes.  </li>
            <li> The motor is fast yet quiet, and using the cleaning mode with a little dab of hand soap is much more appealing and convenient than needing/using the base station (bulk) and cleaning fluid ($$$) -- especially for travel.</li>
            <li> Starting way back when I was 14 years old I shaved strictly with bladed razors of various brands and styles.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s long gone, I still prefer my old ES-8066.</li>
            <li> I have a long, angular face, and the skin on my neck tends to be quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> After that first round I was done.</li>
            <li> Upon my first few weeks this thing tore up my face as the manual stated might happen...  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter and doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as past panasonic razors I&#x27;ve owned, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Caution: for the first few times you use this, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to have something like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver about a month and a half ago based largely on the reviews.</li>
            <li> It seems to give a closer shave dry, although if shaving in a steamy bathroom or hot hotel room, wet is the only way to go.    </li>
            <li> I used it both wet and dry and the results were pretty similar.</li>
            <li> This particular shaver, I purchased from Amazon about a year ago after having tried other Panasonic shavers.  </li>
            <li> this is to be expected, as all new shavers cause the razor burn problem that ususally goes away after a month or so of use.  </li>
            <li> The on/off button is right where my thumb usually rests, and I continually switch it off accidentally.    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a leightweight cheap little thing that should sell for about $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not $79.99!!!</li>
            <li> My previous Panasonic razor would have cost almost as much just for the foil and cutter replacements.</li>
            <li> Dry works better for me because it is less time consuming and not so messy with the dripping shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The heads don&#x27;t pivot up and down as much as the Braun, but once again, time will tell if this is necessary.</li>
            <li> I usually shave dry, but other reviewers say shaving with soap is even better.  </li>
            <li> That said, this shaver is on the large side and it&#x27;s a little pricey,  </li>
            <li> It works extremely well both wet and dry, although I have come to prefer dry as I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I researched electric shavers thinking I could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer.</li>
            <li> The main difference is the 13K-rpm motor which is much quieter with less vibration and noise than my previous shavers, plus the blade</li>
            <li> The lithium battery is likely to last much longer than the previous ni-cad units.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that you can if you want use a little shaving cream while you shave.</li>
            <li> For those of you who have never used an electric razor, this style of razor (linear) gives a much closer shave than the 3 blade rotor razors at the cost of a little comfort.  </li>
            <li> and it takes me a little while to do my whole face.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s due for some new blades.</li>
            <li> It took him a little while to get used to using it, but now he shaves nearly every day!!!</li>
            <li> if you hold down the power button for a few seconds, it turns the motor on in &#x27;ultrasonic&#x27; mode for about 10 seconds, which is supposed to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li> So, I am raving about his product, but every good has its bad...</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of the long charge time necessary to get a full charge for it to last a few days worth of shaves.</li>
            <li> I echo the previous reviewer who rated this product highly for head shaving.  </li>
            <li> Either buy a new $32 screen for a seven year old shaver with tired blades, or buy a new shaver for $72.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I did notice that it was a little red the first few times using it-</li>
            <li> It sucked off the cream like a vacuum.</li>
            <li> It is considerably louder than some other rotary shavers</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 of these, the last for less than 1 1/2 years, and in both cases, one of the clips that hold the top part of the razor on has broken off, so that the screen pops off constantly.</li>
            <li> Then I bought a rotary shaver of other brand on Black Friday which was cheap but has less power, I returned it.</li>
            <li> So after about a year and a half I bought a new razor.</li>
            <li> the idea of getting a faster shave with less irritation and less blood loss has gotten me interested enough to purchase several shavers.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, I would say that I have an average beard growth on an average face.</li>
            <li> I got an electric shaver to prevent in grown hairs and so far its been doing an above average job.</li>
            <li> They can also be broken down based upon number of foils in which some have dual shaving foils, this one has three, and panasonic&#x27;s latest shavers have four.      </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound too down on the Norelco, it just was slow, imprecise and didn&#x27;t cut as close...</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s pretty hard to get a shaver made in Europe, USA or Japan).</li>
            <li> value.[[ASIN:B000GRZBU6 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet Dry Shaver]]</li>
            <li> I finally grew tired of the endless circling necessary to get a clean shave...and this circling often led to irritation, especially on my neck, and occasionally in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li> Given all the positive reviews, this one was worth a shot, but was disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to tell if the Panasonic will last as long as a Braun.  </li>
            <li> It just does not pick up hairs that lay flat against your neck.  </li>
            <li> Obviously a strange comparison that teases the mind for further explanation.</li>
            <li> The razor foil on this model is supposed to last for a relatively long time.</li>
            <li> This is because of how flat heads are compared to faces.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick and curly and I suspect that it&#x27;s just tricky to get it to go through the foil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the other major brands over the years</li>
            <li> but it is not a major problem.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like many other rechargeable products, unless you leave it on the charger 24/7, don&#x27;t expect to shave the second time.</li>
            <li> Simple to clean up with just soap and water unlike the Braun which uses expensive cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li> However after trying various shaving conditions with this razor, I use it when I am completely dry.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m dry shaving with this razor daily and have no irritation.</li>
            <li> and it works well enough with a dry face.</li>
            <li> bought this as a replacement unit for my old Braun 5550, which after a few years of use has finally died.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to get to certain places on a face.     </li>
            <li> But after owning 4 electric shavers the Norelco being the only other shaver I used on a daily basis this shaver blows them all out of the water.</li>
            <li> There are a number of other models in the same series, such as the 8044.</li>
            <li> After several attempts at both dry and wet shaving, cream, no cream etc.. it missed the hair on my neck but repeatedly managed to give me nicks and cuts around the corners of my mouth and upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer in back is small, and I&#x27;d prefer it to be in front, but it&#x27;s sharp and works very well keeping my sideburns in check.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud, but it&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I am very prone to ingrown hairs, so regular razors and \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; electrics are not good for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely money well spent.</li>
            <li> Happily it&#x27;s as solid a product as I expected.</li>
            <li> -Holds the charge long</li>
            <li> The old razor was one with the three round heads.     </li>
            <li> It has a lithium ion battery, so you can charge it anytime without worry of getting \\&quot;battery memory\\&quot; issues like nickel cadmium, or nickel metal hydride batteries can develop, when the batteries are not completely depleted before recharging.  </li>
            <li> For a long time I&#x27;d been telling myself that the electric was \\&quot;just as good\\&quot; as a blade.</li>
            <li> I found no hair pulling whatsoever - even against long hairs under my chin.</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> Was a long time</li>
            <li> They want the shaver sent back to their customer service center.  </li>
            <li> how long I spend trying to get it all off.</li>
            <li> I did give 2 stars intead of 1 because it eventually does give a close shave and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> (I only used it for wet shaving.)</li>
            <li> However, this is a minor inconvenience and not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A minor drawback.   </li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t remember it lasted so long)</li>
            <li> I look forward to having this shaver a long time.  </li>
            <li> The models differ in terms of minor features.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t matter how long I go between shaves -</li>
            <li> Long battery life.    </li>
            <li> how long it will go.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> A strange paradox here.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll have to see how long it can keep this up.</li>
            <li> As long as you use it \\&quot;wet\\</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because the final product was just as I&#x27;d expected.  </li>
            <li> First cleaning is a snap, no messy expensive alcohol cleaners, just soap and water.</li>
            <li> I finally got fed up for the third time when the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t stay in the down position.</li>
            <li> This razor does such a better job at not leaving uncut wiskers, especially on my neck where my wiskers tend to curl a little and gave other electrics fits.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Panasonic wet &amp; dry shavers and have used an ES8066 for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on the new 8043 is situated at a crazy angle, and is not as useful as the one on the 8066.  </li>
            <li> It take me five solid minutes to shave with this thing because the main blades do such a poor job on the neck area that I have to use the trimmer on this \\&quot;tough\\&quot; spot.</li>
            <li> The foil assembly frame is constructed of what appears to be very thin and cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet also, not like some other noisy razors in comparison.  </li>
            <li> The instructions sort of plead with the buyer to \\&quot;give it a month\\&quot; to develop a personal technique and somehow let your scalp and the razor get to know each other.</li>
            <li> Especially if you like to shave every day, or every other day.  </li>
            <li> I only shave every other day.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine needing the cleaning station that comes with other packages of this same razor.  </li>
            <li> The other big difference is that the shaving head tilts from side-to-side.  </li>
            <li> this is the second one i got, the other one was a norelco</li>
            <li> On the other hand, having a simple cord is easier when you travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s used every day for the face and every other for the head and lasts an entire week on one charge.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Now the battery isn&#x27;t holding a charge very long anymore</li>
            <li> I also like that this shaver holds a charge for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> The only down side I can see is that the battery does not last quite as long as some other shavers.</li>
            <li> If you get a lot of shaving irritation dry shaving, you can try some of the thicker soaps or shaving gels or try shaving while you are in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Dry</li>
            <li> Dry shave.</li>
            <li> I use this thing totally dry</li>
            <li> crack, flake, dry, or come unglued from the shaver.</li>
            <li> I use it dry.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t dry shave</li>
            <li> Dry shave on neck - alright.    </li>
            <li> I tried it dry a couple of times</li>
            <li> Dry</li>
            <li> I tried this shaver with shaving cream and tried it dry.  </li>
            <li> The last one has just cracked after only a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t been able to get the blades off of the 8043, and I&#x27;m afraid if I try any harder</li>
            <li> and so I focused on Braun and Panasonic as I believe neither sell a product that did not live up to their brand name.</li>
            <li> Hmm quieter than the last...subconsciously thought might not live up.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 30 days now, and I will not live without it.</li>
            <li> After more than a decade with a pair of Norelco razors I had grown tired of the almost constant skin irritation on my neck and the pulling sensation I got when the batteries were wearing down or the heads were going dull.  </li>
            <li> I have used every single type of razor out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type and from the one blade to the 5+1 blade.</li>
            <li> I have also found that irritation has increased slightly in the past few weeks which, as I stated earlier, wasn&#x27;t a problem for the first five months or so.  </li>
            <li> it is such a simple device for a simple task, that anything less than \\&quot;works perfectly\\&quot; seems like a wasted purchase.    </li>
            <li> ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry shaver is a down grade from their previous models.</li>
            <li> the trimmer on this model is only about 50% as wide as on other models I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> looked at the Panasonic&#x27;s model that came with a charger and the cleaning &#x27;thingamajig&#x27; and decided it was not worth the extra 40-50 bucks.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old Panasonic shaver could be placed vertically on a small charging stand.</li>
            <li> but I take off the thin screen after each shave and run really hot water over the blades and through the screen</li>
            <li> I use it wet only...if this shaver hold up for the long run, I will never use a blade again.</li>
            <li> I have had less expensive, single head panasonic shavers in the past that I liked.  </li>
            <li> When the blades began to dull, I ordered new ones from an aftermarket company on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is the noise, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I still have the occasional hair that will lay down and not get cut, for that I still use my thirty cent Bic.</li>
            <li> I weeded down my choices to a Braun at the same price level and the Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> really sucks is that I sent it to Panasonic for replacement (30 day trial period was up by just two weeks), and after 2 weeks, they notified me that replacements were on back order and not due in for 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Since it seems to work much like a conventional razor, you do have to draw it slowly accross your skin.</li>
            <li> As soon as I did a dry head shave with the Panasonic I could see the difference!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic does provide a smoother shave with much less irritation--I have yet to experience red neck.  </li>
            <li> I tend to use this razor dry, however it works well wet also.  </li>
            <li> for this razor I like  - wet dry use  - speed of charging and length charge is held  - fits my hand</li>
            <li> I have two Panasonic shavers and one Norelco wet dry.      </li>
            <li> Not only was the neck a problem but the overall shave was no better.</li>
            <li> Works well in wet or dry conditions.</li>
            <li> Which is the only reason I had to replace my previous Panasonic&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Works both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> It only takes about a half hour to charge.  </li>
            <li> Works well both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this has been a simple evaluation but none the less one that has passed all tests with ease.</li>
            <li> I had a different model previously that cost $200 and shaved quicker with a wider blade</li>
            <li> My previous shaver was also a Panasonic, and it finally gave out after almost 10 years.</li>
            <li> It may be that it&#x27;s just different from my previous shaver, and hopefully I&#x27;ll get used to it.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different brands of shavers in the past.</li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;d do this with a regular razor in front of a mirror; invariably I&#x27;d nick myself, and the cleanup was a hassle.</li>
            <li> the unit is actually quieter than my previous Panasonic.</li>
            <li> But like I said those are minor complaints I now overlook due to the fact</li>
            <li> Hope this lasts as long as the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for a few years, and the expense of quality disposable blades, along with the mess of water and shaving gels and the like, well, it was getting really old.    </li>
            <li> It takes a little longer than using disposables - maybe 20 minutes in total.  </li>
            <li> Despite the fact that it takes a little longer and requires some mirror-maintenance at the end, I can&#x27;t bring myself to go back to disposables - and it&#x27;s not because of the cost savings.  </li>
            <li> In fact, they didn&#x27;t work as well as the old dull blades in the 8066, which I re-installed.      </li>
            <li> To start I have very sensitive skin on my neck, the hairs lie very flat as well there...and my beard hair is freaking tough.</li>
            <li> This foil shaver cuts closer with a single pass than any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It gave me a pretty bad razor burn and did not get all the hairs; I ended up having to shave as normal.</li>
            <li> So as much as I like the shaver I am sending it back and keeping my ugly and noisier old Braun that can keep going for over a week on one charge.</li>
            <li> manufacturers use a multitude of intentionally confusing model numbers in order to sell the same razors to different \\&quot;marketing</li>
            <li> If and when I wet shave</li>
            <li> to even get it slightly wet anywhere  </li>
            <li> (Only used it a few times)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wet</li>
            <li> Ability to shave wet is a plus.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the wet shaving capabilities.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not fast.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve just spent $40 and get a Remington.</li>
            <li> I always heard the mantra that you can never get a close a shave as with a wet shave, well you can wet shave with this thing, and its as close as any blade...</li>
            <li> I have bought a few of these -- for different homes I have.</li>
            <li> I have been a wet shave, blade guy forever..</li>
            <li> For a few years I tried a couple different Norelco razors and they did not cut it.  </li>
            <li> The blade and screen are expensive but it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> I recommend for repairs or parts the Appliance Repair Center in San Francisco.</li>
            <li> This wet/dry razor with a few drops of shave oil gives me the closest shave ever inside or outside the shower.</li>
            <li> I wet my face and head in the shower and shave.</li>
            <li> Like all electric shavers, the foil dulls after about four months and should be replaced.  </li>
            <li> Wet shave on neck -</li>
            <li> But once I tried it wet, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> &quot; on my mug and a few minutes later make a few passes over my entire face.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a blade for the past few years and the first few weeks after going electric again</li>
            <li> a hundred bucks later and a few emergency room-esq gashes on my neck have taught me my lesson.  </li>
            <li> No unusual nooks or crannies and average to slightly above average beard growth.</li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> (wet) but is pretty useless dry.  </li>
            <li> This shaver, the ES8043 - felt like a downgrade from the ES8162 plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I can live with the so-so shave quality but this hair pulling is ridiculous and something that I have never had with other shavers.  </li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve finally gotten a clean shave, it&#x27;s cut my skin so it bleeds as bad as if I used a blade.</li>
            <li> Purchased this shaver after spending a year desperately wanting to like my Norelco, which gave me razor burn on my neck, and was a pain to clean, not to mention a not very close shave after a month of replacing the heads.</li>
            <li> This model was about half the price of my last Panasonic, and for me it shaves half as close.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it doesnt come with any kind of stand, which is odd since the base of the shaver is tapered and not very stable, you&#x27;d think they would have included one.... especially since the foils on these things are so fragile, getting knocked over is usually how they get knicks.  </li>
            <li> My only hesitation in giving this five stars is that, after six months, the foil feels a little duller, and thus it is taking slightly longer to shave.  </li>
            <li> (The only decline has been in the battery life, which is now down to just a few days before it must be recharged.)  </li>
            <li> I am a Manager at my job and on my last annual review the only item I was marked bad was my personal appearance.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station itself is unnecessary; every model has a high speed cleaning mode and can be cleaned up with liquid soap and water.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is one of few manufacturers that allow for wet dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> This is based on 3 other panasonic models to compare.  </li>
            <li> -Pop-up trimmer is sharp  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Panasonic cameras and other electronics</li>
            <li> It usually takes several passes to get all the hairs, but it will shave virtually as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> me yet, like a couple other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried have.  </li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first, but after reading a couple of reviews decided to try.</li>
            <li> My husband owned another Panasonic shaver that lasted for over 10 years with nary a problem other than foil and blade replacement.  </li>
            <li> He does not recommend the purchase of this shaver and if other Panasonic models are similarily constructed, he would not purchase any of those.    </li>
            <li> Get this one like the other reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with it and use it every other day with no problems.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before deciding on this shaver.  </li>
            <li> The speed of the motor seems to be the biggest difference between this and other electrics</li>
            <li> Since I have always used an electric razor, I did not require any \\&quot;adjustment\\&quot; time as other have indicated they needed.</li>
            <li> Provides a close shave and have not had irritation or bumps that i have had with other shavers (Braun).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it shaved any closer than the Panasonic anyway, so the extra thinness is just a pointless marketing thing.    </li>
            <li> This electric shaver does work, but its outside finish and design is not appropriate to an eighty bucks price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s louder than other shavers, but who cares?</li>
            <li> I have owned Braun and Remington shavers, as well as other Panasonics.  </li>
            <li> After 2 months I still get razor burn and have be careful when going against the grain because this baby will burn you!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- multi-voltage charger (can be used in other</li>
            <li> the other hand, I had no problems at all with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> and I am extremely impresed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Razor Shopper Beware:&lt;br /&gt;- cleaning systems are a marketing gimmick, they do not clean any better than soap and water; the alcohol and chemicals used in cleaning systems can in fact be bad for your skin</li>
            <li> Until it is broken in which takes a few weeks, I use my previoius Panasonic for certain trim areas.  </li>
            <li> One caution: if you press too hard, it is still possible to nick your self with this shaver, but pressure really is not needed to achieve a close shave.  </li>
            <li> It charges in less than an hour and has a charger that supports world wide voltage for charging when traveling.    </li>
            <li> I used to own one of the Remington triple foil microscreens but the stupid screens were so thin and flimsy that holes would show up within a couple months of use and replacing those screens at $25 a pop was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this shaver has the other one beat hands down.</li>
            <li> For the price and the regular cleaning, I would expect the foil to remain sharp for at least a year.      </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s also substantially louder than other electric razors.</li>
            <li> Well mostly...one spot stayed a little rough</li>
            <li> My Grandfather has a hard time with regular blades</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that this model doesn&#x27;t have a battery bar to gauge remaining charge life.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, picked up the wonky hairs.</li>
            <li> There are only three slightly negative things I can say, but none are deal breakers:</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin, especially under my neck.</li>
            <li> I have bought and used at least 4 different brands of electric shavers over the years.</li>
            <li> I have an average beard.</li>
            <li> And the narrow end of the 8043 makes it extremely unstable standing on the counter among the other appliances when not plugged in.    </li>
            <li> one complaint is that the newer shaver does not have a charging stand; you simply plug the cord into the bottom of the shaver to recharge.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is that it does not come with a carrying case for travel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this electric razor because I was tired of putting all the chemicals on my face when shaving with a old school razor.</li>
            <li> And I have a thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have had two of them and both ended up breaking down.</li>
            <li> and I would say that this shaver beats my Braun 8995 in terms of closeness hands down.</li>
            <li> This product broke down write after one year.</li>
            <li> I just got this shaver, but I&#x27;m guessing that down the raod the rubber is going to wear,</li>
            <li> Outdoes the 8043 hands down.</li>
            <li> , that is--to tone down my barbarianness as needed.  </li>
            <li> , I have no first hand knowledge!).  </li>
            <li> I currently get approximately twenty shaves out of a single charge.</li>
            <li> Recently I just got tired of long lasting procedure of manual shaving, burning sensation aftermath, red bumps, and buying cream and expensive blades over and over.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to shave dry from past Braun experience and this is no problem with this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> It does not give you a close shave and cuts other parts of your head unevenly.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of shave oil in the palm of my wet hand and rub my face and head (except the bald part!).</li>
            <li> Its only negative is that it is a little slower than others I have used and requires repeated passes to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I ended up not shaving it regularly due to the trouble</li>
            <li> The only slight complaint is the noise level - a little noisier than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can find wrong with this shaver is it is a little difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> I get less irritation.</li>
            <li> previously I had a norelco that lasted for something like 8 years.</li>
            <li> it takes longer to shave with than my previous model  </li>
            <li> I also prefer the induction recharging method as it has less moving and connecting parts and therefore has less things to break.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used shavers in the past, but the shave never seemed to last past noon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just less of a hassle to grab this thing, get the job the done, and move on.  </li>
            <li> I previously used a Braun, serviceable though unspectacular.</li>
            <li> Previous electrics I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> Less \\&quot;burns\\&quot; than the Norelco and zero nicks.   </li>
            <li> Give your face a week or two to get used to the electric, if you were previously using a blade.</li>
            <li> Despite it being less than</li>
            <li> It is cheaper in construction and poorer in design than my previous Panasonic.</li>
            <li> My previous model was the Panasonic ES8162</li>
            <li> This trimmer is around half the width of the trimmer on the ES8066.  </li>
            <li> Sorry for the gory details, but they are necessary to adequately contrast this razor.    </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t shave every day and a half I look like a barbarian, a full beard in two weeks.      </li>
            <li> My last electric, a Remington rotary razor, was not nearly as good to me.</li>
            <li> but I think a little less close than a Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li> The floating head is a little odd as it rotates side-to-side and not front-to-back.  </li>
            <li> I have used several high end electric razors before and always been really disappointed in the rough and uneven result.  </li>
            <li> Very little irritation, certainly less than with other electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have kept this razor too long to send it back.</li>
            <li> At the time I purchased this product, it was the first least expensive panasonic shaver that had Lithium Ion batteries, triple blade shaving, and a 13,000 rpm linear motor.      </li>
            <li> I have to make a ton of passes to get the hairs (leading to a bit of irritation) and I typically end up missing a bunch and having to do touch-up with my Mach3.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t get a shaver with a fancy cleaning system - lotions and base - since this cleans so easily with liquid soap and running water.</li>
            <li> This guy was a little heavier than expect.</li>
            <li> A little louder than I&#x27;m accustomed from an E Razor.  </li>
            <li> I have now had the shaver a little over 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Granted, the skin is a little sore after the shave,</li>
            <li> I use a little splash of \\&quot;Williams Lectric Shave\\</li>
            <li> /&gt; - I can put a little shaving cream on the razor itself and it seems to help get a closer shave &lt;</li>
            <li> Not sure about other models</li>
            <li> I noticed my face would be a little sore after shaving.  </li>
            <li> It cuts close with little irritation to the face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two different Brauns, but the motors were just too weak.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re desperate to get away from straight edged razors.  </li>
            <li> -Heavy    </li>
            <li> I tried different ways of shaving and they all gave me poor results.</li>
            <li> If you shave your head don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this shaver.</li>
            <li> so close that I&#x27;ve gotten a few nicks from it.</li>
            <li> After spending over $80, what I got was a flimsy cheap plastic Chinese-made crap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it now for a few weeks and used it a handful of times.  </li>
            <li> Charging is required every few shaves.  </li>
            <li> have read a few reviews saying they could not get a close shave or it cut their face.</li>
            <li> and I have always had trouble getting all the hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a deal breaker by far, but I understand why one of those slightly expensive automatic shaver cleaners would work well.    </li>
            <li> The problem only got worse.</li>
            <li> As with all electrics, you will have to \\&quot;chase around\\&quot; a few stray hairs.</li>
            <li> There were still some missed hairs that required shaving over again, but not as frequent or as uncomfortable as the Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> So, ordered the ES8043SC and have been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, your scalp and face will get used to it ...</li>
            <li> It took another few days for my Panasonic ES8043SC to arrive, so I continued to use my Norelco to shave my head.</li>
            <li> Because of the speed of the Panasonic I can shave everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d call my beard fairly heavy</li>
            <li> And this one has the same performance as the Panasonics that cost over twice as much, if you don&#x27;t need the cleaner base, which I never used when I did have one.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing the Panasonic ES8043SC over other Panasonic and Braun models because of various benefits, including the wet/dry ability and being able to wash the cutting blade and foil by using just liquid soap and a little water instead of the cleaning base with expensive fluid cartridges.    </li>
            <li> The battery lasts at least 5 days without a re-charge or slowing down even a little.  </li>
            <li> (and I have a very thin beard and shave only every other day)</li>
            <li> This shaver will shave my reasonably tough beard close in three minutes, including cleanup time, and it will do a mean \\&quot;three-dayer\\&quot; in only a little longer.  </li>
            <li> I had little control over where it cut and it was hard to address the little problem areas.</li>
            <li> Con:  -Lousy soft vinyl case  -weird plug design...have to look when plugging in for charging  -same brand as before    </li>
            <li> I remember this from past electric shavers, is that it does take a few weeks for your face to get used to an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> it will burn you raw trust me.</li>
            <li> If your thinking about the other more expensive Panasonic model with the base charger/cleaner, don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> and I had to replace the shaver with a new model from Panasonic (the ES8249S, which showed itself to be a disappointing replacement).</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that complained about the noise that it makes, however I find that this one is quieter than my previous one.</li>
            <li> The base on the older version gave you a place to keep your shaver dry and made charging an automatic.  </li>
            <li> There is very little irritation when using the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of growth this device loses some of its effectiveness, but the price I pay for lazy weekends...    </li>
            <li> The one small drawback is the plug on the charging cord.</li>
            <li> One of the big negatives is that it is difficult to shave around the neck line.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that you can&#x27;t use ot while it&#x27;s pluged in since it&#x27;s a wet/dry razor so once the battery dies it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> It has a flashing LED that tells you when the unit needs charged, and usually there&#x27;s ample time to finish your shave, and then plug it in to charge when you&#x27;re done.    </li>
            <li> - I like the wet/dry feature since I usually shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> I will usually jack up the volume on tv and do my shaving on the floor in front of an armchair.    </li>
            <li> Shaves as close as any shaver I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually slap on some shaving gel before I shave.  </li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts or blood which always happened with any razor blade up to 3 blades in the past.</li>
            <li> I find that it cuts well if I wait no more than three days between shavings.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going back to expensive blades and blood in the sink...</li>
            <li> Although I do have small hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors for past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> Never having owned a shaver with a pivoting head, I was skeptical, but it actually improves the shave.    </li>
            <li> not sure if I like the \\&quot;side</li>
            <li> I found that Panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced and had all the features the expensive models had.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- shaves-per-second, vibrations per second: these are meaningless statistics that are almost marketing fraud</li>
            <li> They usually die after about 3 years because of battery problems.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $100!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is small and lighweight, and contours to your hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two linear shavers over the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> The only down side to this shaver (IMHO) is that the trimmer forces me to put my hand in an awkward position to use it.</li>
            <li> (I shave at the very least every other day, usually every day).</li>
            <li> The razor gave me about 20 shaves after the initial charge, but after the 2nd I got about 5 before it was drained - an annoying surprise on a business trip.  </li>
            <li> With the Norelco, pushing hard to get curved hairs always caused burns or small nicks, but that does not happen with this one.  </li>
            <li> Hard Case for storage    </li>
            <li> Having owned an electric razor before I don&#x27;t find this hard on my skin at all as some have reported.</li>
            <li> Even the \\&quot;hard to get to spots\\&quot; are no problem once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> The on botton is indented which makes it hard to find in the shower.</li>
            <li> -Least close shave  -longest time to shave  -those</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably quit using this and go back to a regular razor, but I get awful razor burn on my neck from using a straight razor that I don&#x27;t get nearly as bad with this item.</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint</li>
            <li> While it may not be quite as close as a shave, at least it doesn&#x27;t take 10 minutes and need a styptic pencil to stop the bleeding.</li>
            <li> lately it was the Norelco Speed series.</li>
            <li> This gives me the least irritation I have user had, and after using it for a while, there is NO irritation.      </li>
            <li> I also find it clumsy to use.  </li>
            <li> However, this seems to be a common complaint of electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> at least mine did.</li>
            <li> Extremely inconvenient if you lose the charge in the middle of a morning shave!  </li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t dismiss me as being too negative...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too late -- they already lost me as a customer</li>
            <li> It makes about as much sense as having a Sonicare toothbrush that had a plug in the end rather than a charging base.  </li>
            <li> If your worried that your beard is too thick, don&#x27;t worry, they don&#x27;t get thicker than mine and this makes the cut.</li>
            <li> The narrow trimmer seems silly, not sure why they didn&#x27;t make it a bit wider, though it isn&#x27;t a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> Called Panasonic to complain about the failure of the foil support.  </li>
            <li> Also, the 8066 rested in a basic charging base (not a cleaning unit, which I wouldn&#x27;t care to mess with).</li>
            <li> well maybe not as close as the ridiculous 5 bladed monster they have now.</li>
            <li> This lasted for about 26 years until I finally got tired of cutting myself and paying for throw away razors and blades.</li>
            <li> I had previous experience with Remington (not impressed)</li>
            <li> I did some research and decided to buy the less expensive model without the auto cleaner, since I was already used to cleaning the heads with soap.  </li>
            <li> BTW, don&#x27;t take Panasonic&#x27;s recommendation to replace the blades and foil once a year too seriously.  </li>
            <li> Still not perfect around the neck where any electric razor I have tried has problems (hairs are tight against skin in varying directions).  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this purchase, however, the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave attracted me.  </li>
            <li> NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> so if you want a beard and to shave your neck, not a good chioce.    </li>
            <li> not a good idea.    </li>
            <li> not good.    </li>
            <li> The extension for sideburns or other hair is almost worthless, and the razor has trouble picking up some neck hair, even after repeated passes.    </li>
            <li> But on the bad side, in the past I&#x27;ve often used the trimmer on my neck area, where the narrow width of this one would be a disadvantage -</li>
            <li> This Panasonic wet/dry shaver, from my experence, shaves closer than a blade, and I have a tough beard.</li>
            <li> Lets face it, head hair is tough to shave.</li>
            <li> And my beard isn&#x27;t even very thick.  </li>
            <li> Least expensive  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because I am tired of dealing with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> 2/15/10-Here&#x27;s an update on this shaver and the poor design of the foil frame.</li>
            <li> the trimmer has been unnecessary there.  </li>
            <li> i was tired of the razor</li>
            <li> it without the possibility of the thin metal parts bumping and bending.    </li>
            <li> I use it but am not happy with it.</li>
            <li> You get a lot worse with a disposable razor.    </li>
            <li> The way Panasonic comes up with the designs and features of its models, I&#x27;m almost afraid to imagine what shavers will look like in a few years.  </li>
            <li> but it seems a lot of you have it worse.  </li>
            <li> Norelco shaver and had a previous bad experience with a Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first that the lack of the cleaning base would be annoying</li>
            <li> : the trimmer is too thin and located in a weird spot.  </li>
            <li> Generally I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> this sucker is built like a tank!!    </li>
            <li> br /&gt;I am extremely unhappy particularly as I was unable to return it!!!</li>
            <li> Freakishly thick, evil little guys.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after three years of use, the shavinghead foil retainer broke</li>
            <li> It is difficult to determine which way to plug it in.</li>
            <li> -Expensive  </li>
            <li> - the cap is cheesy (the case is too, but I don&#x27;t see me using that)    </li>
            <li> No need for expensive cleaning docks and cartridges.      </li>
            <li> Sorry, but I do not remember purchasing this shaver.</li>
            <li> It makes a very annoying high-pitched noise, and the power plug is proprietary, means you have to pay extra and buy from Panasonic if you ever lose it.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used (Braun, Norelco), although I&#x27;m not retiring my razor yet, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The final straw was this morning when I accidentally dropped it in the sink, and now that pivot won&#x27;t work without making a horrible squealing noise.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s not too expensive for a wet/dry shaver and that it IS a wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> Useless.  </li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Power blades are really expensive...</li>
            <li> It was expensive, and the refills were a pain, pricey, but they worked.</li>
            <li> Silly me</li>
            <li> , believe it or not...sounds weird, but those blades lasted seven years).  </li>
            <li> Sorry Braun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a perfect razor close shave</li>
            <li> As one person mentioned, if you are expecting razor close, then you have unrealistic expectations.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any shave gel and I merely shave my head in the shower and rinse off.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about all the rave reviews for this razor, but after using one for a week, I am now a believer.  </li>
            <li> wrong again folks.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is that no matter how bad you let it tear at you, you still have stubble left that no amount of choppi</li>
            <li> This is compared to a Remington rotary shaver I had previously which was terrible.  </li>
            <li> The remington would pull hairs and was awkward to hold.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line is that the cutting head on all these shavers is identical.</li>
            <li> so I have been afraid to try another electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I have an ES8066 that I would still be using except that it was time to replace the foil and cutting blocks</li>
            <li> Who knows, maybe I won&#x27;t grow my winter beard this season if this combination of shaving techniques keeps the cutting of my face to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the stupid foil frame that fails.  </li>
            <li> But it was very expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who was very skeptical about electric razors.</li>
            <li> : unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work for crap on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Not that I dress bad or not wear deodorant, but that they felt I didn&#x27;t shave often.</li>
            <li> what the bad?</li>
            <li> Shaving with a blade in these circumstances can be quite painful and often causes a lot of bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because I was disappointed in the performance of Norelco electric rotary shavers that I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that Panasonic cuts corners to save pennies.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the noise too annoying, though some of you may.</li>
            <li> I just end up using the base for the drying cycle, which is an option.</li>
            <li> This product does not include the cleaning base.</li>
            <li> The 8043 charging/storing method with a plug in the end is annoying, and I don&#x27;t have room to leave it lying there</li>
            <li> They are identical except that this one doesn&#x27;t come with the base.</li>
            <li> I find this quite annoying.</li>
            <li> Buy it you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This razor was terrible!  </li>
            <li> And Panasonic service is the very worst I have ever encountered for any product I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Outrageous!  </li>
            <li> Had tried an electric razor years ago (Norelco Triple Header)and it irrated my face horribly and my face never adjusted to it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just recieved the Panasonic ES8042SC from Amazon. I didn&#x27;t notice there is no charging station for the razor.  The Braun it is replacing was half the price and worked fine for nearly five years and included a charging station.  This is going to be step back in convience, pluging in the cord constantly and having the razor laying on the counter..... NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington rotary shavers for over a decade now.  I decided to try a foil blade after reading the Consumer Reports reviews.  The best CR foil razor didn&#x27;t get great reviews from Amazon customers so I looked at other shavers at a reasonable price that received better reviews and this is the item I purchased.  The Panasonic does provide a smoother shave with much less irritation--I have yet to experience red neck.  I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 30 days now and it does require multiple passes to get a clean shave, but it does a better job than rotaries I&#x27;ve used.  It is loud, but that&#x27;s not a problem for me.  It also will not shave while plugged in, which bothers me a bit, but really isn&#x27;t an issue because it charges fast and holds a charge for several weeks.  The cleaning is really simple.  I haven&#x27;t tried a wet shave and probably won&#x27;t, but the dry shave is really good for the price.  I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone currently using a rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> For the cost and free shipping, this is a good deal. My previous Panasonic razor would have cost almost as much just for the foil and cutter replacements. And this one has the same performance as the Panasonics that cost over twice as much, if you don&#x27;t need the cleaner base, which I never used when I did have one.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002N2HZF6 PAN-ES8043SC]]  I now on two Braun Electric Razors and decided to try the Panasonic because of the price difference.  The Panasonic Razor is AS GOOD or even better than the Braun.  It is too soon to tell if the Panasonic will last as long as a Braun.  However; I am more than satisfied with the Panasonic and have been using for one month.  YES, I would purchase another one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model for almost 2 years now.  It isn&#x27;t just one pass and done, but I&#x27;ve never had an electric that was.  It gives a quick fairly clean shave.  I like the fact that you can clean it by just popping off the top and holding it under the faucet.  The built in battery holds a charge for 1 month of daily shaves.   I haven&#x27;t had to replace anything yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely amazed with how close this shaver gets.  My face feels as smooth as when using shaving cream and a regular razor.  The handling is very smooth and it seems to almost grip my face without a single nick.  Very little irritation, certainly less than with other electric shavers.  This is honestly the first time I&#x27;ve been so impressed with a product that I came back to write a review.  Definitely money well spent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver in &#x27;06.  It provided a very close and smooth shave.  Unfortunately, after three years of use, the shavinghead foil retainer broke and I had to replace the shaver with a new model from Panasonic (the ES8249S, which showed itself to be a disappointing replacement).</li>
            <li> I bought this in summer 2006.  It is now 2015 and I still use it every day. I&#x27;ve never done the slightest bit of maintenance on it, including never changing the blades. It just works and works. (The only decline has been in the battery life, which is now down to just a few days before it must be recharged.)  By contrast, before this I owned probably a half-dozen Brauns over the years and never had one able to last longer than about 2 years before the motor would quit or the battery would die or something of that nature. I worry about buying a new razor because the reviews don&#x27;t sound as good on the new ones.</li>
            <li> The ES8043SC Pro-Curve Linear is definately the best razor I have ever owned.  This is based on 3 other panasonic models to compare.  You can get the closest shave in the shortest time.  It is quiet also, not like some other noisy razors in comparison.  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rotary style electric razors for more than 15 years. I finally grew tired of the endless circling necessary to get a clean shave...and this circling often led to irritation, especially on my neck, and occasionally in-grown hairs. Sorry for the gory details, but they are necessary to adequately contrast this razor.    I&#x27;ve been using this for six months now ... in-grown hairs have virtually disappeared and irritation on the neck is drastically reduced.  This razor cuts very cleanly and rarely requires more than two passes over one area.  For stiffer hairs, it cuts through like a lawn-mower--absolutely brilliantly.  After a few days of growth this device loses some of its effectiveness, but the price I pay for lazy weekends...    I tend to use this razor dry, however it works well wet also.  It seems to give a closer shave dry, although if shaving in a steamy bathroom or hot hotel room, wet is the only way to go.    The razor holds a charge for weeks, which is good because you get to keep the charging cable (which is clunky and heavy) stored away most of the time. It has a rapid charge feature and self-cleaning cycle that I use about once per week.  The wet/dry functionality of this device makes it extremely easy to keep clean.    My only hesitation in giving this five stars is that, after six months, the foil feels a little duller, and thus it is taking slightly longer to shave.  I have also found that irritation has increased slightly in the past few weeks which, as I stated earlier, wasn&#x27;t a problem for the first five months or so.  For the price and the regular cleaning, I would expect the foil to remain sharp for at least a year.      For its good shave, low level of irritation, long battery life, and wet/dry flexibility, this razor gets 4.5* from me.  Excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> WOW....Kudos to Panasonic on this electric razor!  I have been using an electric razor for many years and have had just about every brand including some lesser know brands like Sunbeam.  This Panasonic wet/dry razor out shaves them all including the highly touted Braun! I have had two of them and both ended up breaking down. They did not give as close a shave as the Panasonic either. I really like the fact that you can if you want use a little shaving cream while you shave. It makes for a very close non-abrasive shave.  Simple to clean up with just soap and water unlike the Braun which uses expensive cleaning fluid.  I can&#x27;t understand why consumer reports did not rank this as a must have item. Buy it you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Recently I just got tired of long lasting procedure of manual shaving, burning sensation aftermath, red bumps, and buying cream and expensive blades over and over.  So I decided to give electronic razor a shot. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and so far I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  I don&#x27;t even have to apply cream or soup; it shaves gently and smoothly without pulling hair. Not as close as manual razor but considering how fast and smooth the whole procedure is I am pleased overall.    However, It does have one disadvantage. It cannot shave any hair on my neck. No matter at what angle I hold the razor or how slow/fast I move it around my neck, it just does not shave it.  So I have to use manual razor for my neck. Which is sad because my neck is the most sensitive part to shave. Very easily it gets red bumps and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> bought to replace my 8 y/o panasonic.  i guess these things are almost indestructible, but i just had to get rid of the old model b/c it was getting gunky.  this shaver cuts close to the skin but doesn&#x27;t give any razor burn.  the clippers are practical for trims along the hair line and side burns.  my only complaint is that this model doesn&#x27;t have a battery bar to gauge remaining charge life.</li>
            <li> This is my fifth or sixth Panasonic shaver.  It is the best one yet. The linear motor is far superior to other motors.  It is quiet and fast.  Until it is broken in which takes a few weeks, I use my previoius Panasonic for certain trim areas.  The one small drawback is the plug on the charging cord. It is difficult to determine which way to plug it in. I get about 10 shaves before charging is necessary.</li>
            <li> I love the shaver, it gives me a nice close shave and the fact I can run it through the water to clean it is perfect and simple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used razors because I could never shave close enough with an electric until now.  My Grandfather has a hard time with regular blades so I asked around and was told this was the one to get so I bought one for myself as well.  Very fast, extremely easy to clean, just some liquid soap and then turn it on!  Can&#x27;t beat that and it gets nearly as close as a razor does.  My skin was a little irritated at first but now it&#x27;s perfect and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I got this item for shaving my head, not my face. I had never used an electric shaver before but I had decided I wanted to go beyond the burr haircut I had been giving myself for years. And the couple of times I had done the deed with a razor and soap or foam, it was messier than I wanted to deal with.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried this unit with soap and shaving foam also. But the best results for me have been to use it dry. The instructions sort of plead with the buyer to \\&quot;give it a month\\&quot; to develop a personal technique and somehow let your scalp and the razor get to know each other. I&#x27;ve developed a technique of working out from the top of my head, where I&#x27;m already bald for good, in circular motions and doing those circles in both directions to work against the grain whichever way it goes. It also helps to pull the scalp against the grain in order to stand up the stubble better and let the razor get a better bite. After about 15 minutes, the job is pretty well done.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I want to stick with the \\&quot;chrome dome\\&quot; look so I&#x27;ll keep using the razor that I paid $60+ for. But it&#x27;s not like zip, zip, zip and you&#x27;re done. And really, even if I do a very good job and the result is very smooth, within 5-6 hours, the hair is growing back and noticeable to the touch. Just like a beard.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The razor has no issues with being drenched and it charges up quick and holds the charge for 5-6 (head)shaves. I haven&#x27;t used any soap to clean the blades but I take off the thin screen after each shave and run really hot water over the blades and through the screen and it&#x27;s cleaning up pretty good like that. I&#x27;m kind of curious about how a rotary would perform because I ended up doing a rotary thing with mine manually. But the Panasonic seems solid and until it screws up, I won&#x27;t be getting another one.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think it does what it claims to do. But it doesn&#x27;t do it without some significant cooperation from the operator.</li>
            <li> I bought Panasonic because I wanted a solid name in shavers and so I focused on Braun and Panasonic as I believe neither sell a product that did not live up to their brand name. I focused on the brands I trusted most to still deliver good engineering, metal foils and electronics regardless where they were made (It&#x27;s pretty hard to get a shaver made in Europe, USA or Japan). Happily it&#x27;s as solid a product as I expected. For the past month shaving is fast and pain free again. I prefer to shave dry from past Braun experience and this is no problem with this Panasonic.  If and when I wet shave I dont think you can beat a Gillette Mach 3 or better razor anyway and it&#x27;s just as much work rinsing an electric shaver as a blade so to me I go with the blade when water is in the equation.  It helps as people said to dedicate a a minute or more to running the shaver over the skin in different directions and pulling the looser neck skin a bit to engage the blades but the shave quality and speed are excellent.</li>
            <li> The following review is because I found it excruciating to find an electric razor that really truly met all my needs. And because I can&#x27;t trust anyone&#x27;s opinion that hasn&#x27;t really tried a few.    To start I have very sensitive skin on my neck, the hairs lie very flat as well there...and my beard hair is freaking tough. Freakishly thick, evil little guys.    The contenders:    Norelco (Phillips) has been around for a while and is known for their 3 head rotary design. I got a SpeedXL, 8175XL. Claiming 50% more surface area than before with three rings on each head.     Braun a big name in the foil shaver market and apparently the top rated by a certain consumer mag. I got a 8975, 360 Complete.     Finally Panasonic \\&quot;Linear\\&quot;, the lone entry as a wet/dry shaver, boasting \\&quot;fastest speed\\&quot; and \\&quot;sharpest\\&quot; blades. ES8043 was the model.     The lowdown:    Norelco...bundled with lots of extras. Best feedback with most LEDs. Very quiet, picked up the wonky hairs. But I wasn&#x27;t happy. I had little control over where it cut and it was hard to address the little problem areas. Also it doesn&#x27;t cut along a line well...so if you want a beard and to shave your neck, not a good chioce.    I realize others may not have that concern...so how about the actual cut? Decent, but I had an OLD Panasonic model which was right in the ball park...and I wanted to replace that one. Back to the store with you!!! The cleaning on this was also harder as the rotary area wasn&#x27;t very streamlined.    Braun. After that first round I was done. I went for the top (well almost, mine didn&#x27;t have the cleaning station). The 360 Complete had new Gillette tech, a really cool looking foil patter, and wow!! it was $140. This guy was a little heavier than expect. Fired it up...and loud, MUCH louder than the Norelco, even louder than the Panny...and it vibrated more in my hand.    Not too worried, more power right? First off...we have a contender. It cut fast, and closer than my previous Panny, much better than the Norelco. Came with a nice little hard case for travel. Pretty much it was all good. I figured this was the same model as the one with the cleaning stand...so rinse clean right? NOPE. A three step process of open partly, shake out, open fully brush out, finally a drop or two of oil.    Hmm still it cut pretty darn nice. But it was very expensive. Better take one last look....I had a Panasonic, what do they have? Without returning the Braun I got the new Panny. Hmm..wet/dry, self cleaning \\&quot;sonic mode\\&quot; (add a touch of soap and cleans itself), 13,000 rpm motor. It was quiet, it was lighter.    Now I had the two contenders in hand, time to test on the 5 o clock shadow. Panasonic first. Quickly shaved one side of my face. Hmm quieter than the last...subconsciously thought might not live up. Felt that side of my face...HOLY &amp;^*(&amp; that is smooth, like perfect, blade-eque smooth, except one tiny ridge along the jaw bone I just missed.    Still this was the easy task...nice short hair, lets bring out the Braun again. It made quick work of the other side of my face as well. Well mostly...one spot stayed a little rough and I gave it multiple passes. Still very much acceptable. Before finishing up, I decided to run the Panny back over the area the Braun had some issues with. ...and some tell tale hair clinking noise....felt it. Perfect.    The easy winner: Panny    Done. Told my now exasperated GF I found it. My shaver. Fastest, middle quiet, cheapest of the bunch, able to clean itself with no special stand, and finally wet or dry capable. Awesome!!    Wrap up:    Norelco (Phillips) 8175XL:    Pro:  +Great accessories  +Best LED feedback  +Li-ion batter (pretty sure)  +Quietest  +Best on slightly longer hairs that are laying flat    Con:  -Least close shave  -longest time to shave  -those longer hairs get pulled a bit (ouch)  -a bit more irritation (more passes)  -Hard to cut along a line (beard shaping)  -iffy sideburn trimmer (fell all the time)    Braun 8975    Pro:  +Almost asclose a shave  +good sideburn trimmer  +Top rated makes you feel cool  +indicator for time to replace cutting block  +best pivoting head  +Hard Case for storage    Con:  -Loudest  -Expensive  -Didn&#x27;t cut as well as the Panny  -No allowance to even get it slightly wet anywhere  -Only one with Ni-MH batteries  -Heavy    Panasonic ES8043  Pro:  +Least expensive  +great cleaning that can be done anywhere (so special stand)  +Best shave, close and fast  +Much quieter than Braun  +Light  +Li-ion battery  +Only with full, in the shower Wet capability (not even tested...still won)  +Great sideburn trimmer, now a solid flip up design    Con:  -Lousy soft vinyl case  -weird plug design...have to look when plugging in for charging  -same brand as before    So there you have it. I don&#x27;t want to sound too down on the Norelco, it just was slow, imprecise and didn&#x27;t cut as close...maybe with enough time training your skin it would be better?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always shaved with a rotary shaver.  This foil shaver works okay in the shower (wet) but is pretty useless dry.  I still find myself finishing my shave with my old rotary (Norelco).  I bought this one based on the positive reviews it received.  Everyone&#x27;s beard is different, so buying any electric razor is a bit of a gamble (IMHO).  I gambled and lost on this one.</li>
            <li> It take me five solid minutes to shave with this thing because the main blades do such a poor job on the neck area that I have to use the trimmer on this \\&quot;tough\\&quot; spot. I&#x27;d probably quit using this and go back to a regular razor, but I get awful razor burn on my neck from using a straight razor that I don&#x27;t get nearly as bad with this item. I&#x27;ve been using this thing for eight months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all been said so I&#x27;ll just add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wet/Dry works but even water helps irritation burn, I use water and&lt;br /&gt;  I get less irritation. (Only used it a few times)&lt;br /&gt;2. Close shave (I&#x27;ve used other shavers this is better) but don&#x27;t tell&lt;br /&gt;  me its as close as a razor; however it&#x27;s close enough, very good if&lt;br /&gt;  not excellent.&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;ve had no razor pull at all but after shave lotion is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they had 1/2 stars Id give this product 4 1/2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;*******************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only lasted 4 months, fell apart, pinched a lot, not close any more. Who wants to pay $60 for 4 months use.</li>
            <li> Only my second \\&quot;real\\&quot; shaver. This was an upgrade over a 1 1/2 year old braun. Does a better job than the braun, but not the miracle shaver I hoped for.     pros:  -Pop-up trimmer is sharp  -Holds the charge long (lithium ion battery)  -good job shaving  cons:  -while it cut better than my old braun, ther are some areas (especially on my neck) that require multiple passes, from various angles  -can&#x27;t use while plugged in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the other major brands over the years and I like this one best.</li>
            <li> For the last 15 years (i.e. my entire shaving life), I have used Norelco shavers. When the battery on my last one would no longer hold a charge, I decided to try something new, and purchase this Panasonic wet/dry shaver. Materials in the box caution users to \\&quot;Please Stick With It. It&#x27;s Worth it.\\&quot; They say my skin and beard need 30 days to adjust. Okay. Expectations duly lowered, I turned the shaver on, was momentarily surprised by the high frequency buzz that comes with 13,000 oscillations a minute, and ran the shaver down my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks, this shaver has produced an EXTREMELY close shave, with no irritation at all, and no uncomfortable pulling sensation that Norelco&#x27;s \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; method sometimes produces. Nothing can quite match a straight blade, but this is without a doubt the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver -- and I&#x27;m sure it will produce even better results as my skin and beard \\&quot;adjust.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to switch from the trusty Norelco 3-headed shavers to this foil shaver. But I&#x27;m SO glad I did. And you can bet I&#x27;m going to tell my family about this. It was my dad who introduced me to Norelcos all those years ago. It&#x27;s about time I introduce him to the Panasonic.  :-)</li>
            <li> Follows every curve, no sharp edges. Very smooth shave. Women, if you want a real shaver, stay away from those \\&quot;for women\\&quot; shavers that look like kid toys. This is a very good choice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver about a month and a half ago based largely on the reviews. previously I had a norelco that lasted for something like 8 years. The old razor was one with the three round heads.     for this razor I like  - wet dry use  - speed of charging and length charge is held  - fits my hand nice  - ease of cleaning  - smoothness of cut *when it cute* - see below    I dislike  - it&#x27;s quite loud  - it takes longer to shave with than my previous model  - the cap is cheesy (the case is too, but I don&#x27;t see me using that)    I really dislike the way this razor treats my neck. it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to get under my jaw and around my adams apple without a lot of contortion and extra time. I&#x27;m constantly finding missed patches on my neck. it shaves my face smoother than any razor ever has. Having owned an electric razor before I don&#x27;t find this hard on my skin at all as some have reported. perhaps I&#x27;m used to it. I don&#x27;t like having to push, pull twist and reshave to get my neck done. it&#x27;s faster with a regular razor and was way faster with the 3 head shaver that just snuck into the crevices.  Granted you&#x27;re not supposed to drive and shave, but the old razor didn&#x27;t need to be paid attention to to get all the spots, this one requires more attention than I have in the morning and it certainly prohibits multi tasking. Unfortunately I have kept this razor too long to send it back. for the money, the $[...] norelco was a better razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who was very skeptical about electric razors. He has used the rotary bladed kind in the past that left him with lots of irritation. Since he refused to shave more than 2 or 3 times a week due to his sensitive skin, I thought maybe this would be worth a try. It took him a little while to get used to using it, but now he shaves nearly every day!!! No irritation for him and no whisker burn for me!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I am tired of dealing with shaving cream. Ordered it for $50 on sale thru Amazon and got it today. Took it out of the box and it worked like a charm. Very clean shave.     I love Panasonic!    14 month update.    Well it still is a good razor. The side burn trimmer quit working but I didn&#x27;t use it anyway. I sometimes have to really work hard to get a good shave. It has a problem getting certain areas....like on my neck. Around the nose and mouth is excellent.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this razor; apparently it gives a much closer shave than any electric razor he&#x27;s tried.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s also substantially louder than other electric razors.</li>
            <li> This dealer was very promp in sendig this shaver. It arived in less time than given and was in great shape. I think you can depend on them, Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost two months now and I would say that this shaver beats my Braun 8995 in terms of closeness hands down. The shaver does an excellent job. I would recommend this product. You can buy two of these compared to one Braun 8995. Excellent Buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this electric razor because I was tired of putting all the chemicals on my face when shaving with a old school razor. Plus there is the environmental aspects of not throwing blades away that make the electric more appealing..     I purchased this razor because of the fact that it was wet/dry and had good reviews for the price. The last electric razor I had was a top of the line Norelco I purchased in 2000... that thing would often snag my beard hair and boy did it hurt! So, I threw it through a window and I went back to shaving with a blade.    With the old school way of shaving, I am one to shave in the shower as I find I get a better shave. However after trying various shaving conditions with this razor, I use it when I am completely dry. However the fact that this unit is wet/dry makes cleaning it a breeze.    Upon my first few weeks this thing tore up my face as the manual stated might happen...  but once my skin adjusted I was fine and am able to shave with it everyday.... I also found that once my skin adjusted, my shaving goes much quicker than it first took... Still takes a minute or two longer than with a blade...     Also, I read through a lot of reviews about this razor not doing so great on the neck. I have to agree which is the reason I only give this thing 4 stars... I find even now after my skin has adjusted I have to move the thing.. **TIP** When you shave your neck, move this thing in circles rather than linearly as the manual specifies... I found spinning it in circles on my neck got those rogue hairs it missed when I moved it in a linear direction</li>
            <li> It only took about 4 shaves to really get used to using an electric shaver. I&#x27;m a fan of Panasonic cameras and other electronics and this is no exception. I would recommend this to anyone with facial hair.</li>
            <li> The idea of using an electric shaver is very appealing  - the idea of getting a faster shave with less irritation and less blood loss has gotten me interested enough to purchase several shavers.  I have two Panasonic shavers and one Norelco wet dry.      This particular shaver, I purchased from Amazon about a year ago after having tried other Panasonic shavers.  Panasonic&#x27;s product line can be broken down into three categories based on battery type -- NiCad, NiMH, and Lithium Ion with Lithium Ion being the latest and best.  They can also be broken down based upon number of foils in which some have dual shaving foils, this one has three, and panasonic&#x27;s latest shavers have four.      This shaver is a Lithium Ion shaver.  It has no battery memory effect, it can be charged any time you want, and it lasts a good long time and does not lose shaving speed until the battery is fully depleted.  It charges in less than an hour and has a charger that supports world wide voltage for charging when traveling.    At the time I purchased this product, it was the first least expensive panasonic shaver that had Lithium Ion batteries, triple blade shaving, and a 13,000 rpm linear motor.      The shaver is loud!  But also it feels very powerful. Panasonic is one of few manufacturers that allow for wet dry shaving.  If you get a lot of shaving irritation dry shaving, you can try some of the thicker soaps or shaving gels or try shaving while you are in the shower.  Some people suggested Lectric Shave but I did not find it useful.     One of the big negatives is that it is difficult to shave around the neck line.  It just does not pick up hairs that lay flat against your neck.  I find myself cleaning up with a standard razor after finishing to get all that it missed.  I wanted to be on a completely electric shaving system but at this time it&#x27;s not possible.  Panasonic just released several new shavers such as the  Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV which I would love to try and see how much improvement Panasonic has made in the two generations of shavers they have released since I purchased this unit.    Everyone&#x27;s facial hair is different.  No one shaver can be all things to all people.  With that said, this is a good solid shaver at an affordable price and it&#x27;s definitely worth looking at.</li>
            <li> For those of you who have never used an electric razor, this style of razor (linear) gives a much closer shave than the 3 blade rotor razors at the cost of a little comfort.  It is important to alow your skin to get used to your new razor (about 2 weeks).    I use this on my head and my face and it works great for both.  It gives a nice close shave and is fairly comfortable.  The only downside is that you can&#x27;t use ot while it&#x27;s pluged in since it&#x27;s a wet/dry razor so once the battery dies it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> just got it and tried. it&#x27;s a little noisy, and have to push hard many times to shave clean.</li>
            <li> This is my second ES8043.  The motor delivers as close a shave as you like.  Cleans easily.  Battery lasts a week before charging, assuming a shave of 5-10 mins. per day.  Blades and foil probably could go 2 years before replacement, but I find that you will notice an improvement in your shave if you replace after 1 year.  Overall, I have been quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Had an old Norelco with three rotating blades and was looking for a closer shave.  This Panasonic foil shaver is definitely an improvement.  Shaves closer and quicker.  Still not perfect around the neck where any electric razor I have tried has problems (hairs are tight against skin in varying directions).  For the price and product I believe this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I shave my face and my head with this razor, and it does a great job on both.  It usually takes several passes to get all the hairs, but it will shave virtually as close as a blade. I can get my head cue ball smooth without suffering the inevitable nicks and cuts of head shaving with a blade. It sure is a lot more convenient, and cheaper, than blades and shaving cream, over time. Especially if you like to shave every day, or every other day.  I usually shave dry, but other reviewers say shaving with soap is even better.  Also the popup trimmer is great for edging my goatee.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, and it&#x27;s never \\&quot;bitten\\&quot; me yet, like a couple other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried have.  You&#x27;ll get the best results if you don&#x27;t go more than 3 days between shaves. It takes much longer to get a good shave with it if you have substantial growth to mow down.    I generally get about 4-5 face and head shaves on a charge.  It has a lithium ion battery, so you can charge it anytime without worry of getting \\&quot;battery memory\\&quot; issues like nickel cadmium, or nickel metal hydride batteries can develop, when the batteries are not completely depleted before recharging.  It has a flashing LED that tells you when the unit needs charged, and usually there&#x27;s ample time to finish your shave, and then plug it in to charge when you&#x27;re done.    It cleans up easy by just popping off the foil head and running the blades under the tap, or you can do a more thorough job with soap and water.  No need for expensive cleaning docks and cartridges.      All in all, I think it&#x27;s the best bang for your buck electric shaver on the market today.  There are cheaper models in Panasonic&#x27;s lineup, but they lack the 13,000 RPM motor, which is key to the excellent performance this unit offers.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this shaver. My last electric, a Remington rotary razor, was not nearly as good to me. My skin did not react well at all to its rotary blades. But the Panasonic is great. I have only used the dry function for shaving, and it provides a great shave. The linear blades don&#x27;t disturb my skin or give me ingrown hairs. I also appreciate how easy it is to clean - just a rinse, or a bit of soap and a rinse - and done. The battery life is great (way better than my Remington). I probably charge it twice a month. And I quite like the style: compact and sleek, it&#x27;s very easy to handle.    The one downside that I can think of is that this shaver is pretty noisy. Kind of surprising for how small it is. But definitely not a big deal. Overall great choice.</li>
            <li> A little louder than I&#x27;m accustomed from an E Razor.  I prefer the 3 blade system but this unit is ok at best for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about 2 months now and I love it.  Very close, very smooth.  I do have to go over my face a time or two but it is all good.  I would recommend this product to my family and friends.  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After using this razor for over six months I purchased a Norelco because I was so dissatisfied with it. It took forever to shave my neck and even then stubbles could be seen within several hours. I tried different ways of shaving and they all gave me poor results. Not only was the neck a problem but the overall shave was no better. I certainly would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> If you shave your head don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this shaver. It does not give you a close shave and cuts other parts of your head unevenly. Had to go back over spots multiple times.</li>
            <li> This product broke down write after one year. Planned yes for sure no longer returnable. This is the environmental stuff we really should be worried about.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I do not remember purchasing this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for over two years now and just realized that it&#x27;s not quite as good as I thought. I&#x27;ve replaced the foil and head every year, as recommended and, while it works, it just doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d like. Recently I started shaving at my gym in the morning, using a two blade disposable razor and was surprised to find that I was getting a much closer shave than with the Panasonic. For a long time I&#x27;d been telling myself that the electric was \\&quot;just as good\\&quot; as a blade. I used it both wet and dry and the results were pretty similar. I&#x27;ll keep it for travel purposes but am heading back to blades.</li>
            <li> This is the second panasonic shaver I have owned. I replaced the first one once the battery eventually died. I have now had this particular shaver over two years. It shaves great, cleaning is a snap seeing how it is waterproof, all you have to do is pop the top off and rinse it under the faucet. Being two years old the battery is still going strong. I currently get approximately twenty shaves out of a single charge. I would certainly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have the identical shaver, the ES8077S.  The difference between the two is that this ES8043SC model does not include a cleaning station. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a replacement unit for my old Braun 5550, which after a few years of use has finally died. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you prefer not to purchase the bulky cleaning station (from the ES8077S model), the manual suggests an alternative method to clean -- using liquid soap and water; this would be convenient when on the road! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Replacement Parts &amp; Accessories (Retail prices &amp; model # as indicated in insert): &lt;br /&gt;1) Protective Cap (WES8044X7158): $0.62 &lt;br /&gt;2) Outer Foil (WES9085PC): $35.00 &lt;br /&gt;3) Inner Blades (WES9064PC): $21.95 &lt;br /&gt;4) Charging Adapter (WES8044K7658): $16.11 &lt;br /&gt;5) Self-Cleaning Recharger (WES8078H4218): $41.89 &lt;br /&gt;6) Detergent Cartridge 3-pack (WES035P): $9.99 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;- The Panasonic Vortex is relatively light, and easy to hold/grip. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Wet/Dry: One of the main features that won me over. I decided to get this unit instead of the Braun Activator because of this feature. I usually shave right after I take a shower, and my old Braun wouldn&#x27;t cut cleanly until I fully dried off. First thing I did when I received this unit was to try shaving after a shower -- worked perfectly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Speed: For my old shaver, I had to take several passes, and yet still missed stubs here and there. With the Vortex, I was able to shave cleanly in one quick pass. I&#x27;m impressed! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Head Pivots: The head of the shaver adjusts smoothly to the contours of my face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Battery:  Right out of the box, I used my shaver for about a month before charging! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;- After my shave, my skin got a bit irritated at first use.  After a few uses, my skin was able to adjust. &lt;br /&gt;- Came with a cheap travel bag. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;--- &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have mentioned the noise of the unit. With any electric shaver, the noise is unavoidable. I didn&#x27;t find the noise too annoying, though some of you may.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for over 2 years (bought May 2008) so I feel qualified to write a review.  I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this product and and even after 2 years the blades are still sharp and the battery is still going strong.  This is compared to a Remington rotary shaver I had previously which was terrible.  The remington would pull hairs and was awkward to hold.  This one feels very solid in the hand and the motor is powerful enough to give a good shave.    Pros  - Head flexes back and forth to makes shaver follow contour of your face  - Wet/dry operation makes it easy to clean and shave wet  - Has both the foil and side-to-side blades to cut the longer hairs and shave close at the same time  - Has a pop out trimmer to trim side burns and beard if you have one  - Has a special high-speed mode to make cleaning blades easier  - sharp blades, strong motor, good quality overall    Cons  - Sometimes need to go over area several times to get a smooth shave, but I think this is a limitation of electric shavers in general rather than a fault of this product    As you can see very few cons and many pros.  Overall a great product that I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This shaver seems to be well constructed and has great features like wet/dry use and easy cleaning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t work very well for me. My hair is pretty thick and curly and I suspect that it&#x27;s just tricky to get it to go through the foil. I have to make a ton of passes to get the hairs (leading to a bit of irritation) and I typically end up missing a bunch and having to do touch-up with my Mach3. So while I thought this would save me time, it actually takes me more time to shave than with my Mach3 and some nice shaving cream like Trumper&#x27;s Limes (great stuff!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some people swear by electric razors so I suspect that the product might work very well for others with straighter whiskers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I missed the return date so I&#x27;m probably going to sell mine.</li>
            <li> this shaver has to be used to be believed it is fantastic!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves the razor. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and gives a great shave. I love how easy it is to clean. Charges in 1 hour and gives a lot of shaves on a charge.</li>
            <li> This is the EXACT same model as the ES8077 without the cleaning block (see my review of it under that model). All I can say is that this razor is not all that it seems to be and many reviewers are trying to make it seem like it is \\&quot;the ultimate\\&quot; razor which it is not.</li>
            <li> The razor was delivered as promised and it was packaged well.  The razor works great.  I shave every morning after my shower, and the dampness from the shower does not interfere with obtaining that optimal shave without any knicks or razor burn. The cordless feature is a pleasure.</li>
            <li> As advertised; a well made product.  Cuts clean and comfortable, but can leave stubble if you are not careful.  Ability to shave wet is a plus.  It cleans easily and the batteries are long-lasting.  I won&#x27;t abandon it, but I will buy the top of the line Norelco again next time.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Panasonic wet &amp; dry shavers and have used an ES8066 for the last 5 years. I looked at many options and read many reviews before deciding to buy the Panasonic ES8043.  This afternoon, I received my shaver, charged it fully (only took an hour, as advertised) and began working on the 4 day growth that I prepared just for the occasion.  Note that I get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow about 2 hours after I shave each morning, so my 4 day growth is pretty substantial.     Out of the box, my first impression was that the ES8043 was a lot cheaper built than my older Panasonic.  It is lighter, more delicate, and seems more &#x60;plasticy&#x27; when compared to my older model.  Also, the popup trimmer in the older model was much wider and more solid. I also prefer the induction recharging method as it has less moving and connecting parts and therefore has less things to break. But the new model does look very cool and &#x60;high tech&#x27;.     My shave was awesome.  First, I trimmed 1/3 of my face with a Conair trimmer and used the ES8043&#x27;s pop-up trimmer for another third. I then shaved with the ES8043 on everything left over. The shave in all areas of my face was extremely close and comfortable. I found no hair pulling whatsoever - even against long hairs under my chin. I have no irritation at all. Shaver noise was much quieter than my older model. The pop-up trimmer works fine, but I do miss the one in my older model.    The ergonomics of the ES8043 was very comfortable and though the shaver felt awfully delicate in my hands my shave was easier, faster, and closer.    This baby is a keeper!  I&#x27;ll repost in 6 months or so with an update, if necessary.</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the so called \\&quot;leading\\&quot; and I might add much more expensive razors with fancy submerged cleaning attachments. IMHO none hold a candle to this sleek, well desingned and crafted exceptional razor. As close as a blade without the blood bath. Only con - cheap travel bag. Superb value.[[ASIN:B000GRZBU6 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet Dry Shaver]]</li>
            <li> Not a bad shaver, fits the hand well, but does not shave as close as the Braun 360 razor I have, but a good razor.  Comes with a cloth bag as a travel case, a little cheap.</li>
            <li> ShaveITS (TM) Panasonic Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver is a cordless razor designed for men with medium to light weight baldness on top of their head. Can be used in the shower, with or without soap, I prefer the soap myself, a cool, refreshing blend of citrus and Vit E cream designed to combat pimples, tooth decay and plugged pores. This unit isn&#x27;t difficult to use, one can recharge it quite conveniently near the sink top, comes in its own handy \\&quot;egg top\\&quot; (TM) case. For those with heavy, thick set beards, full of skin scruff and fleas, this works wonders after a few moments in the warm shower with a cream of pea soup nearby.</li>
            <li> This shaver shaves very close.  It&#x27;s quiet.  Cleans easily with water. Stays charged for a long time. An excellent product.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Panasonic razor for about a month.  It is a nice upgrade from the Braun I had.  It holds a charge for a good long time.  I have not used it in the shower yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on the wet shaving capabilities.  Dry it works real well.</li>
            <li> ...but getting closer as I&#x27;ve used it over the last 30 days. Just like they advise, there is a transition time as your face becomes accustomed to the shaver (from using a 5 blade Gillette). A little \\&quot;warm\\&quot; feeling the first week.     I have a heavier beard than most, and I&#x27;d say this shaver comes pretty close to a blades performance. I&#x27;d used shavers in the past, but the shave never seemed to last past noon. So I&#x27;ve used blades for the last 15 years. I decided to gamble again, given I was about to purchase another 15 pack of blades for $40+ at Costco. So I figured it was worth a try since after about 6 months the costs would come out about the same as using a blade a week. I&#x27;m definitely satisfied, and not looking to go back to blades. Biggest complaint - I use it in the shower with shaving cream, and sometimes I miss fully getting a spot around the chin.</li>
            <li> I recently shifted from 20 years of using norelco rotary razors to this foil shaver. It gives a much closer shave...so close that I&#x27;ve gotten a few nicks from it. However, it&#x27;s not fast. Since it seems to work much like a conventional razor, you do have to draw it slowly accross your skin. It does take fewer passes than my old norelco, but overall it seems like a slower but closer shave. It cleans-up easily, but you have to empty the cuttings and clean the head every other or every third day. A bit more involved to get really clean but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> After spending over $80, what I got was a flimsy cheap plastic Chinese-made crap.  It makes a very annoying high-pitched noise, and the power plug is proprietary, means you have to pay extra and buy from Panasonic if you ever lose it.    I should&#x27;ve just spent $40 and get a Remington.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first, but after reading a couple of reviews decided to try. Was a long time Norelco shaver and had a previous bad experience with a Braun shaver. This shaver rocks. The only slight complaint is the noise level - a little noisier than the Norelco. But the first shave was so close it impressed me to the fullest. Now, after a couple of weeks, am totally sold on it. It is wonderful</li>
            <li> This shaver was purchased for my husband in June of this year.  Yesterday while he was using the shaver the plastic frame that holds the foil assembly cracked at its end and a piece of plastic broke away.  The foil assembly frame is constructed of what appears to be very thin and cheap plastic.  My husband owned another Panasonic shaver that lasted for over 10 years with nary a problem other than foil and blade replacement.  He does not recommend the purchase of this shaver and if other Panasonic models are similarily constructed, he would not purchase any of those.    2/15/10-Here&#x27;s an update on this shaver and the poor design of the foil frame. My husband is now on his 4th foil frame.  The last one has just cracked after only a few weeks of use. Called Panasonic to complain about the failure of the foil support.  They want the shaver sent back to their customer service center.  The shaver will be replaced with a rebuilt shaver for a fee. This is ludicrous.  The shaver works fine.  It&#x27;s the stupid foil frame that fails.  What a joke!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my wife because lady&#x27;s razors suck.  She loves it.  Easy to use, shaves close, and has a lot of extras that are not found on lady&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li> It works fine except for being very loud.  Earlier Panasonic models I&#x27;ve owned were not as loud, and I would not recommend this model to anyone.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I bought this because it was affordable and sounded like a great buy.  My boyfriend said he really likes it because it shaves his face very well.  I have to agree with my boyfriend because his face can look  and feel pretty rough, but after using this shaver his face is very soft. He really loved that I bought this gift  for him. The only downside is that this shaver did not get the neck hairs thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I have owned many different razors in my time.  My last razor was a Panasonic ES726.  This was a great razor for $40.00.  Close and comfortable.  But the battery is dying so I went to buy another $40.00 Panasonic.  It was one of the basic Pro Curve models.  It didn&#x27;t do as good a job as my ES726.  I took it back and got a Braun Cruser3.  This razor was terrible!  So I took it back and got the Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver.  After the 1st use I was like, OMG!  This razor shaves as close as my ES726 but is even more comfortable! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor runs at 13,000 RPM&#x27;s. &lt;br /&gt;Has a triple blade system. &lt;br /&gt;Wet/Dry shave. &lt;br /&gt;Cleans under water. &lt;br /&gt;Pivot head. &lt;br /&gt;Turbo clean mode. &lt;br /&gt;Cord/Cordless operation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor has everything you could want and it delivers.  I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Very good shaver.  Gives me the best close shave ever.  I&#x27;ve used razors most of my 60years, except when I was too young, and this shaver does the job a lot closer and faster and without the cuts!  And as always Amazon provides fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I finally made the jump after almost seven years with the original Mach 3. First, if this is your first electric, realize that your face is gonna be tender for a while as your not used to it. I hear it takes a month to get used to it...I&#x27;m on day 2. First of all, let me say that this thing shaves closer than the Mach 3 in some areas. For example, the mustache area. If I had wanted to get this close in the mustache area, I would had to have shaved against the grain, and that simply isn&#x27;t an option with the Mach 3. Can we say razor burn? Well, this electric got it nice and close, seems even below skin level. On the other hand, in other, more fleshy areas like the neck and cheek, its not quite so close. I would right now say that it rivals the Mach 3 but not quite as close in those areas. As my sensitivity decreases to this, I&#x27;m betting on getting  closer and closer shaves. If your thinking about the other more expensive Panasonic model with the base charger/cleaner, don&#x27;t get it. Get this one like the other reviewer mentioned. It takes 2 seconds to clean this shaver with soap and water. If I remember, I&#x27;ll try and do a follow up later on after my face gets adjusted. I&#x27;m glad I made the switch. I always heard the mantra that you can never get a close a shave as with a wet shave, well you can wet shave with this thing, and its as close as any blade...well maybe not as close as the ridiculous 5 bladed monster they have now. SNL coming to life. &lt;br /&gt;P.S. Its pretty cool shaving with an electric and being able to use shaving get.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but after testing it for almost a month I decided to return it for a full refund.  The biggest problem I had with this shaver is it does not give you a close shave.  Right after I shaved it looked like I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow already. I will recommend anyone who uses a regular razor not to make the change.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver but it doesn&#x27;t give anything close to a real razor shave, as Panasonic and some customers claim. Still, it&#x27;s better than the other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used (Braun, Norelco), although I&#x27;m not retiring my razor yet, unfortunately. Just a reminder that if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.</li>
            <li> Gave this promising well reviewed shaver a good try (about 3 months), but it&#x27;s inability to provide a close shave, particularly in the chin and neck areas, combined with receiving frequent bleeding cuts, made me toss it into the drawer for no further use.  And my beard isn&#x27;t even very thick.  I only shave every other day.  I&#x27;m back to a Norelco triple rotary shaver, which performs better.  I shouldn&#x27;t have defected in the first place.  Panasonic may sell very good shavers, but they&#x27;re probably in the higher price range.  I don&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Super Shaver.  It is different and you have to get used to it a bit.  But now I am a big Panasonic fan.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to use on my head and not face. I prefer a regular blade for my face. This does an exceptional job on your head. It&#x27;s just as close as a straight blade. I have had no issues with it and use it every other day with no problems. If you&#x27;re looking for a close shave on your head, this is it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who started shaving with an electric razor from the beginning, and have been for 25 years now. I used Norelco Rotary shavers for 11 years (neck burners) I then switched to Braun foil razors. I always enjoyed Braun razors, but their foils wear out quick and they&#x27;re expensive to replace! After 6 years with my last Braun I decided to give Panasonic a try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First of all, I love being able to lather up and shave. That makes my neck much more comfortable. Keeping it wet and lathered makes the shave more pleasant.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It shaves really close (still have some trouble around the adam&#x27;s apple).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I first bought it, it was pretty quiet. After a year or so, it got louder and didn&#x27;t like being woke up in the mornings. :-) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The sideburn trimmer is OK. I like the Braun trimmers much better.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all though, I think Panasonic gives a closer, more comfortable shave than the Braun. For now, I&#x27;m a Panasonic man.</li>
            <li> Never thought a linear shaver could cut closer than a rotary on a bald head. &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I&#x27;d been having problems with razor bumps from shaving with from regular razors. This one was recommended to me so I got it.  &lt;br /&gt;Pros - I like the wet/dry feature since I usually shave in the shower. I also liked the pop-up trimmer, not more cuts trying to shave my mustache. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons - It really doesn&#x27;t deliver a very close shave. I&#x27;d been using it for over a month and after every shave, I could still feel some stuble no matter how long I spend trying to get it all off. I asked my doctor about it and she recommended using some of that old fashion shaving powder instead of a razor. I tried that and it worked like a charm, the razor bumps are all fading away. I just wish I knew about it before I bought this razor.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving your head for those bald guys (or ladies).  Easy to clean and maintain.  Works well in wet or dry conditions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for few days, and I&#x27;ve used it both dry and with a light lather of shaving cream.  Color me impressed!  This thing shaves at least as close as my blades (Gillette Sensor Excell), with more consistent results and less chance of cuts.  It&#x27;s very comfortable to use, and my skin is in better shape after shaving than when I use a manual blade.  I actually did lightly scrape myself lightly with it on my adam&#x27;s apple on the first use due to using too much pressure on that raised area, so it&#x27;s definitely getting close and it requires a bit of technique.  But that was easily mastered, and I&#x27;ve had no problems since then.  They say to give it 30 days for your face and beard to acclimate to the new shaver, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to be necessary.  I don&#x27;t foresee regularly using a manual blade anymore.  I&#x27;m getting better results in less time and with more convenience than I got with blades. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had zero issues with clean up.  I just put it under running water with the motor running and it gets clean.  It has a special 17000rpm cleaning mode (\\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; - what doesn&#x27;t use that moniker these days?) to make sure it gets clean.  You can use a bit of hand soap (per the instructions) in the cleaning foils and it will lather out, then you rinse it off, and it&#x27;s like new again.  I can&#x27;t imagine needing the cleaning station that comes with other packages of this same razor.  This is a great electric razor - recommended.</li>
            <li> Panasonic makes a great electric shaver, this is the second one for me in the last sixteen years.</li>
            <li> Do you ever make on of those online purchases that really exceed your expectations.  &lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic 8043 Pro Curve had me smiling from ear to ear the night I received it. I have the thickest beard of anyone I know, get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon, and used to shave every morning with a blade followed by my Braun. I have done this for over 15 years.... until now.  &lt;br /&gt;I was reluctant to write this review thinking that people would think I work for Panasonic, ranting about such a great product, but to tell the truth, they could hire me today and I&#x27;d gladly tell everyone about this shaver.    &lt;br /&gt;The first night I used it, I had not shaved the day before (a rare occasion). I told my wife I should give this shaver a fair chance and do my usual pre shave with my Gillette razor. But then I figured to put this thing to the test without any help. I followed the instructions of wetting my face and then lathering up with shave gel.    &lt;br /&gt;When I began, under the side burn, I felt absolutely no hair pull of any kind. I went up and down twice, with light pressure and could not believe what I saw. The hair was not only gone, but seemed to get grinded up into fine particles like dirt. &lt;br /&gt;It has not taken me the 30 days as mentioned in the manual to get used to this shaver. To say I have the best shave of my life is an under statement. &lt;br /&gt;Even if the replacement parts are a litlle more than other brands, I will gladly pay it. Time is money, and I will never have to buy razors and pre shave powder again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;T Moore</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before deciding on this shaver.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers  for 15-20 years so this was a change.  This was my first wet/dry shaver.  This one seems to take longer and more passes to get all the stubble. Cleaning is easy though.  I think next time I&#x27;ll try another Norelco model.  I like the 3 floating heads. I think they do a better job, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this item on a recommendation from a friend.  I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for a few years, and the expense of quality disposable blades, along with the mess of water and shaving gels and the like, well, it was getting really old.    If you are thinking of switching from disposable blades to this razor, you will probably be pleasantly surprised at just how close it can cut.  I have used several high end electric razors before and always been really disappointed in the rough and uneven result.  This razor will leave most of your skin just as smooth as a blade.    I use this thing totally dry - there are a couple of spots on my throat and under my jaw that it just can&#x27;t pick up.  I&#x27;ll flip up the straight blade piece and get pretty close with that.  It takes a little longer than using disposables - maybe 20 minutes in total.  I will usually jack up the volume on tv and do my shaving on the floor in front of an armchair.    Despite the fact that it takes a little longer and requires some mirror-maintenance at the end, I can&#x27;t bring myself to go back to disposables - and it&#x27;s not because of the cost savings.  It&#x27;s just less of a hassle to grab this thing, get the job the done, and move on.  I would recommend this as a replacement for disposables, but I&#x27;d also suggest you be patient and accept that it isn&#x27;t totally perfect.</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver was a Panasonic (that was over 15 years ago).  Since then I tried other brands, assuming that other companies who specialized in this market would have developed better performing products.  I found no other brand of shaver that gave me the same close, easy shave as that early Panasonic, so I recently went for this newer model after analyzing reviews.      Using this razor was like coming home; it gives me a close, clean, fast shave (with the assistance of shaving oil) and I really love it.  The motor is fast yet quiet, and using the cleaning mode with a little dab of hand soap is much more appealing and convenient than needing/using the base station (bulk) and cleaning fluid ($$$) -- especially for travel. That said, this shaver is on the large side and it&#x27;s a little pricey,  but I can easily overlook that for the performance and convenience Panasonic offers in this product.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few of these -- for different homes I have. Also got one for my son. It does a great job. This is the 3rd Panasonic linear shaver I have owned and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. I previously used a Braun, serviceable though unspectacular. The Panasonic is much lighter, cleans easier, and shaves much  closer. I have only used the shaver for about a month but I cut my shaving time considerably with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about a week.  I&#x27;ll start by pointing out that everyone&#x27;s face and beard are different, so your results may vary.  But for me, this razor gives me the best shave of any electric I&#x27;ve ever used.  The speed of the motor seems to be the biggest difference between this and other electrics I&#x27;ve used - it just goes, and keeps going ever after several minutes of shaving.  Previous electrics I&#x27;ve had, I would guess might have achieved maybe 1/3rd the speed, and that&#x27;s probably only for the first minute or so of shaving before the battery looses a bit of its edge.  This razor does such a better job at not leaving uncut wiskers, especially on my neck where my wiskers tend to curl a little and gave other electrics fits. The other big difference is that the shaving head tilts from side-to-side.  My last electric, a Braun self-cleaning model, had a head that titled forwards and backwards.  At least for my face, and the way I shave, the side-to-side tilt is much more helpful, especially for the chin, neck and moustache areas.  Another plus is that the main shaving head is maybe 20% wider than other models that I&#x27;ve used, and much wider than an earlier Panasonic wet/dry that I had - helps me shave my face in fewer passes.      There are only three slightly negative things I can say, but none are deal breakers: a) if you hold down the power button for a few seconds, it turns the motor on in &#x27;ultrasonic&#x27; mode for about 10 seconds, which is supposed to clean the blades.  It doesn&#x27;t, at least so far when I inspect the blades right before doing this and right after, I notice no change.  b) the trimmer on this model is only about 50% as wide as on other models I&#x27;ve used.  Actually, its good because its about the exact width of my sideburns, and it makes dealing with them much easier.  But on the bad side, in the past I&#x27;ve often used the trimmer on my neck area, where the narrow width of this one would be a disadvantage - but so far the main shaving head does sucha great job on my neck the trimmer has been unnecessary there.  c) if you look at the product photo, the blue areas on either side of the main handle are rubber, and it feels cheap.  I just got this shaver, but I&#x27;m guessing that down the raod the rubber is going to wear, crack, flake, dry, or come unglued from the shaver.</li>
            <li> I hope people are smart enough to read the bad reviews more than the good ones.  I like how quiet this shaver is, and it does shave as close as an electric can, BUT!...   you can&#x27;t take just the shaver on even a short three day trip without it running out of battery power.  The charger is HUGE so it&#x27;s a real pain to bring it along.  So as much as I like the shaver I am sending it back and keeping my ugly and noisier old Braun that can keep going for over a week on one charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for over a year now and I have replaced the blades only once, maybe twice.  I have owned 2 other Panasonic shavers before this one, and this is by far the best bang for the buck.  The best part is the battery still keeps a good charge.  Which is the only reason I had to replace my previous Panasonic&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  Excellent value.  Shaves as close as any shaver I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> i made the mistake of trying to shave my pubic area with this product. not a good idea.    you see, i am really, really hairy in the crotch area. i was tired of the razor burn i got associated with my single-blade womens disposable Bic razor . it worked well on the upper areas of my pubes, but when trying to shave the shaft (my shaft is hairy all the way up to the tip) and the testes, i got cut up like i had been using weed-eater. ouch!!! believe me, band-aids just don&#x27;t want to stick in this area. especially on those really  humid days...... what a pain!!!!    i never tried using this product on my face. i didn&#x27;t know it was intended for facial use. i like to shave my face with a single-blade womens disposable Bic razor.     other than those complaints, this baby is great!!!! it looks cool and sounds great, and feels good in your hand!!! oh, and the price is just right!!! this sucker is built like a tank!!    i highly recommend dropping the dough to buy this premium jap-built peice of shaving artillery!!!  BAM!</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 of these, the last for less than 1 1/2 years, and in both cases, one of the clips that hold the top part of the razor on has broken off, so that the screen pops off constantly. Knowing this might happen, I was very gentle with the second razor, but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 1 1/2 years for a $80+ razor is unacceptable. I will not get another Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> I was honestly wanting to like this, after all the great reviews. However, it&#x27;s been over 6 months and I really don&#x27;t like it. It takes forever to shave every morning. I have to go over spots on my neck 4-5 times different ways to get a clean shave. Once I&#x27;ve finally gotten a clean shave, it&#x27;s cut my skin so it bleeds as bad as if I used a blade. I kept thinking that I wasn&#x27;t using it right, but I&#x27;ve tried every direction and always end up the same. I used a cheap Norelco in the past, and think I&#x27;m going back. While it may not be quite as close as a shave, at least it doesn&#x27;t take 10 minutes and need a styptic pencil to stop the bleeding. I&#x27;ve never been a blade fan, but have even tried the Gilette fusion and I am quicker but more bleeding with this. I did give 2 stars intead of 1 because it eventually does give a close shave and the charge lasts a long time. The final straw was this morning when I accidentally dropped it in the sink, and now that pivot won&#x27;t work without making a horrible squealing noise.</li>
            <li> This shaver is well worth the money.  I have tried several different shavers, Remington, Braun and lately it was the Norelco Speed series. All of them were okay, but they always took so long and I never got a great shave.  The Braun worked the best but it took like 10 minutes to shave.  I had to go over each part of my face numerous times.  So I decided to try the Panasonic based on all of the good reviews.  Man were they right.  This is the best shaver I have ever owned.  I have now had the shaver a little over 2 weeks and I love it.  It now only takes 2-3 minutes to shave instead of 10.  It cuts much closer than any other shaver I have owned and it even gets the hairs on my neck.  Also, I did not have any adjustment period at all with this shaver.  From day one it felt great and never made my skin irriated at all.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Pros: works for face and head.  That&#x27;s right, if you are one of the many emerging head shavers, I would suggest this one.  Works both wet and dry.  I usually slap on some shaving gel before I shave.  It is easy as all get out to clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work for crap on my neck.  It either chews it up like cheap hamburger (back of the neck), or can&#x27;t give a smooth shave (under the chin).  So, i use a regular razor for the neck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a pretty great electric razor.  Use and maintenance make it a worthwhile addition to my morning routine.</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks. it turned on by itself while resting on the counter. It then entered turbo cleaning mode, shut off and repeated this cycle until the battery was drained many hours later. The buttons on the shaver would not work at al. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What really sucks is that I sent it to Panasonic for replacement (30 day trial period was up by just two weeks), and after 2 weeks, they notified me that replacements were on back order and not due in for 6-8 weeks. That was 4 weeeks ago. they would not send me a different model. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;mn now using the new 5 blade Gillette Fusion and it works great. No nicks or cuts or blood which always happened with any razor blade up to 3 blades in the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will I use the Panasonic replacement if and when it ever comes? Probably but I am very satisfied for the moment.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I must add that I loved shaving with the Panasonic. I did have to touch up a bit with a disposable blade razor as some areas were not as close as I wanted. But using it was a lot of fun. the shaving cream just disappeared into it and I still can&#x27;t figure out where it went. (I only used it for wet shaving.) It sucked off the cream like a vacuum. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s an excellent shaver if it works. And Panasonic service is the very worst I have ever encountered for any product I have owned.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shelly</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for 1 month and find it shaves faster and closer than my old Grundig. I like that I can clean it with ordinary liquid soap and do not need to buy special cleanser. I can get more than 10 shaves out of the battery (I have a light beard.) Since I have always used an electric razor, I did not require any \\&quot;adjustment\\&quot; time as other have indicated they needed. Having an electric razor that I can use in or out of the shower has been a real treat. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington for decades.  I finally got fed up for the third time when the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t stay in the down position. This Panasonic does a good job shaving, but the trimmer is only good for sideburns, it does a poor job timming mustaches.  The tilt feature is a gimmick.  The charge lasts a good amount of time with a little light indicating when it needs recharging.</li>
            <li> I have curly whiskers and sensitive skin. I&#x27;m still getting used to this razor after 3 weeks. It does a pretty good job of picking up longer curly whiskers and gives a close enough shave for me with great comfort shaving through fresh soap and water. I do find that I can get razor burn on my chin and I&#x27;m still working on that problem. My first wet shave electric razor and I like that - a comfortable shave and easy to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic I have purchased. I have also used Norelco and Remington.     This is the first one that I can honestly say shaves as close as a Razor can shave. I have delicate skin, especially under my neck. This gives me the least irritation I have user had, and after using it for a while, there is NO irritation.      I love the wet dry feature, which allows me to shave in the shower. The wet/dry feature also allows the people to throughly clean out  the razor with soap, water and the natural rotation of the blades.    Just simply the best.    Jon</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this Panasonic Linear would be better than the other ones that I&#x27;ve used over the years.  Really, it&#x27;s the same.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s not too expensive for a wet/dry shaver and that it IS a wet/dry shaver.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging stand and therefore doesn&#x27;t have a safe way to \\&quot;store\\&quot; it without the possibility of the thin metal parts bumping and bending.    As far as the shave goes, my skin type is not really conducive to a \\&quot;close\\&quot; shave.  It shaves closer than blades, but I still get a 5:00 shadow at noon (or sometimes 10am).  FYI:  Blades give me a 5:00 shadow as soon as the post-shave inflammation goes away.</li>
            <li> Alright there are plenty of good reviews here so I will keep mine quick and simple.    Pros:    1)  It recharges fast, feels light and good grip.  2)  The pivot head makes simple to shave around the neck.    Cons:  1)  Feels cheap.  I am comparing it with my Norelco.  2)  Charger:  Its HUGE!  Again comparing to my Norelco.  3)  Bag:  Its the cheapest thing I&#x27;ve EVER seen.  Useless.  My Norelco came with a nice leather bag and had a tight fit around my razor.  4)  No battery meter:  Although it claims to have a 5 minute emergency charge.    With this said, I regret not getting the cheaper ES4026 that was highly recommended by consumer reports.    http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES4026NC-Rechargeable-Double-Shaver/dp/B0001209OO/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;hpc&amp;qid&#x3D;1245198876&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1</li>
            <li> I really like using my Panasonic shaver, this is my second one (ES8043).  My first one lasted for nearly 5-years, as battery would only last about 4-5mins after charging - I only had to replace the foil once, primarily my fault when I dropped it in the sink.  The shaver is superior to any Braun shaver I have ever had in the past, and I had about 4 or 5 of those, but I would always spend a lot of money on the foils ($25-40 each).  I will continue buying the Panasonic over any Braun shaver, as it has been my personal experience the Panasonic is a better shaver and higher quality product for my daily shaving usage needs.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this purchase, however, the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave attracted me.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The Panasonic shaves quicker and closer than my Braun. I&#x27;m also still on my first charge.  Good looking unit that works as advertised.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was using an Oster clipper to keep my hair short.  After a year of that I decided I wanted my hair shorter.  I was worried about the potential irritation to my scalp from a razor so I decided to look for an electric razor.  This Panasonic received good ratings and was priced relatively low (compared to Braun for instance).  I&#x27;ve had it now for a few weeks and used it a handful of times.  I use it on my scalp only.  I find that it cuts well if I wait no more than three days between shavings.  If I wait longer than that, it doesn&#x27;t cut well and requires many passes to cut the hair.    When using this product I like to moisten my scalp with water.  The water helps to cool the scalp because the manual hand motion and especially the electric action of the Panasonic will heat up the scalp.  There is very little irritation when using the Panasonic.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to cut oneself when using properly- that means having the foil in place.  I&#x27;ve heard that if the foil is damaged through use or abuse, it&#x27;s then possible to cut oneself.  Of course it&#x27;s replaceable.  It is a very close shave but I think a little less close than a Gillette razor.  Charging is required every few shaves.  It only takes about a half hour to charge.  Self-cleaning under running water (with hand soap) appears to be simple and effective.    *****Update 11/22/08*****  I now use a Gillette razor to shave my head.  I only use this Panasonic on the back of my neck where I get ingrown hairs if I use a safety razor.  I&#x27;ve found that the razor is no more irritating and more effective than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have been a wet shave, blade guy forever..40 years....not anymore! The wet/dry feature was what attracted me. I can&#x27;t believe it. The wet shave is great and I&#x27;m dry shaving with this razor daily and have no irritation. My beard is heavy and the results are nothing short of remarkable. Even the \\&quot;hard to get to spots\\&quot; are no problem once you get the hang of it.  Gillette Fusion Power blades are really expensive...this product paid for itself in no time. I&#x27;m not going back to expensive blades and blood in the sink...love it! .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old cuss, having shaved for over 50 years, and I&#x27;ve owned every make of electric imaginable (even a Ronson).  I bought this shaver after the timely death of a Remington, which followed the timely death of a Braun, which followed the timely death of a Norelco, and on and on. None of the others even came close to the Panasonic. This shaver will shave my reasonably tough beard close in three minutes, including cleanup time, and it will do a mean \\&quot;three-dayer\\&quot; in only a little longer.  It seems to find all the nooks and crannies in my somewhat crinkly neck.  It almost never needs recharging.  Cleaning it is a piece of cake.  It&#x27;s light, compact, and easy to pack for travel.  I keep looking for some flaw in the design or function of this shaver, but I honestly can&#x27;t find any, except perhaps that my local stores don&#x27;t stock replacement heads.  (I bought an extra on-line.)  I use the shaver dry with pre-shave most of the time, but it&#x27;s especially effective after a shower or hot face wash.      My overall view:  I wouldn&#x27;t part with this shaver even if they had a recall on it.  It will never leave my medicine cabinet except in the company of my suitcase.</li>
            <li> I can get a very close shave, so close my beard isn&#x27;t rough, it&#x27;s great. Best shaver I ever bought, I now have two of them.</li>
            <li> Just works fine! this is the second one i got, the other one was a norelco and i realize that the panasonic it is just  better then the another one!!!  Barbeador incrivel!!!funciona mto bem, é rápido e nao machuca como o barbeador da concorrente e tem uma velocidade incrivel das laminas!!!</li>
            <li> I would rate my beard 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 on density of the hair and size. I came on here to buy another Panasonic razor after using this one for 3 years. This was my 3rd Panasonic W&amp;D razor I have owned a norelco rotory before,     This razor when it was new was fast and did not require a touch up with a razor. Near the end of its blade life I have to touch up frequantly and that is why I am buying another razor for the price of the replacement blade head and foil. I am expecting the new one I bought to last about 2 to 3 years.    These W&amp;D razors are worth the money and the convenience of being able to shave in the shower compared to the blades that now cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I have bought and used at least 4 different brands of electric shavers over the years. My latest one finally gave up so I decided to try this Panasonic for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is much better than most others I have tried. The main advantage is that it provides a much closer shave. I also like being able to use it wet or dry. Plus, cleaning it with liquid soap is easier and more efficient than trying to brush the heads clean. The only down side I can see is that the battery does not last quite as long as some other shavers. However, this is a minor inconvenience and not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read a few reviews saying they could not get a close shave or it cut their face. I have not had any of these problems. Yes, it does take time for your skin to adjust to a new razor. However, I had no irritation from day one. Plus, I am getting a very close shave. I thought that I would have some problems because of my fair skin and I have always had trouble getting all the hairs on my neck. But, I had no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I highly recommend this razor based on my personal experience.</li>
            <li> Starting way back when I was 14 years old I shaved strictly with bladed razors of various brands and styles. This lasted for about 26 years until I finally got tired of cutting myself and paying for throw away razors and blades. I finally switched to a rechargeable rotary which I used up until a month ago. I finally got tired of the long charge time necessary to get a full charge for it to last a few days worth of shaves. I chose the [[ASIN:B0009DT342 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver]] because of some of the reviews that I read, the short charge time and the price. After receiving the razor and trying it for about a month I was completely sold on this razor. Not only did it give me a much better shave than my previous rotaries it did not irritate my face in the least and my face and neck were smooth like when I shaved with the bladed razors. So far this razor has been successful in resolving all my shaving needs. Also as an added bonus, my wife says that it&#x27;s gently enough for her to allow me to shave her \\&quot;sensitive areas\\&quot; without any resulting razor burn. We are both extremely happy with the performance of this razor.</li>
            <li> I had the ES 8023 prior to this and it was great.  After several passes over all areas of my face this shaver does not get close.  AFTER I shave with the 8043sc, I then go over it with my $20 Remington to finish the shave.  Geez what is the story with this shaver?  It does hold a charge for 2+ weeks, it does have a nice feel, and it doesn&#x27;t pull or yank hairs due to high speed.  BUT DOES NOT give a close shave.  I have an average beard.</li>
            <li> I have owned every electric brand.  I rate this the best of all.  I thought the Braun Advantage did a good job, but this does even better with a whole lot less mess and noise.  I also owned a Norelco Smart Touch, but I have sent that to my son. &lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that Panasonic has really come close to a blade shave.  I use it dry. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased</li>
            <li> This is far and away the best electric shaver I have ever used.  It is light, comfortable to use, and shaves closer than a blade in hard to get to places and almost as close elsewhere.  I shave with lather and it is very confortable.  It takes me about 5 or 6 minutes per shave and the battery lasts for 12 or 13 shaves.  I used a Norelco rotary for many years.  It was good (dry shaver) but this new Panasonic is superior.  It is also superior to the older Panasonic ES8092 which was much heavier with shorter battery life.  What especially impresses me about the new shaver is its ability to cut neck hairs very closely.  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these and I love them.  They give a close shave without a burn, the blades last a long time and the floating head is great.</li>
            <li> Gives a very good &#x27;wet&#x27; shave--nearly as good as a blade.    Since it is a wet-dry razor, you won&#x27;t be able to shave with the power cord plugged in -- lest some yahoo attempts a corded shave while sitting in the tub.    The razor does have a charge gauge (in percent) to give you a good idea how much charge remains and the razor will charge up in 5-10 minutes sufficient to do a single shave.    Dry shaves are ordinary and not really any better than many other razors--but the wet shaves are great.  This is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> It cuts my whiskers close.  It trims sideburns and my neck nicely.  It works well in water and with shaving gel.  It holds a battery charge much longer than you&#x27;d expect.  It&#x27;s still as strong today as it was when I purchased it more than four years ago. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I found that Panasonic easily outclasses Bruan, Remington and Norelco. I replaced my old 8017 Panasonic Linear shaver with a fixed head with the 8043 and it blows the old model away.  I thought the pivoting head was more of a gimmick but it makes shaving easier, more comfortable, and produces a closer shave.  I also love the fact that I can clean the shaver using any soft soap and water instead of having to buy \\&quot;special\\&quot; cleansers for an automatic gizmo than is a countertop space hog.    CAVEAT: Don&#x27;t buy the replacement blade that Amazon is recommending to purchase with the ES8043SC. I bought it and had to return it because it isn&#x27;t made for this model.  I emailed Panasonic and the correct blade replacement is WES9064PC.</li>
            <li> After more than a decade with a pair of Norelco razors I had grown tired of the almost constant skin irritation on my neck and the pulling sensation I got when the batteries were wearing down or the heads were going dull.  I bought this Panasonic razor about a year ago and can&#x27;t beleive the difference.  I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with the skin irritation and the shave is much closer than I ever remember going around in circles.  In addition the motor is sealed so you can take this in the shower (don&#x27;t tell your wife or you&#x27;ll never see it again) and can clean it with simple soap and water.  I am never going back to going around in circles.</li>
            <li> first of all it didn&#x27;t fit in my hand very well. Although I do have small hands. The on botton is indented which makes it hard to find in the shower. It didn&#x27;t cut well under the sides of my chin. But actually I like the Panasonics and have a ES8807 which I love. In fact I&#x27;m buying another one for travel.    I&#x27;m very much impressed with Amazon&#x27;s return policy and just ordered this 2nd one from them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors for past 3 years.  This was my first try at the linear razor from Panasonic.  Been using it for the past 3 weeks and seems like a very good razor.  Less \\&quot;burns\\&quot; than the Norelco and zero nicks.   With the Norelco, pushing hard to get curved hairs always caused burns or small nicks, but that does not happen with this one.  Overall a good razor!</li>
            <li> I have owned two mid level Braun and two mid level Panasonic shavers before this one and I can say this Panasonic is by far the best.  It is the closest, fastest, and most comfortable shaver I have used.  Never having owned a shaver with a pivoting head, I was skeptical, but it actually improves the shave.    The only thing I can find wrong with this shaver is it is a little difficult to clean.  It&#x27;s not a deal breaker by far, but I understand why one of those slightly expensive automatic shaver cleaners would work well.    I&#x27;m going to guess a high end Braun might work just as well as this shaver, but I have always liked Panasonic a little better.</li>
            <li> The ES8043SC works as advertised. Works well both wet and dry.  Used on a daily basis for face and head shaving.  Provides a close shave and have not had irritation or bumps that i have had with other shavers (Braun).  Battery lasts about a week before recharge needed so far (6-10 minutes)  Ability to clean with hand soup and running water is very nice and cost effective.  No complaints so far after 2 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned and the price can&#x27;t be beat. It provides a close, comfortable shave, the battery life is excellent (2-3 weeks), and in the over 2 years I&#x27;ve owned it I have never once had to replace the screen head or the blades. The circular rotary blade types are not an option for me because they don&#x27;t shave close enough. I used to own one of the Remington triple foil microscreens but the stupid screens were so thin and flimsy that holes would show up within a couple months of use and replacing those screens at $25 a pop was a complete waste of money. I don&#x27;t think it shaved any closer than the Panasonic anyway, so the extra thinness is just a pointless marketing thing.    The only downside is that you can&#x27;t shave when it is plugged in. However, within a minute or two of charging it will have enough juice for one shave so for me this is not an inconvenience.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic razor is the best ever!  Can be used wet or dry, and is a snap to clean.</li>
            <li> A great little wet or dry rechargeable shaver for the money.  I got it in record time and it works great.  It shaves really close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor about six months and it works great. i dislike the cost of blades though.</li>
            <li> This is my 5th electric shaver, and definitely the best I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;ve tried Remingtons, Norelcos, and Brauns, and this Panasonic out-performs all of them. The only down side is the noise, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. This shaver cuts very close wet or dry, cleans easily and seems to hold a charge forever.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipped promptly!  Razor works great so far.  Smooth shave, low noise, easy clean up.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Norelco and Brawn but this Panasonic is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> It has been three years now using this shaver, and I would never go back to another brand. It shaves clean and close in less time than any I&#x27;ve owned, and its shape and weight makes it comfortable to use.     There is no need for the added-expense cleaning kit, as it cleans itself with soap and water, unlike many other models.     The only complaints I have are:  1) with the cheap travel bag, which does not hold the charger. A minor drawback.   2) the motor sound takes some getting used to, as it is a high pitched whine.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver does work, but its outside finish and design is not appropriate to an eighty bucks price.  &lt;br /&gt;Also, the motor&#x27;s sound makes a high whining noise. &lt;br /&gt;Returned it.</li>
            <li> Read some of the reviews on Amazon, bought this shaver and it gives a really great shave.  I also found that it gets better has your face adapts and gets used to it. Someone said that it was loud, and I don&#x27;t find that to be true.  Everyone is gonna have different levels of expectations.  I love that is sooo easy to clean, which was one of the things I hated in my last electric. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Shavers fall into two categories, those who prefer rotaries like the Norelco and those who prefer foil shavers.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For those of you who like foil shavers, this is the one for you!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned the latest Braun 8985 and it was excellent, while it lasted... The charger kept breaking on me (once in the first month [11/2006], then another time 4 months later [3/2007]). It was expensive, and the refills were a pain, pricey, but they worked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After two exchanges I decided to try the norelco 8140XL (speed XL)rotaries, and while they shaved really close, they tore up my neck. The problem only got worse. Returned 3 weeks later. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just got the Panasonic and can say that it definitely shaves closer than both of the tried razors. They shave MUCH faster than the Braun and Norelcos. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I like the \\&quot;side to side\\&quot; pivoting head, only time will tell. The heads don&#x27;t pivot up and down as much as the Braun, but once again, time will tell if this is necessary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One MAJOR advantage is that it cleans with soap and water... No expensive refills to hassle over. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The panasonic has two noticeable downsides: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s louder than other shavers, but who cares? It shaves incredibly fast anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. You can&#x27;t plug it in and shave... You have to wait until the battery is charged and charger is disconnected to turn it on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite razor by far.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have been converted. For over 15 years now I lived with a razor. I have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too. I am the kind of guy that gets a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon. I have used every single type of razor out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type and from the one blade to the 5+1 blade. I have tried all the brands and ended up feeling the Gillette brand is the best type of razor, but now I find it&#x27;s not the best shave. I used an electric shaver several years back, it was one of the top of the line Norelco with the incorporated gel. It gave me a pretty bad razor burn and did not get all the hairs; I ended up having to shave as normal. --TRUE STORY-- I am a Manager at my job and on my last annual review the only item I was marked bad was my personal appearance. Not that I dress bad or not wear deodorant, but that they felt I didn&#x27;t shave often. (I shave at the very least every other day, usually every day). So I felt I had to so something about it. I researched electric shavers thinking I could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer. I found that Panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced and had all the features the expensive models had. The instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30 days to get used to any new shaving method and they assure you will love the Panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut. I have been using it for almost 30 days now, and I will not live without it. I have NEVER had this close of a shave before. I can actually go 2 days without getting a shadow. My fiancé has found a new love for touching my face, and I seem to be getting more kisses too! During the first 2 weeks I had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old Gillette, but today officially I was able to through my Gillette away for good. (My boss has even asked what I am doing different and when Itold him, he went out and bought one too, he also loves it now. My fiancé said she would leave me if I stopped using the Panasonic, it&#x27;s a good thing Panasonic has been around for decades) So, I am raving about his product, but every good has its bad... what the bad? Well, it gets a couple of weeks to get used to the shave, but for the amount of time I am planning to use it and the money I am saving from buying razors every month, I can handle that. The cleaning system is very good, but it takes very long to clean (2-3 hrs) and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles. The cleaning cartage is said to last 3 months whether you use it once a day or one a week. I have not gotten to that point yet, but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash. I just end up using the base for the drying cycle, which is an option. The batter is very good. In the month I have used it, I have charged it twice but it really didn&#x27;t need it as it said the charge was good. Overall... excellent product. Could there be a better shaver out there, maybe, will I ever know... at this time, I am not worried about it, I am very satisfied with this Panasonic, and don&#x27;t think it can get any better. This product does not include the cleaning base. I do recommend it as even if you don&#x27;t use it to clean the razor, you can use it to dry it, it will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent them from rusting when air drying. But, if you are looking to save money and get an excellent razor, this is it!</li>
            <li> Was used to a braun shaver but this item is really nice.. Easier to clean and can be used wet or dry.  Its very fast and shaves very close but it takes a few more strokes to get around the neck.  Ive had it for about a month and only have charges it around 3 times, i would certainly buy another if i needed too.</li>
            <li> Does not cut close enough.  Only maintains a charge for 3 shaves and then is completely discharged. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am extremely unhappy particularly as I was unable to return it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought a really nice Panasonic \\&quot;Smooth Operator\\&quot; razor years ago, and it&#x27;s been GREAT. I thought after 4 YEARS of using it I should get an updated model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one and it turned out to be a light weight cheapo plastic razor. Come on Panasonic... This thing is cheap. It shaves OK but it&#x27;s a leightweight cheap little thing that should sell for about $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not $79.99!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased to use in the shower. Works very well but I still shave my neck with a razor.  Holds a charge for a very long time.  My wife dropped my first one, I purched the same model again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this shaver after spending a year desperately wanting to like my Norelco, which gave me razor burn on my neck, and was a pain to clean, not to mention a not very close shave after a month of replacing the heads. After using this for 2-3 weeks, I don&#x27;t dread shaving any more. Feels solid, not too loud (higher-pitched motor sound, not lawn-motory). Cuts about 99% of my face and 95% of my neck on the first pass. 3 passes and 2 minutes gets me smooth, without a hint of razor burn. I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, but it does grow a bit sideways on the neck, and this handles just as good as any other new foil I&#x27;ve tried. I rise it under tap water to clean it out after every other shave. No brushes... it&#x27;s nice. Trimmer in back is small, and I&#x27;d prefer it to be in front, but it&#x27;s sharp and works very well keeping my sideburns in check. All in all, I&#x27;d give it an 87 out of 100 for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Panasonic Wet/Dry owner for many years and love the ability to shave in the shower. Like all Wet/Dry shavers, you have to use it for a week or so to get your face use to it. For the price this ES8043SC model is well worth it. Thumbs up, way up for this model.</li>
            <li> I just got it yesterday.  The best electric shaver I have ever used, and I have had plenty of them.  No electric shaver will give a shave as close as a blade, but this Panasonic comes the closest.  Great shaver!</li>
            <li> I got this shaver for Christmas, so I figured a review after 3+ months of use would be of use to people looking to buy this shaver.  I have found the shaver to be an excellent gift.  It shaves with ease and speed.  My skin has never been irritated after shaving, which is very nice - no red bumps, no friction burns.  The fact that the shaver&#x27;s head pivots and \\&quot;curves\\&quot; makes it great.  The shaver was made with excellent quality - no cheap parts, has a very solid feel.  Cleaning is a breeze, and being able to use it in the shower is something some people may like (I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, probably won&#x27;t since I don&#x27;t have a mirror in there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are the occasional lose hairs on my neck that don&#x27;t get picked up, but I have noticed that with every shaver and I wasn&#x27;t expecting that to change.  Besides, it&#x27;s not a hassle to grab the razor out of the medicine cabinet and make a single pass along my neck to clean up any misses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this shaver for anyone looking for a good, clean, fast shave day after day (which I guess is everyone).</li>
            <li> For many years now I have been using a relatively simple Panasonic ES7016 wet/dry razor. I used another wet/dry Panasonic before that although I don&#x27;t have it any more to give it&#x27;s model number. The first one was a little better than the ES7016 but I have to say for a razor that cost me one-third the price of the ES8043SC and not having the pivot head and linear motor, I prefer the clunky &#x27;brick&#x27;-like ES7016. I&#x27;ll keep the new one but it just takes many more passes to get what the older ones were able to shave off.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver 4 weeks ago and I am still amazed at its speed and the quality of the shave. My wife gave me a Norelco Spectra 8892 xl as a Christmas gift in 2002. It seemed like an upgrade compared to using a razor blade and only shaving 2 or 3 times a week. It was a good starter electric shaver until I found out she spent $180.00 After it started to die and after replacing the heads a few times I decided to part with it. So here we are in 2008 and found myself struggling to shave without major touch ups with a disposal blade. After reading the reviews I researched Panasonic linear shavers. The one reviewed in Consumer Reports as a \\&quot;best buy\\&quot; was unavailabe at the time. I won&#x27;t say I settled on my Panasonic it is more than I dreamed. First cleaning is a snap, no messy expensive alcohol cleaners, just soap and water. Second speed, this thing vibrates rotates at an unreal speed, giving a quick shave. And third this thing shaves  my face as close as a blade. I still have the occasional hair that will lay down and not get cut, for that I still use my thirty cent Bic.I don&#x27;t think an electric shaver will ever be made that won&#x27;t require some touch up with a blade. But after owning 4 electric shavers the Norelco being the only other shaver I used on a daily basis this shaver blows them all out of the water. Forget the fact that this model costs around $65.00 it is three times cheaper than the Braun, it is $115.00 cheaper than my Norelco and it works great. It has become a pleasure to shave daily. I had charged it out of the box and that charge lasted 3 weeks. If I have any complaints they are the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a digital display to let you know how much charge is left. I also don&#x27;t like the fact you can&#x27;t shave while its plugged in. But like I said those are minor complaints I now overlook due to the fact the shave is so darn good. I would definitely reccomend this shaver for quality of shave and it&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li> I have owned Braun and Remington shavers, as well as other Panasonics.  This is the best one so far.  Lightweight, easy to use, and does a great job.</li>
            <li> This shaver has strengths and weaknesses.      Strengths: It is fairly good shaver, that works quickly, wet or dry.    Weaknesses: The extension for sideburns or other hair is almost worthless, and the razor has trouble picking up some neck hair, even after repeated passes.    Overall, a good value for the money, and performs as well as the 300 dollar Braun (which I had).</li>
            <li> After five months of use, I figured I could finally weigh in.    First, some background...I purchased a Panasonic ES-8066 in &#x27;01 to replace a single-head Braun whose battery had given out after six or seven years.  I loved the dual-head 8066, and it stayed sharp and effective for five years on my medium beard.  When the blades began to dull, I ordered new ones from an aftermarket company on Amazon.  I was dismayed to find that the new blades were totally different than the originals on the 8066.      The original blades actually looked like blades.  Each head consisted of an array of vertical blades arranged in parallel.  The replacements looked like some sort of screen, with the edges arranged horizontally.  They didn&#x27;t work worth a flip.    Silly me, I thought, not buying new blades from Panasonic in the first place.  So, I returned the first pair and bought a second pair, this time from Panasonic.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the genuine Panasonic replacement blades looked exactly like the \\&quot;screen\\&quot; blade design of the first aftermarket pair.  And they didn&#x27;t work any better.  In fact, they didn&#x27;t work as well as the old dull blades in the 8066, which I re-installed.      I continued to use the old, original blades for another two years, (removing them daily and keeping them stored under a small pyramid, believe it or not...sounds weird, but those blades lasted seven years).  Finally, when the screen on the 8066 developed a hole, I was faced with a choice.  Either buy a new $32 screen for a seven year old shaver with tired blades, or buy a new shaver for $72.     Based on reviews, I went with the ES-8043SC, only to discover that the new shaver has the new version blades.  Now, why Panasonic has changed their blade design, I&#x27;ll never understand.  I still prefer the old style blades and the feel of the 8066.  It just felt like a closer shave.    Also, the 8066 rested in a basic charging base (not a cleaning unit, which I wouldn&#x27;t care to mess with). The 8043 charging/storing method with a plug in the end is annoying, and I don&#x27;t have room to leave it lying there plugged in. It makes about as much sense as having a Sonicare toothbrush that had a plug in the end rather than a charging base.  And the narrow end of the 8043 makes it extremely unstable standing on the counter among the other appliances when not plugged in.    Also, the blades on the 8066 came off easily to clean, (and store under the pyramid).  I still haven&#x27;t been able to get the blades off of the 8043, and I&#x27;m afraid if I try any harder I&#x27;ll break something.    The trimmer on the new 8043 is situated at a crazy angle, and is not as useful as the one on the 8066.  The movable nature of the top third of the shaver doesn&#x27;t do anything for me, and I keep it locked.  The on/off button is right where my thumb usually rests, and I continually switch it off accidentally.    I give the 8043 three stars.  It works fine, but is not as convenient.  Though it&#x27;s long gone, I still prefer my old ES-8066.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 30 years and have tried all the different brands and styles. From Braun foil to the Norelco rotary and Panasonic always won out in comfort and durability. The last Panny I owned was an 1800 series. (I can&#x27;t remember it lasted so long) I&#x27;ve had it well over 5 yrs and only had to replace the blades once. Now the battery isn&#x27;t holding a charge very long anymore and it&#x27;s due for some new blades. So. with the price of the blades and foil around $50, I thought it&#x27;s time to replace it.    I&#x27;ve always shaved dry and got a clean cut with no pulls. This new Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry shaver is a down grade from their previous models. After 2 months I still get razor burn and have be careful when going against the grain because this baby will burn you! I also have to make more passes over the same place to get all the hairs. (and I have a very thin beard and shave only every other day) Granted, they do say this has the sharpest blades in the market, but do we really need them to be soooo sharp that they cut skin??    I gave this razor 3 stars because it does cut, but not as easy and gentle as older Panny models. I hope I get used to this soon. Also, for those who say this shaver is loud....that&#x27;s a bunch of bunk. This is one of the quietest electrics I&#x27;ve owned in 30 yrs.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for the money. It comes with a lithium battery which gives it more power and more time between charges, probably the only shaver under $125 to come with this battery. I&#x27;ve owned nearly every shaver brand over the years and I like panasonic the best. They shave better and last longer. The only gripe that I have is this model has a pop up trimmer as opposed to a slide up. The slide up trimmer was excellent for those difficult neck hairs that lay down flat to the skin. The pop up is better for side burns though.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic Linear shaver for several years with good results. I replaced it with the Pro-Curve because of the pivoting head and have experienced the same quality of shaves. Pros of the Pro-Curve: pivoting head, better shave than blades, ability to shave in the shower, good price. Cons of the Pro-Curve: doesn&#x27;t have the induction battery charging, takes longer to get close shave than blades. Helpful hints: use a liquid pre-shave (the gooey kind works better than lectric-shave) or shave in the shower   and use shower gel instead of shaving cream. As with all electrics, you will have to \\&quot;chase around\\&quot; a few stray hairs. I use a blade every week or so to get those.</li>
            <li> Obviously a strange comparison that teases the mind for further explanation. May I suggest a test drive that will encompass all aspects of a thorough trial. First,the equipment: exceptionally well engineered for the intended purpose. Sleek design that beckons a ,try me, hands-on approach. Well placed highly responsive controls that cover all requirements.  An all seasons wet or dry duty kind of animal with respected heritage. Floating heads with firm or soft ride really make the difference where the linear activated blades meet the whiskers.  Of course the real issue is the resultant tribute to a supremely close and comfortable shave.  My last experience with electric shavers ended my lust for one during the 1950&#x27;s. Baskets of used blades and mountains of lather have been my constant companions until recently at which point I dared to explore mans&#x27; progression as a species.  Can you believe? Technology, innovation, divine inspiration, dare to achieve. There is hope yet for our survival as I base my conclusion solely on the benefits of being able to finally enjoy without hassel or fear \\&quot;The Joy Of Shaving\\&quot;. The system that works best for me is to soften my whiskers with warm water and soap, rinse, then apply a 50/50 mix of shaving gel and penetrating lotion. I call this my 98% shave (as compared to a blade shave). Without hesitation I can say this has been my favorite, if not best, purchase from Amazon. Perhaps this has been a simple evaluation but none the less one that has passed all tests with ease.</li>
            <li> Please note that any electric razor requires at least 10 days use in order to properly condition the skin so that you can have a good shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Panasonic ES8043 for about 20 days now and it still tears my face to shreds every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay clear of this device unless you have stubble like a porcupine, it&#x27;s like French kissing jaws.  The worst part is that no matter how bad you let it tear at you, you still have stubble left that no amount of choppi.. shaving will remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this must be one of those devices left over from the Spanish inquisition.</li>
            <li> This shaver has done an excellent job!!  Smooth cut, great power and durable.  I have had several shavers in the last 6 months and all did not even come close in comparison.  The price has went up since I bought mine but well worth it.  It did such a great job I bought my Dad one.  Overall.......Superb!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic cordless wet-dry shaver I&#x27;ve owned - the 1st one lasted 10 years - this one is even better than my 1st one.  Hopefully it&#x27;ll last another 10 years.</li>
            <li> Some of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric razor. Easy to use and clean.  Holds a charge for around 7-10 days worth of shaves and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor about 2 months now, so my face is pretty well adjusted to the switch from a blade shave (Gillette Fusion).  I still can shave more of my face, especially the concave areas, slightly closer with blades than this electric, but it&#x27;s close enough and faster.    My only issue is charge retention.  The razor gave me about 20 shaves after the initial charge, but after the 2nd I got about 5 before it was drained - an annoying surprise on a business trip.  I hand&#x27;t used it for about a week following the full recharge, but I would have expected it to retain energy when not in use.  I&#x27;m reviewing th owner&#x27;s manual to see if it&#x27;s me.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a replacement for one lost in a luggage screw-up on a recent plane trip.  It&#x27;s the same brand (Panasonic) but a different model.  I was always pleased with the old one, but hoping it wasn&#x27;t just a fluke... It wasn&#x27;t.  Panasonic still lives high on my list for quality products.  Good performance, long-lasting battery charge, durable, performs just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am very prone to ingrown hairs, so regular razors and \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; electrics are not good for me. I have used Panasonic wet/dry shavers in the shower for years now, and have always been pleased. This model is the first I have used with the movable head, and it it a nice addition to help prevent accidental razor burn.  It cleans easily, and has a surprisingly long charge. If you want to start using an electric in the shower, get one of these models, you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> After years of shaving with a blade, I decided about six months ago to switch to an electric, because I thought it would be better for my eczema-prone skin. I had never used an electric before, and I therefore had lots of homework to do. Eventually, I settled on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- can be used in the shower&lt;br /&gt;- can be used with face/shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;- can easily be cleaned with water&lt;br /&gt;- multi-voltage charger (can be used in other countries)&lt;br /&gt;- quality and relatively long-lasting battery&lt;br /&gt;- razor quality and speed stays constant even as the battery charge decreases&lt;br /&gt;- very good trimmer&lt;br /&gt;- sturdy casing, easy to hold with wet hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor Shopper Beware:&lt;br /&gt;- cleaning systems are a marketing gimmick, they do not clean any better than soap and water; the alcohol and chemicals used in cleaning systems can in fact be bad for your skin&lt;br /&gt;- many electric razors sold in the US are crippled of their multivoltage capability; counterpart models sold in other continents often do have multivoltage capability&lt;br /&gt;- shaves-per-second, vibrations per second: these are meaningless statistics that are almost marketing fraud&lt;br /&gt;- Panasonic sells a model just like this one, but without the trimmer. Panasonic calls it the \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; model.  This is a gimmick, because the model with the trimmer is also hypoallergenic. Actually, just about all good electric razors are hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;- manufacturers use a multitude of intentionally confusing model numbers in order to sell the same razors to different \\&quot;marketing segments\\&quot; at different prices. You will have difficulty shopping on model number. Shop on manufacturer and feature set, because model numbers could be different for practically identical razors. [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On using an electric razor&lt;br /&gt;- I was surprised at how close it shaves. Genuinely as close as a blade&lt;br /&gt;- Give your face a week or two to get used to the electric, if you were previously using a blade. Your skin must get used to it. Also, your facial hair will grow in a different direction (unnoticeable to the eye)&lt;br /&gt;- The razor foil on this model is supposed to last for a relatively long time. Overall, using this electric razor is far cheaper than Gillette models that rake in huge profit on their blades.</li>
            <li> For a few years I tried a couple different Norelco razors and they did not cut it.  My 5 o&#x27;clock shadow was back by noon.  So I switched back to blades and cream.  But after two years of expenses associated with that system and all the cuts and blood lost, I decided to try this one based on the reviews and because it was a straight head, not the round lift and cut system.    The manufacturer tells you to shave with it for a month before you rate the results; they say that is how long it takes your face to get use to a new shaving system.  It took about 2 weeks and I realized how great this product is.  If a razor and cream is a 10 for closeness, then this is 9.5.  Best of all, it pays for itself in less then a year.  And instead of shaving for 10 minutes every morning, I can do it in about 4-5 minutes.  I use it dry, right after my shower, but wet the neck area, this seems to get a closer shave.  You can also use shaving cream with it, but I have never tried it.  Clean up is a snap, soap and water; none of the soaking the heads in a special cleaner and spaying down the razor like Norelco made you do. This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic wet/dry shaver, from my experence, shaves closer than a blade, and I have a tough beard. I use it wet only...if this shaver hold up for the long run, I will never use a blade again. The blade and screen are expensive but it would be worth it. I had several othe electric shavers in the past including a wet/dry Panasonic but this one is so much better.    I can&#x27;t help but give this great shaver 5 stars. I fact I ordered another one after I use this one for a month as it was on sale at Amazon. Amazon it really good too.</li>
            <li> Hands down best electric on the market.  Takes 1 - 2 swipes over an area of my face to get it clean.  It pretty much is as smooth as when I use a real razor.    After reading the reviews on amazon for the other electronic razors I knew I made the right choice.  Worth every penny.    Oh and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a panasonic linear for over 15 years.  In this time, I&#x27;ve had 2 (still on my second now).  When I bought my second about 2 years ago, I also bought the latest greatest rotary and did a side-by-side comparison because the rotary advertisments are so compelling.    No comparison.  I won&#x27;t bore you with the details, but the linear is superior in every way.  Speed of shave, closeness of shave, quickness &amp; hold of charge, and cleaning.  Don&#x27;t even think about a rotary, I&#x27;m 100% sure you&#x27;ll love the linear.  Get a wet/dry - - these are great for the shower which gets the shave very close to a blade when used in with soap &amp; water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and it works really well - the head pivots and everything. My only complaint would be that the blades seem to be really fine and it takes me a little while to do my whole face. But not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I have an unusual shaving situation. I have MRSA, which periodically creates facial lesions. Shaving with a blade in these circumstances can be quite painful and often causes a lot of bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to switch from the best of Gillette&#x27;s systems to an electric razor. I have used Remington and Norelco before and have not been satisfied with them. I weeded down my choices to a Braun at the same price level and the Panasonic razor. I decided not to get anything with a charging stand or a self-cleaning system, since these appeared to be something of a nuisance, cost more, and did not add to the overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally picked the Panasonic. The reviews were somewhat more positive, the shaver was somewhat higher in the popularity ratings, and the shaver design was distinctly more stylish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I made the right decision. This shaver is not only a great value, but it shaves extremely well for an electric shaver. In dry mode, it is about as good as a generic three-blade system such as that from CVS. In wet mode with shaving gel, it is almost a match for Gillette&#x27;s vibrating razors; there is somewhat more skin irritation in this mode, but it&#x27;s not to an unusual degree. The Panasonic shaver is clearly the winner hands-down on economics. Blades just cost too much right now, and they don&#x27;t last long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the shaver on beards ranging from one day to three days old. It performs well in all these circumstances. Heavier beards might require a bit more time, but I have not found this to be significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that the speed and pivot head are advantages; the speed in particular makes for a very comfortable and fast shave. Unlike some others, I do not find that hairs are left requiring a blade razor. The lack of an LCD screen showing remaining charge is pretty irrelevant--I might as well ask for one showing weather reports.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic after trying out a new braun to replace my last one.  I&#x27;ve used Braun for the last 14 years!   I have had the new shaver for 2 weeks and it is perfect.  It cuts so close, can shave even when my face is still damp or with shaving cream.   Although I cut myself once, it was only because I was using too much pressure.  If you allow the shaver to glide over your skin, it does all of the work.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds a charge forever.  I look forward to having this shaver a long time.  Sorry Braun.</li>
            <li> I have had less expensive, single head panasonic shavers in the past that I liked.  I thought by spending more money I would get a better shaver.  Not so.  I can&#x27;t get a decent shave from this shaver, even though I have a light beard.  I also find it clumsy to use.  I have a $10.00 shaver purchased from a major drug store (advertised \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot;) that gives a better shave but has too small a head.  I bought it for emergency use and  didn&#x27;t expect much.  I expected more from Panasonic but this shaver just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> For the money spent it does an ok job.  I had a different model previously that cost $200 and shaved quicker with a wider blade</li>
            <li> I replaced a cheap 3 head shaver with this one. This one works much better. Before I would shave with the electric and have to go back over everything with a razor to get even a reasonably close shave. With the ES8043SC I can do the whole job with just the shaver. It&#x27;s not a perfect razor close shave but it does a decent job for the price.     One problem I had was trying to shave with a damp face. When your face is damp the shaver doesn&#x27;t glide across your face as easy and it is difficult to get a good shave, though I haven&#x27;t tried it yet fully lathered so it may work better that way and it works well enough with a dry face. It doesn&#x27;t cause a lot of skin irritation for me either way, but that could be because I was already used to using an electric razor.    There are two models of this shaver. They are identical except that this one doesn&#x27;t come with the base. I was worried at first that the lack of the cleaning base would be annoying but, it hasn&#x27;t really been a problem. It is easy to clean and the lady friend likes the extra counter space. Overall, I would say that it is a good purchase if you aren&#x27;t looking to spend a ton of money on a fancier one.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth Panasonic wet/dry shaver I&#x27;ve bought. They usually die after about 3 years because of battery problems. The last three all had inductive loop chargers. Panasonic have gone back to a plug-in charger which allows room for a bigger battery. Now I get two weeks of shaves on a charge rather than 4 days.    Very good product before, I&#x27;d now rate excellent. Shaves well, too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace an older Panasonic (Model ES7018) that had served me well for many years.  This new shaver is much improved over the older one.  I especially like the speed of the motor and it is much quieter.  I use wet shaving and find I can get a good close shave much faster than before.  This shaver model does not come with a stand for charging and, if I had known, I would have gotten the ES8044 instead.  There is a charging cord that plugs into the bottom so the shaver has to be placed on it&#x27;s side.  Depending on where it is stored, it&#x27;s more susceptible to damage.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to shave my head.  After reading numerous positive reviews, I ordered it.  I am very happy with it.  Sometimes I just like to get away from the razor blades, and have no worry about getting cut.  This razor fits the bill.  Actually, I couldn&#x27;t believe how close a shave it gives, better then I ever expected, since I never used an electric shavor at all before.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for the money.Shaves as good as braun and doesn&#x27;t burn face like remington.Really good on neck hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Norelco Spectra series (now discontinued and replaced by an even newer series) but I&#x27;ve been much more impressed with this shaver. As other reviewers have said elsewhere, the type of electric shaver -- rotary or foil -- that works best for you will totally depend on your skin type and your beard. I can&#x27;t tell you which one to buy. I can say that a foil shaver will be my choice in the futute, and this Panasonic has delivered impressive results for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My own beard is thick in places and the hairs themselves tend to be quite coarse. I have a long, angular face, and the skin on my neck tends to be quite sensitive. I always cut my neck when I shave with blades -- and I do mean always, even using the superior Mach 3 -- and the Norelco gives me a pretty good razor burn on my neck unless I&#x27;m very careful.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I had no problems at all with the Panasonic. I have nicked myself once or twice but not severely, and it&#x27;s more of a fluke. There&#x27;s no accompanying irritation or razor burn; I must just have held the shaver incorrectly. By comparison, the Norelco will really chew up my neck if I want to get a close shave. I think the Norelco worked well when I first bought it, but the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; heads become clogged with hair fairly quickly and can be difficult to clean. The Panasonic seems much more straightforward: There are blades, they move, they cut your beard. As I said, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back to a rotary shaver again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the 8043 is of the same series as the more expensive 8077 model with the cleaning station. There are a number of other models in the same series, such as the 8044. The bottom line is that the cutting head on all these shavers is identical. The replacement parts are the same and you will get the same shave. The models differ in terms of minor features. For example, the 8077, in addition to the cleaning station, has a more detailed battery-charge readout. The 8043 just has an LED that tells you it&#x27;s time to recharge. I expect the battery life is longer on the 8077 as well, though the 8043 lasts several shaves on one charge and it recharges rapidly. The cleaning station itself is unnecessary; every model has a high speed cleaning mode and can be cleaned up with liquid soap and water. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this product in the weeks since I bought it and it&#x27;s given me some of the nicest shaves I&#x27;ve had in a while.</li>
            <li> All you would like in a razor. Easy handling, Charge lasts almost forever,VERY close shave. Easy to clean and fast shave due to not having to go over areas more than once or twice.</li>
            <li> This was a gift I gave to my Dad, he is very happy (replacement to Norelco).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my new Panasonic shaver for a month now and love it.  I had an older Panasonic linear shaver before, and it served me well for quite a while.  The newer version tends to shave more closely in a single pass and holds a charge for at least an entire week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  I like being able to wash it with soap and water and not have to deal with those expensive alcohol based cleaners like the Brauns use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that the newer shaver does not have a charging stand; you simply plug the cord into the bottom of the shaver to recharge.  The base on the older version gave you a place to keep your shaver dry and made charging an automatic.  On the other hand, having a simple cord is easier when you travel.</li>
            <li> I have owned several panasonic razors and thought they were much better than the Braun razor I used previously. I don&#x27;t know what happened but this Panasonic is unusable. Not only does it not give a close shave but I cut myself constantly. I keep thinking I need to adjust my technique or need to get used to it but at this point I give up. This razor is going in the garbage and I won&#x27;t buy another Panasonic. Despite it being less than a month old Amazon won&#x27;t accept a return either. I would definitely avoid this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for about a decade now and this is the best one i&#x27;ve had so far... very smooth, very comfortable to hold, quiet (compared with others i&#x27;ve had), great battery life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;my only complaint is that it doesnt come with any kind of stand, which is odd since the base of the shaver is tapered and not very stable, you&#x27;d think they would have included one.... especially since the foils on these things are so fragile, getting knocked over is usually how they get knicks.  I called Panasonic just to let them know and they said they would send me out a stand free of charge, however 3-4 weeks later i&#x27;ve yet to receive it.</li>
            <li> Like others, I carefully went thru many reviews before choosing to buy this shaver from Panasonic.  &lt;br /&gt;My previous shaver, a Norelco, was going on the blink after many years of usage and I was keen to try out something new,  &lt;br /&gt;something different from the rotary shaving heads that I was used to.  &lt;br /&gt;More over, I wanted a shaver that could be cleaned easily with a little water and soap.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I looked at the Panasonic&#x27;s model that came with a charger and the cleaning &#x27;thingamajig&#x27; and decided it was not worth the extra 40-50 bucks. &lt;br /&gt;I then settled for the ES8043 model which I understand is the exact same thing as the models that have the charger stand etc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the shaver is a breeze!. Just smear a drop or two of hand washing soap on the outer foil guard and power the unit on under running water.  &lt;br /&gt;10 seconds later, turn the power off and remove the outer frame with the foil guard, exposing the cutter heads.  &lt;br /&gt;Now turn the power on again under the running water once more for another ten seconds and you&#x27;re all done. I rarely use the turbo power mode. &lt;br /&gt;Just clean the excess water with a soft cloth being careful not to touch the cutter heads. The shaver is now squeakly clean and ready for the next shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a light to medium growth of hair on my face and am able to get a clean smooth shave. Granted, the skin is a little sore after the shave, &lt;br /&gt;but this is to be expected, as all new shavers cause the razor burn problem that ususally goes away after a month or so of use.  &lt;br /&gt;Of course, YMMV! &lt;br /&gt;Personally, I am very happy with this shaver.  &lt;br /&gt;I got a good deal on the shaver. A week later I saw another store selling the same shaver with the price lower by $10.00.  &lt;br /&gt;A quick call to Amazon and the $10.00 was refunded with no questions! Can&#x27;t beat that for customer service!  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for another Panasonic razor.  This model has a charging converter which is at the plug, with a wire that plugs into the bottom of the shaver.  This model can deffinately go two weeks before charging, I just got back from Europe and had no problems with holding a charge.  The shaver even has a light to show you when the batteries are going low.  I am very happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.   The battery life is fantastic -- on a full charge on Sunday, I can use it for a whole week without any perceptible loss of power.  The quality of the shave is fantastic -- especially if used with some pre-shave gel, it gives a very close, comfortable shave without leaving my skin dry or irritated.   Ergonomics of the shaver are very well done, it is nice to hold, the cushion/pivoting of the shave head is neither too firm nor too soft, and overall, this is just a fantastic buy.  HIGHLY recommended in all regards!  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I echo the previous reviewer who rated this product highly for head shaving.  It works extremely well both wet and dry, although I have come to prefer dry as I have fine hair and it seems to stand up to be cut better when dry.  I am new to head shaving, so it took me quite a while to get a satisfactory shave the first time.  This quickly changed, and after only about 10 shaves, it is taking me no more than five minutes.  (Note: The hair on about 1/2 my head is sparse to non-existent.)  I had a little irritation on my neck the first time, but none since.  I can&#x27;t testify to its use in shaving one&#x27;s face, as I would not do such a thing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because I was disappointed in the performance of Norelco electric rotary shavers that I&#x27;ve tried.    Above the chin was okay, but below the chin proved to be problematic as multiple passes would have to be done to clip the whiskers, causing visible skin irritation.    Being fed up with the lackluster performance of the Norelcos, I decided that I needed to get a new electric razor.    I had previous experience with Remington (not impressed) so I skipped them.  That leaves Braun and Panasonic.    I ended up purchasing the Panasonic ES8043SC over other Panasonic and Braun models because of various benefits, including the wet/dry ability and being able to wash the cutting blade and foil by using just liquid soap and a little water instead of the cleaning base with expensive fluid cartridges.    Basically, the shave was almost perfect the first time I used this thing when shaving wet with cream. There were still some missed hairs that required shaving over again, but not as frequent or as uncomfortable as the Norelco shavers. Dry shaving was almost just as good with performance still superior to Norelco.    Although Panasonic insists that it may take a month to adapt to it, I feel like I&#x27;ve already gotten used to it; I think it&#x27;s because after suffering from the Norelco all this time, the Panasonic is a revelation in comparison, even on the first try!  If my face actually adapts, I can only imagine performance being better, even though it&#x27;s already good as it is!    The fact that I can fully charge the Panasonic&#x27;s battery in just one hour is a plus compared to the eight hours required of my last Norelco.    So, I think I may forgo the 30 day exchange.  As of now, I am convinced that this is the electric that works for me.</li>
            <li> After a lot of deliberation reading reviews,  this unit truly fits the bill.  Sharp, close shaving, pivot head, easy clean, holds a long charge, less expensive than a number of other razors, I am very satisfied.  I recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> Does a great job.    Only one problem. My 5 year old Panasonic shaver could be placed vertically on a small charging stand. With this model you have to pull out the charging cord from the shaver if you want to do a cordless shave. Which is why I purchased it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have always used foil-type shavers and bought this Panasonic as an \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to my older Braun Syncro.  Several of the design features are very nice - very quiet, light, ergo friendly.  The problem is the shave quality is not as good as I am used to and it PULLS HAIRS.  I can live with the so-so shave quality but this hair pulling is ridiculous and something that I have never had with other shavers.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if it is fully charged or not and it doesn&#x27;t matter how long I go between shaves - it always grabs some whiskers and yanks them out.  A real eye opener.  Anyway, I shaved with this shaver 12-15 times and gave up - I&#x27;m back to my noisy and worn out Braun.</li>
            <li> I just got my ES8043SC and I am extremely impresed.  This razor shaves better than any razor I have ever owned and I&#x27;ve tried all the brands ver the years including my Braun which this replaces.  It truly is a different product with its extremely fast cutting head and it shaves very closely, very quickly and with almost no pressure.   Wet/dry shave and cleans itself with liquid soap and water. Amazing product!  Just bought another one for my son for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have used this Panasonic 8043 for maybe 3 years now. It does not do the job nearly as well as my old ES7003 Panasonic. I use it but am not happy with it. Best thing I did was find a source that repairs or rebuilds or was able to get parts for my old Panasonic ES7003. I ordered new replacement batteries and fixed it myself. Outdoes the 8043 hands down. I have a Braun too that I use for sensitive areas (neck)etc and love it also. I have used the Norelco triple blade job. Don&#x27;t like it at all. We are all so different. I recommend for repairs or parts the Appliance Repair Center in San Francisco. Great service and will save your favorite shaver or any appliance that uses rechargable batteries.</li>
            <li> This wet/dry razor with a few drops of shave oil gives me the closest shave ever inside or outside the shower. Through the years I have used Braun, Norelco, Remington and Gilette razors with gels, creams etc. The others don&#x27;t come close to the Panasonic wet/dry shaver. I put a few drops of shave oil in the palm of my wet hand and rub my face and head (except the bald part!). I wet my face and head in the shower and shave. To clean up I use a line of liquid soap along the center of the razor and turn it on under running water and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> An excellent electric shaver -- the best I have used.  It gives close shaves without skin irratation or cuts.  Its only negative is that it is a little slower than others I have used and requires repeated passes to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for about one month now. My previous shaver was also a Panasonic, and it finally gave out after almost 10 years. I have to say that this shaver has the other one beat hands down. It&#x27;s been almost 15 years since I shaved with a blade, and this shaver gives me a shave that rivals the blade that I used to use. It&#x27;s very light to handle, and the pivoting head truly does conform to your face/neck line thus allowing for a more efficient shave. I shave 5-6 days/week, and since I have had this shaver, I have had to recharge it once. The cleaning process is very easy and quick. I use Panasonic&#x27;s recommended procedure once/week and it takes about 5 minutes. I have yet to use this shaver in the shower, so I can&#x27;t comment on its capability there. I read some reviews that complained about the noise that it makes, however I find that this one is quieter than my previous one. The only down side to this shaver (IMHO) is that the trimmer forces me to put my hand in an awkward position to use it. It may be that it&#x27;s just different from my previous shaver, and hopefully I&#x27;ll get used to it.    Overall, I don&#x27;t regret my purchase whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I thought i could shave at the speed of light :| (in 5 minutes or so). but it takes abt 20 minutes to get a decent shave, of course in shower. Maybe its because my face has some baby fat. i might try a lesser speed rotational shaver from norelco philips soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also i find that i could shave with just the trimmer at the back faster than with the shaver :|</li>
            <li> My second Panasonic wet/dry rasor. Hope this lasts as long as the other.It gave me years of good shaving. Took a while to get used to the pivot head.</li>
            <li> These shavers provide an excellent shave either wet (with gel shaving cream) or dry.  I have been using them for 15 years and can not find anything better...beats a blade every time.  Like all electric shavers, the foil dulls after about four months and should be replaced.  The blades should be replaced once a year.  Small price to pay for a great shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is heads and tails above the shaver I used to use.  The linear motor is very nice.  It does sound like a bumblebee, but since it cuts so nice, that part is easy to forget.    Many features like a locking/unlocking head are nice to have.  Trimmer works well.  Easy to clean out.  Good cut.  Long battery life.    Highly recommended and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic shavers for years. This new one is not as good as my old one but better than the alternative brands like Braun and Norelco. It is cheaper in construction and poorer in design than my previous Panasonic. I&#x27;m disappointed that Panasonic cuts corners to save pennies.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this razor every day, granted he researched it before I bought it.  It is easy to recharge and clean and does not require expensive refills on lotions and such to use. Looks nice, not too big nor small.</li>
            <li> I thought I had already done a review on this product. It was refurbished in panasonics mexico plant and arrived all plastic shrink wrapped with a one year warranty. I haven&#x27;t owned a electric shaver in decades so I thought I would give it a try with all the new technology,  it has been reviewed as the sharpest shave on the market. For the first 3 weeks use in the shower with lather or sink. Don&#x27;t dry shave it will burn you raw trust me. After three weeks you can but with it&#x27;s totally waterproof design the showers the only way to go.  Has a cleaning option and it completely cleans all hair and residue off on the foil and the blades.Doesn&#x27;t need charging very often and when it does it only takes 30 min max. The only problem I had is it didn&#x27;t work when i tried it. That&#x27;s because it won&#x27;t run when in the charging mode. I had to call panasonic to figure it out. Highly Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This may be the best electric razor I have ever owned.  It gives a good close shave with out irritating the skin.  The charge lasts a long time and it recharges quickly.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different brands of shavers in the past. I found the Panasonics to be the most durable, while still providing a close shave. So, ordered the ES8043SC and have been using it for a few weeks. It&#x27;s lighter and doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as past panasonic razors I&#x27;ve owned, but it gets the job done. And I have a thick facial hair. I don&#x27;t care for the pivot feature, which enables the head to move from side to side. I just press the button to lock it in place. Overall, I feel it&#x27;s a good razor for the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in 10 years.  They have come along way.  I have a thick beard and a job that requires me to have a clean shave.  This razor cuts as close as a Mach 3.   If your worried that your beard is too thick, don&#x27;t worry, they don&#x27;t get thicker than mine and this makes the cut.</li>
            <li> The shave is fine if you use a pre-conditioner.The motor is way too loud.It is light and durable.Good battery life</li>
            <li> This is only the second electric razor I have owned, so maybe it&#x27;s not saying a lot to claim it&#x27;s the best I  have ever used. However, I cannot say enough good things about this Panasonic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of its use is in the shower to shave my head. Previously, I&#x27;d do this with a regular razor in front of a mirror; invariably I&#x27;d nick myself, and the cleanup was a hassle. I ended up not shaving it regularly due to the trouble involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, I use the Pro Curve every other day, and it does a fantastic job. My scalp is a bit lumpy, so the pivot action is a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For face shaving, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there would be a downside, it would be shaving the neck area. However, this seems to be a common complaint of electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution: for the first few times you use this, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to have something like [[ASIN:B001FB5INM Nivea for Men Post Shave Balm, Cooling, 3.3-Ounce Container (Pack of 4)]] on hand. After a few uses, your scalp and face will get used to it ... at least mine did.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the swift, smooth, close, once-over shave he gets with  his new Panasonic ES8043SC shaver.  I wish it had a quieter sound to it, but he is done so quickly I can bear with it.</li>
            <li> Wet shave - good on face.    Dry shave - great on face.    Wet shave on neck - not good.    Dry shave on neck - alright.    BaTTERY LIFE - Awesome</li>
            <li> Quality razor cuts close with flexible head adjusting to face contours of face.  Overall, very happy with purchase.  Only negative is that it does not come with a carrying case for travel.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8043SC wet/dry shaver has met my expectations - set rather high from prior reviews. (It was on my Christmas list, replacing a Norelco that gave up the ghost in December.) I tried it dry a couple of times and it worked fine.  But once I tried it wet, I was hooked.  Great, close shave - no nicks, no irritation, just a great close shave. Battery seems to last longer between charges than indicated in the manual, but maybe that&#x27;s just because shaving is so quick.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver in Aug 09 after reading the reviews on Amazon.  This shaver will only give you a good shave if you spend a lot of time going over problem areas (neck and chin for me).  If you need a quick and clean shave, you will not get one with this razor.  Most importantly, you can NOT use the shaver while it is being charged.  You have to wait for it to charge up before you can turn the darn thing on!  Extremely inconvenient if you lose the charge in the middle of a morning shave!  The replacement cutter and foil cost about 75% of the cost of a brand new shaver!  Outrageous!  Also comes with the world&#x27;s cheapest travel pouch and cleaning brush.  In Januray 2010 (the day before I am writing this review) the battery malfunctioned and only holds the charge for three or four shaves!  Called the factory and they said \\&quot;send the shaver in at your expense, and we will replace it in two weeks!\\&quot;  This means I have to go buy another one to use while I wait for service.  You can be sure it won&#x27;t be a Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 with a history with Norelco and Remington.  Neither inspired me to re-purchase their brand again and each time I went back to blades for a time.  This time it&#x27;s different.  I&#x27;ve had this Panasonic since Christmas ... using it every day for about 7 weeks now.  I wanted to give it a fair test before writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;1.  I had no trouble getting used to it.  It was comfortable from Day 1.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The noise level is significantly lower than my previous electric shavers, though quite a bit louder than my blades except for my weeping and wailing when I cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The battery lasts at least 5 days without a re-charge or slowing down even a little.  I&#x27;ve never used it longer than that without recharging so I don&#x27;t know how long it will go.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Shaving dry is good ... I have to cover some spots 2 or 3 times to get a clean shave, but I consider that normal for an electric and the end result is comfortable and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Shaving wet is where this razor really shines.  There&#x27;s a slip of paper Panasonic puts in on how to clean the razor using hand soap and running water.  Not only is this amazingly simple, I use it as a shaving technique as well and this is where the title of my review comes from.  It works so well, I don&#x27;t want to stop with my face, I just want to keep shaving shoulders, arms, etc. it feels sooooo good.  I&#x27;ll just leave it at that.&lt;br /&gt;Those are the issues that are important to me in an electric razor.  I plan on maintaining and replacing this one with another Panasonic when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver online for $61 incl shipping. I&#x27;ve owned braun foil shavers: 7500(syncro), 5400(flex), as well as Norelco rotary shavers and this Panasonic (ES8043SC)beats both in my opinion. The main difference is the 13K-rpm motor which is much quieter with less vibration and noise than my previous shavers, plus the blade angle(30deg)which gives a very close shave with no irritation. This is important to me as I have sensitive skin.    This foil shaver cuts closer with a single pass than any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned. It also has a very flexible head with comfortable spring action to reach under the chin and jawline areas for a completely smooth shave. After using it for a month(dry shave only - I&#x27;m yet to try it wet), it still feels like shaving with a regular blade and cream(and of course without the blood-loss and irritation lol).      Cons:  - Cannot shave while charging(while conn.to elect.outlet)  - Pivot head moves smoothly but feels a bit on the &#x27;loose&#x27; side(as if it will     eventually break off - time will tell)    All in all, I love this powerful yet quiet shaver. I consider it a wonderful value(typically US$60-80).</li>
            <li> I had an 8802 which worked flawlessly and I loved it however it broke and this one had decent reviews so i gave it a try.      After several attempts at both dry and wet shaving, cream, no cream etc.. it missed the hair on my neck but repeatedly managed to give me nicks and cuts around the corners of my mouth and upper lip.  I got a return authorization from Amazon so I hope to get another 8802 instead.     This is an older model 8043 avoid it like the plague!!!</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver has performed just fine for me over the last 5 weeks.  I have bone-dry skin and develop a light peach-fuzz beard in 3 to 4 days.  I use a little splash of \\&quot;Williams Lectric Shave\\&quot; on my mug and a few minutes later make a few passes over my entire face.  The Panasonic gives me a smoothly shaved surface over my cheeks, jawbone and neck.  It is considerably louder than some other rotary shavers but, I genuinely like the shave.</li>
            <li> My DH says he is very happy with this shaver, since he is not one to give anything a good rating, that is saying a lot.</li>
            <li> As many of you do, I love to scour reviews carefully before making a selection on anything (which is why we use Amazon).  So, rest assured, the Amazon reviews here are quite accurate.  I&#x27;ve always owned Brauns, but I wanted a good new shaver that I could quickly and easily use in the shower.  This works even better in the shower than dry, which surprised me a bit, but I guess it makes sense due to additional lubrication.  Dry, it works well too, but you have to do more pass-bys in order to get stragglers.  As one person mentioned, if you are expecting razor close, then you have unrealistic expectations.  But in the shower, it is damn close.    I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I did notice that it was a little red the first few times using it- but it went away- so no big deal.  Probably can avoid if you use shaving gel (I got lazy and just went for water, but using gel it is smooth and super close).  You get a lot worse with a disposable razor.    Pros:  Charge lasts forever.  Cleans real easy.  Well built.  Versatile.  Even the hair trimmer works well and is easily accessible.    Cons:  None.  I wouldn&#x27;t have bought a shaver with cons b/c it is such a simple device for a simple task, that anything less than \\&quot;works perfectly\\&quot; seems like a wasted purchase.    Have no worries with this shaver- if you are looking, get it.</li>
            <li> it works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;After two years, the battery starts to drop. i need to charge it more frequently.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  Had tried an electric razor years ago (Norelco Triple Header)and it irrated my face horribly and my face never adjusted to it so I have been afraid to try another electric razor.  After reading many reviews of many different razors I decided to try this one.  I am so glad I did, because this razor is great.  No adjustment time needed for me, the first time I used it I got a great shave with no discomfort all all.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver 6 months ago. My son uses it once or twice a week. He takes care of it and cleans it. Today it just stopped working completely. What a waste of $100!</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for over seven years and I have used it every day. IT IS AWESOME. This great product is a breath of fresh air. It holds a charge today as well as it did when I first bought it (about three-four weeks). I have never replaced the blades and it still cuts great. Sure, I probably should replace them here some time soon. I just can&#x27;t emphasis enough how good this razor has been.</li>
            <li> Have been using this shaver for close to a year.  Sure the blades are getting dull and I should upgrade but the battery (and the blades) have paid for them selves and overall the performance is still acceptable.  I have thick, coarse facial hair yet this shaver still does an acceptable job at cutting smooth enough to get me through most of my work-day.    Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Decent buzzing shaver.  I bought this panasonic as an alternative to a phillips norelco. Because(phillips norelco makes to many models, and the models I have tried have week motors, maybe the exception is the $100 to $200 ones.  But I am a cheapskate.  So this panasonic buzzy razor works ok.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent electric razor. This review is also for all the head shavers out there that need a good quality razor for getting bald. How do I know this Panasonic is a good razor? Well a little while ago I began searching for an electric razor to shave my head, it had to be fairly inexpensive and able to shave razor close. I bought two different electric razors that were in my price range and tested them both out. And the Norelco was returned to the store for a refund.     I began using the Norelco 7735X Cool Skin, electric razor. It took another few days for my Panasonic ES8043SC to arrive, so I continued to use my Norelco to shave my head. Let me be honest, the Norelco Cool Skin works great and gets a good head/face shave. Then my Panasonic arrived and I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the look of the razor and was not expecting much. As soon as I did a dry head shave with the Panasonic I could see the difference! Quickly, I knew this Panasonic is a better all around razor and shaves closer than the Norelco. I can also shave faster with the Panasonic but the Norelco contours my face and head a little better.     Because of the speed of the Panasonic I can shave everyday. I like to keep my head shaved very close and keep it clean looking, the Panasonic is the best for this. My hair grows fast and I just shave my head in the shower every day. It&#x27;s like mowing a lawn; if you keep it trimmed it is very easy to cut it the next time. I don&#x27;t use any shave gel and I merely shave my head in the shower and rinse off. If there are any missed spots I usually shave them after the shower to clean my head up. It takes 5 minutes at most to shave my head in the shower with the Panasonic. And I&#x27;m getting quicker by the day. I actually think the Panasonic shaves my head better than my face. This is because of how flat heads are compared to faces. It can be hard to get to certain places on a face.     Actually, the Norelco contours your head better than the Panasonic, but the Panasonic shaves quicker and a closer. A strange paradox here. The Norelco does do a good job, don&#x27;t get me wrong here. But the Panasonic is better. I&#x27;m really pleased with the closeness of the razor. Additionally, I shave against the grain on my head to get a really close shave, and this baby of a shaver does get razor close. I will repeat, razor close, completely smooth.     This Panasonic 8043 runs at 13,000 rpm and works excellent. Turbo Cleaning Mode (available on our Pivot Action Shavers) is used for quick and easy cleaning. Press and hold the On/Off button to shift from 13,000 RPMs to an impressive 17,000 RPMs in this mode. I will never use a Mach 3 again on my head because there is no need for one. This thing rocks! Great product, great feel, quick charge, excellent razor wet/dry close shave. Period.     *Updated on 10/7/2007  So after about a year and a half I bought a new razor. Remember, I do shave my head every day in the shower. I believe there was wear and tear from being in my shower over time. I did notice a big performance boost from my new razor and I am completely satisifed with the new purchase. Buying new replacement blades only worked for so long. Still a great shaver. Lets face it, head hair is tough to shave. I found its better to shave everyday and keep it trimmed. I do not see how men shave their heads with razor blades. Also recommended is baby oil or \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; shaving oil for better performance.</li>
            <li> I just tried out this shaver in the shower and I am extremely impressed.  I read some reviews here, and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  Here&#x27;s what I like: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; - I can now shave in the shower (need to invest in a shower mirror) &lt;br /&gt; - This thing cuts CLOSE people.  For me, it&#x27;s just as good as my Mach3.  We&#x27;ll have to see how long it can keep this up. &lt;br /&gt; - The form factor is much more ergonomic than my Braun.  Shaving with a Braun is like shaving with a garage door opener.  The Panasonic is small and lighweight, and contours to your hand. &lt;br /&gt; - I can put a little shaving cream on the razor itself and it seems to help get a closer shave &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So there you have it.  I&#x27;m sold on Panasonic.  It&#x27;s only the first day, but I&#x27;m confident I won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two linear shavers over the past 7 years. The first died only because I dropped it.  This new shaver is better than the first and less expensive.  Great shave, not too noisy, great battery life and one of the best designs I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing! it&#x27;s been years since i used an electric shaver because of the skin irritation factor but i&#x27;m very happy i tried this one.  It&#x27;s used every day for the face and every other for the head and lasts an entire week on one charge.  Not sure about other models but i think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It works very well.  I tried this shaver with shaving cream and tried it dry.  Dry works better for me because it is less time consuming and not so messy with the dripping shaving cream. One thing to note, and I remember this from past electric shavers, is that it does take a few weeks for your face to get used to an electric shaver.  I had been using a blade for the past few years and the first few weeks after going electric again I noticed my face would be a little sore after shaving.  That has completely gone away and now my face feels great after shaving.  I also like that this shaver holds a charge for a very long time.  On a recent trip I didn&#x27;t even bring the charging cord.  I wouldn&#x27;t get a shaver with a fancy cleaning system - lotions and base - since this cleans so easily with liquid soap and running water.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about all the rave reviews for this razor, but after using one for a week, I am now a believer.  The designers put a lot of thought into this razor.  It is comfortable to hold and use.  The pivoting head is a help, but if you do not like it, there is a button to lock the head.  Doing away with tiny brush cleaning is a major advance for those of us who have dexterity problems.  Also, being able to rinse it with tap water is better than having to use expensive cleaning cartridges.  Best of all, it gives a great shave.  It even gets the 6-10 problem whiskers my Remington would not touch.  I haven&#x27;t tried using it with shaving creme.  I am too cheap to buy some to try.  Besides, this razor has already got me to the point that I almost do not mind shaving now.</li>
            <li> I did not think that I would ever be able to say that about a electric shaver.  My wife is the ultimate judge on this score and she says that I am shaved closer.  I purchased this shaver in anticipation of shaving my head.  I am finding out that the hair on your head grows much faster than on your face.  With this shaver it only takes a couple of minutes longer in the shower shave my head as well as my face.  My hair would already be regrowing with out this shaver.  It is great to just leave it running and stick in the shower spray for clean up.  I like it!</li>
            <li> Never thought to see it. This razor shaves as close as a blade. Fast, light, comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> the shaver works really well. It is a little loud, but it&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this thing.  If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re desperate to get away from straight edged razors.  Many people warned me against electrics but I had to give it try....a hundred bucks later and a few emergency room-esq gashes on my neck have taught me my lesson.  Stick with the straight razors.  This one does a fairly decent job on the face, but once you go south of the mouth say your prayers.  The chin, neck, and right below your ears will take a beating.  Problem is, after the beating...you still have whiskers!!  You can run this thing over your neck a thousand times, and you will STILL have stubble.  I thought it would be great using it in the shower to really get a close shave....wrong again folks.  The cleaning/drying system is really cool looking and seems to work well, but, after the coolness wears off you&#x27;re left with a mediocre razor that makes straight edges feel like the greatest invention since television.  And don&#x27;t dismiss me as being too negative...I tried this thing for two weeks.  Eight hospital visits and a lot of cursing later, I shall be sticking with my old buddy.</li>
            <li> I had been using an older Panasonic fixed head wet-dry shaver in the wet mode for several years, but the battery finally gave out.  I did some research and decided to buy the less expensive model without the auto cleaner, since I was already used to cleaning the heads with soap.  After shaving with a blade for about two weeks, I was delighted to get my new shaver.  It shaves closer than the old Panasonic, and the tilting head really does help the head follow the shape of my face.  It holds a charge for over a week, and recharges quickly, so that is one less thing to leave out on the counter.  One caution: if you press too hard, it is still possible to nick your self with this shaver, but pressure really is not needed to achieve a close shave.  I have been very pleased with this model.</li>
            <li> I have owned many Panasonic wet/dry razors through the years. It is so great to see that the company keeps improving them. This razor cuts better each time you use it and cleans very easily. Not having a charging stand is a plus because the razor stays cleaner and no stand to clean. The razor itself is super easy to clean. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for Xmas, and he said it is the best electric shaver he has ever had. After buying cheap junk, it is definitely worth the money paid.</li>
            <li> This is an easy review. It&#x27;s the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;m never, ever, ever, ever buying another Braun electric razor again. I&#x27;ve bought many and now regret it. This Panasonic is so much smoother and quieter and recharges quickly. The last Braun I bought I shelled out $120 for and it died 6 months later; not to mention the $10 packs of cleaning fluid I had to buy for it. What a rip off it was. With this awesome Panasonic, I just take it in the shower with me and pop the foil off and rinse it off after I use it. Something else that I really like about this razor is the way you can lock the shave head in position or switch over to one that can give and pivot with the contours you are shaving.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome razor for the price. I bought this shaver to replace an old Panasonic wet/dry shaver when it finally died.  This one delivers a closer, more comfortable shave, and the charge lasts a lot longer.  I preferred the old model&#x27;s charging stand but this is an overall superior razor</li>
            <li> Product arrived in great time! This razor is an exceptionally good razor when used wet with shaving cream or soap. Closest to a blade then anything else I&#x27;ve used. However if shaving dry it is just a mundane adequate, my old Norelco was better. As long as you use it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; you&#x27;ll be very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Review of the Panasonic ES8043SC: I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for about 10 years. Each one got better, except for this purchase. My previous model was the Panasonic ES8162 wet/dry, which I don&#x27;t see listed on here. It is in the same price point as the Panasonic ES8168, and looks very similar. In any case, I was amazed three years ago by the ES8162, which shaved so close it almost hurt my skin if I was not careful. After three years, the shaver pop-up trimmer stopped working. I rely on the trimmer quite a bit, but that was the weakness of the ES8162. That trimmer felt flimsy the first day I used it, and I knew that would be the first part to go. (Anyone remember the full size trimmers on the older models with Linear motors? They were no joke.)    This shaver, the ES8043 - felt like a downgrade from the ES8162 plain and simple. After reading all the positive reviews on this shaver, I believed the consensus that you don&#x27;t need to purchase the costlier Panasonic models. This model was about half the price of my last Panasonic, and for me it shaves half as close. After much work with it this morning, I felt like I had a five o&#x27; clock shadow stepping out of the shower. The pop-up trimmer feels sturdier than my old ES8162, so I&#x27;ll give it two stars for the effort. I think I&#x27;ll charge up the old ES8162, replace the blades and use another trimmer for a while. The ES8043SC will be a backup. Given all the positive reviews, this one was worth a shot, but was disappointing.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Model ES8043SC is an excellent product.  It uses a lithium battery for extended time between recharging.  I use it with shaving cream most of the time.  It cuts close with little irritation to the face.  It is much sharper and a more modern design than previous models.  The lithium battery is likely to last much longer than the previous ni-cad units.  I would definitely purchase it again.  Delivery was free and prompt.  All in all, it&#x27;s one of the main reason I buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> As stated, this is the second Panasonic linear shaver that I have owned. Firstly, I would say that I have an average beard growth on an average face. No unusual nooks or crannies and average to slightly above average beard growth. In addition, I shave my head with this unit.    I have had no problems with any areas that I shave and the unit is actually quieter than my previous Panasonic. The reliability is fine, noise is not an issue and shave quality is very good. So in a nutshell, based on my experience with Panasonic shavers, you would be pleased both short and long term with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had an old model of Panasonic shaver which provided me with 7 years of service until the battery died recently. Then I bought a rotary shaver of other brand on Black Friday which was cheap but has less power, I returned it. One month of experience with the ES8043SC is happy.</li>
            <li> Many years of use and it still works like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> Good shaver but I wish you could use the electric cord to shave if the batteries get low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Panasonic and this new design is even better.  It actually cuts better than the older models.  The shaver is light with a good ergonomic handle.  The lithium battery is stronger and allows for a shorter recharge time.  It uses the linear motor but even though it doesn&#x27;t list this, it also has the turbo speed(17,000 rpm) for cleaning purposes.  Being able to clean it with liquid soap and water makes this a better and cheaper choice than the cleaning stand models which require detergent packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic is always ahead of the rest (also in cordless phones) when it comes to shavers.  The way Panasonic comes up with the designs and features of its models, I&#x27;m almost afraid to imagine what shavers will look like in a few years.  Who knows, they may design a shaver that operates at such a high rpm rate that you just have to hold it up to your face and it will sonically(is that a word?) remove facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend this product without any reservation.</li>
            <li> This is awesome, my husband has not sensitive skin, but extremely sensitive, and this is the first shaver that he&#x27;s been able to use without any kind of irritation on his face, it gets the hair realy close to the skin, and it&#x27;s realy easy to clean. We are definetly in love with this one, (and i think his skin apreciates it too).</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver, and the first couple of times I used it its been pretty good...definitely not as close as a regular razr but for an electric one it seems pretty good. I got an electric shaver to prevent in grown hairs and so far its been doing an above average job. However, the shaving the neck can be a pain sometimes, and I resulted in razor burn from it. You definitely need to the trimmer to cut off extra hairs that the shaver cannot cut through.     Overall I give this is a 4/5 because it just doesnt seem as closecut as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic electric razor over the last ten years and I&#x27;ve liked them all.  I have an ES8066 that I would still be using except that it was time to replace the foil and cutting blocks and I found that for just $15 more I could get this model brand new from Amazon.  (I paid $57 a month ago but the price today is up to $85!  Check often because Amazon prices fluctuate a lot.)    I&#x27;ve had two different Brauns, but the motors were just too weak.  My second Braun would actually freeze up on my face while shaving because it just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to cut through my beard.  Never any problems like that with Panasonic.  Maybe Braun has upgraded their motors by now but it&#x27;s too late -- they already lost me as a customer and I see no reason to leave Panasonic.    This model, the ES8043, gives the same great, quick, close shave as my other Panasonics.  Wet/dry is the way to go.  It&#x27;s also easy to clean -- just open it up and run some water over it, no brushes or fancy docking stations required.  The floating head is a little odd as it rotates side-to-side and not front-to-back.  It&#x27;s good around my chin and jaw but I find I get a better shave elsewhere if I just lock the head so it doesn&#x27;t rotate at all.    I would give this razor five stars except for one thing: the trimmer is too thin and located in a weird spot.  This trimmer is around half the width of the trimmer on the ES8066.  More importantly, it pops out from the side whereas the trimmer on the ES8066 (and other Panasonic and Braun razors I&#x27;ve used) can be aligned with the foil and can be used at the same time as the foil cutter over your entire face.  That makes it easier to shave when you haven&#x27;t done so for a while and your beard is grown out.  With this 8043 model the trimmer works fine for sideburns, but you can&#x27;t use it on the rest of your face or neck.    BTW, don&#x27;t take Panasonic&#x27;s recommendation to replace the blades and foil once a year too seriously.  You can use them for longer.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried several electric razors.  Generally I was very disappointed.  I&#x27;ve had 3 Norelco (Phillips), a Remington, and a Braun.  I find the Panasonic to be a very good razor. It is the only electric unit that even comes close to making a quality shave.  Also, it&#x27;s a breeze to clean.  I like it !</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my husband as a Christmas gift and he loves it.    [[ASIN:B0009DT342 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like a lot of you, I&#x27;ve been shaving with a blade since day one but thought I&#x27;d try an electric shaver to touch up as needed, who knows, maybe even a replacement for my Mach 3 blades.    I&#x27;d call my beard fairly heavy but it seems a lot of you have it worse.  I&#x27;ve always shaved AFTER showering when my beard is ready.  I&#x27;ve seen buddies just grab their shaving creme, lather up and start sawing away. Dude, why not after your shower?  I&#x27;ve got friends who shave IN the shower (they&#x27;ve told me this, I have no first hand knowledge!).  If I don&#x27;t shave every day and a half I look like a barbarian, a full beard in two weeks.      So, after much studying these types of forums I got me a Panasonic ES8043. I don&#x27;t know what the \\&quot;SC\\&quot; means in the description of this shaver on this thread because mine isn&#x27;t designated as such.  Funny, they say, \\&quot;give it a 30 day tryout so your face can get used to it.\\&quot;  And their return policy is within the first 30 days!  Go figure.  Anyhoo...    I&#x27;ve had this for about two weeks.  And as others have said about any electric shaver, there&#x27;s no way in heck it can give me a shave as close as my Mach 3, just no way.  Those who have always used an electric and claim this I can only guess just don&#x27;t know what a blade-close shave can be.  But...    It does do what I bought it for, that is--to tone down my barbarianness as needed.  But after three or four shaves I notice the hairs it invariably misses are still growing wildly (mostly on my neck) and look to be seeking an ingrown kind of experience.  So...three electric, one blade (and, yes, the blade shave is as close as a blade).  I&#x27;ve found that if I wet my face maybe 5 minutes before I launch the Panasonic it really helps, because just electric on bone-dry doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  And I&#x27;m never going to lather up before hand because that&#x27;s specifically what I&#x27;m trying to avoid, more as a time saver than anything else.    Who knows, maybe I won&#x27;t grow my winter beard this season if this combination of shaving techniques keeps the cutting of my face to a minimum.  It&#x27;ll be cold without the beard, but change is good, right?      I gave it three stars because the final product was just as I&#x27;d expected.  If it was truly a replacement for my Mach 3 blades I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Unit arrived quickly (one day) from Amazon and works great.  I had an ES4026 prior to this unit and it worked ok, but I like the ES8043 much better.  I only use it with soap/water, and works well for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace a Norelco razor I had for several years and where the switch died.  I&#x27;ve now had  this razor for about a year (revised).  I looked up online reviews and liked what I saw about this razor.  I was not particularly interested in lots of extras, just a razor that would give a very close shave, quickly and quietly.  This razor does the first two significantly better than the Norelco (even when it was new) and the noise factor, while not nearly as quiet as the Norelco, is acceptable to me.  The razor head is a bit wider than I would like but it is not a major problem.  The narrow trimmer seems silly, not sure why they didn&#x27;t make it a bit wider, though it isn&#x27;t a problem for me.  The razor is comfortable in my rather large hand.  Occasionally, I find that the charge won&#x27;t last a full week, even with my fairly light beard.  I find this quite annoying.</li>
            <li> Very good from the first shave, a bit better than my old Braun but much cheaper and better battery.</li>
            <li> I have not been happy with electric shavers in the past but sometimes want something that will give a fast shave&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised how well this shaves. Best I have tried</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for 5 years and have never changed any parts and it still runs like a dream. I will wash it out on occasion and don&#x27;t use it in the shower very often, but man is this thing durable.</li>
            <li> ShaveITS (TM) Panasonic Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver is a cordless razor designed for men with medium to light weight baldness on top of their head. Can be used in the shower, with or without soap, I prefer the soap myself, a cool, refreshing blend of citrus and Vit E cream designed to combat pimples, tooth decay and plugged pores. This unit isn&#x27;t difficult to use, one can recharge it quite conveniently near the sink top, comes in its own handy &amp;#34;egg top&amp;#34; (TM) case. For those with heavy, thick set beards, full of skin scruff and fleas, this works wonders after a few moments in the warm shower with a cream of pea soup nearby.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my dad.  He tried my husbands linear shaver and absolutely loved it.  He had always used an old fashioned razor and found the shaver easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I have not used one as good as this before. The speed and sharp blades make fast work out of anything. This is by far the best I have ever used. Only oddity is the sound it makes when running, a bit more high pitched then I expected. I guess that&#x27;s because it just has such high rpm. Worth every penny though.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like many other rechargeable products, unless you leave it on the charger 24/7, don&#x27;t expect to shave the second time.</li>
            <li> Panasonic Linear shavers are the only way to go if you want an electric shaver.  I have owned two of these now.  Before I purchased this style of shaver, my cabinets were full of electric shaver rejects.  Great to find a shaver that gives you a shave as close as a manual razor.</li>
            <li> THIS SHAVER IS QUIET AND CUTS LONG HAIR VERY WELL.  SHORT NOT SO GOOD.  HAVE TO USE A SLOWER SHAVER LIKE A CHEAP REMINGTON.  THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THE BATTERY IS HALF GONE AFTER 1 YR.  THIS COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE DUAL POWER.</li>
            <li> im still using it now</li>
