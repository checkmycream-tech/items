            <li> Glimmersticks by Avon is one of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever used at any price. It goes on nicely, the Cosmic Brown color is rich and most importantly -- it stays where you put it. You won&#x27;t come home at the end of your work day to find you now look exactly like a raccoon, except not quite so cute! Good stuff at a good price.
