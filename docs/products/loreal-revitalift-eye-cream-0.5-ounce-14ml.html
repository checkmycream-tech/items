            <li>Good Luck</li>
            <li>good product at a good price</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it lifts or anything but feels nice around my eyes</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t afford to spend that kind of money monthly.</li>
            <li>Honestly I didn&#x27;t notice any difference over the rose hips oil</li>
            <li>love this cream and cheaper than in stores would not hesitate to purchase again nice job two thumbs way up</li>
            <li>I had been noticing more lines around my eyes until I began using this product.</li>
            <li>It contains Pro-Retinol A, a potent anti-wrinkle ingredient that will promote skin renewal, offer 24-hour hydration, and soothe dryness.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years after trying many products.</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>The scent was ok but the color was off.</li>
            <li>and I find this keeps the skin around my eyes hydrated, and  fine lines at bay.</li>
            <li>However, my favorite reason (other than looking great), is that L&#x27;Oreal eye products never sting, burn or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>It offers many cosmetics under many brand names, including Lancome, Feria, Maybelline, Essie, Garnier, Matrix and others, concentrating on hair color and care, skin care, sun protection, make-up and perfumes.</li>
            <li>Nice cream and Walmart and other department stores cost more than what Amazon is offering around $8 or so.&lt;br /&gt;The facial cream is good as well</li>
            <li>They further state that it will banish puffiness and dark circles under the eyes as it unveils firmer smoother and more brilliant eye</li>
            <li>It is my first purchase.</li>
            <li>I have not used it.good remark first.</li>
            <li>Great cream, a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have used the L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Micro-Pulse total eye correction system with great success (see my other reviews) and</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for a long time</li>
            <li>I have found this works about as good as a few of those high priced ones I have tried and it won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Not very expensive</li>
            <li>The company is active in the dermatology, toxicology, tissue engineering, and biopharmaceutical research fields and is the top nanotechnology patent-holder in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a new product offered by L’Oreal Paris, the world’s largest cosmetics company, and one of the world’s largest chemical companies.</li>
            <li>I am 38 years old</li>
            <li>Skin Expertise Revitalift Complete Eye Cream --14g/0.5oz, by L&#x27;Oreal Paris.  </li>
            <li>It definitely helps dark circles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Using the Micro-Pulse with this eye cream twice a day, for 3 months has diminished those dark under eye circles and has really tightened those under eye bags.  </li>

            <li> so when I opened the jar from my order it was immediately apparent that something wasn&#x27;t right because the color of the cream was not as white as usual, but a pale yellowish color.</li>

            <li> and it lasts a long time.  </li>

            <li> My eyes are  brighter and tighter that I now wear less eye make-up other than mascara.  </li>
            <li> I called L&#x27;Oreal and they said not to use it and are sending me coupons to replace it because the jar I ordered through Amazon may be past its shelf life.</li>
            <li> L’Oreal states that it is a groundbreaking revitalizing eye cream formulated with elastin complex that will shield the skin’s elastin fibers.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, what was received was not what is pictured.  </li>

            <li> Not very expensive and I am happy with this product. I am 38 years old and I find this keeps the skin around my eyes hydrated, and  fine lines at bay. I had been noticing more lines around my eyes until I began using this product. Now I don&#x27;t see them so much.&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of super expensive eye creams out there but I can&#x27;t afford to spend that kind of money monthly. I have found this works about as good as a few of those high priced ones I have tried and it won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> Great Eyecream Just What I Wanted</li>
            <li> I use this product at night before I go to bed.  I get a lot of compliments on my skin, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Skin Expertise Revitalift Complete Eye Cream --14g/0.5oz, by L&#x27;Oreal Paris.  This is a new product offered by L’Oreal Paris, the world’s largest cosmetics company, and one of the world’s largest chemical companies. L’Oreal states that it is a groundbreaking revitalizing eye cream formulated with elastin complex that will shield the skin’s elastin fibers.  They add that it will lessen wrinkles and improve the skin’s flexibility.  It contains Pro-Retinol A, a potent anti-wrinkle ingredient that will promote skin renewal, offer 24-hour hydration, and soothe dryness. They further state that it will banish puffiness and dark circles under the eyes as it unveils firmer smoother and more brilliant eye contours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Group is headquartered in Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine, France. It offers many cosmetics under many brand names, including Lancome, Feria, Maybelline, Essie, Garnier, Matrix and others, concentrating on hair color and care, skin care, sun protection, make-up and perfumes. The company is active in the dermatology, toxicology, tissue engineering, and biopharmaceutical research fields and is the top nanotechnology patent-holder in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been trying this product for a while now, and don’t care for it.  I don’t  notice any improvement in the eye area.  I find it too greasy.  And I do notice that it is causing me to break out – at my age—in the eye area.  Back to the lab, messieurs.</li>
            <li> It is my first purchase. I have not used it.good remark first.</li>
            <li> love this cream and cheaper than in stores would not hesitate to purchase again nice job two thumbs way up</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. They have it fire a great price too!</li>
            <li> excellent product  great service  will buy when needed again  ethel</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal is one of those brand names that have always had an excellent reputation in beauty products and when it comes to eye creams, I can always trust L&#x27;Oreal.  I have used the L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Micro-Pulse total eye correction system with great success (see my other reviews) and I use this L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift eye cream with the Micro-Pulse from their other eye product.  This cream is completely absorbed, and a very small amount (a dab) goes a long way.

            <li> Great cream, a tiny bit goes a long way. It definitely helps dark circles and fine lines. I dont think it helps puffiness. Great eyecream for the price! I will keep buying in walmart or maybe here!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years after trying many products. It is the only product that works as advertised. Reasonable price and it lasts a long time.  I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream. Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t notice any difference over the rose hips oil I use all over, so I&#x27;ve discarded it.</li>
            <li> Sadly, what was received was not what is pictured.  The box does nor jar has the word &amp;#34;complete&amp;#34; on it...the &amp;#34;complete&amp;#34; is a different formula.  Suffice it to say, this version does not work.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for a long time so when I opened the jar from my order it was immediately apparent that something wasn&#x27;t right because the color of the cream was not as white as usual, but a pale yellowish color. The scent was ok but the color was off. I called L&#x27;Oreal and they said not to use it and are sending me coupons to replace it because the jar I ordered through Amazon may be past its shelf life. I won&#x27;t order this online again.</li>
            <li> Nice cream and Walmart and other department stores cost more than what Amazon is offering around $8 or so.&lt;br /&gt;The facial cream is good as well but you need to use both every day. Good Luck</li>
            <li> good product at a good price</li>
