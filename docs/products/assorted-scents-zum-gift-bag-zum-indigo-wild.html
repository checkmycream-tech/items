            <li>I love.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do better then this.  </li>
            <li>I love ZUM products, all their products.</li>
            <li>I especially love the soaps and presently have 5 of their scents.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>would have to pay more for shipping.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I guess they were ok.</li>
            <li>I love all the samples.  </li>
            <li>Everything in the bag is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Have always enjoyed the bar soaps from ZUM.  </li>
            <li>Mostly, I still love the soaps with mint and herbs, but my husband enjoyed the smell of Frankincense and Myrrh more for himself, and the bath salts with that fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love the lavender stuff here.  </li>
            <li>The oil especially is wonderful with the dry patches I get on my hands in the winter!  </li>
            <li>Makes it easy to just pack up</li>
            <li>/&gt;The item was shipped very quickly and it was well</li>
            <li>This is a great way to try a new product without committing to a full size and a full price!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend as a hostess gift, but I liked it so much I kept it!</li>
            <li>I actually loved them so much I placed an order with them through their website for full size items.</li>
            <li>Everything in the bag is super!</li>
            <li>Best part is they DO NOT dry out your skin like most soaps (natural or not)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s even a little bottle of hand soap that&#x27;s perfect for travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soaps smell fantastic</li>
            <li>I love their products and this makes a fun gift.</li>
            <li>Great for weekend trips and simple gifts to others.</li>
            <li>and it is very useful.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the grapefruit oil much, I don&#x27;t use body oils frequently, but it smells great.</li>
            <li>This make a perfect gift for the person who is hard to buy for or has everything.</li>
            <li>I love these so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased full size products since this.</li>
            <li>I will for sure be buying more of their regular sized products after this experience!</li>
            <li>they were super helpful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s filled with a great cross section of goodies from Indigo Wild, the maker of Zum products.</li>
            <li>Makes a great gift for any young woman whose concerned about using organic earth friendly ingredients....bar soap was an especially big hit!</li>
            <li>The lotions are nice and thick (Zum Body) and the Lavender rub marvelous for dry feet.  </li>
            <li>Now I want more Zum -- especially the fabulous soap that heals my hands, rather than triggering a breakout.</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
            <li>For the price, this really is an amazing and thoughtful little gift.</li>
            <li>These purport to be natural, but I found the scents to be EXTREMELY strong.</li>
            <li>The bath salts beg for a deep tub, candles and your favorite novel.  </li>
            <li>Love all of these products, especially the massage oil and the bath salts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying  more from this company.  </li>
            <li>We were fans of zum products long before this purchase, and this only increased our curiosity of the many products they offer - the body oil is our favorite.</li>
            <li>I found myself using products that I never thought I would, such as the lip balm, simply because they&#x27;re all so good.</li>
            <li>The liquid wash was OK, and looking forward to trying out the Grapefruit oil with a much needed massage, foot or back!  </li>
            <li>The items aren&#x27;t big but enough to give them a good test.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the items were quite small they all smell soo good</li>
            <li>If you or any one you know is a fan of natural products, this little kit offers up a nice selection of products that anyone would love.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far too easy to get hooked on this line of products from Indigo Wild.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little package.  </li>
            <li>It gets rid of any smell and leaves only a wonderful scent behind - nothing over powering or chemically.  </li>
            <li>The little bag is chock full of scented products that make traveling a bit more enjoyable and less stressful.  </li>
            <li>This is a great option for people curious about other products.</li>
            <li>The lotions are nothing short of amazing for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It has helped me to identify products I will be reordering and some that I don&#x27;t particularly care for...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances, though, and this really bothered me.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend any ZUM product.</li>
            <li>This little gem of a sample bag packs a HUGE punch!</li>
            <li>I just assumed everything was bigger, but still worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought more and gave a few away to friends that travel a lot.  </li>
            <li>Got this as a sampler for my son in his new house.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my kit at a local Whole Foods and have used almost everything so far.</li>
            <li>Everything I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>Their lotions, lip balms, salves, soaps etc. are all natural, and my skin loves all natural.</li>
            <li>Looks like old expired product.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>natural smells.  </li>
            <li>This gave me the opportunity to try much of the different products.  </li>

            <li> Items very small with shipping costing too much.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a hand sanitizer, bar soap, lip balm, oil for dry skin or massage, moisturizer and mister.  </li>
            <li> The two soaps are small, but will last through several baths and/or hand washings.  </li>
            <li> I remember them being a little bit larger.</li>
            <li> Small enough for carry on.  </li>
            <li> I received the lip balm as a gift and tat lead me to try their other products.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> But my niece is down with it.  </li>
            <li> trying a little bit of everything!  </li>
            <li> We have used each product at least once</li>
            <li> Only when all together  the smell is bad.</li>
            <li> I had problems with the spray being broken, but the company worked with me to get it sorted out -</li>
            <li> Rather disappointed in the lotions.</li>

            <li> The item arrived with in the time frame set. I had thought the contents would be a bit larger then they are. It was a very tiny gift set for the money, but the Birthday person loves the product. I must say the scents are wonderful. Next time I buy your product, I will stay away from the sets due to size and cost.</li>
            <li> A gift for my niece.  She loves it.  I gave it to my step daughters.  Haven&#x27;t heard anything about it from them. But my niece is down with it.  She said it reminds her of home (Brooklyn, NY).  I will buy it again for her.</li>
            <li> If you or any one you know is a fan of natural products, this little kit offers up a nice selection of products that anyone would love.  The two soaps are small, but will last through several baths and/or hand washings.  Best part is they DO NOT dry out your skin like most soaps (natural or not) do.  They leave skin nicely scented and moisturized.  The lotions are nothing short of amazing for dry skin.  Haven&#x27;t used the massage oil yet, but it smells great.  The room mist is addicting.  It gets rid of any smell and leaves only a wonderful scent behind - nothing over powering or chemically.  It&#x27;s safe for pets, too.  The bath salts beg for a deep tub, candles and your favorite novel.  The lip balm is yummy and works well.  There&#x27;s even a little bottle of hand soap that&#x27;s perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my kit at a local Whole Foods and have used almost everything so far. It&#x27;s far too easy to get hooked on this line of products from Indigo Wild.  For the price, this really is an amazing and thoughtful little gift.</li>
            <li> Love each one by it&#x27;s self. Only when all together  the smell is bad.</li>
            <li> Great smelling products. Going to use in Africa where bathrooms are a challenge. So strong smelling herbal is nice.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Everything I&#x27;ve tried so far I love. The body oil is awesome and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. The lotions: ditto. The balm is excellent on elbows, heels and cuticles.The soaps smell fantastic but I haven&#x27;t used them yet. This is a great option for people curious about other products. The samples are big enough to figure out what the products are like. It&#x27;s a great sampler!</li>
            <li> Love all of these products, especially the massage oil and the bath salts.  This is a great way to try a new product without committing to a full size and a full price!  I am now going to purchase more of those two items!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother and she loved it. I just assumed everything was bigger, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> I got this for a trip and it has everything I need. All TSA approved as well. Makes it easy to just pack up and you&#x27;ve got everything in one spot.  All the products are Triple A for purity and non toxic. Can&#x27;t do better then this.  I&#x27;ve switched over to Indigo Wild-Zum from Burt&#x27;s Bees. Hope they don&#x27;t end up selling their soul for $$.</li>
            <li> Rather disappointed in the lotions. They are packaged in very tiny cardboard containers. It seems as if the entire line has shrunk. I remember them being a little bit larger.</li>
            <li> Great, great, products! I love ZUM products, all their products. I especially love the soaps and presently have 5 of their scents. Their lotions, lip balms, salves, soaps etc. are all natural, and my skin loves all natural. I highly, highly recommend any ZUM product. And they make great gifts.</li>
            <li> Great products, the soap is fantastic, going to purchase more of this</li>
            <li> I love these so much I bought more and gave a few away to friends that travel a lot.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Nice way to try these products!</li>
            <li> This little gem of a sample bag packs a HUGE punch! It&#x27;s filled with a great cross section of goodies from Indigo Wild, the maker of Zum products. It makes a perfect hostess gift, welcome gift or just an anytime day brightener. I found myself using products that I never thought I would, such as the lip balm, simply because they&#x27;re all so good. Now I want more Zum -- especially the fabulous soap that heals my hands, rather than triggering a breakout.</li>
            <li> Good way to try Zum products!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend as a hostess gift, but I liked it so much I kept it! The little bag is chock full of scented products that make traveling a bit more enjoyable and less stressful.  There&#x27;s a hand sanitizer, bar soap, lip balm, oil for dry skin or massage, moisturizer and mister.  Too nice to give away!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little package.  The products smell great.  Good way to check out the Zum line and decide which ones are your favorites.</li>
            <li> Looks like old expired product. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Items very small with shipping costing too much. I purchased as a gift for my daughter but would never buy again. Order was separated so&lt;br /&gt;I would have to pay more for shipping. One time purchase for me. I completed this order only because it was a gift for my child. I should have tried eBay!</li>
            <li> Oh my!  We LOVE this!  Purchased 2 for my kids stockings.  It was a big hit.  Great all natural smells.  I want to buy one for myself asap.</li>
            <li> We have used each product at least once and it is very useful.  We were fans of zum products long before this purchase, and this only increased our curiosity of the many products they offer - the body oil is our favorite.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice assortment of Zum Bar products. I love all of the products!</li>
            <li> Makes a great gift for any young woman whose concerned about using organic earth friendly ingredients....bar soap was an especially big hit!</li>
            <li> Great gifts I have used for visitors and friends.  Best thing to introduce someone to our world of Zum.</li>
            <li> I love their products and this makes a fun gift.</li>
            <li> Small enough for carry on.  Perfect for a vacation.  Has everything you need.</li>
            <li> Its good way to try out some of the products but it was just so so for me. I  was a fan of the lavender room spray but since its changed to room and body its just not the same.</li>
            <li> Got this as a sampler for my son in his new house. Now he&#x27;s hooked too.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for a friend who LOVED the bag of goodies!</li>
            <li> These purport to be natural, but I found the scents to be EXTREMELY strong. Otherwise I guess they were ok. I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances, though, and this really bothered me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful assortment!  Fun trying a little bit of everything!  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying  more from this company.  The oil especially is wonderful with the dry patches I get on my hands in the winter!  I swear its made my hands look younger!</li>
            <li> I love these products! I received the lip balm as a gift and tat lead me to try their other products. They smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Great for weekend trips and simple gifts to others. Smells good, nice variety of scents and types of products.</li>
            <li> The scents are luscious and very nice.  I love all the samples.  I actually loved them so much I placed an order with them through their website for full size items.</li>
            <li> It is so helpful to have a sample of multiple products.  It has helped me to identify products I will be reordering and some that I don&#x27;t particularly care for...</li>
            <li> This contained a really delightful collection of scents and a nice assortment of products.  It&#x27;s a nice introduction to Zum!</li>
            <li> Great introduction to Zum products. I&#x27;ve purchased full size products since this.</li>
            <li> I love it! Everything in the bag is fantastic! I had problems with the spray being broken, but the company worked with me to get it sorted out - they were super helpful. I don&#x27;t use the grapefruit oil much, I don&#x27;t use body oils frequently, but it smells great. Everything in the bag is super!</li>
            <li> Have always enjoyed the bar soaps from ZUM.  This gave me the opportunity to try much of the different products.  Mostly, I still love the soaps with mint and herbs, but my husband enjoyed the smell of Frankincense and Myrrh more for himself, and the bath salts with that fragrance.  The lotions are nice and thick (Zum Body) and the Lavender rub marvelous for dry feet.  Love the lavender stuff here.  The liquid wash was OK, and looking forward to trying out the Grapefruit oil with a much needed massage, foot or back!  PLEASE beg-beg?</li>
            <li> Looovvve this for the price, you get to try everything!</li>
            <li> I have bought three of these, two as gifts. Love the aromas, the size is perfect for testing to see what you do or don&#x27;t like. The items aren&#x27;t big but enough to give them a good test. The tangerine Lip balm (ZUM Kiss) smells wonderful, the soaps are fragrant and everything works well. This make a perfect gift for the person who is hard to buy for or has everything.</li>
            <li> I got my zum bar gift bag today.&lt;br /&gt;The item was shipped very quickly and it was well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Although the items were quite small they all smell soo good and it is perfect for taking on trips.&lt;br /&gt;Also there is quite an assortment of products to try; a total of ten tiny samples.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Bought two as gifts for college students.</li>
