            <li>good quality!</li>
            <li>The price was great &amp; I&#x27;m so happy that it holds all my pills/vitamins.  </li>
            <li>All of her pills fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This is a good compact pill organizer.  </li>
            <li>Labels for each day have a good print quality and doesn&#x27;t seem like it will chip or fade away.  </li>
            <li>Good compact unit for traveling</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>love the design!</li>
            <li>Great, I scraped off the labels and filled the wells with spices so my husband can carry it in his lunch pail and modify his food at work, keeps him from eating out.</li>
            <li>I bought this pill case to be able to carry in my purse.  </li>
            <li>There are no braille dots or raised lettering if you are interested in that, but otherwise they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li>This is the best round pill box that I&#x27;ve managed to find.</li>
            <li>This was for my mom and she absolutely loves it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap but very well made.</li>
            <li>DAYS SNAP TIGHT, LARGE COMPARTMENTS AND UNIQUE SHAPE!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I ended up getting a second for travel on top of the one I already had.</li>
            <li>Although I would love to see slightly bigger compartments.</li>
            <li>Since my son don&#x27;t have fine motor movement of his right hand, he&#x27;s able to open this with his left.</li>
            <li>The great design opens in the center so even in my purse the compartments don&#x27;t open up &amp; spill my pills all over!  </li>
            <li>I take a large dose of morning meds as well in a rectangular box</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much space than a candy bar design.  </li>
            <li>For the low price of 6.00, this is not only a bargain but a great purchase as well for those who&lt;br /&gt;need a container for several medications.</li>
            <li>Each compartment will only hold 4 large vitamin pills or 24 regular aspirin-sized pills, but I take a variety of small meds, so this works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I really like the circle shape (opposed to the classic rectangle) because I find it is space efficient for my needs.  </li>
            <li>I also really like how the Sunday is marked to avoid any confusion, and is sturdy.</li>
            <li>There is more than enough room for three large vitamins and two smaller daily pills.</li>
            <li>The clips are easy to open and snap close, although some are weak or too strong.  </li>
            <li>And great size, round &amp; small!</li>
            <li>Most of my meds are small to regular in size.</li>
            <li>I like this round pill box much more because it opens from middle rather than the outside part of the circle.</li>

            <li> I like this round pill box much more because it opens from middle rather than the outside part of the circle.</li>
            <li> I used to have a blue long pill box (from CVS)</li>
            <li> well keeping the container closed because it snaps shut in the middle!</li>
            <li> I needed a round box that would hold a lot of a larger pills ie...calcium, daily vit, another supplement and then some subscription meds as well.  </li>

            <li> Enough to get me by for several days if not more - just depends on the size of your pills.</li>

            <li> Each day has a little extra space, but the point of each triangle piece is not exactly pointy</li>

            <li> The individual lids are very hard for me to open.</li>
            <li> Size fits big vitamins, small pills, &amp; a lot of them!</li>
            <li> The ink came off in less than a week.</li>
            <li> The tabs fold open and stay open, they don&#x27;t annoyingly flap back close.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve always had problems with pills falling out&lt;br /&gt;and making a mess in my pocket.  </li>
            <li> Fill it up once per week&lt;br /&gt;Great and closes real tight</li>
            <li> NO MORE MISTAKES!  </li>
            <li> and I was always grabbing for the wrong pill box.  </li>
            <li> Useless</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Each compartment will only hold 4 large vitamin pills or 24 regular aspirin-sized pills, but I take a variety of small meds, so this works perfectly.  The compartments stay closed and the round shape is easier to pack than a long rectangular pill box.</li>
            <li> I really like the circle shape (opposed to the classic rectangle) because I find it is space efficient for my needs.  I also really like how the Sunday is marked to avoid any confusion, and is sturdy.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly and holds a lot of pills for road trips</li>
            <li> Fits all my medication, excellent size!</li>
            <li> I needed a round box that would hold a lot of a larger pills ie...calcium, daily vit, another supplement and then some subscription meds as well.  I take a large dose of morning meds as well in a rectangular box and I was always grabbing for the wrong pill box.  Now I can  always tell which is which.  NO MORE MISTAKES!  STURDY, DAYS SNAP TIGHT, LARGE COMPARTMENTS AND UNIQUE SHAPE!!! Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I carry 6-7 different medications for managing my migraines. I used to have a blue long pill box (from CVS) but one of the compartments refused to close after about a year. I like this round pill box much more because it opens from middle rather than the outside part of the circle. Therefore if you keep it in a bag there&#x27;s less of a chance for it to pop open and spill out. It holds an appreciable amount of pills. Enough to get me by for several days if not more - just depends on the size of your pills. Most of my meds are small to regular in size. If you&#x27;re looking for a size reference: One compartment can hold about twelve regular sized 50mg night time sleep aid (OTC blue pills).</li>
            <li> This was for my mom and she absolutely loves it!! All of her pills fit perfectly.  Each day has a little extra space, but the point of each triangle piece is not exactly pointy - this gives the case extra space.  Love it! totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for on the go organizing, slips into my bag and travels well.</li>
            <li> This is a good compact pill organizer.  Doesn&#x27;t take up much space than a candy bar design.  The tabs fold open and stay open, they don&#x27;t annoyingly flap back close.  The clips are easy to open and snap close, although some are weak or too strong.  There&#x27;s no consistency when opening each compartment.  Labels for each day have a good print quality and doesn&#x27;t seem like it will chip or fade away.  Works as intended, so I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Size fits big vitamins, small pills, &amp; a lot of them! Works well keeping the container closed because it snaps shut in the middle! I going to order another one! It&#x27;s labeled too! And great size, round &amp; small! Perfect!</li>
            <li> Works like it should.</li>
            <li> This is the best round pill box that I&#x27;ve managed to find. It&#x27;s cheap but very well made. The compartments close firmly and are very spacious. There is more than enough room for three large vitamins and two smaller daily pills. There are no braille dots or raised lettering if you are interested in that, but otherwise they&#x27;re amazing. I ended up getting a second for travel on top of the one I already had.</li>
            <li> Fill it up once per week&lt;br /&gt;Great and closes real tight</li>
            <li> The ink came off in less than a week. Useless</li>
            <li> Great, I scraped off the labels and filled the wells with spices so my husband can carry it in his lunch pail and modify his food at work, keeps him from eating out.</li>
            <li> This pill container is just wonderful.  It is compact and well designed.  In the past, I&#x27;ve always had problems with pills falling out&lt;br /&gt;and making a mess in my pocket.  Because of its design, it does no such thing.  The lids must be opened from the inside, so they&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t end up being accidentally opened.  For the low price of 6.00, this is not only a bargain but a great purchase as well for those who&lt;br /&gt;need a container for several medications. Now go get one!</li>
            <li> This pill box works. The lids click closed. One has, as an option, the chance to learn the Chinese characters for the days of the week. I have not learned them...yet.</li>
            <li> Since my son don&#x27;t have fine motor movement of his right hand, he&#x27;s able to open this with his left. Although I would love to see slightly bigger compartments.</li>
            <li> My wife uses daily and it still snaps shut after 2 months</li>
            <li> Good compact unit for traveling</li>
            <li> I bought this pill case to be able to carry in my purse.  The price was great &amp; I&#x27;m so happy that it holds all my pills/vitamins.  The great design opens in the center so even in my purse the compartments don&#x27;t open up &amp; spill my pills all over!  Perfect!  I&#x27;m so happy!!!  Great design!!!!</li>
            <li> love the design! good quality!</li>
            <li> I wanted one you sent two</li>
            <li> The individual lids are very hard for me to open.</li>
