            <li> just a couple of drops of argan oil to your food-grade carrier oil of choice (coconut, olive, jojoba, sweet almond, or sesame) to immediately reap all the benefits of this healing natural oil.</li>
            <li> I like how it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This is real Argan Oil.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I make most of my own beauty products so I go thru a lot of argan oil.  I love it and love trying different brands.  This is a great brand, the quality is awesome and it makes wonderful hair masques and body butter.  There are so many benefits to using argan oil on hair and skin and this is definitely a good brand to start with.  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry, and gets frizzy in the humidity.  This Argan Oil helps keep the craziness under control.  I add a few drops after I&#x27;ve styled it.  It&#x27;s also good to put in your hair as an overnight masque , if you&#x27;re planning on washing it in the morning.</li>
            <li> great oil for your skin</li>
            <li> This was a pretty interesting product. Shipping was quick and easy and there was no hassle whatsoever. Item arrived in good clean condition, perfectly brand new. Used it today and I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> Ever since I have been using this produt I get repeated requests from friends as to the drastic healthy change in my hair and facial skin. I no longer have to buy expensive facial moisturizer or hair treatments.  It is all in this little bottle!</li>
            <li> This is real Argan Oil. It moisturizes my skin and I can immediately tell the difference after applying it. In addition to moisturizing your skin, you can also use this for dry hair or brittle nails and it will help with those too. It&#x27;s a great product and it&#x27;s all natural straight from Morroco.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected. Purchased to use for conditioning my cuticles.  Product doesn&#x27;t penetrate skin very well, and I end up having to wipe it all off so that I can continue to work without getting everything greasy.  On top of that, the stuff smells really bad.  I&#x27;ll stick to using lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it has so many uses.  I had been using Argan oil for my hair and now I use it on my dry skin.  My nails are stronger since using it and my hair is never frizzy.  It has a nice neutral scent too.</li>
            <li> I love this Argan Oil.  It is the only product I will use on my hair.  I have also been applying it to my skin immediately after showering and I have noticed that my skin is much softer and has a light glow.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Terra Botanicals Argan oil is a good quality oil. I like how it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft. It also makes a great deep hair conditioning treatment. If you are looking to buy Argan oil this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> Great Argan Oil!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product. The Argan Oil is all natural and doesn&#x27;t have a scent. This also come in a glass bottle with an added bonus of a dropper. This really makes my hair soft and less frizzy, I highly recommend it to those with dry or curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love love love this argan oil! My skin feels so soft and smooth! I noticed a difference in my skin after the first use! Absorbs nicely and does not feel greasy. I woke up and my skin felt so moisturized and soft!  My skin glows! I even apply to my face and no breakouts! My cuticles are not dry. Heels are repairing. I&#x27;m used on the ends of my hair as a conditioning mask. I&#x27;m addicted and will need more soon if I keep bathing in this stuff!</li>
            <li> This oil has a nice natural scent, unlike some that I have purchased that had obvious added fragrance. It was exactly what I wanted. I use argan in my hair, 2 drops, rubbed into my palms and then rubbed through the length of my hair as a leave in conditioner and prior to using the flat iron. It works way better than expensive products like CHI. You can add a few drops of lavender oil which helps with the hair strength, you wouldn&#x27;t want to use a lot, like for a 2oz bottle if you wanted to add an essential oil to it you would only want to add about 20 drops of an essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my cuticles as well and it works great on them. I recieved this poduct at a discount in exchange for providing an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are Dr Axe&#x27;s top 12 uses for argan oil&lt;br /&gt;1. Nighttime Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil absorbs quickly, and does Nighttime Oil Treatmentnot leave an oily residue. After cleansing your skin with an all-natural cleanser, pour a single drop into your palm to warm. Apply in a circular motion to your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the winter months, or in dryer climates, you may need a second drop; but remember to use sparingly. This oil is gentle, and safe to use around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply one drop to your face, using a tapping motion, from the bridge of your nose to your temple, and back again. Then apply a drop beneath your eyes with the same gentle tapping. The vitamin A and vitamin E can help to reduce fine wrinkles and keep this delicate area moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Skin Toner&lt;br /&gt;Skin toning is an important step in your skin care routine. For an all-over glow, add 2-4 drops to 8 ounces of your favorite toner, or better yet, make your own chemical free, all natural toner at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply pour one cup of boiling water over a green tea bag and let steep for 7-10 minutes. Remove the tea bag and allow to come to room temperature. Add a drop or two of your favorite essential oil (orange, lemon or tea tree are great), and 2-4 drops of argan oil, and seal in a jar. Use morning and night after cleansing, and before moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Exfoliating&lt;br /&gt;Do-it-yourself exfoliators are not difficult to make, and are significantly less expensive than what you can purchase in the store, plus when you add argan oil, you get all the anti-aging effects too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To experience the argan oil benefits while exfoliating, just mix 1 tablespoon of brown sugar with a couple of drops of argan oil in your hand. Rub into your face in a circular motion for 2-4 minutes; pay special attention to acne prone areas and areas that are dry. Rinse with warm water, and pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular exfoliation helps to remove dead skin cells and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, while giving you a younger fresher complexion. With the aid of the brown sugar, the argan oil’s nutrients are more readily absorbed into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this exfoliator for more than just your face! If you have dry elbows or heels (or during an at-home pedicure) mix up a bit more to massage the dry and dead skin away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturized face and skin4. Acne&lt;br /&gt;Great news for anyone that is suffering from acne – argan oil has been proven to reduce sebum levels in individuals with oily skin! (2) Women than have never had acne before are finding in that in their 30s and 40s this pesky condition arises, and it is often, difficult to treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chemical creams can be expensive, and in the long run truly do more harm than good. Argan oil’s high linoleic acid content helps to reduce inflammation caused by acne, (not to mention rashes, infections and bug bites) while helping heal damaged skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using argan oil as your moisturizer, but are still fighting acne, place a drop in the palm of your hand and lightly dab a bit extra into problem areas. To fight stubborn or persistent white heads, be sure to make the toner above, using a couple of drops of tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil compliments the argan oil benefits beautifully with its rich content of anti-oxidants and its inherent anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-fungal properties(3). Together, they can help fight stubborn acne while reducing the inflammation, and scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Stretch Marks&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil can help prevent stretch marks by improving the elasticity of the skin. Warm 2-3 drops of pure argan oil in the palm of your hands and gently rub your stomach, hips, thighs or any other potential problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin A and vitamin E will help to rejuvenate the skin while moisturizing, making stretch marks less likely to form. If you already have a stretch mark or two (or six), start by massaging argan oil and brown sugar into the affected areas before your next bath. Rinse well and apply the oil to the affected areas prior to dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Razor Bumps and BurnSmooth Legs&lt;br /&gt;Razor bumps and razor burn are uncomfortable and unsightly. Argan oil is an effective treatment to soothe and heal for men after shaving, as well as women for their legs and bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm a drop or two of the oil in your hands and lightly massage into the affected area. The healing power of the oil will astound you. Some individuals note a reduction in the number of ingrown hairs present as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Whole-Body Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Once you see amazing ways that argan oil benefits your face, do not hesitate to use it as your whole-body moisturizer! Hopefully, you are currently using an all-natural moisturizer (like coconut oil) on your body and avoiding the harsh hidden chemicals that are present in most lotions and moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add just a couple of drops of argan oil to your food-grade carrier oil of choice (coconut, olive, jojoba, sweet almond, or sesame) to immediately reap all the benefits of this healing natural oil. If you have dry patches on your heals, elbows or other areas, massage an extra drop into those areas for relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Leave-In Conditioner &amp; Styling Long Healthy Hair&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is not only beneficial to skin – it is also great for hair. This non-greasy oil makes for the perfect leave-in conditioner that makes your hair easier to style while repairing those pesky split ends! Argan oil helps to tame frizz and fly-aways, protect against the heat of hair dryers, curlers and flat irons, all the while promoting body, and a healthy shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some research that indicates argan oil can even promote hair growth, so be sure to rub it in to your scalp too. Depending on the thickness, texture, condition, and length of your hair, you may need anywhere from 1 drop to 3 drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting the right amount may take some practice.  Start with a drop (or for short hair ½ drop may do) and warm in your palms before raking your fingers through your hair, paying special attention to your ends. Once complete, add ½ drop to your fingertips and massage into your scalp. Rub any excess into your face, neck or hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Overnight Deep Conditioning Treatment&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry, brittle hair, once a week do an overnight deep conditioning treatment with argan oil. Warm 4-10 drops in your hands before massaging into your scalp. Continue applying all the way to the ends, twist, and place a shower cap on top. Your natural body heat retained in the shower cap will help the oil to penetrate, while keeping your pillowcase free of oil. In the morning, wash your hair as normal, rinsing until all residue is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dandruff or dry scalp, do an overnight treatment twice per week until dandruff is gone. Continue on with weekly treatments, or as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Lip Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil benefits more than just your skin and hair; it makes for a wonderful lip treatment or chap stick substitute! Rub in 1-2 drops, and wipe away any excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will not only heal any cracked lips, but also keep your lips soft,smooth and conditioned. Keep argan oil around in winter-time to prevent chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. Nails&lt;br /&gt;Now, let’s talk about how this can help your nails! Argan oil’s non-greasy moisture is an ideal treatment for cuticles and nails. Remove all polish from  fingernails and toenails, and rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dot a fraction of a drop directly onto each nail, one at a time, and rub into the nail bed and cuticle. Leave on until all nails have been treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash and rinse thoroughly and then apply polish as desired. The oil will help to condition your nails, but also help keep your cuticles moisturized so you don’t develop painful hangnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. Dry Feet and Heels&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry cracking skin on your feet or heels, rub 2 drops into your feet, paying special attention to the problem areas. Depending on the how dry your skin is, you may need to apply a couple of more drops to fully moisturize the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover with a pair of cozy socks to give the oil a chance to soak in. Leave the socks on for at least 20 minutes, and preferably overnighteas for relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.

Leave on until all nails have been treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash and rinse thoroughly and then apply polish as desired. The oil will help to condition your nails, but also help keep your cuticles moisturized so you don’t develop painful hangnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. Dry Feet and Heels&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry cracking skin on your feet or heels, rub 2 drops into your feet, paying special attention to the problem areas. Depending on the how dry your skin is, you may need to apply a couple of more drops to fully moisturize the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover with a pair of cozy socks to give the oil a chance to soak in. Leave the socks on for at least 20 minutes, and preferably overnight</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this Argan oil! I have heard about the benefits of argan oil so I finally decided to try it. I received it early in the morning, so I used it right after showering. For hair, the bottle says to use a few drops in your hand and run it through your hair. My hair is down to the small of my back so I decided to use a but more. I used 6 drops and ran it through my wet hair. It didn&#x27;t feel like enough so I used 3 more. 6 would have been enough. While I don&#x27;t necessarily look greasy, it looks like second day hair. My fault. If you have short hair, definitely 3 drops should be enough! I then used it on my face. It says to apply liberally. Well, let me tell you, a little bit does go a long way. If you are only using on your face, don&#x27;t apply too liberally. It will eventually soak in but it does take a while. So less is more in my opinion. However, oh my goodness, my face is soooo soft!! Seriously. I am replacing my moisturizer for this oil. Very very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Works great and gives you a lot for your money! Even better when you add your own aromatherapy oils, making your hair, legs, feet, smell and feel GREAT!. I mostly use it on its own for all my dry skin and wrinkle needs. Not that I have any wrinkles because this stuff works.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of funny, but good product for nails and hair.</li>
            <li> This has now become a staple in our house. My daughter has long curly hair that tends to get dry. She really loves it and uses it every day. I am constantly replenishing the supply of it.</li>
            <li> In summary, argan oil can help improve and repair your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for my wife as she wanted to try some argan oil products. I am impressed with the results she has gotten and she is now a big believer in argan oil. She has seen major improvements in the softness, texture and overall health of her hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This high quality virgin argan oil does wonder for my wife&#x27;s skin and especially her hair. A little bit, goes a long way. She adds this to her hair post shower and it makes for very soft and shiny and flowing hair. I am impressed with the results she has gotten and she is now a big believer in argan oil. More importantly, the argan oil does not negatively impact her coloring and hair treatments, so she is also pleased about that.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using argan oil and I&#x27;m impressed!  A little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve heard the smell of pure argan oil bothers some people, but I found this oil&#x27;s nutty scent to be pleasant. I didn&#x27;t notice the scent when I placed a few drops in my hand but when I warmed up the oil by rubbing it in my palms, I noticed a rich, nutty aroma akin to that of hazelnut.    I have normal-combination skin, slightly dry around the mouth and oily T-zone. I use two drops of it as the last step in my nightly skin routine and I wake up with glowy-but-not-greasy, hydrated skin in the morning! I noticed that I require far less moisturizer  throughout the day as the moisturizing effect lasts a very long time. I also use a few drops on my hair after washing it and it gives shiny, hydrated look without weighing my hair down. I received a discount in exchange for a honest review.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and quick delivery. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful to use. It was a bit heavy on my face but I do have oily skin so that was why. I used it on my legs and it absorbed quickly with no sticky residue :) I also use it in my hair in the shower and I can see my hair looking healthier every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I use this product after shampooing. I have really liked its effect on my hair. My hair feels softer and looks overall less frizzy. I love  how it smooths my hair and it smells nice too.  It helps to moisturize dry hair or protect hair from damage from heating devices. Highly recommended for all hair types!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil and this brand is pretty good! I use it at night for my face and it does wonders on my skin. Wayyyy better than buying the expensive brands at the stores. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase and excellent pricing!&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
