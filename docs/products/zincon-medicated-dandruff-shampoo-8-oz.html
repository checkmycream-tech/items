            <li> Our family has eczema, this is the BEST! Arrived in a timely fashion. Will order again.</li>
            <li> winter is bad for me. If I did not use zincon shampoo my shoulders would look like there was snow on them/. My excema is really bad in the winter. If I start using this as soon as it gets cold I do not flake from excema at all. excellant for the scalp.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo to give a good cleaning to scalp!  Have used it for many years and I hope they continue to manufacture and sell this product.</li>

            <li> We have been using this shampoo for years-wouldn&#x27;t consider changing.  It is great and leaves hair clean, shiny and dandruff free</li>
            <li> I WAS FINDING IT HARD TO LOCATE THIS PRODUCT. DECIDED TO LOOK AT INTERNET AND WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED MANY CHOICES IN PACKING. WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH PURCHASE.</li>

            <li> Helps neutralize my scalp from the effects of rosacea, and it smells good too.  I have used Zincon for years, but have trouble finding it in stores.  Amazon took care of that for me!</li>
            <li> My husband has used this shampoo for years, but he cannot find it locally.  He was pleased to find it on Amazon at a most reasonable price!</li>
            <li> My husband is actually the person in our house who uses Zincon, and until recently, he could just pick it up at a local supermarket or drugstore.  It is one of only two shampoos that keeps his dandruff at bay, and also doesn&#x27;t make his head itch.  He hadn&#x27;t been able to find it in the last few months, until I looked online.  I ordered the 5 pack, so that it will last a long time.  He was extremely happy to know how easy it will be to find and buy next time.</li>
