            <li>Not only did I make my step dad happy but saved a lot of money by buying from amazon!!</li>

            <li>I will be buying more from Yves de Sistelle</li>

            <li>Husband and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Seems kind of cheap</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>I truly LOVE the original Thallium.</li>
            <li>So having fallen in love with the original</li>
            <li>not to strong afterglow I took a shower that vary night</li>
            <li>I liked it the first time I opened it</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne for my brothers, hands down is one of the best</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to my son and he seems to enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>Worth more than what it sells for.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>This fragrance smells so light and citrus like.</li>
            <li>the package came early right packaging great service can&#x27;t wait to have this on when i go to my job</li>
            <li>This cologne has a great smell that stays on a long time.  </li>
            <li>chicks really dig it :).</li>
            <li>all of that being said, this cologne smells good enough to be worn around my wife sometimes, too.  </li>
            <li>Smells masculine and warm but not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a true sporty scent</li>
            <li>at Cool tempts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first spritz, I got a strong Alcohol smell</li>
            <li>Its not in your face bold.</li>
            <li>I like this because it has a mild smell.</li>
            <li>the initial application, the most prominent scent is vanilla.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts long, good buy.</li>
            <li>When I think of Sport, I think fresh, cool, nose-catching fragrances.  </li>
            <li>but I think it smells good enough to wear on a first date.</li>
            <li>then it began to smell familiar maybe like Polo Big Pony or more like True Religion</li>
            <li>I also think the bottle is pretty cool; it reminds me of something you would see at the barbershop, sitting on the ledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a fresh &amp; citrus  </li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>&gt; If you don&#x27;t want to spend $90/bottle for &amp;#34;AHS&amp;#34;, you can get Thallium &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; and still have something that smells nice and is pretty similar.</li>
            <li>A weak but pleasant fragrance that lasts for about 30 minutes and then poof!</li>
            <li>My best blind choice.</li>
            <li>, it has a very enjoying full scent , people usually ask him where he got it the smell</li>
            <li>Just be aware that they could screw you order up......</li>
            <li>will purchase more Thallium products in the future</li>
            <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>The spray top is a little flimsy, but it still works fine</li>
            <li>This brand of mens cologne is very nice and last a good while, i have bought the original a few times and new just got the Sport, not a fan of the black (yet!)</li>
            <li>Seriously one of my favorite colognes, I have bought many through the years</li>
            <li>Really like Tallium colognes in general but this Sport edition is too light.  </li>
            <li>I do feel that the vast majority of people would enjoy this sent.</li>
            <li>nice for everyday......</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I prefer the Original Thallium myself.</li>
            <li>nice smell, but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>/&gt;After several hours, the vanilla and woody scents fall away and the lasting scent is very light and sort of fruity and grassy.  </li>
            <li>I usually use in special occasions, when going to a party or important events.</li>
            <li>Thallium Black gets ALOT more compliments.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t particularly want to go through a 60 dollar bottle of Polo when all I&#x27;m doing is going to work with a bunch of dudes.  </li>
            <li>I will tell you how it smells from a real-life realistic standpoint.  </li>
            <li>got all ready for work the next day to give it fresh start I got complimented on it when I walked in the doors at work</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed purchasing the Thallium trio (sport, classic and black)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Great for casual situations</li>
            <li>The hint of spices and the sweet aroma compliment each other very well.  </li>
            <li>The seller is also very professionally spoils his customers.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that they are the same item.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful because a lot of perfumes give me a bad headache, but this is very nice, love the scent...</li>
            <li>Lasts a really long time and for such a low price whats not to love?</li>
            <li>I bought the Black at the same time and it has a better bite to it.  </li>
            <li>I have Thallium Sport, original, and black....</li>
            <li>last the whole day</li>
            <li>far, I have not received any compliments, that is probably because I have not been out all day.  </li>
            <li>Decent fragrance overall</li>
            <li>, bases on certain circumstances; especially the price, this is definitely a 5 star</li>
            <li>I have used the original for a while and recently bought the black and this one which is the sport...</li>
            <li>I was hoping to use this as a travel bottle, but alas, the atomizer button is exposed on the top and there is no cap to cover it, so</li>
            <li>I bought Thallium from Premier Health and Beauty and they sent me the wrong kind.</li>
            <li>The initial scent last for several hours, and I have had that long-lasting fruity/grassy scent last on a shirt for nearly two days while not being worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For events like that, I use Polo Black or Polo Blue, although those cost about four times as much as Thallium.  </li>

            <li> but I don&#x27;t particularly want to go through a 60 dollar bottle of Polo when all I&#x27;m doing is going to work with a bunch of dudes.  </li>
            <li> I will tell you how it smells from a real-life realistic standpoint.  </li>
            <li> got all ready for work the next day to give it fresh start I got complimented on it when I walked in the doors at work</li>
            <li> and I enjoyed purchasing the Thallium trio (sport, classic and black)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great for casual situations</li>
            <li> The hint of spices and the sweet aroma compliment each other very well.  </li>
            <li> The seller is also very professionally spoils his customers.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that they are the same item.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful because a lot of perfumes give me a bad headache, but this is very nice, love the scent...</li>
            <li> Lasts a really long time and for such a low price whats not to love?</li>
            <li> I bought the Black at the same time and it has a better bite to it.  </li>
            <li> I have Thallium Sport, original, and black....</li>
            <li> last the whole day</li>
            <li> far, I have not received any compliments, that is probably because I have not been out all day.  </li>
            <li> Decent fragrance overall</li>
            <li> , bases on certain circumstances; especially the price, this is definitely a 5 star</li>
            <li> I have used the original for a while and recently bought the black and this one which is the sport...</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use this as a travel bottle, but alas, the atomizer button is exposed on the top and there is no cap to cover it, so</li>
            <li> I bought Thallium from Premier Health and Beauty and they sent me the wrong kind.</li>
            <li> The initial scent last for several hours, and I have had that long-lasting fruity/grassy scent last on a shirt for nearly two days while not being worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For events like that, I use Polo Black or Polo Blue, although those cost about four times as much as Thallium.  </li>
            <li> It does a decent job capturing the vibe of &amp;#34;AHS&amp;#34;, but with a few draw backs.</li>
            <li> It also last a long time.</li>
            <li> Last all day long</li>
            <li> but doesnt last long...</li>
            <li> Over rated and don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Amazon lists two Thallium Sport items a regular and a \\&quot;limited edition\\</li>
            <li> Thallium sport and Thallium sport Limited Edition are the same thing.</li>
            <li> A lot of colognes are very expensive, and pretty much only because they know that we are willing to pay a lot of money to smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Always have hard time finding it , I really like it allot , I get compliments every time i wear it</li>
            <li> I have so many bottles of cologne its crazy..</li>
            <li> First mens spray I have used that performed so poorly.</li>
            <li> The heavy vanilla smell falls to a moderate level within a minute or so and the woody scents come through.  </li>
            <li> they are diamonds in the rough..</li>
            <li> Will consider other thallium versions soon</li>
            <li> For your info, I wear colognes on my shirt due to the fact that when I wear cologne on my skin, my skin can get irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why others voted it other than 5 stars, this is a must have in your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t detect any other notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did smell this fragrance in a small store on my last trip and after I finished it</li>
            <li> I am considering trying Thallium other fragrances.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thallium &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; also has a slightly synthetic scent, but it isn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance is also below average, but that is to be expected with a cheaper fragrance.</li>
            <li> once it drys down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sharp blast of citrus and that&#x27;s all I get from it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the Black version but from the notes</li>
            <li> Every single day I get at least 1 compliment.</li>
            <li> Every single day I get at least 1 compliment.</li>
            <li> Bought this one in the blind but pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t wanna waste money on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was looking to get a bottle of cologne that wasn&#x27;t so expensive that I could wear on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Spray it on and leave it on for a few hours than ask others!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely for daywear or maybe, in a pinch, casual evenings during thespring or summer.  </li>
            <li> I do not have experience with other Thallium scents, but I may experiment with them soon to see if there is a less expensive alternative for evening wear.</li>
            <li> First, the lemon note is a little dominating, and it doesn&#x27;t have the peppery base of &amp;#34;AHS&amp;#34; which is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> and I am seriously considering taking the scent.</li>
            <li> What I have been doing is applying it to my shirt as well as behind the neck,chest and arms</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain some fragrances other than sometimes the fragrance can seem annoying.  </li>
            <li> I have expensive colognes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll save the expensive stuff for the nights when I&#x27;m with my wife.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the expensive stuff at Macy&#x27;s, but with 2 children I have to budget myself.</li>
            <li> &gt; Dont be afraid to try it, I dont think for $15 you will be disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We were very disappointed to receive the wrong product.</li>
            <li> hated it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I think I may have received a duplicate one. It did not even last for 1 hour. My Axe Bodyspray last longer that this.&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Lasts a really long time and for such a low price whats not to love? Will consider other thallium versions soon</li>
            <li> nice smell, but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne... My best blind choice.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts long, good buy.</li>
            <li> Amazon lists two Thallium Sport items a regular and a \\&quot;limited edition\\&quot; The pictures are even different. Please be aware that they are the same item. Thallium sport and Thallium sport Limited Edition are the same thing. BTW the cologne smells great you should buy it.</li>
            <li> A weak but pleasant fragrance that lasts for about 30 minutes and then poof!.. it&#x27;s gone!  For the price, it&#x27;s fair!</li>
            <li> nice for everyday......</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my brothers, hands down is one of the best, it has a very enjoying full scent , people usually ask him where he got it the smell last the whole day, His girlfriend said she loves it so i would recommend this cologne to men out there chicks really dig it :).</li>
            <li> Thallium sport is a great Cologne</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. I always get asked about it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell excellent product would definitely buy it again soon.</li>
            <li> Good sporty scent, now I can afford to buy more than one bottle.</li>
            <li> When I think of Sport, I think fresh, cool, nose-catching fragrances.  However, this didn&#x27;t quite do it for me.  It&#x27;s hard to explain some fragrances other than sometimes the fragrance can seem annoying.  I ended up giving it to my son and he seems to enjoy it.  Thallium Black gets ALOT more compliments.</li>
            <li> I have been using  for a couple of years and love it !!!!  I usually use in special occasions, when going to a party or important events. It smells AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good summer/day sent. Its not in your face bold. For the price I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a buy for sure. It reminds me of juicy fruit gum, but in a good way! Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I prefer the Original Thallium myself. It&#x27;s all about preference. I do feel that the vast majority of people would enjoy this sent. It also last a long time.</li>
            <li> I like this because it has a mild smell. And the people around me says I smell great at work. I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> everything was great. No problems.</li>
            <li> Smell so good, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t ever buy again. Did not work well with my chemistry and even before use it did not have the olfactory notes claimed in the description.</li>
            <li> Lets be honest here.  A lot of colognes are very expensive, and pretty much only because they know that we are willing to pay a lot of money to smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking to get a bottle of cologne that wasn&#x27;t so expensive that I could wear on a daily basis.  I have expensive colognes but I don&#x27;t particularly want to go through a 60 dollar bottle of Polo when all I&#x27;m doing is going to work with a bunch of dudes.  I&#x27;ll save the expensive stuff for the nights when I&#x27;m with my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now all of that being said, this cologne smells good enough to be worn around my wife sometimes, too.  I was hoping to use this as a travel bottle, but alas, the atomizer button is exposed on the top and there is no cap to cover it, so I cannot just throw it in a bag for fear that it will spray itself all over who-knows-what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read the description to see what this sort of smells like.  I will tell you how it smells from a real-life realistic standpoint.  For your info, I wear colognes on my shirt due to the fact that when I wear cologne on my skin, my skin can get irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the initial application, the most prominent scent is vanilla.  The heavy vanilla smell falls to a moderate level within a minute or so and the woody scents come through.  I&#x27;d say that for the first two or three hours, the scent would best be akin to a vanilla cake inside of a freshly cut cedar box.  Don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;d find such a thing, but that&#x27;s what you smell like.  Smells masculine and warm but not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several hours, the vanilla and woody scents fall away and the lasting scent is very light and sort of fruity and grassy.  Not feminine at all, though, to be clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longevity is good.  The initial scent last for several hours, and I have had that long-lasting fruity/grassy scent last on a shirt for nearly two days while not being worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely for daywear or maybe, in a pinch, casual evenings during thespring or summer.  Not for evenings in the fall or winter or anything too fancy like that.  For events like that, I use Polo Black or Polo Blue, although those cost about four times as much as Thallium.  I do not have experience with other Thallium scents, but I may experiment with them soon to see if there is a less expensive alternative for evening wear.</li>
            <li> Brother-in-law states he now have a favorite cologne.  My sister love the smell and is going to order it for her son.</li>
            <li> great smell love all Thallium</li>
            <li> If you stink and don&#x27;t shower use Axe! If you like to smell good ontop of taking care of yourself than use cologne! This scent works for me and the ladies so make sure what you buy works well with you&#x27;re body chemistry... Spray it on and leave it on for a few hours than ask others!</li>
            <li> Great product perfect.</li>
            <li> No scent whatsoever five minutes after applying.  First mens spray I have used that performed so poorly.</li>
            <li> Thallium &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; is a clone of Chanel&#x27;s &amp;#34;Allure Homme Sport&amp;#34;. It does a decent job capturing the vibe of &amp;#34;AHS&amp;#34;, but with a few draw backs. First, the lemon note is a little dominating, and it doesn&#x27;t have the peppery base of &amp;#34;AHS&amp;#34; which is unfortunate. Thallium &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; also has a slightly synthetic scent, but it isn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance is also below average, but that is to be expected with a cheaper fragrance. I also think the bottle is pretty cool; it reminds me of something you would see at the barbershop, sitting on the ledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you don&#x27;t want to spend $90/bottle for &amp;#34;AHS&amp;#34;, you can get Thallium &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; and still have something that smells nice and is pretty similar.</li>
            <li> Great price and it smells amazing</li>
            <li> this one has a nice somewhat spicy but fresh scent a good all day cologne</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why others voted it other than 5 stars, this is a must have in your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Worth more than what it sells for.&lt;br /&gt;2. Lasted entire night.&lt;br /&gt;3. 1st night out wearing it, had 2 complements&lt;br /&gt;4. Can&#x27;t stop enjoying the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a list of edt&#x27;s/colognes to gamble on and hit a jackpot with Thallium Sport!</li>
            <li> I truly LOVE the original Thallium. I&#x27;ve worn it exclusively since I got it over a month ago. So having fallen in love with the original I thought there would be a good chance I would love this one as well. But unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s a very sharp blast of citrus and that&#x27;s all I get from it. I can&#x27;t detect any other notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It almost instantly gave me a headache and I had to wash it off. I haven&#x27;t tried the Black version but from the notes I just don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it so don&#x27;t wanna waste money on it. I will be trying the Thallium for Women tho. I like the notes and hope it isn&#x27;t too feminine smelling, so maybe I can pull it off as a dude.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance but it last (max) only 3 hours on my skin ... I ish it lasted longer but I guess for the price I cannot complain</li>
            <li> If I were to review this item based on the fragrance, I would give it three stars.  However(it you knew me you would know that there was going to be a \\&quot;HOWEVER\\&quot;), bases on certain circumstances; especially the price, this is definitely a 5 star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me tell you about this cologne.  When an individual puts this on, he (since it is a male&#x27;s product) won&#x27;t be overwhelmed.  The hint of spices and the sweet aroma compliment each other very well.  I (since I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur in the science of aromas)say that this is a daytime cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have not received any compliments, that is probably because I have not been out all day.  When I will, then I will write another favorable review.  Until then.</li>
            <li> This brand of mens cologne is very nice and last a good while, i have bought the original a few times and new just got the Sport, not a fan of the black (yet!)</li>
            <li> Smell great,and affordable price. Last all day long</li>
            <li> I bought Thallium from Premier Health and Beauty and they sent me the wrong kind. My husband loves Thallium, that is why I&#x27;m not knocking the product. We were very disappointed to receive the wrong product. Just be aware that they could screw you order up......[[ASIN:B002XQ1Y86 Thallium By Jacques Evard For Men Edt Spray 3.3 Oz]]</li>
            <li> This smells very good. I leave at in my office at work and when I put it on me anyone coming to my office would notice its nice odor. Really worth every penny and its price is excellent</li>
            <li> Price is good, love this perfume. I have to be careful because a lot of perfumes give me a bad headache, but this is very nice, love the scent...</li>
            <li> Smells great! I get complemented all the time. If your looking for something that sticks to you, this is your product.</li>
            <li> Great buy And great smell</li>
            <li> I did smell this fragrance in a small store on my last trip and after I finished it I when on amazon to buy this perfume.  I found a great surprise, the price was cheapest than the store.</li>
            <li> The price was right&lt;br /&gt;the smell is great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase more Thallium products in the future&lt;br /&gt;the scent lasts</li>
            <li> I have Thallium Sport, original, and black....all three are unique and smell nothing alike, yet all are great. I have used the original for a while and recently bought the black and this one which is the sport...for the price you just can&#x27;t beat these colognes. I have so many bottles of cologne its crazy..always four or five at one time and can tell you that when I spray any of the Thallium colognes on me, I always am getting compliments and they want to know what I am wearing and of course when I tell them they are like...\\&quot;what name\\&quot;...they are diamonds in the rough..smell better than most my 50 or 60 dollar colognes..try it for the price you have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Seriously one of my favorite colognes, I have bought many through the years but I can say that this is a great fragrance to have in your smell great arsenal. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This product smells perfectly like the best international and well-known brands. Compare to the price, I believe this is the best one can get. The seller is also very professionally spoils his customers.</li>
            <li> Smells very good. The spray top is a little flimsy, but it still works fine</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. Only con with it is that I wish that it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Awesome Spring/Summer fragrance. Doesn&#x27;t last all day but does the job for the price!! Bought this one in the blind but pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> We saw this same cologne at the mall in One if Those kiosk in the middle of the mall and they wanted $45 for one bottle or 2 for $75. Not only did I make my step dad happy but saved a lot of money by buying from amazon!! Thank u!!!</li>
            <li> It smells really good and my husband love it</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne. I used to buy the expensive stuff at Macy&#x27;s, but with 2 children I have to budget myself. This compares to the stuff that I used to get.</li>
            <li> Decent fragrance overall but doesnt last long...bottle is cheapyly made....</li>
            <li> Really like Tallium colognes in general but this Sport edition is too light.  It seem like it is gone minutes after you Spray it on.  I bought the Black at the same time and it has a better bite to it.  Some might like it but not what I was looking for but I will still wear it in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by the price.  This cologne has a great smell that stays on a long time.  My husband loves it for daily use.</li>
            <li> Amazing cologne, and lasts all day! Great for casual situations</li>
            <li> At first spritz, I got a strong Alcohol smell I didnt like then it began to smell familiar maybe like Polo Big Pony or more like True Religion Drifter.&lt;br /&gt;I hated it. I regret buying it and was only going to use it as a bathroom air freshener or for my sneakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wearing it for 20-30mins I notice a  change.I started to smell the sweetness in it and around 30-35mins I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling myself. As my body tempt rises I can smell the fragrance lifting off of my body and I was pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a true sporty scent but I think it smells good enough to wear on a first date. I only use 3 sprays ,2 arms and once on tshirt. Its light but warm. great for all day but optimal warm weather and ok at Cool tempts.&lt;br /&gt;I can see myself wearing this to a wedding or Basket ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on taking a  trip to Brasil and I am seriously considering taking the scent. It well be good on those Rio Nights by the beach.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I can name the notes that I smell it says it has Pineapple, Viviter,Patchouli but I cant make them out. I do smell the a hint of lemon every now and then and I do smell and feel that Vanilla warmness so let me describe it like this. once it drys down.It doesnt smell like anything i have tried before  but let me try. I would say It is in the vain or Issey Miyake Sport,Ck One,Polo Red to my noise this is the scent and feel i get from this Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Dont be afraid to try it, I dont think for $15 you will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly if you dont like it, I will buy it from you. For a  reduced price that is LOL . I am considering trying Thallium other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hope this helps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh I put some on at 6:30pm and 8:30 i can still smell it with every move I make. I give it a B+ for projection. YOu are not going to smell it across the room but if you shake someone&#x27;s hand or walk by them at the water cooler you will get a wiff of it. What I have been doing is applying it to my shirt as well as behind the neck,chest and arms this seems to help the projection and longevity. Also I have been using  coco Butter oil or lotion on my skin which is great for my brown skin tone but it also has a vanilla smell which compliments this fragrance. Im going to shower and wear this stuff too bed.&lt;br /&gt;Its that nice of a smell. I which they made lotion,soap etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/25/14&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing this juice for 4 days now. Every single day I get at least 1 compliment. I will buy this again!!!ion and longevity.

            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last very long. Seems kind of cheap</li>
