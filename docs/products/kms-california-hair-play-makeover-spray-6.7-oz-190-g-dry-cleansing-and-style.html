            <li>The smell is okay after it&#x27;s been on your hair a while, but initially, it&#x27;s really strong</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo ever.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling clean!</li>
            <li>and wow, my hair has great lift, no greasy feel</li>
            <li>Feel free to comment and ask any questions &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I got a sample from my hairdresser and loved it so much I wanted to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I like the smell (and so does my husband, which is surprising because he&#x27;s very picky about smells), and it seems to work</li>
            <li>now I wash my hair every 3 days my hair is much healthier and my hair looks good always.</li>
            <li>Hair Play is nice and light and perfect for fine, limp hair in between washings</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo E.V.E.R!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not as strong as Batista, but it&#x27;s not that powdery.</li>
            <li>but most of all that the vendor shipped it right away!</li>
            <li>My hair looks more full when I use it.</li>
            <li>I cannot even see it on my hands, it&#x27;s that fine.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this product helps me avoid washing for 2 to 3 days</li>
            <li>So the most success has been spray and let go rather than spray and HOLD of</li>
            <li>No white residue and smells great</li>
            <li>This is by far the best dry shampoo available in my opinion!</li>
            <li>consistently the best dry shampoo ever!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I am pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Love the product but the nozzle got messed up after the first use.</li>
            <li>When used sparingly this is great for days when you don&#x27;t have time to wash and dry your hair.</li>
            <li>It defintely gives hair a lift and works great as a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks clean after.</li>
            <li>It smells great, doesn&#x27;t affect my color, and gives me a few more days between washings...which saves my color.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and my hair feels soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is a little oily spray some of this in and instantly hair smells nice and looks great!</li>
            <li>It however does a good job to revive and put some extra body in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the size, but has a very chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li>This is particularly true if I use it two days in a row without wetting my hair.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light, fresh and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Said it could take up to two weeks to arrive the speedy delivery is what I love so much about this seller.</li>
            <li>It arrived it was full.</li>
            <li>This is by far THE BEST dry shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>So far this is the best dry hairspray I have used.  </li>
            <li>I can get super curls or brush it out a bit for wave.</li>
            <li>That is when I use Batiste because it is much more powerful on absorbing the oil.</li>
            <li>Good dry shampoo or style refresher.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone looking for a good dry shampoo to use between washes!</li>
            <li>is definitely the best dry shampoo I have used!</li>
            <li>This KMS line is amazing and you can extend nabbing to wash your have daily to every two to three days with this product!!!  </li>
            <li>It does its job and isn&#x27;t heavy or filmy and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>it can keeps your hair fresh all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair will not hold a curl if it&#x27;s freshly washed.</li>
            <li>Spray it on and it soaks up the oil in the hair, making it looked fresh again.</li>
            <li>makes your hair smell fresh</li>
            <li>Love it for day old hair to freshen up and revive my hairstyle.</li>
            <li>If the price wasn&#x27;t so high, I could quite easily go through 1 bottle every month.</li>
            <li>Smells great and really makes your hair look light and fluffy like it&#x27;s just been blown out!</li>
            <li>(I am right handed).  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and am always looking for something to keep my hair under control, especially in a fancy updo</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other dry shampoo because I&#x27;ve found the perfect one!</li>
            <li>the less it is a good product .</li>
            <li>KMS California Dry Sampoo smells nice and works well -</li>
            <li>It smells good, but if if can&#x27;t wear black, this is a dud.</li>
            <li>The best dry shampoo hands down.</li>
            <li>Have tried every dry shampoo on the market and this one is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>I have tried several dry shampoos and this product is, by far, the best!</li>
            <li>The smell is just okay, so I also spray body spray from Bath and Body Works on my roots and then blow dry upside down and my hair looks as good as fresh washed and styled.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li>and I am ready to go!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend using it more than occasionally.</li>
            <li>Subsequently,  I receive many complements.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The first time I sprayed this on my hair, the nozzle broke</li>
            <li>It really revived my hair on my in between days of no washing!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I also tend to have a pretty oily scalp, use after the gym, hot weather, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rinsed the nozzle in hot water, but nothing seems to work, and it just ends up spraying propellant on my hair, making it oily.</li>
            <li>I love the added texture it gives to day old limp hair, and it smells nicely as well.  </li>
            <li>Tried this for the first time today and then if got to work, my whole coat was powdered!</li>
            <li>It really helps my hair feel and look fresh and that result lasts all day, also like another brand I tried.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that there was hardly any residue in my hair after giving myself a good dry shampoo, however it doesn&#x27;t compare to Batiste products.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out color treated hair, and it super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that gets oily after a day, so I normally rely on cornstarch to revive it the next day.</li>
            <li>I love using it to give my hair some lift and after a long day it refreshes my hair to go out for the evening.</li>
            <li>I also really love the smell, which lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s way better dry shampoo out there</li>
            <li>I have tried many dry shampoos and this is the only one that truly combats oil and blends easily</li>
            <li>Love this dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo brand!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite dry shampoos!</li>
            <li>And it smells decent too!</li>
            <li>It aids in giving your hair a lot of body too when you are trying to style it, but I mainly use it for getting rid of oily hair!  </li>
            <li>It works amazingly also if your blonde and like a little bit more of the fresh look like when you leave a salon and your highlights are still white</li>
            <li>Im sold on this product and recommend it to anybody who wants to give their hair a break from shampooing and all the stress that goes with that.</li>
            <li>and it does help to use it when you are trying to make your hair ready for an updo.  </li>
            <li>I eventually used the whole can, but I won&#x27;t buy it again for that reason.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for all!</li>
            <li>It covers the oil on my roots very well also.</li>
            <li>I have straight and very oily hair.</li>
            <li>I use KMS on day 2 &amp; 3 when my hair isn&#x27;t much oily.</li>
            <li>KMS - not so much.  </li>
            <li>It also adds some much needed volume, when doing up dos...</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to tease so much...</li>
            <li>Keeps my day old hair looking fresh.</li>
            <li>had used it in the past , but I ordered it online for the first time , it is kind of pricey , none</li>
            <li>So, I was excited to hear their was a product to use in place of washing your hair, it is supposed to put the &#x27;lift&#x27; back into your hair even though you didn&#x27;t wash it.  </li>
            <li>This product was way better than the other products I&#x27;ve tried like this.</li>
            <li>This is a great dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t create a powdery mess.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite dry shampoo ever!  </li>
            <li>Even with my dark, thick hair, it works great!</li>
            <li>This amazing product absorbs oil and helps me freshen up day old hair styles without leaving any residue or weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li>By far my favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>This product does a decent job..</li>
            <li>I thought because it was high end, it would deliver.  </li>
            <li>I have found herbal essence dry shampoo to do just as good a job with no film and half the cost.</li>
            <li>My hair feels normal, like I washed it.</li>
            <li>I just spray a few areas on the top of my head, blend it in and style as normal.</li>
            <li>and this is powerful enough for my sweaty head!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos, and this is my favorite</li>
            <li>I have tried so many dry shampoos and this is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li>I have tried many dry shampoos and this one is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make it look like I squeezed powder on my head.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>this product works the best for thin hair as it is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>I received this earlier than expected and love this product.  </li>
            <li>However, I had the same problem with the new one!!!</li>
            <li>I used to hate my day two hair, but after using KMS, I now love my day two hair more than my freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li>I have the MOST greasy hard on the planet and this stuff is just a lifesaver on days when I can&#x27;t get up in time.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair look less oily and extremely clean.</li>
            <li>I am currently using Umberto Beverly Hills Dry Clean (purchased at Target for $8.99).</li>
            <li>It works very well on blonde hair and extends my hair washing when needed.</li>
            <li>My hair looks completely rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>This is one of the more expensive brands (although I&#x27;m sure there are ones even more expensive)</li>
            <li>So far, I am liking it.</li>
            <li>Product came about two weeks early.</li>
            <li>and I look like a 100 years old person.  </li>
            <li>I dye my hair, but my natural hair is oily so as my roots grow in this stuff is a savior.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida where it is hot and humid 11 months out of the year, and if I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily it gets really gross.</li>
            <li>First time user of a dry shampoo... chose this one based on the rave reviews...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, especially for finer hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as fond of the smell as some of the other reviewers, but it&#x27;s not bad enough to bother me.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weight hair down, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It is pretty expensive for how much you get and how quickly the can is gone.</li>
            <li>It occasionally leaves a white residue if I use too much.</li>
            <li>My hair has been acting up lately, so I&#x27;ve been trying to change my routine and take better care of it.</li>
            <li>This is the first dry shampoo product that I actually like!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoo products before but they were all too heavy and gross feeling.  </li>
            <li>I am very new to the dry shampoo craze, but someone recommended KMS Hair Play to me, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>just how dry shampoo is supposed to work, but as I said, I am new to it, so I don&#x27;t know!</li>
            <li>I use it on clean, dry hair and it helps to keep your style, as if not freshly washed.</li>
            <li>, I flat iron my hair practically every day, but thanks to this spray i can wash my hair Sunday night, flat iron it on Monday and wash it Tuesday.  </li>
            <li>Heck, it barely holds a curl anyway &#x27;cause</li>
            <li>While this is a decent dry shampoo, it didn&#x27;t perform the way I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>I just called the manufacturer, but they need the batch number on the bottle as apparently they&#x27;ve changed the packaging (hopefully to fix that problem).</li>
            <li>I can only get away with using this on day old hair.  </li>
            <li>Its also not wet</li>
            <li>Initially when you spray it on it makes your hair a little lighter or powdery looking but a couple of quick pats and it&#x27;s invisible.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is unlike some other dry sprays I have used, if you don&#x27;t watch how much you are layering on then it will leave a powdery white residue, kind of like baby powder, if over used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to experiment with some other brands to see if I can get something comparable without spending so much.</li>
            <li>I am a new dry shampoo user.</li>
            <li>I just spray it in, give my hair a quick brush or a little blow dry</li>
            <li>It arrived fast, and was looking forward to trying it out, but my let down was only on the smell.</li>
            <li>I have used many dry shampoos and this one is very heavy and makes my hair feel even more dirty.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of white powder behind.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff smells great and worked very well.</li>

            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely though.  </li>

            <li> I tried Batiste first and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I love this spray, it keeps my hair nice looking and fresh</li>
            <li> The smell is okay after it&#x27;s been on your hair a while, but initially, it&#x27;s really strong</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo ever.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling clean!</li>
            <li> and wow, my hair has great lift, no greasy feel</li>
            <li> Feel free to comment and ask any questions &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I got a sample from my hairdresser and loved it so much I wanted to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I like the smell (and so does my husband, which is surprising because he&#x27;s very picky about smells), and it seems to work</li>
            <li> now I wash my hair every 3 days my hair is much healthier and my hair looks good always.</li>
            <li> Hair Play is nice and light and perfect for fine, limp hair in between washings</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo E.V.E.R!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not as strong as Batista, but it&#x27;s not that powdery.</li>
            <li> but most of all that the vendor shipped it right away!</li>
            <li> My hair looks more full when I use it.</li>
            <li> I cannot even see it on my hands, it&#x27;s that fine.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li> Fortunately, this product helps me avoid washing for 2 to 3 days</li>
            <li> So the most success has been spray and let go rather than spray and HOLD of</li>
            <li> No white residue and smells great</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo available in my opinion!</li>
            <li> consistently the best dry shampoo ever!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I am pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the nozzle got messed up after the first use.</li>
            <li> When used sparingly this is great for days when you don&#x27;t have time to wash and dry your hair.</li>
            <li> It defintely gives hair a lift and works great as a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks clean after.</li>
            <li> It smells great, doesn&#x27;t affect my color, and gives me a few more days between washings...which saves my color.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and my hair feels soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is a little oily spray some of this in and instantly hair smells nice and looks great!</li>
            <li> It however does a good job to revive and put some extra body in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the size, but has a very chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li> This is particularly true if I use it two days in a row without wetting my hair.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light, fresh and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Said it could take up to two weeks to arrive the speedy delivery is what I love so much about this seller.</li>
            <li> It arrived it was full.</li>
            <li> This is by far THE BEST dry shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> So far this is the best dry hairspray I have used.  </li>
            <li> I can get super curls or brush it out a bit for wave.</li>
            <li> That is when I use Batiste because it is much more powerful on absorbing the oil.</li>
            <li> Good dry shampoo or style refresher.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone looking for a good dry shampoo to use between washes!</li>
            <li> is definitely the best dry shampoo I have used!</li>
            <li> This KMS line is amazing and you can extend nabbing to wash your have daily to every two to three days with this product!!!  </li>
            <li> It does its job and isn&#x27;t heavy or filmy and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> it can keeps your hair fresh all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair will not hold a curl if it&#x27;s freshly washed.</li>
            <li> Spray it on and it soaks up the oil in the hair, making it looked fresh again.</li>
            <li> makes your hair smell fresh</li>
            <li> Love it for day old hair to freshen up and revive my hairstyle.</li>
            <li> If the price wasn&#x27;t so high, I could quite easily go through 1 bottle every month.</li>
            <li> Smells great and really makes your hair look light and fluffy like it&#x27;s just been blown out!</li>
            <li> (I am right handed).  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and am always looking for something to keep my hair under control, especially in a fancy updo</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other dry shampoo because I&#x27;ve found the perfect one!</li>
            <li> the less it is a good product .</li>
            <li> KMS California Dry Sampoo smells nice and works well -</li>
            <li> It smells good, but if if can&#x27;t wear black, this is a dud.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo hands down.</li>
            <li> Have tried every dry shampoo on the market and this one is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos and this product is, by far, the best!</li>
            <li> The smell is just okay, so I also spray body spray from Bath and Body Works on my roots and then blow dry upside down and my hair looks as good as fresh washed and styled.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li> and I am ready to go!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using it more than occasionally.</li>
            <li> Subsequently,  I receive many complements.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The first time I sprayed this on my hair, the nozzle broke</li>
            <li> It really revived my hair on my in between days of no washing!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I also tend to have a pretty oily scalp, use after the gym, hot weather, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rinsed the nozzle in hot water, but nothing seems to work, and it just ends up spraying propellant on my hair, making it oily.</li>
            <li> I love the added texture it gives to day old limp hair, and it smells nicely as well.  </li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time today and then if got to work, my whole coat was powdered!</li>
            <li> It really helps my hair feel and look fresh and that result lasts all day, also like another brand I tried.  </li>
            <li> I liked the fact that there was hardly any residue in my hair after giving myself a good dry shampoo, however it doesn&#x27;t compare to Batiste products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out color treated hair, and it super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that gets oily after a day, so I normally rely on cornstarch to revive it the next day.</li>
            <li> I love using it to give my hair some lift and after a long day it refreshes my hair to go out for the evening.</li>
            <li> I also really love the smell, which lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s way better dry shampoo out there</li>
            <li> I have tried many dry shampoos and this is the only one that truly combats oil and blends easily</li>
            <li> Love this dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo brand!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite dry shampoos!</li>
            <li> And it smells decent too!</li>
            <li> It aids in giving your hair a lot of body too when you are trying to style it, but I mainly use it for getting rid of oily hair!  </li>
            <li> It works amazingly also if your blonde and like a little bit more of the fresh look like when you leave a salon and your highlights are still white</li>
            <li> Im sold on this product and recommend it to anybody who wants to give their hair a break from shampooing and all the stress that goes with that.</li>
            <li> and it does help to use it when you are trying to make your hair ready for an updo.  </li>
            <li> I eventually used the whole can, but I won&#x27;t buy it again for that reason.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for all!</li>
            <li> It covers the oil on my roots very well also.</li>
            <li> I have straight and very oily hair.</li>
            <li> I use KMS on day 2 &amp; 3 when my hair isn&#x27;t much oily.</li>
            <li> KMS - not so much.  </li>
            <li> It also adds some much needed volume, when doing up dos...</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to tease so much...</li>
            <li> Keeps my day old hair looking fresh.</li>
            <li> had used it in the past , but I ordered it online for the first time , it is kind of pricey , none</li>
            <li> So, I was excited to hear their was a product to use in place of washing your hair, it is supposed to put the &#x27;lift&#x27; back into your hair even though you didn&#x27;t wash it.  </li>
            <li> This product was way better than the other products I&#x27;ve tried like this.</li>
            <li> This is a great dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t create a powdery mess.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite dry shampoo ever!  </li>
            <li> Even with my dark, thick hair, it works great!</li>
            <li> This amazing product absorbs oil and helps me freshen up day old hair styles without leaving any residue or weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> By far my favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> This product does a decent job..</li>
            <li> I thought because it was high end, it would deliver.  </li>
            <li> I have found herbal essence dry shampoo to do just as good a job with no film and half the cost.</li>
            <li> My hair feels normal, like I washed it.</li>
            <li> I just spray a few areas on the top of my head, blend it in and style as normal.</li>
            <li> and this is powerful enough for my sweaty head!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos, and this is my favorite</li>
            <li> I have tried so many dry shampoos and this is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried many dry shampoos and this one is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make it look like I squeezed powder on my head.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> this product works the best for thin hair as it is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I received this earlier than expected and love this product.  </li>
            <li> However, I had the same problem with the new one!!!</li>
            <li> I used to hate my day two hair, but after using KMS, I now love my day two hair more than my freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li> I have the MOST greasy hard on the planet and this stuff is just a lifesaver on days when I can&#x27;t get up in time.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair look less oily and extremely clean.</li>
            <li> I am currently using Umberto Beverly Hills Dry Clean (purchased at Target for $8.99).</li>
            <li> It works very well on blonde hair and extends my hair washing when needed.</li>
            <li> My hair looks completely rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> This is one of the more expensive brands (although I&#x27;m sure there are ones even more expensive)</li>
            <li> So far, I am liking it.</li>
            <li> Product came about two weeks early.</li>
            <li> and I look like a 100 years old person.  </li>
            <li> I dye my hair, but my natural hair is oily so as my roots grow in this stuff is a savior.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida where it is hot and humid 11 months out of the year, and if I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily it gets really gross.</li>
            <li> First time user of a dry shampoo... chose this one based on the rave reviews...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, especially for finer hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as fond of the smell as some of the other reviewers, but it&#x27;s not bad enough to bother me.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weight hair down, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It is pretty expensive for how much you get and how quickly the can is gone.</li>
            <li> It occasionally leaves a white residue if I use too much.</li>
            <li> My hair has been acting up lately, so I&#x27;ve been trying to change my routine and take better care of it.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo product that I actually like!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoo products before but they were all too heavy and gross feeling.  </li>
            <li> I am very new to the dry shampoo craze, but someone recommended KMS Hair Play to me, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> just how dry shampoo is supposed to work, but as I said, I am new to it, so I don&#x27;t know!</li>
            <li> I use it on clean, dry hair and it helps to keep your style, as if not freshly washed.</li>
            <li> , I flat iron my hair practically every day, but thanks to this spray i can wash my hair Sunday night, flat iron it on Monday and wash it Tuesday.  </li>
            <li> Heck, it barely holds a curl anyway &#x27;cause</li>
            <li> While this is a decent dry shampoo, it didn&#x27;t perform the way I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> I just called the manufacturer, but they need the batch number on the bottle as apparently they&#x27;ve changed the packaging (hopefully to fix that problem).</li>
            <li> I can only get away with using this on day old hair.  </li>
            <li> Its also not wet</li>
            <li> Initially when you spray it on it makes your hair a little lighter or powdery looking but a couple of quick pats and it&#x27;s invisible.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is unlike some other dry sprays I have used, if you don&#x27;t watch how much you are layering on then it will leave a powdery white residue, kind of like baby powder, if over used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to experiment with some other brands to see if I can get something comparable without spending so much.</li>
            <li> I am a new dry shampoo user.</li>
            <li> I just spray it in, give my hair a quick brush or a little blow dry</li>
            <li> It arrived fast, and was looking forward to trying it out, but my let down was only on the smell.</li>
            <li> I have used many dry shampoos and this one is very heavy and makes my hair feel even more dirty.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of white powder behind.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product as it never made my dark hair look dull or powdery or make the roots feel thick and gross as another brand did.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it!!</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works very well for adding texture, alleviating greasiness, and it works as a great base before teasing hair!</li>
            <li> This is strange, since I&#x27;ve had the same problem with 2 different bottles of it.</li>
            <li> I will be using a different brand for my dry shampoo in the future.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out several different dry shampoos</li>
            <li> It actually gets rid of the grease without making your hair look dry and gives your hair a lot of life.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like feeling like I have a wig on when I use dry shampoo, and this definitely absorbs the oils without the yucky feeling!</li>
            <li> No other dry shampoo compares!!!  </li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it does add a bit of a strange texture to my hair which is why I have to blow dry it for a minute or so, which gets rid of it.</li>
            <li> Years back there was a dry shampoo called Pssst!  </li>
            <li> At the same time, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well on extra oily days compared to some other brands.  </li>
            <li> Can show white in my dark hair if not applied properly.</li>
            <li> I have long, mid-back hair, but this does the trick.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine and very thin.  </li>
            <li> or if I know it will be a long day, I will use it immediately after blowing dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Does do what it says, just smells like ethanol and not a good fresh smell I was expecting as with other brands.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come out as white as other dry shampoos and gives the body I need to my unwashed hair.</li>
            <li> I have never tried dry shampoo before.  </li>
            <li> My go-to for a Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and a tresemme dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you are wanting your dry shampoo to give you lift or volume, this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> what else do you want or need in a dry shampoo?</li>
            <li> It works very well and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any white powdery residue.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it smells very strong and I just couldn&#x27;t justify spraying something that smells so bad (like model glue?)</li>
            <li> and it is the only product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and gross feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> This tended to make my hair heavy and flat, the opposite of what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> For me, it just left my hair looking flat and heavy.  </li>
            <li> From a dry shampoo junkie to another, you need this!</li>
            <li> the can was empty.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (down to the bum) and often go 3 days without shampooing.  </li>
            <li> Just with those two changes, my hair feels healthier and less dry.</li>
            <li> The nozzle was difficult to use at first.</li>
            <li> I have dark thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave the white reside that some of the other dry shampoos tend to.  </li>
            <li> The other plus is that the price here is about half what my hair dresser charged me, $23.00.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a terrific lift whenever I feel I need &amp;#34;a little something&amp;#34;  to freshen up my look!!  </li>
            <li> It works well even for dark hair like mine with no flakes.  </li>
            <li> I give it and negative 10 if possible.</li>
            <li> It increases volume dramatically so that I can wear it down.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easier to distribute and less visible.</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick long dark hair.</li>
            <li> a little rub will not take out.</li>
            <li> I watched a video about not washing your hair everyday and they recommended this product as a replacement to your &#x27;off&#x27; days where you don&#x27;t wash your hair.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I changed my shampoo/conditioner and try not to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Cornstarch, however, can be messy and leaves powdery residue in your hair and clothes that your hair rubs against during the day.</li>
            <li> Hair Play Makeover spray for a few years now.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair too heavy.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it came in less the 24 hours of ordering it!</li>
            <li> Not to mention the mess it made sitting on my counter oozing out!</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the less expensive tresemme.</li>
            <li> It works on my thick hair and my daughter&#x27;s thin hair equally well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually smell it throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I had in the past wash my hair everyday which is not good</li>
            <li> dosn&#x27;t last very long:(</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that I do sometimes feel it when I run my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li> The nozzle doesn&#x27;t appear broke but the product is just slowly spitting out and won&#x27;t spray.</li>
            <li> Other ones I tried had either too much powder, or nasty residue feeling.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m too lazy or too rushed to wash my hair, which is often!</li>
            <li> The problem with not washing your hair everyday though is that it can feel a little greasy...or dirty.</li>
            <li> They always smell horrible, leave a white residue, leaves my hair flat or just doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t use very much or your hair gets nasty and greasy.</li>
            <li> My secret weapon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this product</li>
            <li> NOT happy</li>
            <li> Needless to say I didn&#x27;t even get to use the product once because of this.</li>
            <li> But I do spray it in the shower or else it leaves the bathroom floor feeling weird.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to take care of my hair, let alone wash, style, etc.  </li>
            <li> look* dirty.</li>
            <li> I am an unhappy customer.</li>
            <li> It takes that bad dirty scalp smell out of my hair.</li>
            <li> and I felt bad spraying it in the house around my family.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s bad, it just didn&#x27;t do what I wanted....</li>
            <li> I wish it had a nicer scent, but it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I watched a video about not washing your hair everyday and they recommended this product as a replacement to your &#x27;off&#x27; days where you don&#x27;t wash your hair.  So, I was excited to hear their was a product to use in place of washing your hair, it is supposed to put the &#x27;lift&#x27; back into your hair even though you didn&#x27;t wash it.  Well nervous as I was, I tried it and wow, my hair has great lift, no greasy feel and my husband didn&#x27;t even know I did not wash my hair. He didn&#x27;t have a clue.  Im sold on this product and recommend it to anybody who wants to give their hair a break from shampooing and all the stress that goes with that. My hair feels normal, like I washed it.</li>
            <li> After not using this product for years and then going back to it I dont love it the way I used to. It comes out very very white and leaves a lot of powder showing. There&#x27;s way better dry shampoo out there now, like got2b rockin it or dove refresh+care volume which are way cheaper products as well as being better</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product of all time. If the price wasn&#x27;t so high, I could quite easily go through 1 bottle every month. It gives great texture and volume. I love the smell! It occasionally leaves a white residue if I use too much.</li>
            <li> This left a residue that flaked.  I will be using a different brand for my dry shampoo in the future.  Not my favorite product!!</li>
            <li> Smells good and does the trick!</li>
            <li> Smells great, works pretty good, but dosn&#x27;t last very long:(</li>
            <li> Bought several times!</li>
            <li> Havent used but I like their stuff</li>
            <li> I have never tried dry shampoo before.  I saw it online and bought it to help me style my hair.  I like the idea of it and it does help to use it when you are trying to make your hair ready for an updo.  The problem is that it smells very strong and I just couldn&#x27;t justify spraying something that smells so bad (like model glue?) just so my hair would look nice.  The smell is okay after it&#x27;s been on your hair a while, but initially, it&#x27;s really strong and I felt bad spraying it in the house around my family.  I eventually used the whole can, but I won&#x27;t buy it again for that reason.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased .Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I had used it in the past , but I ordered it online for the first time , it is kind of pricey , none the less it is a good product .</li>
            <li> It smells great and does not leave a stiff/sticky feeling to my hair! I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> First time user of a dry shampoo... chose this one based on the rave reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works well, smells great - I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I love using it to give my hair some lift and after a long day it refreshes my hair to go out for the evening. It does have a powderish look till I play with it and style my hair. Compared to what I used 30 years ago it great!</li>
            <li> awesome product. Makes your hair look less oily and extremely clean. also adds volume and bounce to your hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. This KMS line is amazing and you can extend nabbing to wash your have daily to every two to three days with this product!!!  Will not leave home without it!!</li>
            <li> KMS California Dry Sampoo smells nice and works well - My go-to for a Dry Shampoo.  Highly recommended for all!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It works wonders on day 2 or 3 hair!</li>
            <li> consistently the best dry shampoo ever!!</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works very well for adding texture, alleviating greasiness, and it works as a great base before teasing hair! My lift lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this product at all.  I have used many dry shampoos and this one is very heavy and makes my hair feel even more dirty.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo hands down. I have the MOST greasy hard on the planet and this stuff is just a lifesaver on days when I can&#x27;t get up in time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works very well on blonde hair and extends my hair washing when needed. It covers the oil on my roots very well also.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo available in my opinion! If your hair is a little oily spray some of this in and instantly hair smells nice and looks great!</li>
            <li> I have straight and very oily hair. I wash my hair everyday. I use it sometime in the PM to refresh. or if I know it will be a long day, I will use it immediately after blowing dry my hair. it can keeps your hair fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as strong as Batista, but it&#x27;s not that powdery. so it&#x27;s easier to distribute and less visible.</li>
            <li> Best ever! I have tried many dry shampoos and this is the only one that truly combats oil and blends easily</li>
            <li> I just found out about this &amp;#34;makeover&amp;#34; spray. I absolutely love it. It works. When I&#x27;m too lazy or too rushed to wash my hair, which is often! I use this, brush thoroughly and I&#x27;m ready to go! Love it!</li>
            <li> In order to keep my hair healthier I only wash it every three days. This product helps to keep my hair looking great on days two and three of not washing it. I just spray it in, give my hair a quick brush or a little blow dry and I am ready to go! My hair looks completely rejuvenated. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it does add a bit of a strange texture to my hair which is why I have to blow dry it for a minute or so, which gets rid of it.</li>
            <li> I love this spray, it keeps my hair nice looking and fresh, I flat iron my hair practically every day, but thanks to this spray i can wash my hair Sunday night, flat iron it on Monday and wash it Tuesday.  I&#x27;m so glad i was able to order it through amazon.com but most of all that the vendor shipped it right away!</li>
            <li> My hair has been acting up lately, so I&#x27;ve been trying to change my routine and take better care of it. I changed my shampoo/conditioner and try not to wash my hair everyday. Just with those two changes, my hair feels healthier and less dry. The problem with not washing your hair everyday though is that it can feel a little greasy...or dirty. I&#x27;ve been trying out several different dry shampoos and I always have the same problems. They always smell horrible, leave a white residue, leaves my hair flat or just doesn&#x27;t work at all. This product is none of those things. I just spray a few areas on the top of my head, blend it in and style as normal. It leaves my hair smelling great, feeling great and adds some volume. I would recommend this to everyone looking for a good dry shampoo to use between washes!</li>
            <li> Great for greasy day 2 hair. My hair is very fine and oily and this helps me get away with day 2 hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! Even with my dark, thick hair, it works great!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Product does a good job of refreshing hair between washes.  I have dark thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave the white reside that some of the other dry shampoos tend to.  At the same time, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well on extra oily days compared to some other brands.  It however does a good job to revive and put some extra body in my hair.  I&#x27;m not as fond of the smell as some of the other reviewers, but it&#x27;s not bad enough to bother me.  I don&#x27;t usually smell it throughout the day.  In all I would still recommend.</li>
            <li> When used sparingly this is great for days when you don&#x27;t have time to wash and dry your hair. But don&#x27;t use very much or your hair gets nasty and greasy. I don&#x27;t recommend using it more than occasionally.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some time and it is the only product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and gross feeling after using it. It has a nice smell and gets the job done. I would definitely suggest trying this product out for yourself!</li>
            <li> best product ever.  love it.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a terrific lift whenever I feel I need &amp;#34;a little something&amp;#34;  to freshen up my look!!  Subsequently,  I receive many complements.</li>
            <li> I love the size, but has a very chemical smell to it. Does do what it says, just smells like ethanol and not a good fresh smell I was expecting as with other brands. It arrived fast, and was looking forward to trying it out, but my let down was only on the smell. The fast process was great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works great and my husband loves the smell ;)</li>
            <li> Hairplay is a wonderful product. I use it on clean, dry hair and it helps to keep your style, as if not freshly washed. My hair will not hold a curl if it&#x27;s freshly washed. Heck, it barely holds a curl anyway &#x27;cause I have long, mid-back hair, but this does the trick. I can get super curls or brush it out a bit for wave. I spray as I curl, then after and BAM! Curly Sue!</li>
            <li> This is great for putting texture in at your roots for doing updos.  I highly recommend it, especially for finer hair.</li>
            <li> Love this dry shampoo!  It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of white powder behind.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I love using KMS hair play.  It defintely gives hair a lift and works great as a dry shampoo.  Defintely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product for those days you just can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to wash your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out color treated hair, and it super easy to use.  Spray it on and it soaks up the oil in the hair, making it looked fresh again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the more expensive brands (although I&#x27;m sure there are ones even more expensive) but I have been happy with it so I continue to buy.  The smell is great/makes your hair smell fresh and it helps to remove the oiliness from my thick-coarse hair if I haven&#x27;t had a chance to wash.  My secret weapon ;)</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that there was hardly any residue in my hair after giving myself a good dry shampoo, however it doesn&#x27;t compare to Batiste products. After using a lot of this product I still found my hair oily. This product isn&#x27;t cheap so I will no longer use it.</li>
            <li> The first time I sprayed this on my hair, the nozzle broke and I could not get the bottle to stop spraying the product. Needless to say I didn&#x27;t even get to use the product once because of this.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used! Expensive but worth it!! My hair stylist recommended this...Works well and smells much better than cheaper kinds!</li>
            <li> I am very new to the dry shampoo craze, but someone recommended KMS Hair Play to me, so I decided to try it. So far, I am liking it. I do find that my hair is more healthy when I do not shampoo every day, and this helps ensure my hair does not *look* dirty. My one complaint is that I do sometimes feel it when I run my hands through my hair. It feels like the finest baby powder. I cannot even see it on my hands, it&#x27;s that fine. This is particularly true if I use it two days in a row without wetting my hair. I think perhaps this is just how dry shampoo is supposed to work, but as I said, I am new to it, so I don&#x27;t know!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> works great, doesnt make hair look gray. But I do spray it in the shower or else it leaves the bathroom floor feeling weird.</li>
            <li> This is awesome and works so well, but the four stars is for the high price.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair smells when I use it.  It works well even for dark hair like mine with no flakes.  Initially when you spray it on it makes your hair a little lighter or powdery looking but a couple of quick pats and it&#x27;s invisible.  Have I mentioned how amazing it smells?</li>
            <li> I bought this and a tresemme dry shampoo. I actually prefer the less expensive tresemme.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite dry shampoo! Can show white in my dark hair if not applied properly. I can&#x27;t use anything else...</li>
            <li> I was led to believe it was something of a &#x27;volumizer&#x27;....NOT....I have very fine hair and am always looking for something to keep my hair under control, especially in a fancy updo (I&#x27;ve been watching &#x27;The Simple Things&#x27; on YouTube....the woman on it recommended it....I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s bad, it just didn&#x27;t do what I wanted....I will not be getting it again....Gemma</li>
            <li> Ladies - you MUST have this product in your gym bag for those days when you can&#x27;t shampoo. Volume. Style. Smell. It works on my thick hair and my daughter&#x27;s thin hair equally well. Love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and worked very well. I got a sample from my hairdresser and loved it so much I wanted to purchase it. However, it was out of my price range.&lt;br /&gt;However, it creates a wonderful texture, especially for shorter hair styles. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially my short haired peeps.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo! It works very well and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any white powdery residue. I live in Florida where it is hot and humid 11 months out of the year, and if I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily it gets really gross. Fortunately, this product helps me avoid washing for 2 to 3 days so I can preserve my color. I also really love the smell, which lasts a very long time. It gives good volume and texture to my hair, as well.</li>
            <li> From a dry shampoo junkie to another, you need this! Doesn&#x27;t weight hair down, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, fresh scent. Have tried every dry shampoo on the market and this one is hands down the best. JUST BUY IT!</li>
            <li> KMS Hair Play was recommended to me by a friend. This product does a decent job.. sometimes my hair still looks shiny though. However, it works well enough for the price. Next time I plan on trying a different brand.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I do not recommend it for brunettes, only blondes. It is essentially spray powder. The fragrance is light, fresh and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This product was way better than the other products I&#x27;ve tried like this. No baby powder residue on my roots. I don&#x27;t have oily hair and it&#x27;s pretty fine, the product worked great!! It really revived my hair on my in between days of no washing! And it smells decent too! I would buy many more!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite dry shampoo ever!  It&#x27;s light, smells great &amp; works great!  Not to mention it came in less the 24 hours of ordering it! Love.</li>
            <li> This is a great dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t create a powdery mess. I wish it had a nicer scent, but it isn&#x27;t bad. It does its job - creating texture on those days when you want to give your hair a break.</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick long dark hair. I use KMS and Batiste Powder Blush in between washing days. I use KMS on day 2 &amp; 3 when my hair isn&#x27;t much oily. It takes that bad dirty scalp smell out of my hair. I seperate it in sections and then rub my hands all throughout my scalp. It can leave a white residue, but it&#x27;s nothing a little rub will not take out. Throughout the day, I can smell it. Smells like apples! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;On day 4, my hair is oily. That is when I use Batiste because it is much more powerful on absorbing the oil. I spray &amp; rub the sameway. I don&#x27;t even brush my hair lol I just rub my fingers through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is colored and both of these products work for me. They both boost volume. Hope this review helps! Feel free to comment and ask any questions &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to mention. I workout 3-4 times a week and this is powerful enough for my sweaty head! ;)</li>
            <li> While this is a decent dry shampoo, it didn&#x27;t perform the way I had hoped.  I have long hair (down to the bum) and often go 3 days without shampooing.  I also tend to have a pretty oily scalp, use after the gym, hot weather, etc.  This tended to make my hair heavy and flat, the opposite of what I was looking for.  I thought because it was high end, it would deliver.  For me, it just left my hair looking flat and heavy.  The smell is lovely though.  I prefer Psssssst! which I can get for fraction of the price.  Pssssst! is definitely the best dry shampoo I have used!</li>
            <li> With rotator cuff surgery, I have the use of my left hand. (I am right handed).  It is difficult to take care of my hair, let alone wash, style, etc.  My hair is oily.  Every 2-3 days, I spray and wipe the strands of hair which removes the oil.  My hair looks clean after.</li>
            <li> It seems I&#x27;m the only person who&#x27;s reviewed this product that has had a problem getting it to come out of the bottle. This is strange, since I&#x27;ve had the same problem with 2 different bottles of it. If anybody else has had this problem, please advise on how to remedy it! I&#x27;ve rinsed the nozzle in hot water, but nothing seems to work, and it just ends up spraying propellant on my hair, making it oily. I just called the manufacturer, but they need the batch number on the bottle as apparently they&#x27;ve changed the packaging (hopefully to fix that problem). I will need to get that info and call again tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I am pretty satisfied with this product. I have very fine hair that gets oily after a day, so I normally rely on cornstarch to revive it the next day. Cornstarch, however, can be messy and leaves powdery residue in your hair and clothes that your hair rubs against during the day. I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos, and this is my favorite so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/10/13&lt;br /&gt;I contacted customer care, who told me there was a batch that had defective nozzles, and they promptly sent me a replacement bottle, along with a pre-paid label to send mine back. Kudos to them for doing that. However, I had the same problem with the new one!!! After this third bottle, I have given up. I am currently using Umberto Beverly Hills Dry Clean (purchased at Target for $8.99). It works great, is unscented, and, most importantly, COMES OUT OF THE BOTTLE EVERY TIME!!</li>
            <li> I am a new dry shampoo user. I tried Batiste first and loved it.  KMS - not so much.  My hair looked greasy everytime I used it.</li>
            <li> The nozzle was difficult to use at first. I didn&#x27;t put pressure evenly with my index finger perpendicular to the bottom of the bottle but instead an angle. When pressed at an angle, the powder gets things stuck to keep air leaking.  So the most success has been spray and let go rather than spray and HOLD of the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the even distribution of the powder.  The scent is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this dry shampoo.  I am able to go from a dance class, to the gym, to a lecture and then work without stopping to wash my hair. It has a nice scent and my hair feels soft and clean.  I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo brand! It actually gets rid of the grease without making your hair look dry and gives your hair a lot of life. It increases volume dramatically so that I can wear it down. This is the first dry shampoo product that I actually like!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells great, doesn&#x27;t affect my color, and gives me a few more days between washings...which saves my color.  It also adds some much needed volume, when doing up dos...so I don&#x27;t have to tease so much...which we all know, isn&#x27;t so great for the hair.</li>
            <li> Seems like Inside of bottle just an air...&lt;br /&gt;Never buy again</li>
            <li> I like the smell (and so does my husband, which is surprising because he&#x27;s very picky about smells), and it seems to work okay. Drawback: It is pretty expensive for how much you get and how quickly the can is gone. I&#x27;m going to experiment with some other brands to see if I can get something comparable without spending so much.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried but I found out about it through my friend and I absolutely love it. Smells great and really makes your hair look light and fluffy like it&#x27;s just been blown out!</li>
            <li> Love the product but the nozzle got messed up after the first use.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and have always  loved it. It does its job and isn&#x27;t heavy or filmy and has a great smell. The seller was fast in shipping my order and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Product came about two weeks early. Said it could take up to two weeks to arrive the speedy delivery is what I love so much about this seller. The product itself is AMAZING I have been using it now for about a year. I was recommended to use it by my salon lady and it couldn&#x27;t work more amazing. It works amazingly also if your blonde and like a little bit more of the fresh look like when you leave a salon and your highlights are still white it will give them more of this effect :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the KMS Hair Play Makeover spray for a few years now. My hair looks more full when I use it. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I received this earlier than expected and love this product.  I purchased it on a wimb and I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo E.V.E.R!!! Leaves your hair feeling clean! Not like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried. I don&#x27;t like feeling like I have a wig on when I use dry shampoo, and this definitely absorbs the oils without the yucky feeling! If you are wanting your dry shampoo to give you lift or volume, this is not the one for you. It smells nice, refreshes your hair, and is light and clean feeling! Just what I like :) xo</li>
            <li> this product works the best for thin hair as it is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. and it holds</li>
            <li> Smells great and no sticky residue mess, it works the best to me.  Other ones I tried had either too much powder, or nasty residue feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoo products before but they were all too heavy and gross feeling.  Hair Play is nice and light and perfect for fine, limp hair in between washings</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos and this product is, by far, the best! I used to hate my day two hair, but after using KMS, I now love my day two hair more than my freshly washed hair. It absorbs oil without leaving any residue and gives me lots of volume. I recommend this product to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> This is by far THE BEST dry shampoo I have ever used.  It aids in giving your hair a lot of body too when you are trying to style it, but I mainly use it for getting rid of oily hair!  I bet you I have used 10 different brands before discovering this.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out like almost all the others...it smells divine too!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo ever.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best dry hairspray I have used.  I love the added texture it gives to day old limp hair, and it smells nicely as well.  My only complaint is unlike some other dry sprays I have used, if you don&#x27;t watch how much you are layering on then it will leave a powdery white residue, kind of like baby powder, if over used.  I can only get away with using this on day old hair.  Not a multiple days use product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this product and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other dry shampoo because I&#x27;ve found the perfect one!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many dry shampoos and this is the only one that works for me. I spray it on my roots, wait about 10 minutes, and then rub it in. I then take my blow dryer and a round brush to really freshen up my hair.</li>
            <li> while this stuff works well...I notice a powdery film in my hair. don&#x27;t like that. I have found herbal essence dry shampoo to do just as good a job with no film and half the cost.</li>
            <li> Life changing product! Hair is clean, light, smells great, and easy to style! Must have in every hair product basket!</li>
            <li> Years back there was a dry shampoo called Pssst!  which would leave white specks in your hair after using.  This product does not do that amazingly enough.  My hair is baby fine and very thin.  This product makes my hair too heavy.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time today and then if got to work, my whole coat was powdered! It smells good, but if if can&#x27;t wear black, this is a dud. I even cleaned the powder off, but when I got home, it was back on the coat again, all over the neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I loved this product as it never made my dark hair look dull or powdery or make the roots feel thick and gross as another brand did. It really helps my hair feel and look fresh and that result lasts all day, also like another brand I tried.  The smell is just okay, so I also spray body spray from Bath and Body Works on my roots and then blow dry upside down and my hair looks as good as fresh washed and styled.  The other plus is that the price here is about half what my hair dresser charged me, $23.00.</li>
            <li> Good dry shampoo or style refresher.  Leaves no powdery residue or overpowering smell.  Easy to use.  I like it!</li>
            <li> It just like you spray the white powder on your hair and I look like a 100 years old person.  It leaves white residue on clothes, on counter, on floor.  My scalp is itchy after I sprayed, and it doesn&#x27;t build any bulk like its description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY, THIS PRODUCT CANNOT BE RETURNED! I am an unhappy customer.</li>
            <li> Never got to use the product.  It arrived it was full. Two days later went to use it and the can was empty. Must of had some kind of leak.  NOT happy</li>
            <li> Nice product but not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed!! This product won&#x27;t spray out of the nozzle! The nozzle doesn&#x27;t appear broke but the product is just slowly spitting out and won&#x27;t spray. Not to mention the mess it made sitting on my counter oozing out! I give it and negative 10 if possible.</li>
            <li> Great for clean hair for texture and lift.  Love it for day old hair to freshen up and revive my hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Good product but the bottle came in sort of damaged.. And the aerosol nozzle is not working properly. The can is still hissing and it was not being pressed...</li>
            <li> One of my favorite dry shampoos! Doesn&#x27;t come out as white as other dry shampoos and gives the body I need to my unwashed hair.</li>
            <li> No white residue and smells great what else do you want or need in a dry shampoo? Keeps my day old hair looking fresh.</li>
            <li> Ladies if you have thin/oily hair you will absolutely love this this product keeps your head smelling good and keeps the oil under control...I had in the past wash my hair everyday which is not good we all know this...now I wash my hair every 3 days my hair is much healthier and my hair looks good always.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  I dye my hair, but my natural hair is oily so as my roots grow in this stuff is a savior.  I have tried many dry shampoos and this one is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make it look like I squeezed powder on my head.  Its also not wet and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser gave me a sample once and I was hooked.  Great for the days you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> This amazing product absorbs oil and helps me freshen up day old hair styles without leaving any residue or weighing my hair down.  No other dry shampoo compares!!!  Oh, and I love the smell :)</li>
