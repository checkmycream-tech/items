            <li> the new hairs that have grown out in 2 and a half months are curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> so it last a long time too</li>

            <li> This product came just as expected and on time.</li>
            <li> I use it even when I don&#x27;t have a blowout to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair look greasy and dirty.  </li>
            <li> I tho7ught that the serum was a bit disappointing as it made my hair wavy and curly.</li>
            <li> Nasty product!</li>

            <li> Best product!!! It lasts a very long time and really helps with frizz.</li>
            <li> Always love this stuff and swear by it. Only wish I could get a &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; so TSA doesn&#x27;t confiscate another tube!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair look greasy and dirty.  However if you have really dry, frizzy hair you may really like this product!</li>

            <li> It is making the blow out treatment last longer</li>
            <li> I love this product! Apply to wet or dry hair, and most frizz is gone. I can&#x27;t say enough good about it!</li>
            <li> I cant live without this.  I use it even when I don&#x27;t have a blowout to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and protects against heat from blow drying. Also, it seems to protect my color when I&#x27;m out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works really well.</li>
            <li> Love this product! When I had the Brazilian Blowout done on my hair I loved how it made my hair feel even months after. I use it everytime I get out of the shower and it definitely helps reduce frizz and makes your hair nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> Protect my hair from the split ends.  I have been using it for more than 4 years now and it is one of the best on the market.</li>

            <li> Great results! Made my hair very soft. Smells soooo good!</li>
            <li> Works good as long as you have a Brazilian.  the new hairs that have grown out in 2 and a half months are curly and frizzy.  I have an appointment at the 3 month mark but it does not help frizzes in between.  Love the fresh scent in between washes.  You cannot beat the price on amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I first learned of this product from my hairstylist.

I ordered the first one through her and then found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It really protects your hair and makes it much easier to style.  I won&#x27;t be caught without it, now!</li>
            <li> Fixes my 50year old unmanageable dry hair and makes it smooth and healthy looking all day.  More is not better... I use a dime size amount for median length hair.. a tube last me about a year.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price.</li>
            <li> Love this. The only product that gets rid of the frizzes. Hair looks great. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Nasty product! This made my hair feel greasy and gummy. A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great even if you do not have a Brazilian Blowout.</li>

            <li> My wife uses this whenever she washes her hair and she loves it</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well to smooth hair. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey though.</li>
            <li> Excellect for dry hair (probably all hair types).  Use it everyday.</li>
