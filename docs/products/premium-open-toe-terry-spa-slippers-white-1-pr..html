            <li>good slippers for summer time</li>
            <li>The price is great, &amp; they&#x27;re disposable, so I could cut them to fit!</li>
            <li>I looked for just the right kind of spa slippers, and these were the best selection at any price.  </li>
            <li>It is also nice to keep a pair or two in the guest room closet for visiting friends and family.</li>
            <li>good slippers love them, but they are disposable.</li>
            <li>After an hour of wearing them my feet were too warm to continue wearing them.</li>
            <li>The slippers are very warm and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Received these terry slippers in my hotel room and made sure to pack them home.  </li>
            <li>When I got these slippers, they were comfortable, but they were making my feet warm.</li>
            <li>cheap!</li>
            <li>OK, so they cost $5.75 rather than the $16 to $20 required for Dearfoams.</li>
            <li>Why I have to add more text if I dont want to.</li>
            <li>They could have been cushier, but for the price they are ok.</li>
            <li>They are working great so far as inside pads for my bunny slippers :)</li>
            <li>First used these slippers on a cruise--very comfortable and good for around-the-house wear.  </li>
            <li>easy to slip on and slip off, whether or not I am wearing socks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just what i needed for my Wendy Marvell cosplay and not to mention super comfy!</li>
            <li>They are as cheaply made as possible.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I was expecting rather a comfortable, indoor slippers.  </li>
            <li>as cheap as their price</li>
            <li>there are much better and much cheaper slippers on Amazon</li>
            <li>These are exactly as advertised and arrived very, very quickly.</li>
            <li>But the bottoms wore out too quickly for in home use.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth donating.</li>
            <li>We remove our shoes when coming from outside and these make nice indoor slippers.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps useful for guest use at a spa?</li>
            <li>want to recommand ppl to pay little more to buy better one.</li>
            <li>I actually bought these for a costume, but these are very comfy and warm.  </li>
            <li>and this was exactly I was looking</li>
            <li>Suitable for single use.</li>
            <li>They are likely only really good for a couple of uses and then throw away.</li>
            <li>I find them easy to put on in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>It costs too much to return</li>
            <li>They really are a lot cheaper feeling than I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>you can loosen it by stretching its upper part (it will make some sound like tearing apart, but it works anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Simple and plain but very effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be more careful next time when I buy another pair</li>
            <li>As long as your expectations take this into account,  they are worth the price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for use inside the house, it was okay for a week as it easily got dirty</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for long term use, this is ok if you are just using it for travel or for just a few days.</li>
            <li>Decent quality, not meant for long time use, just from Point  a to b then take them off.</li>
            <li>I suppose for the price I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much.  </li>
            <li>Never touch the hotel floor again with bare or stocking feet.</li>
            <li>Same quality as Dollar Tree but $5.00 more, not pleased!!</li>
            <li>Perhaps its just me, but I found that they did not last very long after what I consider normal use before and after showers.  </li>
            <li>it barely has any cushion on the sole.  </li>

            <li> it barely has any cushion on the sole.  </li>
            <li> for those who have foot-size larger than 9:&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t make this longer(this is long enough no worry),&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Even on carpet they won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> That won&#x27;t last very long even on carpeted floors.</li>

            <li> I managed to get a few wears out of these before I had to give these the kibosh.  </li>
            <li> Simple slippers for the difficult foot.</li>
            <li> They are thin but they do the job.  </li>
            <li> But, the sole is fabric stitched to a cardboard base.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t feel the cold floor anymore.</li>
            <li> These slippers are terrible.  </li>

            <li> I bought 2 and I like them. The price also very good. The size is good like its sizes on hotels.</li>
            <li> These slippers are terrible.  They are sized for men.  They are as cheaply made as possible.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom of them is only a thin piece of plastic like a piece of shopping bag.  It costs too much to return so I will toss them in the garbage.  Not even worth donating.</li>
            <li> Decent quality, not meant for long time use, just from Point  a to b then take them off. I still would go with the dollar tree ones next time. I think they have them ;p</li>
            <li> I looked for just the right kind of spa slippers, and these were the best selection at any price.  These were a great choice to complement a terry cloth robe.</li>
            <li> I wanted a slipper that I could use in hotel rooms and that would not take up a lot of space in the suitcase.  These are perfect.  I bought several pairs to have on hand because they are disposable, and after several washings, you will have to replace them.  It is also nice to keep a pair or two in the guest room closet for visiting friends and family.</li>
            <li> But the bottoms wore out too quickly for in home use.  I&#x27;ll be more careful next time when I buy another pair</li>
            <li> good slippers love them, but they are disposable. after awhile you have to throw them away. they get matted down and dirt is very apparent on them.</li>
            <li> Received these terry slippers in my hotel room and made sure to pack them home.  Because the insole is terry, they do not slip off your feet. Very handy for after bath or shower, padding off to breakfast, or just admiring your pedicure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> These are very good slippers for protecting hardwood floors and allowing house guests to leave their shoes at the front door.</li>
            <li> I was expecting rather a comfortable, indoor slippers.  When I got these slippers, they were comfortable, but they were making my feet warm. After an hour of wearing them my feet were too warm to continue wearing them. So three stars...  I think this review was a fair review.</li>
            <li> I suppose for the price I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much.  They really are a lot cheaper feeling than I was hoping for.  They are likely only really good for a couple of uses and then throw away.</li>
            <li> Just what i needed for my Wendy Marvell cosplay and not to mention super comfy! loved um and i suggest them to everyone! cheap!</li>
            <li> I needed slippers just around the house and this was exactly I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to slip on and slip off, whether or not I am wearing socks.&lt;br /&gt;I am a women&#x27;s US size 7.5, and this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> OK, so they cost $5.75 rather than the $16 to $20 required for Dearfoams. But, the sole is fabric over cardboard. That won&#x27;t last very long even on carpeted floors. Might be good as guest slippers at a spa?</li>
            <li> as cheap as their price</li>
            <li> What a waste ..dont purchase.....made of cardboard I&#x27;m guessing. Why I have to add more text if I dont want to.</li>
            <li> I wore these all weekend.  They are thin but they do the job.  Cheaper/no shipping so I ordered another pair for my next trip.</li>
            <li> I purchased these Cotton Terry Slippers for my guests to wear on my hardwood floors.  We remove our shoes when coming from outside and these make nice indoor slippers.  They could have been cushier, but for the price they are ok.</li>
            <li> Perhaps its just me, but I found that they did not last very long after what I consider normal use before and after showers.  Once they get wet and dry a very few times, they&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for use inside the house, it was okay for a week as it easily got dirty n it barely has any cushion on the sole.  I would not recommend for long term use, this is ok if you are just using it for travel or for just a few days.</li>
            <li> These are very nice slippers.  Simple and plain but very effective.  I find them easy to put on in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> The slippers are very warm and comfortable.</li>
            <li> not so great for the price. there are much better and much cheaper slippers on Amazon</li>
            <li> At $5.75 the price is low. But, the sole is fabric stitched to a cardboard base. Even on carpet they won&#x27;t last long. Perhaps useful for guest use at a spa?</li>
            <li> I got these slippers to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my bunny slippers! The bottoms started wearing out, so I got these to put inside so I didn&#x27;t feel the cold floor anymore. The price is great, &amp; they&#x27;re disposable, so I could cut them to fit! They are working great so far as inside pads for my bunny slippers :)</li>
            <li> Good quality for price. Wasn&#x27;t expecting top-notch quality for the price point, but they are perfect for what I need them for.</li>
            <li> First used these slippers on a cruise--very comfortable and good for around-the-house wear.  Downside is they are not washable so must be thrown away when they become soiled.  As long as your expectations take this into account,  they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good&lt;br /&gt;-light&lt;br /&gt;-warm&lt;br /&gt;-cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad&lt;br /&gt;-easily torn&lt;br /&gt;-not good slippers for summer time&lt;br /&gt;-doesnt last long&lt;br /&gt;-small if your foot-size is larger than 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip for those who have foot-size larger than 9:&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t make this longer(this is long enough no worry),&lt;br /&gt;but you can loosen it by stretching its upper part (it will make some sound like tearing apart, but it works anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to recommand ppl to pay little more to buy better one.</li>
            <li> Suitable for single use. These are exactly as advertised and arrived very, very quickly. But next time, I&#x27;ll go to a dollar store and get flip-flops.</li>
            <li> I actually bought these for a costume, but these are very comfy and warm.  I wear them all the time!</li>
            <li> Simple slippers for the difficult foot.</li>
            <li> Same quality as Dollar Tree but $5.00 more, not pleased!!</li>
            <li> Great for business travel!  Never touch the hotel floor again with bare or stocking feet. I managed to get a few wears out of these before I had to give these the kibosh.  In my opinion they are designed to be relatively disposable anyway. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This feels like a vacation at home without the costs of a spa.  A bit big but comfy and washable.</li>
