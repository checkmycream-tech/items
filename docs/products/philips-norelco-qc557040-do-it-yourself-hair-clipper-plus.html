            <li>When I went to the salon for a haircut and brought my son with me, they were all amazed that I was able to do his cut by myself without any training or experience!</li>
            <li>Works great, easy cleanup and no cords.</li>
            <li>It would also be great to have an attachment with a rounded bottom, to make tapered cuts around the ears, sideburns etc easy.  </li>
            <li>AND IT WORKS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>The best and fast clipper I ever bought.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this clipper a try after reading many good reviews online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own hair for a while</li>
            <li>Nice looks to be a nice device for shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>Is wonderfull be your own stylis</li>
            <li>I wanted to find something that would work for him to do his own trims.</li>
            <li>The rotating head is a nice feature, which is helping me to cut my hair myself.  </li>
            <li>my hairdresser uses in her salon, the kind that she could drop on the tile floor without any damage.</li>
            <li>I have cut my own hair for about three years now.</li>
            <li>The built-in adjustable guard and the ability to swivel the cutter are really handy.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace another Norelco tilt head and this one is not as nice.  </li>
            <li>A must-have for those who plan to shave their own heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought these clippers when they were on sale because I wanted to learn how to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is an excellent clipper that is much easier to use than corded clippers I&#x27;ve worked with.</li>
            <li>The handy trimmer pays for itself in a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li>I liked the cordless feature.  </li>
            <li>Now, I can have my hair cut own my own once a month.</li>
            <li>Really handy to work with.</li>
            <li>The rotating head and length adjustment are both nifty features that should give you all the options you need to buzz your own hair.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if there was a way to lock these</li>
            <li>Really liked these clippers.</li>
            <li>Nice groomer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are really nice clippers.</li>
            <li>fill that bill nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice clipper set.</li>
            <li>perfect buy, easy to handle and quick results</li>
            <li>very easy to do my own haircuts</li>
            <li>This new one works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Probably the good thing of this headgroomer is that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, and the swivel head makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and cuts without pulling on hair.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and configure.</li>
            <li>The haircut length can be very easily adjusted with the dial, and I did not have to remove it yet.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy on the hands and the 180 degree rotating joint def helps with clipping from all angles.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to adjust the height of the cut, as well.</li>
            <li>Works fine and good price, not quite as convenient to use as its forerunner(fatter profile).</li>
            <li>This is by far the best clipper I ever had.</li>
            <li>I own a lot of Norelco electronics, and everything always works like it should and lasts for many years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This electric razor is by far the best I&#x27;ve  ever had</li>
            <li>I found a suitable replacement through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have never owned a more effective hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have never owned a more effective hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The guard gave the right length, and the trim took all of two minutes with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It surprised me when I get it.&lt;br /&gt;It have many functions to make my hair delightful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, from now I will never cost hair cut :) .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot to say , but in general norelco products are the best out there !</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and efficient tool to use.  </li>
            <li>nice in the hand and easy to maneuver</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to cut own hair.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li>price is nice and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Locking features absent: The head rotates too easily on its own.  </li>
            <li>you cut your own hair easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this would be a good product to try if you want to give buzzing your own hair a shot, but those already used to the practice would be better off with a higher end Oster unit rather than this.</li>
            <li>so your child would have to be able to tolerate that.  </li>
            <li>Have owned two of the Remington versions of this and this Norelco unit is way way better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>I had to wait around a month or more to use it.</li>
            <li>and this is the most even haircut</li>
            <li>and I have used many.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>Even their cheapie will do better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>This model has more refinements, the shape of it, the adjustment in the height of the cut and can be rinsed under water.</li>
            <li>In a word, you&#x27;d better have a girlfriend to help you for a better style.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>your cut short length hair this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it for anything more demanding.</li>
            <li>Love this clipper, cordless, convenient and dependable.  </li>
            <li>and I love the cordless option.</li>
            <li>but I love it now.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>No need to change heads any more</li>
            <li>Too convenient, I love it</li>
            <li>I love this hair clipper.</li>
            <li>On top of all that, the &amp;#34;swivel direction&amp;#34; feature adds an additional part that can move accidentally when</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve cut our grandson&#x27;s hair a couple of times with this clipper and we love it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is cordless.  </li>
            <li>They leave a perfect trim and can be used extensively.</li>
            <li>But then the shortest comb which we used most often broke.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, although it&#x27;s a good machine, it doesn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>And I have saved more than $300 just by shaving my head myself with Philips hair clippers.</li>
            <li>sure you read the directions.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried this out the day it arrived in the mail and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Outstanding battery life.</li>
            <li>we all love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s significantly more portable</li>
            <li>It charges fast, is versatile and works great,</li>
            <li>(7 more wrds required?</li>
            <li>tow more ) Thank you.</li>
            <li>It is more of a trimmer than a clipper.  </li>
            <li>Looking for a better option now.</li>
            <li>More than once, I&#x27;ve started trimming my hair at one setting, and finished at another setting.  </li>
            <li>but this is more of a coordination thing for myself.  </li>
            <li>With home haircuts, I&#x27;ve saved thousands of dollars, saved hundreds of hours of driving to a barber shop and waiting for a barber, and enjoyed the convenience of getting a haircut whenever I need one.</li>
            <li>But I know better then to club myself in the head with clippers.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job and pleases me.  </li>
            <li>nice product fast shipping and good price</li>
            <li>swivel head is another interesting feature.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>to use.could not ask for a better hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;i love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s suitable for all easy hair styles.</li>
            <li>LOL I highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li>Just tried this new one yesterday and it is great.</li>
            <li>my wife used it to cut my hair,very good,very easy to use,I love it ,twice a month,it deserves the price</li>
            <li>Outstanding design and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use &amp; i&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>These seemed like a perfect fit for my brother, who keeps his hair fairly short.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use and the ability to be able to turn the blades is more useful that you would think.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, after figuring out the operation (instructions are in every language on a LARGE piece of paper without good illustrations)</li>
            <li>This works quickly and easily, and the cut is amazingly even.</li>
            <li>I had an earlier model from this manufacturer which did a very good job.</li>
            <li>Works very good, I use this to cut my hair short.</li>
            <li>Very good clipper, I have done my first self hair cut yesterday, looks very good!!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li>The Wahls constantly snagged on his hair, much more than on mine, so it was a welcome improvement for him as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and cuts even.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy process.  </li>
            <li>Charges in a couple hours and the adjustable attachments make it easy to cut and do fades.</li>
            <li>shaver easily hold a charge for 4-5 shaves.</li>
            <li>it is well built and designed and easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quick, and easy.  </li>
            <li>EASY TO USE AND NEATER ANDFASTER</li>
            <li>The hair length adjustment is too easy to turn.</li>
            <li>Easy to install and use.&lt;br /&gt;Worth a buy for the price they offer it for.</li>
            <li>I still use to cut my hair, and it makes the job easy with the adjustable guard.</li>
            <li>The clippers are easy to hang onto and maneuver.</li>
            <li>I also like that you can run them under the tap for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>The clippers are well designed and easy to hold in the hand, which my carpal tunnel appreciated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>attachments were easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>easy to.</li>
            <li>These made it easy, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had an older version of this and loved it.</li>
            <li>Strong recommendation for this product.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend to everybody.</li>
            <li>They have a futuristic look compared to the conventional shape of hair clippers, but form follows function, and the clippers are the best ergonomic design of any clippers we&#x27;ve had, as well as being the lightest weight.</li>
            <li>This was the first time that my son has ever cut his own hair.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a nice design when first pulling it out of the package.</li>
            <li>I just use this handy clipper and have my hair cut all by myself (first time).</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold, the blade swivels so I can use both hands and get harder-to-reach spots, and the adjustable trimmer is intuitive and accurate.</li>
            <li>my son is 2 now and he seemed to do fine with it.  </li>
            <li>Battery life has been fine and I&#x27;ve never run out of power mid-haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I can say with me watching over him and giving directions, yes, the clipper works fine.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nice design, pretty comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li>The adjustable length dial is nice and accurate, and I can get the exact length that I want.  </li>
            <li>This clipper is very useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>clipper has an indicator light so you can keep track of the battery charge, and it is also designed to be easily cleaned and to be smooth on your skin (rounded tips).</li>
            <li>So far, they haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;do it yourself\\&quot; part of this, but these work great if you just want to give someone a quick buzz.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and powerful and cordless!</li>
            <li>Now the huge downside is the fragility of the clipper.</li>
            <li>battery life&lt;br /&gt;rotating head is a huge help once you get used to it</li>
            <li>well fit for my sons in 5.</li>
            <li>I used this razor to trim my beard this morning and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>light weight.....</li>
            <li>This hair trimmer works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I even shaved my beard with it then ran a cheap disposable razor over it to finish it of.</li>
            <li>It is nice to  get a quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It does fit my demand.</li>
            <li>I had a wahl clipper before because it was cheap</li>
            <li>Worked great for almost 8 months but recently the guide comb broke off two &amp;#34;blades.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Fortunately I wanted it on the shortest place but for others that might be an additional concern.</li>
            <li>It takes a few minutes to get used to operating the device, so it is best to take things cautiously.</li>
            <li>I had to give myself a military-length shave to make the rest of the head match, then I threw this cheap toy into the trash.</li>
            <li>Waterproof: The waterproof quality of the unit makes for easy clean up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just fit my expect.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way to securely &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I used it regularly and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t give product reviews lightly.</li>
            <li>These are just as good as some old Oster clippers I had, and this is cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lets me keep it nice, short, and neat on daily/weekly basis in my own bathroom.</li>
            <li>The machine is working really good, but I was expecting it to come with more parts, to control different parts of the hair</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The adjustable angle on this thing means I can get right up to the hair line without going through as many</li>
            <li>longer worry about the hot summer!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are easy to disassemble to clean and you can just run the pieces under water to clean them.</li>
            <li>With the Norelco rasor I was able to do a fast (5 minutes!)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve done my hair where I didn&#x27;t have to go over it 4 or 5 times to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss anything.</li>
            <li>Without any experience I was able the first time to cut 95% of my hair myself.</li>
            <li>I had to replace my original for this one.</li>
            <li>I love it at the first time to use .  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After my first haircut with these clippers, my wife/barber loves them, and I love them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fact that this thing cost the same or barely more than the Wahl corded clipper kits yet performs better and is cordless is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Buy discount period, it is cheaper to buy back after use, it is very good, ready to help children at home haircut.</li>
            <li>to use and to clean.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is made very well, the mechanism rotates with a satisfying click and does not feel cheap in anyway.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used scissors for hair cuts for my husband and son, with a razor to clean around the edges.</li>
            <li>Easy cleaning as well and more sturdy in comparison with older models.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight, and I did not have to use the rotating head feature yet as it fits very well in the hand</li>
            <li>Charges fast, and it feels like it provides a lot more power to the trimmer than the QC5170/60 has when using the battery only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only good thing I can say about it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Balding man&#x27;s dream come true.</li>
            <li>Battery operated clipper with good power, last long.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>This product gives a good overall close haircut.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a guy for the full on buzz</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;3 love it so much</li>
            <li>Battery life is excellent; takes me about 8 minutes to do my face and head; can get at least 5 shaves in before recharging.</li>
            <li>Good overall.</li>
            <li>This is the reason I&#x27;m not giving a full five stars.</li>
            <li>The 180 rotating head looks nice but it doesn&#x27;t need to rotate that far.</li>
            <li>Quality wise, it&#x27;s well constructed and not flimsy like some generic competitors where they would pass at a dollar shop.</li>
            <li>We solved the problem by using the container for the old clippers that we discarded, but a container of some kind is needed to keep everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We solved the problem by using the container for the old clippers that we discarded, but a container of some kind is needed to keep everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For someone who has never cut his own hair in his entire life, I found it extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>pretty cool, I can easily do haircut by myself with it</li>
            <li>This handy, easy to use clipper is like having a private barber at home.</li>
            <li>I read the directions, and it seemed pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Adjustable settings make it easy to get your hair to the exact length that you want it.</li>
            <li>I found the cutter to be quiet, effective, and ideal for giving that fresh from the barber shop appearance when the shop is closed.  </li>
            <li>Fine gradations on the two supplied plastic heads allow for exact control of hair length.</li>
            <li>What the most important is it can be washed directly by water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so convenient and quick.</li>
            <li>It charged super quick.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and holds charge well.  </li>
            <li>but the blades will catch on my hair much more often than the older model.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it to do quick trims for the men in the family.</li>
            <li>Satisfied, can rotate 180 degrees, the back of the head is more convenient</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair since 1973, and the Philips Norelco QC5570/40 is the best hair clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of what I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>stil don&#x27;t trust my brother with doing this alone, not for a good, long while.</li>
            <li>This is a nice touch up device, useful for clipping neck, touching up a haircut, trimming a beard (although it is not a beard trimmer) and other do-it-yourself cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m anticipating many years and hair cuts with my new clippers.</li>
            <li>and it still works, I am confident this new one will do the job too...</li>
            <li>I have been using electric wired clippers for as long as I can remember, but I was very impressed with this especially for the price</li>
            <li>This is the first really good clippers I have had for cleaning up the hair on the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li>Compact, fast and easy to use for shaving or having a haircut.</li>
            <li>Multiple trim settings and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I tried a little and wasn&#x27;t too happy -</li>
            <li>Sure, it would be nice if everything would look as high quality as an iPhone or other Apple products, but then it would cost a lot more; and for just clipping my hair this works well at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very good but only for short length adjustments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and very manoeuvrable.</li>
            <li>It also used the same charging cord as my Norelco beard trimmer which is handy.</li>
            <li>i always do my own haircut and when I upgrade to this clipper it only cost me 10 mins.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since it takes me about 1/2 the time as my old wahl beard trimmer I cut my hair more often.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these if you are someone who cuts their own hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>The clip is smooth, the most important thing is qc5570 does not block with my rough hair.</li>
            <li>Not as nice or as powerful as the last Norelco razor I bought.</li>
            <li>Also, once the battery dies out for good you are expected to throw away</li>
            <li>The rotating blades are a useful feature.</li>
            <li>The rotating blades are a useful feature.  </li>
            <li>useful for trimming around the sides of your head</li>
            <li>I do a 5 on top and 1.5 around the sides/back and blend it in with a 3 which looks just like when I had it done professionally.  </li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s a golden 5 star product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cool</li>
            <li>If a product misses the description or if the product is worth the purchase, I will write a review.</li>
            <li>I loved that the blade on this is adjustable, no more storing a bunch of sizes and having to change them, just easily adjust on the clippers themselves.  </li>
            <li>The comb has nice rounded edges rather than the sharp edges like on the Wahls which meant I wasn&#x27;t poking myself with the comb constantly, especially appreciated around my ears.</li>
            <li>I use the longest setting on top, let it grow-out while using the detailing guard to keep the sides and back clean and tapered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimming action is clean and smooth - no biting or pulling has occurred at all.</li>
            <li>The trimming action is clean and smooth - no biting or pulling has occurred at all.  </li>
            <li>It seems a little more comfortable to hold than the older model and was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Will keep using this brand and model as long as I am able to purchase it!</li>
            <li>In use, the blade didn&#x27;t snag or pull at all, which isn&#x27;t too surprising since it&#x27;s still quite sharp, but there were no defects in manufacturing, so</li>
            <li>I figured that if this was as easy as they said, an adult male who is very bright but somewhat limited with new stuff should be able to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ummm....</li>
            <li>It just falls right out of it.</li>
            <li>I keep a buzz cut and the guard adjust just right.  </li>
            <li>With the offset head and bulky handle its just doesn&#x27;t feel right in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>This shaver worked right out of the box.</li>
            <li>The shape is decent and sits in my hand comfortably.  </li>
            <li>All it does is make it easy to hold and clip, but it&#x27;s a nice little addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased this item especially for the purpose to shave my own head and the rotating dead really does a great job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While a basic style, unlike shaving the hear altogether, it&#x27;s not foolproof and is a good test for a new machine.&lt;br /&gt;*The blade design and configuration admirably prevents  cut locks of hair from  getting stuck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over the fact that I&#x27;m going bald but not quite ready to do the full shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using the clipper to cut my two sons&#x27; hair for the past 5 years, and it&#x27;s great for that too.  </li>
            <li>This haircut is very good, you can wash the body, head can be rotated 180 degrees, that is a little short caliper, the longest only to 15mm, if able to 30mm fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, better than other Clippers I have owned.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to start breaking them right away the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The shape of the clippers is unusual but I got used to it quickly</li>
            <li>This newer version is more powerful and longer lasting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great clipper for cutting someone&#x27;s else hair but not your own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are noticeably lighter than conventional clippers, but to be honest, I only cut my own hair, so fatigue has never been an issue.</li>
            <li>This should be a very useful review since I have had this for over 8 months now and feel comfortable actually scoring it.  </li>
            <li>If you want your hair very short, this is the product It never cuts the skin, very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much, even if I havn&#x27;t used</li>
            <li>purchased this to replace my 5 year old one that still works just fine</li>
            <li>This is the first set of hair clippers I&#x27;ve owned, so I have nothing to compare them to (other than the hair attachment on my beard trimmer, which doesn&#x27;t really seem like a fair comparison).</li>
            <li>Cut my sons hair with this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Warning, make sure you check the hair length setting before starting.</li>
            <li>Will it last many years</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t make it threw the first hair cut</li>
            <li>It took me about 1/2 way through the first cut to get the hang of it</li>
            <li>Charging takes about 30 minutes and this more then enough for clipping.</li>
            <li>I just used these clippers today for the first time</li>
            <li>It is washable which make it easy to clean and the battery last for reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was my first time</li>
            <li>; it was OK; required multiple passes); b) Wahl Balding clippers (bulky, corded, ran</li>
            <li>Mine are not broken as I rarely use them</li>
            <li>I tried it using many times but same result.</li>
            <li>I buzz my entire head on the lowest setting on a weekly basis, and am able to get three or four uses per charge before a noticeable drop in power.</li>
            <li>The first one wore out after about 3 years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had many beard trippers and clippers in the past, with many different attachments, but they never made trimming any better or easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I question how well the clipper was made, but I was able to just put it back in the place it was removed and it works as it did</li>
            <li>With the Norelco clippers, a locking dial sets the exact length to the nearest 0.5mm for shorter lengths and 2mm for longer cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first it does not appear functional, but rotating the ring forces the guard through it&#x27;s setting detents and holds it</li>
            <li>Easy to use, excellent battery and high quality cutting blades</li>
            <li>Easy to use, excellent battery and high quality cutting blades</li>
            <li>With the hair guard, it is also easy to accidentally \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; and cause a major screw up on your hair cut.</li>
            <li>When my wife come back from shopping, she is so surprised with such an excellent job done by this new clipper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to hold it and to cut yourself, as well as easy for someone to cut other person.</li>
            <li>Lightweight; easy to hold; rotating handle is useful when shaving back of head.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>so I can use it easily with either the right or the left hand.  </li>
            <li>I think once I&#x27;ve had a chance to play with this a bit more, it won&#x27;t be a real issue, but it did result in a very short buzz my first go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>other nice touches:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those needing to save money on home hair cuts...easy to use and very affordable!!</li>
            <li>, It is very easy to use and cut my hair just as good as any expensive barbers equipment, I have been having a pretty good experience lately with all Philips Norelco products.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and could be tighter, but generally it works fine.</li>
            <li>Again, the rotating head helps to get just the right angle without having to twist my wrist, and it helps to keep the main body of the clippers out of the way for easier trimming around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>the way, thanks for the fast delivery!</li>
            <li>My wife was a bit hesitant the first time or two, but now she&#x27;s really into haircutting, and she loves how much money we save.</li>
            <li>For all the beginners, once you are over the awe, this clipper is easy to handle with its angled settings to help you reach the hair from different directions.</li>
            <li>so they have certainly paid for themselves.  </li>
            <li>certainly will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li>I was using a corded Wahl trimmer that had me tethered to certain locations in and around the house to get the deed done.</li>
            <li>I seek smart way to engage/disengage comb without brute force.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the pros certainly out way the cons at this price point.</li>
            <li>At first, the rotating head seems gimmicky, but it really does come in handy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, convenient, charges fast and staid charged for months, I use it 3 times a week to clip my hair and to keep my haircut in the same shape.</li>
            <li>Works fine if you only want a buzz cut.</li>
            <li>Durability: as I was removing the large clip to change sizes, the whole part of the rotating head was dislodged.</li>
            <li>nice little clipper does the job</li>
            <li>Everyone would get a little apprehensive to using hair clippers on their own -</li>
            <li>It feels great in my hands, and cuts through very thick hair with no problem.</li>
            <li>I did my own cut first, and had the wife do a bit of clean up along the neck and behind the ears after.  </li>
            <li>Very good！it&#x27;s convenient for me.</li>
            <li>job with a very even look to it.  </li>
            <li>The 180 degree rotating head makes it so much easier to cut the hair.</li>
            <li>Worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Cuts well and very efficient cutter</li>
            <li>the clippers was light in weigh, so I sent them back.</li>
            <li>turning head is very helpful in reaching all head areas conveniently.</li>
            <li>We charged it straight away, as he was in need of a trim.</li>
            <li>It held the strength of the charge the whole time.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is cordless makes it much easier to use as well.</li>
            <li>When power is low, it sometimes makes noisy sound.</li>
            <li>So this product really works.  </li>
            <li>To those who want to buy a Hair Clipper , I highly recommend this Philips Norelco QC5570 !</li>
            <li>It has High quality, and well designed !&lt;</li>
            <li>Much easier to cut hair with the rotating clippers.</li>
            <li>The design is reasonable and convenient.  </li>
            <li>The swivel head makes these clippers much easier to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cuts a hair.</li>
            <li>and I am not the most careful person.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Product as described.</li>
            <li>so I have to be careful and get the scissors out for the top.</li>
            <li>I keep my hair short and it is great for cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>A flashing light on the back lets you know when it needs charging and is fully charged.</li>
            <li>no one would ever notice since its really cm but</li>
            <li>the guards feel very flimsy.</li>
            <li>It still worked very well</li>
            <li>I really like the rotating head and the fact that it is cordless.  </li>
            <li>It really does make it easier to reach all the sides of your head by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its swivel head lets you cut the back comfortably, although you need a pair of mirrors to see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>I like the clipper so much</li>
            <li>This device really values the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every bit as much power as a heavy-duty corded model, but with the added features of a swiveling head, water-resistance, and of course, the option to go cordless!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The motor feels powerful, and I haven&#x27;t come anywhere near the limitations of the battery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I really like the QC5570.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Seems very well made.  </li>
            <li>I really like the swivel head and the built in dial for adjusting the trimming height.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re cutting your own hair, the swivel feature is handy as it allows you to reach all areas with ease.</li>
            <li>This results in a 1/8&amp;#34; stripe in the middle of your nice 1/2&amp;#34; fade and forces you to go with the dreaded buzz-it-all last resort option.</li>
            <li>She tried rotating the clipper head and said it was a nice feature, but for my style of haircut (a short buzz cut), it&#x27;s not really necessary.</li>
            <li>The hair cut looks better than other trimmers.</li>
            <li>There is a significant caveat to these clippers that may make them unsuitable for some people: the maximum hair length is only 5/8&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is well-designed, user-friendly, but the user need to be very careful when using it without any combs, or it would make bald spots on your head.:)</li>
            <li>and i found it pretty useful ; the product simply keeps its promises.</li>
            <li>Norelco created this with men in mind for a fast side shave (with 4 length settings) or to knock down that beard you no longer need without clogging your favorite  razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was quite surprised on my first haircut with these clippers that I did not feel any snags.</li>
            <li>It is very useful when I take a long trip like on two week cruise.</li>
            <li>It is very convinient for a new guy to try DIY.</li>
            <li>This one is better than the previous one I used.</li>
            <li>I love cutting my own hair now.</li>
            <li>Then the blade assembly is clipped in a &amp;#34;blade socket&amp;#34; which is clipped on the main assembly (so three parts clipped together).</li>
            <li>They clipped in the main assembly and there&#x27;s a rotating dial to adjust the cut length.</li>
            <li>I bought second one for my bold dad, he loves it too.</li>
            <li>I had the older model and it lasted for two years.</li>
            <li>We have used an older version of these for years.</li>
            <li>This new one is pretty much the new version of the old one.</li>
            <li>Love the rotating feature as it allows me to cut places where I normally can not reach with a typical clipper</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>expectations were high on purchasing this product, expectations were surpassed by eons.&lt;br /&gt;Thanking</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>In 23 years, we&#x27;ve gone through an Oster, a Panasonic, and our current Conair is on its last legs, so we were glad to see the new Norelco clippers</li>
            <li>Must take a little more practice.  </li>
            <li>It is very good item for doing hair cutting yourself.</li>
            <li>his trimmer takes a little getting used to, but once you get it down, it is great.</li>
            <li>This trimmer takes a little getting used to, but once you get it down, it is great.  </li>
            <li>There are indeed so many movable/replaceable parts that I&#x27;m wondering if this product will last long.</li>
            <li>the other one was damaged other wise</li>
            <li>Very convenient, especially if partner is willing to invest the time with you for easiest use.</li>
            <li>; This is just from normal use once a week.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m inclined to believe this is normal.</li>
            <li>Being a college student, I have decided to give myself haircuts to save me some money since I normally have had to get one every month.</li>
            <li>This is just something I have to get used to with these clippers being a different kind and brand than my previous ones, it&#x27;s nothing against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace a 4 year old previous model and this one is even better.</li>
            <li>It charged quickly and lasted as long as we needed.  </li>
            <li>I tried an old unit and it still cut off a little more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I should also explain that my brother has to be supervised doing anything new</li>
            <li>and they still work like new.</li>
            <li>If you take good care of this it should give you at least several years of quality hair cuts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as intuitive as the old golden standard - the flowbee.  </li>
            <li>Since this is sold as a self-cutting hair tool, presumably for men, body hair would be a very natural extension.</li>
            <li>The Norelco cuts better (the cutting blade is parallel to your head surface, like a barber&#x27;s clipper would be);  the Remington cutter is vertical and therefore isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>retire most of my clippers because of mechanical damage around the head/blade area, usually joints.</li>
            <li>It was clipping more hair so finally had to go with Other hair clipper.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really nice not to have a cord in the way, and the charge lasts a long time - long enough to get both of my boys done without having to recharge in between.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I now actually prefer it to the more conventional shape on the Wahls.</li>
            <li>My wife/barber loved the simple, positive adjustment of the combs, which gave much better control of the cutting length than the levers or other controls of clippers we&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>I was used to just doing everything with normal clippers and didn&#x27;t think the rotating blades would be that big of a deal, but they make it much easier.</li>
            <li>At first, it seemed that it would be weird, but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s a handy feature.</li>
            <li>This was easy and intuitive to use, taking much less time and effort (and risk of nicking ears or skin!)</li>
            <li>Battery seems to charge okay and last long enough.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp blades</li>
            <li>Disappointing shortcoming on an otherwise great trimmer.</li>
            <li>But the weight difference is clear, and I appreciate that it&#x27;s easier to handle because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far no cons.  </li>
            <li>It is loud</li>
            <li>I really like how I only have to keep track of one comb</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very please with the product.</li>
            <li>that lasted nearly 3 years for around $20).  </li>
            <li>I had a lot of trouble getting a feel for how to push the trimmer on my head in order to get a smooth even cut (even though the QC5570/40 and QC5170/60 are almost identical), and I felt I had to keep it at a very specific angle to cut correctly, while not putting too much pressure on the teeth so as not to break them.</li>
            <li>(Li ion vs. NiCa battery) than the old one.</li>
            <li>Used it yesterday and wow.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My only issue with these is that you can&#x27;t really cut with them at any sort of an angle, you have to keep the flush against your head for them to cut to the desired length.</li>
            <li>First, let me start by saying that this item is not professional quality and it is not meant to be.</li>
            <li>The protruding head/hair guard is probably the weakest link but has held up so far</li>
            <li>I used it twice so far and it performed well.</li>
            <li>It is cordless, not heavy and worked well.</li>
            <li>As a frequent hair cutter I know what I like and the QC5570 are not to my liking.</li>
            <li>I will have to continue the using  the old one; since at it&#x27;s highest setting my head ended up looking like I was entering Marine boot camp.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco Headgroom Plus offers a compact, lightweight hair clipper that works on a battery charge which lasts around an hour.</li>
            <li>The ergonomic design offers a 180 degree rotating head so you can work from any angle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Happiest man every alive on earth.</li>
            <li>The angles are very helpful for when I need to cut my sides and back.</li>
            <li>Like I said I have used and manhandled the old one at it</li>
            <li>Has exceeded expectations thus far.</li>
            <li>It would have cost nearly nothing to include them, and would have extended the usefulness of of the product tenfold.</li>
            <li>The only deficiency I have is that even the longest setting leaves skin visible, so get ready to go &amp;#34;Jar Head&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s far and away the easiest-to-use hair trimming device I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>week, it died completely.  </li>
            <li>than my old way.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use the swivel action.</li>
            <li>The second time I was able to cut 100% of my hair without missing any spot (with the help of a hand mirror).</li>
            <li>The power is good enough for me, and it lasts at least several cuts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Comes with all the right size attachments, and the blade clicks up with your thumb to get different lengths on the fly--a barber would like how versatile it is with getting different hair lengths without having to swap out different-sized guards.</li>
            <li>Small and lightweight for easy use without tiring the arms.</li>
            <li>convenient, small and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I have cut my own hair for a few years now and have owned one other harclipper</li>
            <li>I tried other products but this worth the money</li>
            <li>while it may be lack of practice with this particular clipper, the cuts are often uneven and require more touch up than I find with other clippers&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing we didn&#x27;t like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a storage bag, so you either store it in the original box, or it will get tangled among other things in a drawer or closet.</li>
            <li>I keep my hair pretty short and hate paying $20 every 3 weeks to keep it looking nice for such an easy style.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this device is not built from high quality materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>c) Wahl basic clippers (stainless steel body, small, cordless, required multiple passes; blade head cracked after a year.)&lt;br /&gt;- Have been shaving my head for almost 4 years; would definitely recommend to anyone who cuts their own hair; will definitely buy again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(a replacement comb was $3 less than a whole new unit so decided to just get a new unit)  </li>
            <li>so you can create a small stubble, if you don&#x27;t like your head looking like a shiny light reflector.</li>
            <li>The Norelco QC5570/40 is a great idea, with a very flawed execution.  </li>
            <li>only limitation (not a defect) is that clippers are only useful for short hair.</li>
            <li>after three years doesn&#x27;t work when blade is turned maximum to the left side, so I bought new model which was QC5570, but it has problem with cut regulation, it can unnoticeable skip down when you cutting hairs (there is no pentameter lock for cut regulation like in QC5170 where you need press small red button to change it), so even if it cuts hairs very good, you can cut them more than you planned before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delicate, easy to use</li>
            <li>It cuts very well, it can be cleaned under water, and the batteries last for several cuts.  </li>
            <li>edges on the blade are not smooth or comfortable, despite the manufacturer&#x27;s claims to the opposite.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving my head for years, and this is the first trimmer that I feel will last a long time and get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Bit the bullet and got this and have been cutting my hair for a few months now with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>hot, extremely sharp, often scraped head; promptly stopped using);</li>
            <li>But the quality of the product is like no other clippers I have had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Size: its relatively small and easy enough to stuff into a mirror shelf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quite honestly, having  spent this machine&#x27;s price several times over inferior alternatives in the last few years (not to mention the frustration borne ) .</li>
            <li>I like it for three reasons, the attachment is easy to adjust for cut height and exchange, the cutting head is rotatable , and the charge can hold for long time (easily 4-5 cuts per charge).</li>
            <li>But only when I saw the turnable clipper that can be rotated to the number setting that you like, the mystery has become clear about how the clipper does the holding the hair through the teeth of the comb, so the hair is not cut beyond the length you want to.</li>
            <li>The only reason we are on the third generation is when it finally poops out (and trust me, as much as he uses it, it lasts 5 years!)they have upgraded it to a newer model.  </li>
            <li>bought the QC5570/40 to replace a 3 year old Norelco QC5170/60, only because one of the teeth on the comb had broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The old one finally died after several years of service (postmortem revealed hair clogged up the metal contacts in the rotary head - probably could have fixed it).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was a really well spent $40.</li>
            <li>Powerful enough to cut through my hair in one pass and holds a charge long enough for multiple haircuts before needing a recharge.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if it holds up as well as the old one.</li>
            <li>I do wish however that it had detachable combs up to 1 inches deep like my old clippers.  </li>
            <li>You can see how this can add up for a college student who is barely getting by.</li>
            <li>However, the length setting tends to slip, and you get to choose between a bald patch and a buzz cut, if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>Because I cut my own hair and beard at the same time, I got tired of the heat and pointed clippers of the standard hair clippers.</li>
            <li>This hair clipper is unique because instead of having 7-10 different clipper attachements to adjust the length of the cut, you simply turn the little dial and the clipper lengthens or shortens the cut.</li>
            <li>The devise is fantastic, not much noisy, long battery life on a single charge.</li>
            <li>The main reason I replaced it with this new one is because the blades were starting to pull my hair every ones in a while, and since I didn&#x27;t take good care of it at all, it was very dirty...</li>
            <li>I think I went a bit too short first go, but it all grows back, so no real harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t turn it that much, but it could be useful for hard to reach places, especially if you&#x27;re cutting your own hair.  </li>
            <li>only complaint is that I wish a couple of longer length settings were available.</li>
            <li>When using the trimmer, the teeth feel like they are a lot longer, but putting them next to my old ones, they are only about a 1/16th of an inch longer.</li>
            <li>I always used #1 and #2 settings with the old trimmer, and now I can’t get as short of a cut/trim with the standard comb attachment.</li>
            <li>feel it does not cut as short as my old corded model of a different brand&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleaning is very very easy on this unit (difficult in the Panasonic).  </li>
            <li>precise.....wish I&#x27;d purchased this a long time ago as I&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for my old Vidal Sassoon palm clipper.  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake of ordering this not long after I cut my hair.</li>
            <li>I got a perfect haircut, and the clippers even got the little frizzy hairs around my balding spot, the ones that defied cutting with other clippers and had to be cut with scissors.</li>
            <li>It is lighter weight and but harder for me to hold because of new design shape.</li>
            <li>It does a terrific job of cutting my hair and I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I problably get my hair cut at the barber about half as much as I use to</li>
            <li>Cutting height readily adjusted, so simple and relatively quick grooming, particularly for those of us with short hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Why are consumers forced to buy a whole new clipper kit when the battery dies out?</li>
            <li>In front of a big mirror, with a small mirror in one hand, and this thing in the other, takes less than 5 min to get a nice head shave.  </li>
            <li>With other clippers, the cutting length had to be eyeballed and was neither very precise or consistent.</li>
            <li>Missing some important accessories ,which was included in the previous model</li>
            <li>Blades are sharp; one pass usually gets everything; no need to keep going over.&lt;br /&gt;- Blades are comfortable; without a guard, I have no irritation, no scrapes, even when applying pressure (for pesky neck</li>
            <li>My clipper is still working fine, and no parts has broken yet.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> When I went to the salon for a haircut and brought my son with me, they were all amazed that I was able to do his cut by myself without any training or experience!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy cleanup and no cords.</li>
            <li> It would also be great to have an attachment with a rounded bottom, to make tapered cuts around the ears, sideburns etc easy.  </li>
            <li> AND IT WORKS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> The best and fast clipper I ever bought.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this clipper a try after reading many good reviews online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own hair for a while</li>
            <li> Nice looks to be a nice device for shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> Is wonderfull be your own stylis</li>
            <li> I wanted to find something that would work for him to do his own trims.</li>
            <li> The rotating head is a nice feature, which is helping me to cut my hair myself.  </li>
            <li> my hairdresser uses in her salon, the kind that she could drop on the tile floor without any damage.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for about three years now.</li>
            <li> The built-in adjustable guard and the ability to swivel the cutter are really handy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another Norelco tilt head and this one is not as nice.  </li>
            <li> A must-have for those who plan to shave their own heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers when they were on sale because I wanted to learn how to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is an excellent clipper that is much easier to use than corded clippers I&#x27;ve worked with.</li>
            <li> The handy trimmer pays for itself in a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li> I liked the cordless feature.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can have my hair cut own my own once a month.</li>
            <li> Really handy to work with.</li>
            <li> The rotating head and length adjustment are both nifty features that should give you all the options you need to buzz your own hair.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if there was a way to lock these</li>
            <li> Really liked these clippers.</li>
            <li> Nice groomer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are really nice clippers.</li>
            <li> fill that bill nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice clipper set.</li>
            <li> perfect buy, easy to handle and quick results</li>
            <li> very easy to do my own haircuts</li>
            <li> This new one works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Probably the good thing of this headgroomer is that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, and the swivel head makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and cuts without pulling on hair.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and configure.</li>
            <li> The haircut length can be very easily adjusted with the dial, and I did not have to remove it yet.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy on the hands and the 180 degree rotating joint def helps with clipping from all angles.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to adjust the height of the cut, as well.</li>
            <li> Works fine and good price, not quite as convenient to use as its forerunner(fatter profile).</li>
            <li> This is by far the best clipper I ever had.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of Norelco electronics, and everything always works like it should and lasts for many years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This electric razor is by far the best I&#x27;ve  ever had</li>
            <li> I found a suitable replacement through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a more effective hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a more effective hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The guard gave the right length, and the trim took all of two minutes with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It surprised me when I get it.&lt;br /&gt;It have many functions to make my hair delightful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, from now I will never cost hair cut :) .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot to say , but in general norelco products are the best out there !</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and efficient tool to use.  </li>
            <li> nice in the hand and easy to maneuver</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to cut own hair.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li> price is nice and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Locking features absent: The head rotates too easily on its own.  </li>
            <li> you cut your own hair easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this would be a good product to try if you want to give buzzing your own hair a shot, but those already used to the practice would be better off with a higher end Oster unit rather than this.</li>
            <li> so your child would have to be able to tolerate that.  </li>
            <li> Have owned two of the Remington versions of this and this Norelco unit is way way better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> I had to wait around a month or more to use it.</li>
            <li> and this is the most even haircut</li>
            <li> and I have used many.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> Even their cheapie will do better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> This model has more refinements, the shape of it, the adjustment in the height of the cut and can be rinsed under water.</li>
            <li> In a word, you&#x27;d better have a girlfriend to help you for a better style.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> your cut short length hair this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it for anything more demanding.</li>
            <li> Love this clipper, cordless, convenient and dependable.  </li>
            <li> and I love the cordless option.</li>
            <li> but I love it now.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> No need to change heads any more</li>
            <li> Too convenient, I love it</li>
            <li> I love this hair clipper.</li>
            <li> On top of all that, the &amp;#34;swivel direction&amp;#34; feature adds an additional part that can move accidentally when</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve cut our grandson&#x27;s hair a couple of times with this clipper and we love it.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is cordless.  </li>
            <li> They leave a perfect trim and can be used extensively.</li>
            <li> But then the shortest comb which we used most often broke.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, although it&#x27;s a good machine, it doesn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> And I have saved more than $300 just by shaving my head myself with Philips hair clippers.</li>
            <li> sure you read the directions.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried this out the day it arrived in the mail and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Outstanding battery life.</li>
            <li> we all love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s significantly more portable</li>
            <li> It charges fast, is versatile and works great,</li>
            <li> (7 more wrds required?</li>
            <li> tow more ) Thank you.</li>
            <li> It is more of a trimmer than a clipper.  </li>
            <li> Looking for a better option now.</li>
            <li> More than once, I&#x27;ve started trimming my hair at one setting, and finished at another setting.  </li>
            <li> but this is more of a coordination thing for myself.  </li>
            <li> With home haircuts, I&#x27;ve saved thousands of dollars, saved hundreds of hours of driving to a barber shop and waiting for a barber, and enjoyed the convenience of getting a haircut whenever I need one.</li>
            <li> But I know better then to club myself in the head with clippers.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job and pleases me.  </li>
            <li> nice product fast shipping and good price</li>
            <li> swivel head is another interesting feature.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> to use.could not ask for a better hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;i love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suitable for all easy hair styles.</li>
            <li> LOL I highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> Just tried this new one yesterday and it is great.</li>
            <li> my wife used it to cut my hair,very good,very easy to use,I love it ,twice a month,it deserves the price</li>
            <li> Outstanding design and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use &amp; i&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> These seemed like a perfect fit for my brother, who keeps his hair fairly short.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use and the ability to be able to turn the blades is more useful that you would think.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, after figuring out the operation (instructions are in every language on a LARGE piece of paper without good illustrations)</li>
            <li> This works quickly and easily, and the cut is amazingly even.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier model from this manufacturer which did a very good job.</li>
            <li> Works very good, I use this to cut my hair short.</li>
            <li> Very good clipper, I have done my first self hair cut yesterday, looks very good!!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> The Wahls constantly snagged on his hair, much more than on mine, so it was a welcome improvement for him as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and cuts even.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy process.  </li>
            <li> Charges in a couple hours and the adjustable attachments make it easy to cut and do fades.</li>
            <li> shaver easily hold a charge for 4-5 shaves.</li>
            <li> it is well built and designed and easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick, and easy.  </li>
            <li> EASY TO USE AND NEATER ANDFASTER</li>
            <li> The hair length adjustment is too easy to turn.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and use.&lt;br /&gt;Worth a buy for the price they offer it for.</li>
            <li> I still use to cut my hair, and it makes the job easy with the adjustable guard.</li>
            <li> The clippers are easy to hang onto and maneuver.</li>
            <li> I also like that you can run them under the tap for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> The clippers are well designed and easy to hold in the hand, which my carpal tunnel appreciated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> attachments were easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beard, sideburns, stache, and even eyebrows if needed, are all easy to trim, and result in a uniform</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> The rotating head locks into 5 positions which allows you to easily cut your hair.</li>
            <li> easy to.</li>
            <li> These made it easy, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had an older version of this and loved it.</li>
            <li> Strong recommendation for this product.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend to everybody.</li>
            <li> They have a futuristic look compared to the conventional shape of hair clippers, but form follows function, and the clippers are the best ergonomic design of any clippers we&#x27;ve had, as well as being the lightest weight.</li>
            <li> This was the first time that my son has ever cut his own hair.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a nice design when first pulling it out of the package.</li>
            <li> I just use this handy clipper and have my hair cut all by myself (first time).</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold, the blade swivels so I can use both hands and get harder-to-reach spots, and the adjustable trimmer is intuitive and accurate.</li>
            <li> my son is 2 now and he seemed to do fine with it.  </li>
            <li> Battery life has been fine and I&#x27;ve never run out of power mid-haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I can say with me watching over him and giving directions, yes, the clipper works fine.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice design, pretty comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li> The adjustable length dial is nice and accurate, and I can get the exact length that I want.  </li>
            <li> This clipper is very useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> clipper has an indicator light so you can keep track of the battery charge, and it is also designed to be easily cleaned and to be smooth on your skin (rounded tips).</li>
            <li> So far, they haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;do it yourself\\&quot; part of this, but these work great if you just want to give someone a quick buzz.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and powerful and cordless!</li>
            <li> Now the huge downside is the fragility of the clipper.</li>
            <li> battery life&lt;br /&gt;rotating head is a huge help once you get used to it</li>
            <li> well fit for my sons in 5.</li>
            <li> I used this razor to trim my beard this morning and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> light weight.....</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I even shaved my beard with it then ran a cheap disposable razor over it to finish it of.</li>
            <li> It is nice to  get a quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It does fit my demand.</li>
            <li> I had a wahl clipper before because it was cheap</li>
            <li> Worked great for almost 8 months but recently the guide comb broke off two &amp;#34;blades.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Fortunately I wanted it on the shortest place but for others that might be an additional concern.</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to get used to operating the device, so it is best to take things cautiously.</li>
            <li> I had to give myself a military-length shave to make the rest of the head match, then I threw this cheap toy into the trash.</li>
            <li> Waterproof: The waterproof quality of the unit makes for easy clean up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just fit my expect.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to securely &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I used it regularly and it works great.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give product reviews lightly.</li>
            <li> These are just as good as some old Oster clippers I had, and this is cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lets me keep it nice, short, and neat on daily/weekly basis in my own bathroom.</li>
            <li> The machine is working really good, but I was expecting it to come with more parts, to control different parts of the hair</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The adjustable angle on this thing means I can get right up to the hair line without going through as many</li>
            <li> longer worry about the hot summer!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are easy to disassemble to clean and you can just run the pieces under water to clean them.</li>
            <li> With the Norelco rasor I was able to do a fast (5 minutes!)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve done my hair where I didn&#x27;t have to go over it 4 or 5 times to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss anything.</li>
            <li> Without any experience I was able the first time to cut 95% of my hair myself.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my original for this one.</li>
            <li> I love it at the first time to use .  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After my first haircut with these clippers, my wife/barber loves them, and I love them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fact that this thing cost the same or barely more than the Wahl corded clipper kits yet performs better and is cordless is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Buy discount period, it is cheaper to buy back after use, it is very good, ready to help children at home haircut.</li>
            <li> to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is made very well, the mechanism rotates with a satisfying click and does not feel cheap in anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used scissors for hair cuts for my husband and son, with a razor to clean around the edges.</li>
            <li> Easy cleaning as well and more sturdy in comparison with older models.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight, and I did not have to use the rotating head feature yet as it fits very well in the hand</li>
            <li> Charges fast, and it feels like it provides a lot more power to the trimmer than the QC5170/60 has when using the battery only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only good thing I can say about it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Balding man&#x27;s dream come true.</li>
            <li> Battery operated clipper with good power, last long.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> This product gives a good overall close haircut.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a guy for the full on buzz</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 love it so much</li>
            <li> Battery life is excellent; takes me about 8 minutes to do my face and head; can get at least 5 shaves in before recharging.</li>
            <li> Good overall.</li>
            <li> This is the reason I&#x27;m not giving a full five stars.</li>
            <li> The 180 rotating head looks nice but it doesn&#x27;t need to rotate that far.</li>
            <li> Quality wise, it&#x27;s well constructed and not flimsy like some generic competitors where they would pass at a dollar shop.</li>
            <li> We solved the problem by using the container for the old clippers that we discarded, but a container of some kind is needed to keep everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We solved the problem by using the container for the old clippers that we discarded, but a container of some kind is needed to keep everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For someone who has never cut his own hair in his entire life, I found it extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li> pretty cool, I can easily do haircut by myself with it</li>
            <li> This handy, easy to use clipper is like having a private barber at home.</li>
            <li> I read the directions, and it seemed pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Adjustable settings make it easy to get your hair to the exact length that you want it.</li>
            <li> I found the cutter to be quiet, effective, and ideal for giving that fresh from the barber shop appearance when the shop is closed.  </li>
            <li> Fine gradations on the two supplied plastic heads allow for exact control of hair length.</li>
            <li> What the most important is it can be washed directly by water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient and quick.</li>
            <li> It charged super quick.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and holds charge well.  </li>
            <li> but the blades will catch on my hair much more often than the older model.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it to do quick trims for the men in the family.</li>
            <li> Satisfied, can rotate 180 degrees, the back of the head is more convenient</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair since 1973, and the Philips Norelco QC5570/40 is the best hair clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of what I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> stil don&#x27;t trust my brother with doing this alone, not for a good, long while.</li>
            <li> This is a nice touch up device, useful for clipping neck, touching up a haircut, trimming a beard (although it is not a beard trimmer) and other do-it-yourself cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m anticipating many years and hair cuts with my new clippers.</li>
            <li> and it still works, I am confident this new one will do the job too...</li>
            <li> I have been using electric wired clippers for as long as I can remember, but I was very impressed with this especially for the price</li>
            <li> This is the first really good clippers I have had for cleaning up the hair on the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Compact, fast and easy to use for shaving or having a haircut.</li>
            <li> Multiple trim settings and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I tried a little and wasn&#x27;t too happy -</li>
            <li> Sure, it would be nice if everything would look as high quality as an iPhone or other Apple products, but then it would cost a lot more; and for just clipping my hair this works well at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very good but only for short length adjustments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and very manoeuvrable.</li>
            <li> It also used the same charging cord as my Norelco beard trimmer which is handy.</li>
            <li> i always do my own haircut and when I upgrade to this clipper it only cost me 10 mins.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since it takes me about 1/2 the time as my old wahl beard trimmer I cut my hair more often.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these if you are someone who cuts their own hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> The clip is smooth, the most important thing is qc5570 does not block with my rough hair.</li>
            <li> Not as nice or as powerful as the last Norelco razor I bought.</li>
            <li> Also, once the battery dies out for good you are expected to throw away</li>
            <li> The rotating blades are a useful feature.</li>
            <li> The rotating blades are a useful feature.  </li>
            <li> useful for trimming around the sides of your head</li>
            <li> I do a 5 on top and 1.5 around the sides/back and blend it in with a 3 which looks just like when I had it done professionally.  </li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s a golden 5 star product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool</li>
            <li> If a product misses the description or if the product is worth the purchase, I will write a review.</li>
            <li> I loved that the blade on this is adjustable, no more storing a bunch of sizes and having to change them, just easily adjust on the clippers themselves.  </li>
            <li> The comb has nice rounded edges rather than the sharp edges like on the Wahls which meant I wasn&#x27;t poking myself with the comb constantly, especially appreciated around my ears.</li>
            <li> I use the longest setting on top, let it grow-out while using the detailing guard to keep the sides and back clean and tapered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimming action is clean and smooth - no biting or pulling has occurred at all.</li>
            <li> The trimming action is clean and smooth - no biting or pulling has occurred at all.  </li>
            <li> It seems a little more comfortable to hold than the older model and was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Will keep using this brand and model as long as I am able to purchase it!</li>
            <li> In use, the blade didn&#x27;t snag or pull at all, which isn&#x27;t too surprising since it&#x27;s still quite sharp, but there were no defects in manufacturing, so</li>
            <li> I figured that if this was as easy as they said, an adult male who is very bright but somewhat limited with new stuff should be able to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ummm....</li>
            <li> It just falls right out of it.</li>
            <li> I keep a buzz cut and the guard adjust just right.  </li>
            <li> With the offset head and bulky handle its just doesn&#x27;t feel right in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> This shaver worked right out of the box.</li>
            <li> The shape is decent and sits in my hand comfortably.  </li>
            <li> All it does is make it easy to hold and clip, but it&#x27;s a nice little addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item especially for the purpose to shave my own head and the rotating dead really does a great job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While a basic style, unlike shaving the hear altogether, it&#x27;s not foolproof and is a good test for a new machine.&lt;br /&gt;*The blade design and configuration admirably prevents  cut locks of hair from  getting stuck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over the fact that I&#x27;m going bald but not quite ready to do the full shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using the clipper to cut my two sons&#x27; hair for the past 5 years, and it&#x27;s great for that too.  </li>
            <li> This haircut is very good, you can wash the body, head can be rotated 180 degrees, that is a little short caliper, the longest only to 15mm, if able to 30mm fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, better than other Clippers I have owned.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to start breaking them right away the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The shape of the clippers is unusual but I got used to it quickly</li>
            <li> This newer version is more powerful and longer lasting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great clipper for cutting someone&#x27;s else hair but not your own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are noticeably lighter than conventional clippers, but to be honest, I only cut my own hair, so fatigue has never been an issue.</li>
            <li> This should be a very useful review since I have had this for over 8 months now and feel comfortable actually scoring it.  </li>
            <li> If you want your hair very short, this is the product It never cuts the skin, very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much, even if I havn&#x27;t used</li>
            <li> purchased this to replace my 5 year old one that still works just fine</li>
            <li> This is the first set of hair clippers I&#x27;ve owned, so I have nothing to compare them to (other than the hair attachment on my beard trimmer, which doesn&#x27;t really seem like a fair comparison).</li>
            <li> Cut my sons hair with this for the first time.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Warning, make sure you check the hair length setting before starting.</li>
            <li> Will it last many years</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t make it threw the first hair cut</li>
            <li> It took me about 1/2 way through the first cut to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Charging takes about 30 minutes and this more then enough for clipping.</li>
            <li> I just used these clippers today for the first time</li>
            <li> It is washable which make it easy to clean and the battery last for reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was my first time</li>
            <li> ; it was OK; required multiple passes); b) Wahl Balding clippers (bulky, corded, ran</li>
            <li> Mine are not broken as I rarely use them</li>
            <li> I tried it using many times but same result.</li>
            <li> I buzz my entire head on the lowest setting on a weekly basis, and am able to get three or four uses per charge before a noticeable drop in power.</li>
            <li> The first one wore out after about 3 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had many beard trippers and clippers in the past, with many different attachments, but they never made trimming any better or easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I question how well the clipper was made, but I was able to just put it back in the place it was removed and it works as it did</li>
            <li> With the Norelco clippers, a locking dial sets the exact length to the nearest 0.5mm for shorter lengths and 2mm for longer cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first it does not appear functional, but rotating the ring forces the guard through it&#x27;s setting detents and holds it</li>
            <li> Easy to use, excellent battery and high quality cutting blades</li>
            <li> Easy to use, excellent battery and high quality cutting blades</li>
            <li> With the hair guard, it is also easy to accidentally \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; and cause a major screw up on your hair cut.</li>
            <li> When my wife come back from shopping, she is so surprised with such an excellent job done by this new clipper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to hold it and to cut yourself, as well as easy for someone to cut other person.</li>
            <li> Lightweight; easy to hold; rotating handle is useful when shaving back of head.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> so I can use it easily with either the right or the left hand.  </li>
            <li> I think once I&#x27;ve had a chance to play with this a bit more, it won&#x27;t be a real issue, but it did result in a very short buzz my first go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other nice touches:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those needing to save money on home hair cuts...easy to use and very affordable!!</li>
            <li> , It is very easy to use and cut my hair just as good as any expensive barbers equipment, I have been having a pretty good experience lately with all Philips Norelco products.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and could be tighter, but generally it works fine.</li>
            <li> Again, the rotating head helps to get just the right angle without having to twist my wrist, and it helps to keep the main body of the clippers out of the way for easier trimming around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> the way, thanks for the fast delivery!</li>
            <li> My wife was a bit hesitant the first time or two, but now she&#x27;s really into haircutting, and she loves how much money we save.</li>
            <li> For all the beginners, once you are over the awe, this clipper is easy to handle with its angled settings to help you reach the hair from different directions.</li>
            <li> so they have certainly paid for themselves.  </li>
            <li> certainly will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I was using a corded Wahl trimmer that had me tethered to certain locations in and around the house to get the deed done.</li>
            <li> I seek smart way to engage/disengage comb without brute force.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the pros certainly out way the cons at this price point.</li>
            <li> At first, the rotating head seems gimmicky, but it really does come in handy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, convenient, charges fast and staid charged for months, I use it 3 times a week to clip my hair and to keep my haircut in the same shape.</li>
            <li> Works fine if you only want a buzz cut.</li>
            <li> Durability: as I was removing the large clip to change sizes, the whole part of the rotating head was dislodged.</li>
            <li> nice little clipper does the job</li>
            <li> Everyone would get a little apprehensive to using hair clippers on their own -</li>
            <li> It feels great in my hands, and cuts through very thick hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> I did my own cut first, and had the wife do a bit of clean up along the neck and behind the ears after.  </li>
            <li> Very good！it&#x27;s convenient for me.</li>
            <li> job with a very even look to it.  </li>
            <li> The 180 degree rotating head makes it so much easier to cut the hair.</li>
            <li> Worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Cuts well and very efficient cutter</li>
            <li> the clippers was light in weigh, so I sent them back.</li>
            <li> turning head is very helpful in reaching all head areas conveniently.</li>
            <li> We charged it straight away, as he was in need of a trim.</li>
            <li> It held the strength of the charge the whole time.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is cordless makes it much easier to use as well.</li>
            <li> When power is low, it sometimes makes noisy sound.</li>
            <li> So this product really works.  </li>
            <li> To those who want to buy a Hair Clipper , I highly recommend this Philips Norelco QC5570 !</li>
            <li> It has High quality, and well designed !&lt;</li>
            <li> Much easier to cut hair with the rotating clippers.</li>
            <li> The design is reasonable and convenient.  </li>
            <li> The swivel head makes these clippers much easier to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cuts a hair.</li>
            <li> and I am not the most careful person.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Product as described.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful and get the scissors out for the top.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short and it is great for cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> A flashing light on the back lets you know when it needs charging and is fully charged.</li>
            <li> no one would ever notice since its really cm but</li>
            <li> the guards feel very flimsy.</li>
            <li> It still worked very well</li>
            <li> I really like the rotating head and the fact that it is cordless.  </li>
            <li> It really does make it easier to reach all the sides of your head by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its swivel head lets you cut the back comfortably, although you need a pair of mirrors to see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> I like the clipper so much</li>
            <li> This device really values the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every bit as much power as a heavy-duty corded model, but with the added features of a swiveling head, water-resistance, and of course, the option to go cordless!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The motor feels powerful, and I haven&#x27;t come anywhere near the limitations of the battery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I really like the QC5570.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Seems very well made.  </li>
            <li> I really like the swivel head and the built in dial for adjusting the trimming height.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re cutting your own hair, the swivel feature is handy as it allows you to reach all areas with ease.</li>
            <li> This results in a 1/8&amp;#34; stripe in the middle of your nice 1/2&amp;#34; fade and forces you to go with the dreaded buzz-it-all last resort option.</li>
            <li> She tried rotating the clipper head and said it was a nice feature, but for my style of haircut (a short buzz cut), it&#x27;s not really necessary.</li>
            <li> The hair cut looks better than other trimmers.</li>
            <li> There is a significant caveat to these clippers that may make them unsuitable for some people: the maximum hair length is only 5/8&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is well-designed, user-friendly, but the user need to be very careful when using it without any combs, or it would make bald spots on your head.:)</li>
            <li> and i found it pretty useful ; the product simply keeps its promises.</li>
            <li> Norelco created this with men in mind for a fast side shave (with 4 length settings) or to knock down that beard you no longer need without clogging your favorite  razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was quite surprised on my first haircut with these clippers that I did not feel any snags.</li>
            <li> It is very useful when I take a long trip like on two week cruise.</li>
            <li> It is very convinient for a new guy to try DIY.</li>
            <li> This one is better than the previous one I used.</li>
            <li> I love cutting my own hair now.</li>
            <li> Then the blade assembly is clipped in a &amp;#34;blade socket&amp;#34; which is clipped on the main assembly (so three parts clipped together).</li>
            <li> They clipped in the main assembly and there&#x27;s a rotating dial to adjust the cut length.</li>
            <li> I bought second one for my bold dad, he loves it too.</li>
            <li> I had the older model and it lasted for two years.</li>
            <li> We have used an older version of these for years.</li>
            <li> This new one is pretty much the new version of the old one.</li>
            <li> Love the rotating feature as it allows me to cut places where I normally can not reach with a typical clipper</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> expectations were high on purchasing this product, expectations were surpassed by eons.&lt;br /&gt;Thanking</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> In 23 years, we&#x27;ve gone through an Oster, a Panasonic, and our current Conair is on its last legs, so we were glad to see the new Norelco clippers</li>
            <li> Must take a little more practice.  </li>
            <li> It is very good item for doing hair cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> his trimmer takes a little getting used to, but once you get it down, it is great.</li>
            <li> This trimmer takes a little getting used to, but once you get it down, it is great.  </li>
            <li> There are indeed so many movable/replaceable parts that I&#x27;m wondering if this product will last long.</li>
            <li> the other one was damaged other wise</li>
            <li> Very convenient, especially if partner is willing to invest the time with you for easiest use.</li>
            <li> ; This is just from normal use once a week.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m inclined to believe this is normal.</li>
            <li> Being a college student, I have decided to give myself haircuts to save me some money since I normally have had to get one every month.</li>
            <li> This is just something I have to get used to with these clippers being a different kind and brand than my previous ones, it&#x27;s nothing against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a 4 year old previous model and this one is even better.</li>
            <li> It charged quickly and lasted as long as we needed.  </li>
            <li> I tried an old unit and it still cut off a little more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I should also explain that my brother has to be supervised doing anything new</li>
            <li> and they still work like new.</li>
            <li> If you take good care of this it should give you at least several years of quality hair cuts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as intuitive as the old golden standard - the flowbee.  </li>
            <li> Since this is sold as a self-cutting hair tool, presumably for men, body hair would be a very natural extension.</li>
            <li> The Norelco cuts better (the cutting blade is parallel to your head surface, like a barber&#x27;s clipper would be);  the Remington cutter is vertical and therefore isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> retire most of my clippers because of mechanical damage around the head/blade area, usually joints.</li>
            <li> It was clipping more hair so finally had to go with Other hair clipper.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really nice not to have a cord in the way, and the charge lasts a long time - long enough to get both of my boys done without having to recharge in between.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I now actually prefer it to the more conventional shape on the Wahls.</li>
            <li> My wife/barber loved the simple, positive adjustment of the combs, which gave much better control of the cutting length than the levers or other controls of clippers we&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> I was used to just doing everything with normal clippers and didn&#x27;t think the rotating blades would be that big of a deal, but they make it much easier.</li>
            <li> At first, it seemed that it would be weird, but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s a handy feature.</li>
            <li> This was easy and intuitive to use, taking much less time and effort (and risk of nicking ears or skin!)</li>
            <li> Battery seems to charge okay and last long enough.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp blades</li>
            <li> Disappointing shortcoming on an otherwise great trimmer.</li>
            <li> But the weight difference is clear, and I appreciate that it&#x27;s easier to handle because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far no cons.  </li>
            <li> It is loud</li>
            <li> I really like how I only have to keep track of one comb</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very please with the product.</li>
            <li> that lasted nearly 3 years for around $20).  </li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble getting a feel for how to push the trimmer on my head in order to get a smooth even cut (even though the QC5570/40 and QC5170/60 are almost identical), and I felt I had to keep it at a very specific angle to cut correctly, while not putting too much pressure on the teeth so as not to break them.</li>
            <li> (Li ion vs. NiCa battery) than the old one.</li>
            <li> Used it yesterday and wow.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My only issue with these is that you can&#x27;t really cut with them at any sort of an angle, you have to keep the flush against your head for them to cut to the desired length.</li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying that this item is not professional quality and it is not meant to be.</li>
            <li> The protruding head/hair guard is probably the weakest link but has held up so far</li>
            <li> I used it twice so far and it performed well.</li>
            <li> It is cordless, not heavy and worked well.</li>
            <li> As a frequent hair cutter I know what I like and the QC5570 are not to my liking.</li>
            <li> I will have to continue the using  the old one; since at it&#x27;s highest setting my head ended up looking like I was entering Marine boot camp.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco Headgroom Plus offers a compact, lightweight hair clipper that works on a battery charge which lasts around an hour.</li>
            <li> The ergonomic design offers a 180 degree rotating head so you can work from any angle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Happiest man every alive on earth.</li>
            <li> The angles are very helpful for when I need to cut my sides and back.</li>
            <li> Like I said I have used and manhandled the old one at it</li>
            <li> Has exceeded expectations thus far.</li>
            <li> It would have cost nearly nothing to include them, and would have extended the usefulness of of the product tenfold.</li>
            <li> The only deficiency I have is that even the longest setting leaves skin visible, so get ready to go &amp;#34;Jar Head&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s far and away the easiest-to-use hair trimming device I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> week, it died completely.  </li>
            <li> than my old way.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use the swivel action.</li>
            <li> The second time I was able to cut 100% of my hair without missing any spot (with the help of a hand mirror).</li>
            <li> The power is good enough for me, and it lasts at least several cuts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Comes with all the right size attachments, and the blade clicks up with your thumb to get different lengths on the fly--a barber would like how versatile it is with getting different hair lengths without having to swap out different-sized guards.</li>
            <li> Small and lightweight for easy use without tiring the arms.</li>
            <li> convenient, small and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for a few years now and have owned one other harclipper</li>
            <li> I tried other products but this worth the money</li>
            <li> while it may be lack of practice with this particular clipper, the cuts are often uneven and require more touch up than I find with other clippers&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing we didn&#x27;t like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a storage bag, so you either store it in the original box, or it will get tangled among other things in a drawer or closet.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair pretty short and hate paying $20 every 3 weeks to keep it looking nice for such an easy style.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this device is not built from high quality materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> c) Wahl basic clippers (stainless steel body, small, cordless, required multiple passes; blade head cracked after a year.)&lt;br /&gt;- Have been shaving my head for almost 4 years; would definitely recommend to anyone who cuts their own hair; will definitely buy again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (a replacement comb was $3 less than a whole new unit so decided to just get a new unit)  </li>
            <li> so you can create a small stubble, if you don&#x27;t like your head looking like a shiny light reflector.</li>
            <li> The Norelco QC5570/40 is a great idea, with a very flawed execution.  </li>
            <li> only limitation (not a defect) is that clippers are only useful for short hair.</li>
            <li> after three years doesn&#x27;t work when blade is turned maximum to the left side, so I bought new model which was QC5570, but it has problem with cut regulation, it can unnoticeable skip down when you cutting hairs (there is no pentameter lock for cut regulation like in QC5170 where you need press small red button to change it), so even if it cuts hairs very good, you can cut them more than you planned before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delicate, easy to use</li>
            <li> It cuts very well, it can be cleaned under water, and the batteries last for several cuts.  </li>
            <li> edges on the blade are not smooth or comfortable, despite the manufacturer&#x27;s claims to the opposite.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head for years, and this is the first trimmer that I feel will last a long time and get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Bit the bullet and got this and have been cutting my hair for a few months now with excellent results.  </li>
            <li> hot, extremely sharp, often scraped head; promptly stopped using);</li>
            <li> But the quality of the product is like no other clippers I have had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Size: its relatively small and easy enough to stuff into a mirror shelf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite honestly, having  spent this machine&#x27;s price several times over inferior alternatives in the last few years (not to mention the frustration borne ) .</li>
            <li> I like it for three reasons, the attachment is easy to adjust for cut height and exchange, the cutting head is rotatable , and the charge can hold for long time (easily 4-5 cuts per charge).</li>
            <li> But only when I saw the turnable clipper that can be rotated to the number setting that you like, the mystery has become clear about how the clipper does the holding the hair through the teeth of the comb, so the hair is not cut beyond the length you want to.</li>
            <li> The only reason we are on the third generation is when it finally poops out (and trust me, as much as he uses it, it lasts 5 years!)they have upgraded it to a newer model.  </li>
            <li> bought the QC5570/40 to replace a 3 year old Norelco QC5170/60, only because one of the teeth on the comb had broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The old one finally died after several years of service (postmortem revealed hair clogged up the metal contacts in the rotary head - probably could have fixed it).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a really well spent $40.</li>
            <li> Powerful enough to cut through my hair in one pass and holds a charge long enough for multiple haircuts before needing a recharge.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if it holds up as well as the old one.</li>
            <li> I do wish however that it had detachable combs up to 1 inches deep like my old clippers.  </li>
            <li> You can see how this can add up for a college student who is barely getting by.</li>
            <li> However, the length setting tends to slip, and you get to choose between a bald patch and a buzz cut, if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> Because I cut my own hair and beard at the same time, I got tired of the heat and pointed clippers of the standard hair clippers.</li>
            <li> This hair clipper is unique because instead of having 7-10 different clipper attachements to adjust the length of the cut, you simply turn the little dial and the clipper lengthens or shortens the cut.</li>
            <li> The devise is fantastic, not much noisy, long battery life on a single charge.</li>
            <li> The main reason I replaced it with this new one is because the blades were starting to pull my hair every ones in a while, and since I didn&#x27;t take good care of it at all, it was very dirty...</li>
            <li> I think I went a bit too short first go, but it all grows back, so no real harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t turn it that much, but it could be useful for hard to reach places, especially if you&#x27;re cutting your own hair.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that I wish a couple of longer length settings were available.</li>
            <li> When using the trimmer, the teeth feel like they are a lot longer, but putting them next to my old ones, they are only about a 1/16th of an inch longer.</li>
            <li> I always used #1 and #2 settings with the old trimmer, and now I can’t get as short of a cut/trim with the standard comb attachment.</li>
            <li> feel it does not cut as short as my old corded model of a different brand&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleaning is very very easy on this unit (difficult in the Panasonic).  </li>
            <li> precise.....wish I&#x27;d purchased this a long time ago as I&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for my old Vidal Sassoon palm clipper.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering this not long after I cut my hair.</li>
            <li> I got a perfect haircut, and the clippers even got the little frizzy hairs around my balding spot, the ones that defied cutting with other clippers and had to be cut with scissors.</li>
            <li> It is lighter weight and but harder for me to hold because of new design shape.</li>
            <li> It does a terrific job of cutting my hair and I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I problably get my hair cut at the barber about half as much as I use to</li>
            <li> Cutting height readily adjusted, so simple and relatively quick grooming, particularly for those of us with short hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Why are consumers forced to buy a whole new clipper kit when the battery dies out?</li>
            <li> In front of a big mirror, with a small mirror in one hand, and this thing in the other, takes less than 5 min to get a nice head shave.  </li>
            <li> With other clippers, the cutting length had to be eyeballed and was neither very precise or consistent.</li>
            <li> Missing some important accessories ,which was included in the previous model</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp; one pass usually gets everything; no need to keep going over.&lt;br /&gt;- Blades are comfortable; without a guard, I have no irritation, no scrapes, even when applying pressure (for pesky neck</li>
            <li> My clipper is still working fine, and no parts has broken yet.</li>
            <li> You can buy the comb as a replacement for about half the price of buying a whole new unit, not cool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*So smooth on my ultra-sensitive curse of a skin, I look a lot less rosy after hair &amp; beard trimmings compared to similarly priced alternatives I&#x27;ve used in the past (one of them was an earlier Philips model, too).</li>
            <li> - I use it without a guard on face and head; cuts down to less than a day&#x27;s worth of growth.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> if I wasn&#x27;t cutting my hair over a trashcan in the driveway, I could have done the whole thing in a mirror, but didn&#x27;t want to clean up.  </li>
            <li> It lacks the ooomph for a full head of thick hair, and seems designed for edging and touching up, rather than cutting and whacking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery holds enough charge to last for 3-5 haircuts depending on how long you are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simply pulling on the long guard allows you to install the short guard, which has 3 settings - 0.5 mm, 1 mm, and 1.5 mm.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never own a hair clipper before, this is my first one.</li>
            <li> (number 1-5) breaking and there is no possibility of buying a replacement piece, you just have to buy the whole unit again :/</li>
            <li> I cant believe it took me this long to finally buy a cordless hair clipper.</li>
            <li> The one attachment has variable depth control so you can cut as long or as short as they want it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a professional tool, but for the occasional touch ups it works quite well.  </li>
            <li> : uses the same charger as other Norelco products - if you have a recent shaver, it should use the same port</li>
            <li> My old Philips hair clipper (previous model QC5170)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husbands hair for years, he only gets a buzz and we&#x27;re too cheap to pay someone else to do it!  </li>
            <li> It hold the charge for a very long time and it comes with many different cutting length settings.</li>
            <li> I should note that I typically clip my hair to either 3/8&amp;#34; or 1/4&amp;#34;, have wavy Italian hair, and have been cutting my own hair for 6 years now.</li>
            <li> Over the years my son and I have used several other types and brands of clippers with mixed results.</li>
            <li> These clippers are light-years ahead of any other clippers that we&#x27;ve used before.haircut (a short buzz cut), it&#x27;s not really necessary.</li>
            <li> decent, I usually get about 3 cuts out of a charge&lt;br</li>
            <li> The most I know about hair cutting for men is&lt;br</li>
            <li> Run&#x27;s through hair without a stumble.</li>
            <li> I am waiting a long time for this deal.</li>
            <li> And the battery lasts long time.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long.</li>
            <li> It can be used for a long time afer being recharged.</li>
            <li> Not for long hair.</li>
            <li> Lets face it - you don&#x27;t always have time to get to the barber shop when your hairline is a tad long.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t take long to charge (out of the box anyway, they probably had a partial charge already) and the charge seems to last.</li>
            <li> The blades and rotating head are both pretty nice, but the \\&quot;guards\\&quot; are absolutely terrible.  </li>
            <li> , I should point out that my hair only is a half inch long when needing cut, and I like to cut it back to about 1/8th of an inch.</li>
            <li> initial issue I noticed is that it&#x27;s quite easy to inadvertently adjust the length of your cut, while you&#x27;re cutting your hair.  </li>
            <li> This Norelco has terrific battery life (weeks, and I use it every day);  the Remington had to be recharged every other day.  </li>
            <li> other clippers would occasionally nick my ears or curved areas of the head, haven&#x27;t seen that yet with these.</li>
            <li> With the QC5570/40 I keep guessing wrong the first time which direction to twist the adjuster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something about the standard comb teeth on the QC5570/40 are strangely different.</li>
            <li> The differences in the 13 settings were miniscule, and I felt that there were not enough choices on hair length due to</li>
            <li> love this thing but feel sorry for the barbers!</li>
            <li> Plus, I have dropped the other one and was looking to replace it with the same model.</li>
            <li> Well like other reviewers note, it only lasts for about a year.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts very long on one charge.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> A few times it would click to a different location so you would have to put it back.</li>
            <li> My dear hubby is in the military, keeps it short, uses it every other day.  </li>
            <li> it spent a much long delivery time to get it.</li>
            <li> I did not want another $20 junk clipper - clunky, loose, noisy, unfinished, short-lived.  </li>
            <li> but the instruction is a little bit confusing, i dont know how to use it at first, and it takes me lots of time to figure it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product is receiving some negative reviews, but I had a positive experience upon the initial use.</li>
            <li> Teardrop shape feels awkward to hold in hand -- easy to drop.</li>
            <li> At a younger age he was scared of the buzzing so this would have been pretty scary for him.  </li>
            <li> My last two corded Wahls snagged a lot and wore out in less than a year each despite maintaining them per the instructions.</li>
            <li> The previous model lasted 4 years of daily use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last year and a half to cut my boys&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> The same as a previous models.</li>
            <li> It is ok, a little awkward to get use to..  </li>
            <li> I did think it vibrated a bit more in my hand than the one we have now, but it wasn&#x27;t so bad that I&#x27;d stop using it.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; was to stop and clear out the blades at least 4x over the course of a hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> The rotating head makes it so much easier to get the proper angle for cutting my hair on the sides and the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old one lasted me for at least 5 years without a hiccup.</li>
            <li> I have seen many reviews which people have complained that the two plastic attachable heads are flimsy and don&#x27;t give a proper cut however, they have worked well for me and don&#x27;t seem to bend if you don&#x27;t put a crazy amount of pressure on them.</li>
            <li> My husband has straight and thin but dense Filipino hair, and he reported no snags when I used these to cut his hair.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.....</li>
            <li> Then again, it&#x27;s not much of a risk considering the price.</li>
            <li> They do not provide an even cut, they do not fit will on the clippers, and they only go up to length 5.  </li>
            <li> Price worked out to about $35, shipped to Canada; pays for itself after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Decent motor, minimal number of second-runs during hair-cuts, length uniformity preserved in angles</li>
            <li> While the motor is stronger than those found in bargain units, it lacks the power and speed for thicker and longer hair and tends to leave a few strays here and there even after multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was rough and hurt.</li>
            <li> This one is harder and you need to be careful using it with mirrored reflection.  </li>
            <li> This will pay for itself in a few short months.</li>
            <li> my grandson likes it, sharp cutting with less noise, no code.&lt;br /&gt;Changing angle as I wish, makes easy to cut hair on side of my head.</li>
            <li> This is a decent, but not great, clipper.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Beats all other by miles.</li>
            <li> I like it and recommend it to other customs ~~</li>
            <li> i bought these clippers for my husband after using various ones over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> i like this purchase, but as other reviewer put, why dont philips throw in a bag or something?</li>
            <li> THANMY OTHER ONE</li>
            <li> I found other units give a tighter shave</li>
            <li> Like all my other Philips Norelco products, this is a quality winner.</li>
            <li> Even so, it only takes me about 8 minutes start to finish, and it saves me from having to spend money at the barber shop and suffering through unbearable small talk with people</li>
            <li> Why other clipper manufacturers haven&#x27;t figured this out is a mystery to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other hair clippers that we&#x27;ve owned included a plastic storage container that held the clippers, battery charger, combs, and other accessories.</li>
            <li> Other hair clippers that we&#x27;ve owned included a plastic storage container that held the clippers, battery charger, combs, and other accessories.</li>
            <li> These clippers are light-years ahead of any other clippers that we&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> First the Philips has a casing made of very thin plastic.</li>
            <li> Philips had discontinued this model, DA&#x27;s and would only replace it with something that was not suitable for my needs.</li>
            <li> weight of the cutter is noticeably less than the other cutters we&#x27;ve used, yet the cut seems to be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The guards would snap into the rotating wheel, but when you rotate the wheel, the guards would not move up and down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s sharp, user-friendly, and efficient!</li>
            <li> It is very light so that you will not feel tired when cutting hair for half an hour.</li>
            <li> Not very strong but for trim, it works.</li>
            <li> If you want less then 1/2 inch this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I owned the previous version of this trimmer, and it lasted a year or so before the tabs broke off the plastic</li>
            <li> I bought these  clippers to replace the previous model of Norelco clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with two attachments that allow you to go from less than a 1 blade all the way up to a 5.  </li>
            <li> typical clipper comes with guards that you snap on.  </li>
            <li> This is less than ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great...easy to use can&#x27;t mess up your hair...</li>
            <li> minor negative comment:</li>
            <li> minor negative comment:</li>
            <li> I used file to round sharp edges on &#x27;precision&#x27; comb!  </li>
            <li> After a few tries, it will get adjusting again, but I am afraid with more usage, the guards will become useless.</li>
            <li> up to 30 mm hair clip rang, that better&lt;br /&gt;But little bit too noise</li>
            <li> /&gt;By pressing against the guide when using it, the cutting level dropped to the shortest length and made a deep gash down the middle of my head.  </li>
            <li> After the third use the cutters were seemingly dull, would hardly cut at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its rotating head makes it very convenient for cutting the backside without someone else&#x27;s help.</li>
            <li> This beats having several different attachments to obtain the varying cutting lengths.</li>
            <li> this raises the guard (like focusing on an old fashioned camera) - it is not entirely intuitive and I was really frustrated for a while.</li>
            <li> this raises the guard (like focusing on an old fashioned camera) - it is not entirely intuitive and I was really frustrated for a while.  </li>
            <li> Some of the features are not important, but it does cut hair well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago and it has done what I needed without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then there are the two hair attachments, which are made of thin plastic, that look very fragile.</li>
            <li> Seems to cut well enough for my baby-fine, thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> a) Conair headshaver (orange/grey, round body</li>
            <li> suggestion is look for a another unit because I just wasted $35.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s missing from this is a bag or case to hold and protect the clipper and attachments.</li>
            <li> I believe Philips/Norelco could find a way to design the item so that the battery can be replaced and the otherwise functional clipper wouldn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let someone lose with this unless they are very sharp, or they can read and assimilate instructions!</li>
            <li> And to make matters worse, I have to push down much harder in order to get</li>
            <li> , it started cutting out several times during a single hair cut, when fully charged.  </li>
            <li> would say the only negative is knowing what length you are cutting at, as it is a bit fluid with the settings.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t slow down at all.</li>
            <li> buy Remington&#x27;s garbage , which has lower price but can only be used for a few times then get broken !</li>
            <li> It-Yourself\\&quot; as I need very little help from my wife for trimming the neck hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money, also manufacturer did not honor warranty</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one con with the Norelco is that when you swivel the head (which you will do each use) if you grab it wrong you will swivel the height ring also, resulting in a different height setting, resulting in...</li>
            <li> I use it with the small hair attachment at the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re left with a fairly useless device.</li>
            <li> Cutting head on this clipper doesn&#x27;t seem as well made as my old one like this.</li>
            <li> Insulate battery ends by covering with tape and/or place battery in a small plastic bag...</li>
            <li> Rotating head is useless; human hand already has all angles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how.  </li>
            <li> clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past have had an attached cable, this has none</li>
            <li> trimmer is small, and the flexibile head makes for something that you can hold, twist, turn, and use by yourself, either standing in the bathroom in front of a mirror or with a small hand held mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure that this would cut hair.  </li>
            <li> Without it this feels like a single-purpose tool, and in my complicated world those just don&#x27;t serve as well as something that will accomplish multiple functions.</li>
            <li> It looks weird with hair all the same length</li>
            <li> Removing the hair there is very awkward, because I have to look through two mirrors and reach around at funny angles.  </li>
            <li> now the slight problem (it is very hard to explain</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear that hair clippings can enter the body behind the cutting blades, a major annoyance with other clippers, causing the motor to slow down and requiring a difficult cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It is cordless and convenient when you are cutting the hair at the back of head.</li>
            <li> There are 2 attachments and multiple length settings to use with either attachment, for a variety of cutting lengths and styles.</li>
            <li> The rotating head just doesn&#x27;t overcome the advantages in power and cutting speed the bigger clippers provide.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hesitate going through thick hair.</li>
            <li> of power to zip through thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I am sad it doesn&#x27;t work anymore due to just a little comb being broken.  </li>
            <li> So a lot of small movable plastic parts!  </li>
            <li> The part that threw me was how to increase the cutting length - the instructions seemed weak to me on this count, but I finally figured it out.</li>
            <li> The part that threw me was how to increase the cutting length - the instructions seemed weak to me on this count, but I finally figured it out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the cutting heads once already and probably will do again to keep shaving as long as the battery lasts.</li>
            <li> You can leave it set straight, but for cutting around the ears or side of the head, you can twist the cutting head to the angle you want.</li>
            <li> Now I can just take this bad boy anywhere and not have to hassle with a cord getting in the way and keeping me from doing it outside in the summer.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use the other one it comes with) and can adjust the hair cutting length without changing combs.</li>
            <li> item is that the locking mechanism to hold the length of cut for hair is a bit weak</li>
            <li> ad surname was absent - caused massive confusion - experience was POOR!!!</li>
            <li> I accidentally turn it a few time while cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> so I was not happy.</li>
            <li> Poor construction:  </li>
            <li> The solution was to plug it in to the charger for a few seconds, when it would recussitate, then work for another 20 seconds of cutting or so.  </li>
            <li> I resented crazy design, sharp edges, awkward grip shape and angles.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to risk a bad haircut at least I&#x27;m not paying someone else to do it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of getting cordless hair clippers.</li>
            <li> The wearing out part I can deal with since I save so much by cutting my hair myself but the snagging really annoyed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hit or Miss or some spots, not perfect it yet...</li>
            <li> It makes it easier at difficult angles.</li>
            <li> Leaves tufts of uncut hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> The material it&#x27;s made of doesn&#x27;t seem to be of the highest quality and it&#x27;s difficult to remove and install the attachments.</li>
            <li> This makes the product useless for doing any haircut that is not a buzz cut.  </li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> It does a very poor job of cutting.</li>
            <li> Manual is incomplete, badly written, and wrong - even numbers on picture disagree with numbers in text.</li>
            <li> Cuts well, but awkward to handle for me.</li>
            <li> I was playing around with these clippers and forgot to re-check the cutting height...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any experience at all with cutting my hair myself, I always been to the hair salon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, I feel its way to awkward to hold and the rotating head is of no advantage.</li>
            <li> this model, the plastic guide does not lock in place, the guide flexes with pressure, and cutting level does not lock.  </li>
            <li> Grip and cutter are 3 cm apart, forcing user to reconcile the plane of holding with the plane of cutting.  </li>
            <li> The swivel head makes hair cutting a breeze.</li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting my hair every 12-14 days since 1990.</li>
            <li> The cutting head swivels through 270 degrees allowing&lt;br /&gt;Ovalldru</li>
            <li> No problems with cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> like that the cutting head swivels 180-degrees</li>
            <li> However, the materials of the accesories are really bad.</li>
            <li> The materials are really bad, and you can not find a replacement anywhere.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I hate manscaping.</li>
            <li> Hate hate hate.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality, terrible performance.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful! but the instruction is a little bit confusing, i dont know how to use it at first, and it takes me lots of time to figure it out. but overall it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> I like it for three reasons, the attachment is easy to adjust for cut height and exchange, the cutting head is rotatable , and the charge can hold for long time (easily 4-5 cuts per charge).</li>
            <li> nice little clipper does the job</li>
            <li> I bought this Philips Hair Clipper model QC5570/40 and it is better than the earlier model because these combs do not have springs which can break and render them useless. One hour to charge and comes all the attachments you will ever need to trim your hair. Philips Norelco make great products.</li>
            <li> It does a terrific job of cutting my hair and I am very satisfied.  The charging unit is also good.</li>
            <li> Delicate, easy to use</li>
            <li> well fit for my sons in 5.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these as my only hair cut but they are great for touching up my neck and keeping my curls in check between cuts.  I problably get my hair cut at the barber about half as much as I use to so they have certainly paid for themselves.  I have even used them on the dog to trim up his coat.</li>
            <li> my husband uses it every two weeks, he likes it</li>
            <li> I used it twice, and it can be washed by water.</li>
            <li> Cut my sons hair with this for the first time.  The clipper works great.  So far no cons.  It is loud so your child would have to be able to tolerate that.  my son is 2 now and he seemed to do fine with it.  At a younger age he was scared of the buzzing so this would have been pretty scary for him.  The hair cut looks better than other trimmers.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of getting cordless hair clippers. My last two corded Wahls snagged a lot and wore out in less than a year each despite maintaining them per the instructions. The wearing out part I can deal with since I save so much by cutting my hair myself but the snagging really annoyed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite surprised on my first haircut with these clippers that I did not feel any snags. It was also the quickest haircut I can remember giving myself. The comb has nice rounded edges rather than the sharp edges like on the Wahls which meant I wasn&#x27;t poking myself with the comb constantly, especially appreciated around my ears. The shape of the clippers is unusual but I got used to it quickly and I now actually prefer it to the more conventional shape on the Wahls. I should note that I typically clip my hair to either 3/8&amp;#34; or 1/4&amp;#34;, have wavy Italian hair, and have been cutting my own hair for 6 years now. My husband has straight and thin but dense Filipino hair, and he reported no snags when I used these to cut his hair. The Wahls constantly snagged on his hair, much more than on mine, so it was a welcome improvement for him as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this thing cost the same or barely more than the Wahl corded clipper kits yet performs better and is cordless is pretty amazing. I really like how I only have to keep track of one comb (I don&#x27;t use the other one it comes with) and can adjust the hair cutting length without changing combs. It also used the same charging cord as my Norelco beard trimmer which is handy. There is a significant caveat to these clippers that may make them unsuitable for some people: the maximum hair length is only 5/8&amp;#34;. This is not a problem for me or my husband but it may be for you. Other than that I cannot find any fault yet in these clippers. I just wish I had found them years ago!</li>
            <li> i always do my own haircut and when I upgrade to this clipper it only cost me 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s sharp, user-friendly, and efficient!</li>
            <li> Have owned two of the Remington versions of this and this Norelco unit is way way better.  This Norelco has terrific battery life (weeks, and I use it every day);  the Remington had to be recharged every other day.  The Norelco cuts better (the cutting blade is parallel to your head surface, like a barber&#x27;s clipper would be);  the Remington cutter is vertical and therefore isn&#x27;t as effective. This Norelco feels like quality in your hand, whereas the Remington feels cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one con with the Norelco is that when you swivel the head (which you will do each use) if you grab it wrong you will swivel the height ring also, resulting in a different height setting, resulting in...</li>
            <li> Works great! I like that it has finer length controls like the 1.5mm.</li>
            <li> My Daughter cuts my hair and she loves using this.  - Used it &amp;#62; 10 times and still on initial charge.</li>
            <li> The best and fast clipper I ever bought. Works great, easy cleanup and no cords. I&#x27;m 100% satisfied. I fully urge you to get it!&lt;br /&gt;#awesome sauce</li>
            <li> It is ok, a little awkward to get use to..  Some of the features are not important, but it does cut hair well.</li>
            <li> Very good！it&#x27;s convenient for me. i like it.</li>
            <li> I used this razor to trim my beard this morning and it was fantastic.  I used to use scissors to do the job and it would always look hacked...I&#x27;d have to have a barber even it up later.  With the Norelco rasor I was able to do a fast (5 minutes!) job with a very even look to it.  Glad I bought this!!</li>
            <li> Must take a little more practice.  Cuts well, but awkward to handle for me.</li>
            <li> This is our 3rd model of the same hair trimmer.  My dear hubby is in the military, keeps it short, uses it every other day.  The only reason we are on the third generation is when it finally poops out (and trust me, as much as he uses it, it lasts 5 years!)they have upgraded it to a newer model.  Highly recommend for those needing to save money on home hair cuts...easy to use and very affordable!!</li>
            <li> very easy to do my own haircuts</li>
            <li> I decided to give this clipper a try after reading many good reviews online. It didn&#x27;t disappoint me! For someone who has never cut his own hair in his entire life, I found it extremely easy to use.  The 180 degree rotating head makes it so much easier to cut the hair. It truly is \\&quot;Do-It-Yourself\\&quot; as I need very little help from my wife for trimming the neck hair. I probably could have done it myself if I am not that picky. ;-) Overall, I am very please with the product.</li>
            <li> Great product....light weight.....precise.....wish I&#x27;d purchased this a long time ago as I&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for my old Vidal Sassoon palm clipper.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Fits curved sufaces!</li>
            <li> It did its job......I wouldn&#x27;t trust it doing by myself. Hit or Miss or some spots, not perfect it yet...IT&#x27;S OKAY !</li>
            <li> Worked very well.  Super sharp blades</li>
            <li> Cuts well and very efficient cutter</li>
            <li> Only con is that even the longest setting is still quite short</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for a few years now and have owned one other harclipper (a Conair purchased from Macy&#x27;s that lasted nearly 3 years for around $20).  I purchased this a few months ago and it has done what I needed without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other clippers would occasionally nick my ears or curved areas of the head, haven&#x27;t seen that yet with these.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the QC5570/40 to replace a 3 year old Norelco QC5170/60, only because one of the teeth on the comb had broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The height adjustment is easier on the QC5170/60 because of the simple sliding adjuster. With the QC5570/40 I keep guessing wrong the first time which direction to twist the adjuster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something about the standard comb teeth on the QC5570/40 are strangely different. When using the trimmer, the teeth feel like they are a lot longer, but putting them next to my old ones, they are only about a 1/16th of an inch longer. I thought I was going to start breaking them right away the first time I used it. I had a lot of trouble getting a feel for how to push the trimmer on my head in order to get a smooth even cut (even though the QC5570/40 and QC5170/60 are almost identical), and I felt I had to keep it at a very specific angle to cut correctly, while not putting too much pressure on the teeth so as not to break them. And to make matters worse, I have to push down much harder in order to get an even and short cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QC5570/40 also cannot cut hair as short as the QC5170-60 with the standard comb. The shortest #1 setting gives a cut similar to the #2 setting the QC5170/60 does. I always used #1 and #2 settings with the old trimmer, and now I can’t get as short of a cut/trim with the standard comb attachment. To experiment, I tried using the precision comb only to end up with a shorter cut than I am used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the lithium-ion battery is great! Charges fast, and it feels like it provides a lot more power to the trimmer than the QC5170/60 has when using the battery only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could get the same cut like I did with the QC5170/60, and the comb teeth would not break, I would give the QC5570/40 5 big stars.</li>
            <li> Love this product...it saves my time and money...i use it every week..would recommend this norelco to everyone, good price too..</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.....didn&#x27;t care for having to charge the clippers. the clippers was light in weigh, so I sent them back.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair cut from this trimmer.  Very easy to use and cuts without pulling on hair.  Have cut my hair at a number 1 setting every week for the last three weeks and the battery is still charged up from the initial charging.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric wired clippers for as long as I can remember, but I was very impressed with this especially for the price, It is very easy to use and cut my hair just as good as any expensive barbers equipment, I have been having a pretty good experience lately with all Philips Norelco products.</li>
            <li> Had an older version of this and loved it. At first, the rotating head seems gimmicky, but it really does come in handy. The old one finally died after several years of service (postmortem revealed hair clogged up the metal contacts in the rotary head - probably could have fixed it). This newer version is more powerful and longer lasting (Li ion vs. NiCa battery) than the old one. It also charges quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m anticipating many years and hair cuts with my new clippers.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer works fantastic. I made the mistake of ordering this not long after I cut my hair. I had to wait around a month or more to use it. Used it yesterday and wow. Run&#x27;s through hair without a stumble. It didn&#x27;t hesitate going through thick hair. Just VROOOOM!!!!! Turn the rotary dial to the desired hair length...push the button and that&#x27;s it. This is the first time I&#x27;ve done my hair where I didn&#x27;t have to go over it 4 or 5 times to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss anything. The hair doesn&#x27;t clog inside the plastic hair guard. It just falls right out of it. I was smiling while this thing was running.  I even shaved my beard with it then ran a cheap disposable razor over it to finish it of. It did the job. I&#x27;ve been doing my own hair for a while and this is the most even haircut I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a really well spent $40. Excellent investment.</li>
            <li> I think it is a basic hair clipper before I get it. It surprised me when I get it.&lt;br /&gt;It have many functions to make my hair delightful. What the most important is it can be washed directly by water.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Best hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used and I have used many.  Easy to use and cuts even.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I USED IT TONIGHT FOR THE SECOND TIME.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Nice looks to be a nice device for shorter hair.  I sent back because the settings were to short for my taste. Otherwise a quiet hair trimmer.  If you want less then 1/2 inch this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had clippers before.  These are just as good as some old Oster clippers I had, and this is cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of power to zip through thick hair.  Easy to use.  I did my own cut first, and had the wife do a bit of clean up along the neck and behind the ears after.  Easy process.  The turning head is great.  I&#x27;m sure if I wasn&#x27;t cutting my hair over a trashcan in the driveway, I could have done the whole thing in a mirror, but didn&#x27;t want to clean up.  The adjustments are different than the traditional clip on  1,2,3 guards.  I think I went a bit too short first go, but it all grows back, so no real harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the only negative is knowing what length you are cutting at, as it is a bit fluid with the settings.  I think once I&#x27;ve had a chance to play with this a bit more, it won&#x27;t be a real issue, but it did result in a very short buzz my first go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super stoked on these with the price paid, after coupon, and how they operate.  Sold 4.5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very good clipper, I have done my first self hair cut yesterday, looks very good!!&lt;br /&gt;Now my friends are all asking me how did you do this by yourself, it took me only 5 minutes, now I can do it every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;No longer worry about the hot summer!!</li>
            <li> IT IS REALLY GOOD AND IT WORKS AMAZING. I AM DOING MY HAIR CUT MYSELF IT IS SAVES TIME AND MONEY</li>
            <li> This haircut is very good, you can wash the body, head can be rotated 180 degrees, that is a little short caliper, the longest only to 15mm, if able to 30mm fine.</li>
            <li> I grooming by my selft and save my money at the same time. Is wonderfull be your own stylis&lt;br /&gt;Great item for chrismas gift .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from china, this very good!!!</li>
            <li> if you like to have a self cut and short one .. this is the best .. I tried other products but this worth the money&lt;br /&gt;plus you can use it corded and cordless</li>
            <li> I love cutting my own hair now. It&#x27;s so convenient and quick. Battery life is also very good. Lasts me months before I need to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;Does only hear hair... doesn&#x27;t trim beards.&lt;br /&gt;The turning head is very helpful in reaching all head areas conveniently. Just feels like combing hair...</li>
            <li> Over the years my son and I have used several other types and brands of clippers with mixed results. I wanted to find something that would work for him to do his own trims. When I looked online at reviews I found that this one made the marks. We received it today. We charged it straight away, as he was in need of a trim. It charged super quick. This was the first time that my son has ever cut his own hair. It looks wonderful and was super easy! It held the strength of the charge the whole time. It didn&#x27;t slow down at all. The fact that it is cordless makes it much easier to use as well. This was THE BEST clipper we have ever used. It didn&#x27;t grab or rip at his hair. In his words &amp;#34;It&#x27;s like butter.&amp;#34; The fact that it has a swivel head is also a plus. It makes it easier at difficult angles. There is nothing that we don&#x27;t like about this product. It is nice to  get a quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> it is good when sufficient power is stored. When power is low, it sometimes makes noisy sound. one thing to remain, even with the longest scale, it is still really short after the cut</li>
            <li> Seems to be a nice design when first pulling it out of the package. That&#x27;s the only good thing I can say about it.&lt;br /&gt;I should have returned it immediately while I still had the chance, but thought maybe I was using it incorrectly. It does a very poor job of cutting. Leaves tufts of uncut hair everywhere. After the third use the cutters were seemingly dull, would hardly cut at all.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I should point out that my hair only is a half inch long when needing cut, and I like to cut it back to about 1/8th of an inch. Terrible quality, terrible performance. My wife just now gave up in the middle of trying to cut my hair, grabbed her coat and headed for WalMart to buy something that will work. Even their cheapie will do better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Look elsewhere unless you like throwing your money away.</li>
            <li> my wife used it to cut my hair,very good,very easy to use,I love it ,twice a month,it deserves the price</li>
            <li> I had an earlier model from this manufacturer which did a very good job. This model has more refinements, the shape of it, the adjustment in the height of the cut and can be rinsed under water. Does a great job!</li>
            <li> Warning, make sure you check the hair length setting before starting. I was playing around with these clippers and forgot to re-check the cutting height... so I had very short hair for a month. These work well and do not pull your hair like some others do. I recommend these</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised. I use it with the small hair attachment at the lowest setting. It&#x27;s light and very manoeuvrable. The rotating head is a nice feature, which is helping me to cut my hair myself.  I&#x27;ve never own a hair clipper before, this is my first one. Prior my purchase of this Philips Norelco Do-It-Yourself hair clipper I didn&#x27;t have any experience at all with cutting my hair myself, I always been to the hair salon. Without any experience I was able the first time to cut 95% of my hair myself. My girlfriend helped me to finish the remaining 5%. The second time I was able to cut 100% of my hair without missing any spot (with the help of a hand mirror). So this product really works.  Now the huge downside is the fragility of the clipper. There are indeed so many movable/replaceable parts that I&#x27;m wondering if this product will last long. This is not the type of sturdy Whal clipper my hairdresser uses in her salon, the kind that she could drop on the tile floor without any damage. First the Philips has a casing made of very thin plastic. Then the blade assembly is clipped in a &amp;#34;blade socket&amp;#34; which is clipped on the main assembly (so three parts clipped together). The blade assembly and the &amp;#34;blade socket&amp;#34; rotate 180 degrees. Then there are the two hair attachments, which are made of thin plastic, that look very fragile. They clipped in the main assembly and there&#x27;s a rotating dial to adjust the cut length. So a lot of small movable plastic parts!  Does this product works: Yes! Will it last many years: I&#x27;m afraid not!  MAY 2015 UPDATE : My clipper is still working fine, and no parts has broken yet. The battery lasts very long on one charge. I&#x27;m still very happy.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best clipper I ever had. Beats all other by miles. Very silent and no pulling of hair.</li>
            <li> To those who want to buy a Hair Clipper , I highly recommend this Philips Norelco QC5570 ! It has High quality, and well designed !&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy Remington&#x27;s garbage , which has lower price but can only be used for a few times then get broken ! You are warned !</li>
            <li> cliper,hair, hand-operated,non-electric, for any use (incl. animal shearing)&lt;br /&gt;cliper,hair, hand-operated,non-electric, for any use (incl. animal shearing)&lt;br /&gt;cliper,hair, hand-operated,non-electric, for any use (incl. animal shearing)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t make it threw the first hair cut don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money, also manufacturer did not honor warranty</li>
            <li> This has paid for itself already. Much easier to cut hair with the rotating clippers. Charges in a couple hours and the adjustable attachments make it easy to cut and do fades. Small and lightweight for easy use without tiring the arms.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of Norelco electronics, and everything always works like it should and lasts for many years.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver easily hold a charge for 4-5 shaves. I use it once a week to shave my head.&lt;br /&gt;Very convenient, small and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Very good  seller, also the good!</li>
            <li> This clipper is very useful and easy to use. It cuts the hair well and the charge holds as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great hair clipper! Very easy to use and configure. Love the rotating feature as it allows me to cut places where I normally can not reach with a typical clipper</li>
            <li> 给男朋友理发，50块一次，不在我这理就打，成本马上收回。&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. If DIY, your finished style totally depends on the shape of your head. In a word, you&#x27;d better have a girlfriend to help you for a better style.</li>
            <li> it works great it is my second one the other one was damaged other wise it would still be serving me for over 5 years</li>
            <li> Used this product for several months and I love it.  It cuts very well, it can be cleaned under water, and the batteries last for several cuts.  This can also be used while in the charger if batteries are getting low.  The haircut length can be very easily adjusted with the dial, and I did not have to remove it yet.  It is very light weight, and I did not have to use the rotating head feature yet as it fits very well in the hand and I don&#x27;t mind moving my hand instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None</li>
            <li> My old Philips hair clipper (previous model QC5170) after three years doesn&#x27;t work when blade is turned maximum to the left side, so I bought new model which was QC5570, but it has problem with cut regulation, it can unnoticeable skip down when you cutting hairs (there is no pentameter lock for cut regulation like in QC5170 where you need press small red button to change it), so even if it cuts hairs very good, you can cut them more than you planned before.&lt;br /&gt;If it will has solid lock for blade regulation it could be perfect hair clipper.</li>
            <li> Balding man&#x27;s dream come true. I&#x27;m over the fact that I&#x27;m going bald but not quite ready to do the full shave. This lets me keep it nice, short, and neat on daily/weekly basis in my own bathroom.</li>
            <li> Very convenient, especially if partner is willing to invest the time with you for easiest use. Cutting height readily adjusted, so simple and relatively quick grooming, particularly for those of us with short hair.</li>
            <li> great love it saves me 20 bucks every month.</li>
            <li> Very good but only for short length adjustments. I tried max length still looks short for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your cut short length hair this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> Cuts good, good battery life. Using it on 3 or 4 for a short overall cut. Haven&#x27;t tried it for anything more demanding.</li>
            <li> I am waiting a long time for this deal. It is very good item for doing hair cutting yourself. It is very light so that you will not feel tired when cutting hair for half an hour. It is cordless and convenient when you are cutting the hair at the back of head.</li>
            <li> Love this clipper, cordless, convenient and dependable.  Will keep using this brand and model as long as I am able to purchase it!</li>
            <li> Good build quality, feels nice in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;Needs to get use to, but looks promising.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> it is a nice tool! The design is reasonable and convenient.  I like it and recommend it to other customs ~~</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for about three years now. The swivel head makes these clippers much easier to use and I love the cordless option.</li>
            <li> The machine is working really good, but I was expecting it to come with more parts, to control different parts of the hair</li>
            <li> i bought these clippers for my husband after using various ones over the past 10 years. these are without doubt the best hair clippers he has ever used, they cut clean and even are very light to hold, i would recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li> It took me about 1/2 way through the first cut to get the hang of it but I love it now.  I keep a buzz cut and the guard adjust just right.  Since it takes me about 1/2 the time as my old wahl beard trimmer I cut my hair more often.  Charges quickly and holds charge well.  I cut my hair about twice a week and have only charged it twice in 5 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cuts a hair. Working with battary and with cable. Charging takes about 30 minutes and this more then enough for clipping.</li>
            <li> I just used these clippers today for the first time and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. They don&#x27;t take long to charge (out of the box anyway, they probably had a partial charge already) and the charge seems to last. It only takes me about 20 minutes to cut my hair because I do it the same length all over but they seem like they would have lasted the hour as stated. My only issue with these is that you can&#x27;t really cut with them at any sort of an angle, you have to keep the flush against your head for them to cut to the desired length. This is just something I have to get used to with these clippers being a different kind and brand than my previous ones, it&#x27;s nothing against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to disassemble to clean and you can just run the pieces under water to clean them. I had no problems figuring out the adjustment system on these to change the length and to rotate the blades. They are very easy to use and the ability to be able to turn the blades is more useful that you would think. I was used to just doing everything with normal clippers and didn&#x27;t think the rotating blades would be that big of a deal, but they make it much easier. I would definitely recommend these if you are someone who cuts their own hair. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Battery operated clipper with good power, last long.&lt;br /&gt;Even my grandson likes it, sharp cutting with less noise, no code.&lt;br /&gt;Changing angle as I wish, makes easy to cut hair on side of my head.</li>
            <li> I like it. It does fit my demand.</li>
            <li> Works great. Stays in place and gets the job done. I would only improve the motor and have more.hair length settings.</li>
            <li> This is one product that I had been waiting for. Its rotating head makes it very convenient for cutting the backside without someone else&#x27;s help.</li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying that this item is not professional quality and it is not meant to be. My rating is based on my expectations in relation to its cost.  I think it does a terrific job. The built-in adjustable guard and the ability to swivel the cutter are really handy. If you&#x27;re cutting your own hair, the swivel feature is handy as it allows you to reach all areas with ease. The power is good enough for me, and it lasts at least several cuts.  I recharge it after three cuts but it may last longer. The cuts are even. So why not give five stars?  The build quality could stand improvement. It works great. I&#x27;m just not sure how long it will last. Then again, it&#x27;s not much of a risk considering the price. I&#x27;m satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> The devise is fantastic, not much noisy, long battery life on a single charge. I recommend this for everyone to purchase.</li>
            <li> For the price this works well. It&#x27;s convenient since it&#x27;s cordless. The material it&#x27;s made of doesn&#x27;t seem to be of the highest quality and it&#x27;s difficult to remove and install the attachments. If you&#x27;re just looking for something that does its job and just works then this is for you. For the price it can&#x27;t be beat. Sure, it would be nice if everything would look as high quality as an iPhone or other Apple products, but then it would cost a lot more; and for just clipping my hair this works well at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Best - best - best of all time.&lt;br /&gt;I will be telling all my friends about it.&lt;br /&gt;My expectations were high on purchasing this product, expectations were surpassed by eons.&lt;br /&gt;Thanking you in advance.&lt;br /&gt;Warmest regards&lt;br /&gt;Dallas</li>
            <li> This should be a very useful review since I have had this for over 8 months now and feel comfortable actually scoring it.  This is used 1-2 times a week and on the lowest setting it can do (the buzz cut 1).  I did read some of the reviews prior to buying this and want to address the craftsmanship of the unit.  In my opinion this is made very well, the mechanism rotates with a satisfying click and does not feel cheap in anyway.  The protruding head/hair guard is probably the weakest link but has held up so far and I am not the most careful person.  its made of a translucent plastic which has survived some drops on tile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The likes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life&lt;br /&gt;rotating head is a huge help once you get used to it&lt;br /&gt;feels nice in the hand and easy to maneuver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dislikes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel it does not cut as short as my old corded model of a different brand&lt;br /&gt;There is a tendency for this unit to need additional passes to cut all hairs</li>
            <li> i like this purchase, but as other reviewer put, why dont philips throw in a bag or something? also the guide is only 15mm maximum. i want 30mm.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another Norelco tilt head and this one is not as nice.  It works okay but the blades will catch on my hair much more often than the older model.</li>
            <li> Works for me and has saved me a ton at the barber.  I give myself a buzz cut every week now so I stay trimmed and neat all the time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s very easy to use, from now I will never cost hair cut :) . I Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Teardrop shape feels awkward to hold in hand -- easy to drop. Seems to cut well enough for my baby-fine, thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only for 1/2&amp;#34; or shorter haircuts. Battery seems to charge okay and last long enough.  --jm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never have to worry about going to the barber again.  Outstanding design and easy to use.  Once you master moving it with your wrist you&#x27;ll never have to fear looking shaggy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like short hair that is.  This clipper is for very short hair styles only.  I use the longest setting on top, let it grow-out while using the detailing guard to keep the sides and back clean and tapered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering another one soon.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to cut own hair. Swivel head is the deal maker. No need to change heads any more</li>
            <li> It is very useful when I take a long trip like on two week cruise. Not very strong but for trim, it works. And the battery lasts long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best clipper for me to cut my own hair</li>
            <li> I bought this hair clipper for my dad. It is good and cut hair well. Love it and very good...</li>
            <li> I had a very simple complaint/rejection:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longest haircut possible based on this product&#x27;s settings was 5/8&amp;#34; -- I need closer to an inch.</li>
            <li> this product is a quality. it is well built and designed and easy to use. I bought second one for my bold dad, he loves it too.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle to cut your own hair. It is washable which make it easy to clean and the battery last for reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Prior to getting these, I used corded clippers about once a week to shave my head.  Switching to a cordless unit has resulted in an improvement in convenience with no drop-off in performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are noticeably lighter than conventional clippers, but to be honest, I only cut my own hair, so fatigue has never been an issue. But the weight difference is clear, and I appreciate that it&#x27;s easier to handle because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They get as close to my scalp as my corded models. The shape is decent and sits in my hand comfortably.  Battery life has been fine and I&#x27;ve never run out of power mid-haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these since October and use them regularly. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> it is value for money and  very good quality product. Easy to rotate and the quality of product is very good.</li>
            <li> This product gives a good overall close haircut.  Especially works well for thicker heads of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick, and easy.  Follow the instructions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Product as described. Works great.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is by far the best I&#x27;ve  ever had</li>
            <li> I had a wahl clipper before because it was cheap, you get what you paid for.  So i decided to upgrade and read lots of good reviews on the norelco.  It is very easy on the hands and the 180 degree rotating joint def helps with clipping from all angles.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> This clipper fits so well in the palm of your hand that your fingers end up holding the ring that adjusts cut length. This becomes a problem when your hand motion of shaving around your head rotates the ring in a way that the cut length adjusts in mid-shave stroke. This results in a 1/8&amp;#34; stripe in the middle of your nice 1/2&amp;#34; fade and forces you to go with the dreaded buzz-it-all last resort option.</li>
            <li> this is a great product ! now i can cut my hair by myself!&lt;br /&gt;this is quite cute ! i love this clipper!</li>
            <li> Too convenient, I love it</li>
            <li> This hair clipper works great. It takes a bit of getting used to the rotational head at first.&lt;br /&gt;One item is that the locking mechanism to hold the length of cut for hair is a bit weak&lt;br /&gt;and could be tighter, but generally it works fine. It&#x27;s a quiet clipper with a low buzz sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper was offered with a discount through the Philips website and link to Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;which made it even more attractive from the cost standpoint.</li>
            <li> Loved that it&#x27;s cordless and can swivel around. I&#x27;ve given myself two cuts so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with it is that it only can extend to 5/8 of an inch. I&#x27;m not a guy for the full on buzz so I have to be careful and get the scissors out for the top. Works great on the sides though!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item especially for the purpose to shave my own head and the rotating dead really does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;It was my first time and i found it pretty useful ; the product simply keeps its promises. A must-have for those who plan to shave their own heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mohamed K.</li>
            <li> Powerful&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;If could work up to 30 mm hair clip rang, that better&lt;br /&gt;But little bit too noise</li>
            <li> This is the kind of good quality stuff for good price. Philips has been making reliable things as I know and experienced.</li>
            <li> I love it !!! &amp;#60;3 love it so much, i have hair lost so need to streem shortly . used every 2 weeks, savevmy money</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers when they were on sale because I wanted to learn how to cut my own hair.  The blades and rotating head are both pretty nice, but the \\&quot;guards\\&quot; are absolutely terrible.  They do not provide an even cut, they do not fit will on the clippers, and they only go up to length 5.  This makes the product useless for doing any haircut that is not a buzz cut.  I just saw that Wahl clippers sell at a comparable price so I will be getting one of those kits and trashing these.</li>
            <li> I had the older model and it lasted for two years. Just tried this new one yesterday and it is great. I keep my hair short and it is great for cutting my own hair. It was already charged out of the box but charged it for an hour anyway. It seems a little more comfortable to hold than the older model and was very easy to use. Love it!</li>
            <li> Purchased earlier this year. Worked great for almost 8 months but recently the guide comb broke off two &amp;#34;blades.&amp;#34; This is just from normal use once a week. Also, it never seemed too reliable in staying on the correct setting. Fortunately I wanted it on the shortest place but for others that might be an additional concern. There&#x27;s no way to purchase a replacement guide comb so you&#x27;re left with a fairly useless device. Disappointing shortcoming on an otherwise great trimmer.</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE AND NEATER ANDFASTER THANMY OTHER ONE</li>
            <li> Great product, light and good design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great clipper for cutting someone&#x27;s else hair but not your own.  The battery lasts long.</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;m bald, and I use this to cut what&#x27;s left of my hair to a uniform, short length. This works quickly and easily, and the cut is amazingly even. A flashing light on the back lets you know when it needs charging and is fully charged. The on/off switch is a push button that is not accidentally turned off when you use the clipper. Great product.</li>
            <li> - I use it without a guard on face and head; cuts down to less than a day&#x27;s worth of growth.&lt;br /&gt;- Blades are sharp; one pass usually gets everything; no need to keep going over.&lt;br /&gt;- Blades are comfortable; without a guard, I have no irritation, no scrapes, even when applying pressure (for pesky neck hairs.)&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life is excellent; takes me about 8 minutes to do my face and head; can get at least 5 shaves in before recharging. (Also, it stops charging when fully charged, which is nice.)&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight; easy to hold; rotating handle is useful when shaving back of head.&lt;br /&gt;- Before this shaver, I owned/used: a) Conair headshaver (orange/grey, round body; it was OK; required multiple passes); b) Wahl Balding clippers (bulky, corded, ran hot, extremely sharp, often scraped head; promptly stopped using); c) Wahl basic clippers (stainless steel body, small, cordless, required multiple passes; blade head cracked after a year.)&lt;br /&gt;- Have been shaving my head for almost 4 years; would definitely recommend to anyone who cuts their own hair; will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;- Price worked out to about $35, shipped to Canada; pays for itself after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> price is nice and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. I used it twice so far and it performed well. Now I don&#x27;t have to pay the $20 I used to pay the hair stylist every 1.5 months.</li>
            <li> The hair length adjustment is too easy to turn. I accidentally turn it a few time while cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it to cut by myself. Easy and convenient operation, but the max length is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;Outlook is beautiful.</li>
            <li> It is well-designed, user-friendly, but the user need to be very careful when using it without any combs, or it would make bald spots on your head.:)</li>
            <li> Good overall. Easy to install and use.&lt;br /&gt;Worth a buy for the price they offer it for. I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product is receiving some negative reviews, but I had a positive experience upon the initial use. It is cordless, not heavy and worked well. It takes a few minutes to get used to operating the device, so it is best to take things cautiously. Patience is key! Yes, the product is sealed and you cannot replace the battery in the future, but I plan to simply reorder the product when that day comes.</li>
            <li> As a frequent hair cutter I know what I like and the QC5570 are not to my liking. I shave my head about twice a week so I like a close shave with no guard on the unit.&lt;br /&gt;First I found other units give a tighter shave so I was not happy. I tried an old unit and it still cut off a little more. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong no one would ever notice since its really cm but its something.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I feel its way to awkward to hold and the rotating head is of no advantage. A few times it would click to a different location so you would have to put it back. With the offset head and bulky handle its just doesn&#x27;t feel right in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Last the guards feel very flimsy. Mine are not broken as I rarely use them but I imagine after some prolonged use they might snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is look for a another unit because I just wasted $35.</li>
            <li> very good, I love it.</li>
            <li> delivery wasn&#x27;t properly labelled - my name ad surname was absent - caused massive confusion - experience was POOR!!!</li>
            <li> pretty cool, I can easily do haircut by myself with it</li>
            <li> I love this hair clipper. I was using a corded Wahl trimmer that had me tethered to certain locations in and around the house to get the deed done. Now I can just take this bad boy anywhere and not have to hassle with a cord getting in the way and keeping me from doing it outside in the summer. Powerful enough to cut through my hair in one pass and holds a charge long enough for multiple haircuts before needing a recharge. I cant believe it took me this long to finally buy a cordless hair clipper.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use. The clip is smooth, the most important thing is qc5570 does not block with my rough hair.</li>
            <li> I owned the previous version of this trimmer, and it lasted a year or so before the tabs broke off the plastic guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this model, the plastic guide does not lock in place, the guide flexes with pressure, and cutting level does not lock.  On top of all that, the &amp;#34;swivel direction&amp;#34; feature adds an additional part that can move accidentally when using.&lt;br /&gt;By pressing against the guide when using it, the cutting level dropped to the shortest length and made a deep gash down the middle of my head.  I had to give myself a military-length shave to make the rest of the head match, then I threw this cheap toy into the trash.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my original for this one. Philips had discontinued this model, DA&#x27;s and would only replace it with something that was not suitable for my needs. I found a suitable replacement through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent all around.  Easy to use and powerful and cordless!</li>
            <li> Works very good, I use this to cut my hair short. It is simple.</li>
            <li> gift, so told it was good</li>
            <li> Works great...easy to use can&#x27;t mess up your hair...</li>
            <li> Cutting head on this clipper doesn&#x27;t seem as well made as my old one like this. It is lighter weight and but harder for me to hold because of new design shape. Only time will tell if it holds up as well as the old one. It still worked very well, I gave it to my brother.</li>
            <li> Really great clippers</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. I recommend. And shipping is also good.</li>
            <li> Great Clipper, very easy to use!</li>
            <li> purchased this to replace my 5 year old one that still works just fine but the comb attachment broke when I dropped it.  (a replacement comb was $3 less than a whole new unit so decided to just get a new unit)  This updated model has a sturdier comb attachment and gives me a smoother/more even self cut.  Like all my other Philips Norelco products, this is a quality winner.</li>
            <li> We have used an older version of these for years. The blades wore out so we finally bought this one. It feels great in my hands, and cuts through very thick hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> I really like the rotating head and the fact that it is cordless.  It is lightweight and efficient.  I do wish however that it had detachable combs up to 1 inches deep like my old clippers.  With the combs I used it as well as my husband.  I will have to continue the using  the old one; since at it&#x27;s highest setting my head ended up looking like I was entering Marine boot camp.  My hair is really,  really  short just like some men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> LOVE:&lt;br /&gt;*So smooth on my ultra-sensitive curse of a skin, I look a lot less rosy after hair &amp; beard trimmings compared to similarly priced alternatives I&#x27;ve used in the past (one of them was an earlier Philips model, too). Can&#x27;t emphasize this enough.&lt;br /&gt;*Decent motor, minimal number of second-runs during hair-cuts, length uniformity preserved in angles (I cut short at ~ 12 mm. While a basic style, unlike shaving the hear altogether, it&#x27;s not foolproof and is a good test for a new machine.&lt;br /&gt;*The blade design and configuration admirably prevents  cut locks of hair from  getting stuck. For me,  this is a way bigger deal than washability, as it frees you from compulsory cleaning breaks during clipping. (I like clipping my hair, beard and chest/shoulders all at once,hdg with my hair density (at simian extremes) this can turn into a half-day affair with crappy clippers. This machine has shortened durations noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;*I retire most of my clippers because of mechanical damage around the head/blade area, usually joints. The design on QC 5570 looks and feels durable. (I&#x27;ll be updating my review if it disappoints in that respect)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HATE:&lt;br /&gt;Quite honestly, having  spent this machine&#x27;s price several times over inferior alternatives in the last few years (not to mention the frustration borne ) .</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve cut our grandson&#x27;s hair a couple of times with this clipper and we love it.  I love that it is cordless.  Makes for an easier job.</li>
            <li> Not as nice or as powerful as the last Norelco razor I bought. I still use to cut my hair, and it makes the job easy with the adjustable guard.</li>
            <li> I bought these  clippers to replace the previous model of Norelco clippers. The previous model lasted 4 years of daily use. I would highly recommend these. They leave a perfect trim and can be used extensively.</li>
            <li> Worst philips product i ever used , dont prefer this product if you are looking for hair cut.</li>
            <li> It is a great cutter - cuts good and fast.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to hold it and to cut yourself, as well as easy for someone to cut other person.</li>
            <li> The Norelco Headgroom Plus offers a compact, lightweight hair clipper that works on a battery charge which lasts around an hour. There are 2 attachments and multiple length settings to use with either attachment, for a variety of cutting lengths and styles. This beats having several different attachments to obtain the varying cutting lengths. The ergonomic design offers a 180 degree rotating head so you can work from any angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper has an indicator light so you can keep track of the battery charge, and it is also designed to be easily cleaned and to be smooth on your skin (rounded tips). If you take good care of this it should give you at least several years of quality hair cuts. It comes with a 2 year warranty (extended by 6 months to 2.5 years if you register on their website).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s missing from this is a bag or case to hold and protect the clipper and attachments. Also, once the battery dies out for good you are expected to throw away the clipper \\&quot;do not attempt to replace battery. Insulate battery ends by covering with tape and/or place battery in a small plastic bag... discard your clipper. Do not attempt to plug electrical cord into the outlet or recharge the clipper after the battery has been removed.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are consumers forced to buy a whole new clipper kit when the battery dies out? I believe Philips/Norelco could find a way to design the item so that the battery can be replaced and the otherwise functional clipper wouldn&#x27;t go to waste. This is the reason I&#x27;m not giving a full five stars. Otherwise, this is an excellent clipper that is much easier to use than corded clippers I&#x27;ve worked with.</li>
            <li> his trimmer takes a little getting used to, but once you get it down, it is great. The rotating blades are a useful feature. The trimming action is clean and smooth - no biting or pulling has occurred at all. The part that threw me was how to increase the cutting length - the instructions seemed weak to me on this count, but I finally figured it out. You twist the ring that has the white ridges on it - this raises the guard (like focusing on an old fashioned camera) - it is not entirely intuitive and I was really frustrated for a while. BUT, once I figured it out - this is great. I have never owned a more effective hair trimmer. Easy to use, excellent battery and high quality cutting blades make this the best trimmer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I tried it using many times but same result. It was clipping more hair so finally had to go with Other hair clipper.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and efficient tool to use.  In front of a big mirror, with a small mirror in one hand, and this thing in the other, takes less than 5 min to get a nice head shave.  I like the fact that it has several adjustable micro-length settings in between 0 and #1, so you can create a small stubble, if you don&#x27;t like your head looking like a shiny light reflector.</li>
            <li> I bought it hoping for quality Norelco battery, power coupling, cutter, blades.  I did not want another $20 junk clipper - clunky, loose, noisy, unfinished, short-lived.  I resented crazy design, sharp edges, awkward grip shape and angles.  It is not designed for the way human hand grips and turns.  It has already caused my scalp a 5 mm bleeding gouge and a red 2 cm scratch.  I used file to round sharp edges on &#x27;precision&#x27; comb!  I seek smart way to engage/disengage comb without brute force.  Rotating head is useless; human hand already has all angles strait clipper needs.  Grip and cutter are 3 cm apart, forcing user to reconcile the plane of holding with the plane of cutting.  Manual is incomplete, badly written, and wrong - even numbers on picture disagree with numbers in text.</li>
            <li> The handy trimmer pays for itself in a couple of uses.  The swivel head makes hair cutting a breeze.</li>
            <li> This handy, easy to use clipper is like having a private barber at home. We&#x27;ve been using it to do quick trims for the men in the family. But my wife keep threatening to use it to trim the dog so I&#x27;ve had to hide it from her...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last year and a half to cut my boys&#x27; hair.  It worked well.  I liked the cordless feature.  But then the shortest comb which we used most often broke.  I&#x27;m not sure how.  I turned the cuff of it thinking I was setting it to make the hair not so short and ended up giving my son razor burn because the comb didn&#x27;t move into the proper place.  I am sad it doesn&#x27;t work anymore due to just a little comb being broken.  Anyone know of any replacement parts?</li>
            <li> Works really good for me. Now, I can have my hair cut own my own once a month. Really handy to work with. Just follow the directions in the manual.</li>
            <li> This trimmer takes a little getting used to, but once you get it down, it is great.  The rotating blades are a useful feature.  The trimming action is clean and smooth - no biting or pulling has occurred at all.  The part that threw me was how to increase the cutting length - the instructions seemed weak to me on this count, but I finally figured it out.

Easy to use, excellent battery and high quality cutting blades make this the best trimmer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> This is a decent, but not great, clipper. What follows are some perceived pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Rotating head:  The rotating head and length adjustment are both nifty features that should give you all the options you need to buzz your own hair. It really does make it easier to reach all the sides of your head by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Motor: The motor is stronger than those found in bargain units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Waterproof: The waterproof quality of the unit makes for easy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Battery:  The battery holds enough charge to last for 3-5 haircuts depending on how long you are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Poor construction:  Overall, this device is not built from high quality materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Locking features absent: The head rotates too easily on its own.  With the hair guard, it is also easy to accidentally \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; and cause a major screw up on your hair cut. It would be nice if there was a way to lock these settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Motor:  While the motor is stronger than those found in bargain units, it lacks the power and speed for thicker and longer hair and tends to leave a few strays here and there even after multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this would be a good product to try if you want to give buzzing your own hair a shot, but those already used to the practice would be better off with a higher end Oster unit rather than this. The rotating head just doesn&#x27;t overcome the advantages in power and cutting speed the bigger clippers provide.</li>
            <li> This is the first set of hair clippers I&#x27;ve owned, so I have nothing to compare them to (other than the hair attachment on my beard trimmer, which doesn&#x27;t really seem like a fair comparison). I buzz my entire head on the lowest setting on a weekly basis, and am able to get three or four uses per charge before a noticeable drop in power. The clippers are easy to hang onto and maneuver. I also like that you can run them under the tap for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take two or three passes to get all of the hairs, but I had the same experience at the barber shop so I&#x27;m inclined to believe this is normal. Even so, it only takes me about 8 minutes start to finish, and it saves me from having to spend money at the barber shop and suffering through unbearable small talk with people I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Satisfied, can rotate 180 degrees, the back of the head is more convenient</li>
            <li> Probably the good thing of this headgroomer is that it is easy to use. However, the materials of the accesories are really bad. I used them for one month two times, and after the second one, the accesory for measuring the length of the haircut already broke. The materials are really bad, and you can not find a replacement anywhere. Therefore, although it&#x27;s a good machine, it doesn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> very nice i like it !</li>
            <li> I have always used Philips DIY hair clipper. This one is better than the previous one I used. And I have saved more than $300 just by shaving my head myself with Philips hair clippers. Got a Moto G 2nd ($170) with the money I saved. Happiest man every alive on earth. Not you. ME. :D</li>
            <li> This clipper is beautifully designed for do-it-yourself hair-cutting. Its swivel head lets you cut the back comfortably, although you need a pair of mirrors to see what you&#x27;re doing. Fine gradations on the two supplied plastic heads allow for exact control of hair length. As a bonus, it&#x27;s a great beard trimmer as well.&lt;br /&gt;The only limitation (not a defect) is that clippers are only useful for short hair.</li>
            <li> Missing some important accessories ,which was included in the previous model</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Will pay for itself in a short time.  Website product registration process does not work; required call to Philips Norelco.  Recommend anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair since 1973, and the Philips Norelco QC5570/40 is the best hair clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  The rotating head makes it so much easier to get the proper angle for cutting my hair on the sides and the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using the clipper to cut my two sons&#x27; hair for the past 5 years, and it&#x27;s great for that too.  Again, the rotating head helps to get just the right angle without having to twist my wrist, and it helps to keep the main body of the clippers out of the way for easier trimming around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s rechargeable, it&#x27;s really nice not to have a cord in the way, and the charge lasts a long time - long enough to get both of my boys done without having to recharge in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second QC5570/40.  The first one wore out after about 3 years.  I like the clipper so much, I actually bought a third one as back-up for when my second one dies.</li>
            <li> These seemed like a perfect fit for my brother, who keeps his hair fairly short. I read the directions, and it seemed pretty easy. I gave it to my brother, with the proviso, \\&quot;Make sure you read the directions.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I saw him, he had a big hole in the back of hair head (not literally, just where the hair should be.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also explain that my brother has to be supervised doing anything new (it&#x27;s an autism thing.) I figured that if this was as easy as they said, an adult male who is very bright but somewhat limited with new stuff should be able to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ummm....nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After he got a haircut from a barber to minimize the &#x27;hole&#x27; in his haircut, we waited and tried it again, this time, with supervision. It worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stil don&#x27;t trust my brother with doing this alone, not for a good, long while. But I can say with me watching over him and giving directions, yes, the clipper works fine. The guard gave the right length, and the trim took all of two minutes with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t let someone lose with this unless they are very sharp, or they can read and assimilate instructions!</li>
            <li> This device really values the money. And it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> i didnt use it yet. it looks good and it indeed charged in one hour.&lt;br /&gt;for me it cuts too short, i wish it would come with larger comb.</li>
            <li> Tried this out the day it arrived in the mail and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every bit as much power as a heavy-duty corded model, but with the added features of a swiveling head, water-resistance, and of course, the option to go cordless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes an hour or so to charge from being totally drained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with all the right size attachments, and the blade clicks up with your thumb to get different lengths on the fly--a barber would like how versatile it is with getting different hair lengths without having to swap out different-sized guards.</li>
            <li> I used this on my teenage son&#x27;s head when he decided to go for (and maintain) a faux hawk. The clippers are well designed and easy to hold in the hand, which my carpal tunnel appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty easy to use. The 180 rotating head looks nice but it doesn&#x27;t need to rotate that far. I only needed to adjust it to get a difference angle three times, and it locked into each place point well. The differences in the 13 settings were miniscule, and I felt that there were not enough choices on hair length due to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edges on the blade are not smooth or comfortable, despite the manufacturer&#x27;s claims to the opposite. It was rough and hurt. Then again, my son is not the best patient when it comes to even the tiniest amount of pain....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments were easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ion battery lasted well on the cuts we did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good clipper for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the first really good clippers I have had for cleaning up the hair on the back of my neck.  Removing the hair there is very awkward, because I have to look through two mirrors and reach around at funny angles.  The adjustable angle on this thing means I can get right up to the hair line without going through as many contortions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does a good job trimming my soul patch and side burns.  The motor feels powerful, and I haven&#x27;t come anywhere near the limitations of the battery.</li>
            <li> I hate manscaping. Hate hate hate. I only have a beard because of my aversion to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had many beard trippers and clippers in the past, with many different attachments, but they never made trimming any better or easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I really like the QC5570. It is easy to hold, the blade swivels so I can use both hands and get harder-to-reach spots, and the adjustable trimmer is intuitive and accurate. Beard, sideburns, stache, and even eyebrows if needed, are all easy to trim, and result in a uniform length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it eight times and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper to replace my former Phillips Norelco Do-It-Yourslef clipper. This new one is pretty much the new version of the old one. My old one lasted me for at least 5 years without a hiccup. The main reason I replaced it with this new one is because the blades were starting to pull my hair every ones in a while, and since I didn&#x27;t take good care of it at all, it was very dirty... it was time. This new one works perfectly. I can even wash it after I am done, and it doesn&#x27;t affect it at all. I use it once a week to buzz/shave my balding head. The angles are very helpful for when I need to cut my sides and back. It hold the charge for a very long time and it comes with many different cutting length settings. I highly recommend this product. Like I said I have used and manhandled the old one at it lasted me five years and it still works, I am confident this new one will do the job too... Knock on wood.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use &amp; i&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> take me 5 minutes/week for haircut now. love this thing but feel sorry for the barbers!</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5 star if it has another clip on that would not cut so close.  But the quality of the product is like no other clippers I have had. If you want your hair very short, this is the product It never cuts the skin, very smooth.  Outstanding battery life.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have tried it from my friend. It is easy to use and works well. It can be used for a long time afer being recharged.</li>
            <li> I just use this handy clipper and have my hair cut all by myself (first time). When my wife come back from shopping, she is so surprised with such an excellent job done by this new clipper. we all love it.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, thanks for the fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, better than other Clippers I have owned. Has exceeded expectations thus far. Multiple trim settings and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great quality produt, have been using it for two years no problems, save $$$ on hair cut too!!</li>
            <li> Buy discount period, it is cheaper to buy back after use, it is very good, ready to help children at home haircut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this clipper just a couple of times and the use seems finicky at best. Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of what I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Rotating head: useful for trimming around the sides of your head&lt;br /&gt;- Different clips: included for various lengths&lt;br /&gt;- Waterproof: great for shower use (see below)&lt;br /&gt;- Charger: uses the same charger as other Norelco products - if you have a recent shaver, it should use the same port&lt;br /&gt;- Wireless: clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past have had an attached cable, this has none so it&#x27;s significantly more portable&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life: decent, I usually get about 3 cuts out of a charge&lt;br /&gt;- Size: its relatively small and easy enough to stuff into a mirror shelf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Durability: as I was removing the large clip to change sizes, the whole part of the rotating head was dislodged. It appears to have been held in place by some sort of glue. I question how well the clipper was made, but I was able to just put it back in the place it was removed and it works as it did before.&lt;br /&gt;- Inconsistent: while it may be lack of practice with this particular clipper, the cuts are often uneven and require more touch up than I find with other clippers&lt;br /&gt;- Waterproof: I noticed that water seemed to seep into the circuitry when the rotating head was dislodged. This does not seem to affect performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great for in between haircuts or for those just learning to cut their own hear. I&#x27;d say the pros certainly out way the cons at this price point.</li>
            <li> Being a college student, I have decided to give myself haircuts to save me some money since I normally have had to get one every month. Haircuts where I am from are around $15-$18 after you give the dresser a tip. You can see how this can add up for a college student who is barely getting by. The rotating head locks into 5 positions which allows you to easily cut your hair. I have seen many reviews which people have complained that the two plastic attachable heads are flimsy and don&#x27;t give a proper cut however, they have worked well for me and don&#x27;t seem to bend if you don&#x27;t put a crazy amount of pressure on them.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair pretty short and hate paying $20 every 3 weeks to keep it looking nice for such an easy style.  Bit the bullet and got this and have been cutting my hair for a few months now with excellent results.  It&#x27;s already paid for itself and it also works great as a beard trimmer.  I sometimes like keeping a very short beard and this makes it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two attachments that allow you to go from less than a 1 blade all the way up to a 5.  I do a 5 on top and 1.5 around the sides/back and blend it in with a 3 which looks just like when I had it done professionally.  It charges fast, is versatile and works great,</li>
            <li> This shaver worked right out of the box. I guess my LOSS is their gain. LOL I highly recommend this unit. easy to.</li>
            <li> Really liked these clippers. Use them in the shower and they work great. I&#x27;ve had them for a couple months now and they still work like new.</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips Norelco Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper Plus, I have dropped the other one and was looking to replace it with the same model. Easy to use, convenient, charges fast and staid charged for months, I use it 3 times a week to clip my hair and to keep my haircut in the same shape.</li>
            <li> I love it at the first time to use .  It just fit my expect.  I will keep it .</li>
            <li> It is very convinient for a new guy to try DIY. (7 more wrds required? tow more ) Thank you.</li>
            <li> The battery charge is excellent on this unit.  I have also used the Panasonic water proof unit and this one blows the run time out of the water.  Cleaning is very very easy on this unit (difficult in the Panasonic).  Obviously the blades rotate for easier access...now the slight problem (it is very hard to explain but I will try).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A typical clipper comes with guards that you snap on.  This unit comes with 2 guards that can adjust the closeness.  The guards snap into the rotating wheel/knob.  So when to adjust the length, you rotate the wheel and it gives you the length you want.  After about 10-15 cuts, the guards stopped adjusting.  The guards would snap into the rotating wheel, but when you rotate the wheel, the guards would not move up and down.  I examined the wheel/knob on the unit itself and it is still functional.  The guards just wear out and don&#x27;t catch as well on the rotating wheel/knob.  After a few tries, it will get adjusting again, but I am afraid with more usage, the guards will become useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I wanted. I like it very much, even if I havn&#x27;t used it.&lt;br /&gt;But it spent a much long delivery time to get it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice touch up device, useful for clipping neck, touching up a haircut, trimming a beard (although it is not a beard trimmer) and other do-it-yourself cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is small, and the flexibile head makes for something that you can hold, twist, turn, and use by yourself, either standing in the bathroom in front of a mirror or with a small hand held mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure that this would cut hair.  It is more of a trimmer than a clipper.  It lacks the ooomph for a full head of thick hair, and seems designed for edging and touching up, rather than cutting and whacking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whacking, use a bigger cutter, or a hedge tool.</li>
            <li> Philips did a good job with the construction of this device - it feels high-quality and has great ergonomics. In use, the blade didn&#x27;t snag or pull at all, which isn&#x27;t too surprising since it&#x27;s still quite sharp, but there were no defects in manufacturing, so that&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had just hoped that the set would include guides for body hair. It would have cost nearly nothing to include them, and would have extended the usefulness of of the product tenfold. Since this is sold as a self-cutting hair tool, presumably for men, body hair would be a very natural extension. Without it this feels like a single-purpose tool, and in my complicated world those just don&#x27;t serve as well as something that will accomplish multiple functions.</li>
            <li> Works great if you want a buzz cut, good way to start over if you cut your own hair and tend to make mistakes. With this you can start over with hair the same length, short. Not for long hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a Braun shaver that used pricy cleaning fluid packs. Good shave, and cleans up with soap and water. I&#x27;ve replaced the cutting heads once already and probably will do again to keep shaving as long as the battery lasts.</li>
            <li> It work perfect. But the longest hair can be retained is just 15mm by its comb, it is too short.</li>
            <li> The price is excellent and it cuts hair like a champ.  The only deficiency I have is that even the longest setting leaves skin visible, so get ready to go &amp;#34;Jar Head&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Well like other reviewers note, it only lasts for about a year. Purchased in January, the guide/comb broke in December. I contacted them and accessories are not covered under warranty. You can buy the comb as a replacement for about half the price of buying a whole new unit, not cool. Looking for a better option now.</li>
            <li> The Norelco QC5570/40 is a great idea, with a very flawed execution.  When it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s far and away the easiest-to-use hair trimming device I&#x27;ve used.  The issue is that it&#x27;s so seldom working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial issue I noticed is that it&#x27;s quite easy to inadvertently adjust the length of your cut, while you&#x27;re cutting your hair.  There&#x27;s no way to securely &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; your length in place.  More than once, I&#x27;ve started trimming my hair at one setting, and finished at another setting.  This is less than ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, it started cutting out several times during a single hair cut, when fully charged.  The solution was to plug it in to the charger for a few seconds, when it would recussitate, then work for another 20 seconds of cutting or so.  The &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; was to stop and clear out the blades at least 4x over the course of a hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week, it died completely.  No amount of charging, cajoling or threatening could bring it back to life.  I&#x27;m outside of Amazon&#x27;s return window, so I&#x27;ll be contacting Phillips.</li>
            <li> Delighted with my purchase. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Light and easy to use. Nice groomer.</li>
            <li> The barber is very good.</li>
            <li> Strong recommendation for this product.  I used it regularly and it works great.  It holds its charge for 2 - 3 weeks with daily use.  Very easy to adjust the height of the cut, as well.</li>
            <li> Everyone would get a little apprehensive to using hair clippers on their own - I was the same.  I tried a little and wasn&#x27;t too happy - but this is more of a coordination thing for myself.  It&#x27;s not quite as intuitive as the old golden standard - the flowbee.  This one is harder and you need to be careful using it with mirrored reflection.  Best to have someone help you cut it for you then it&#x27;s a golden 5 star product.  Quality wise, it&#x27;s well constructed and not flimsy like some generic competitors where they would pass at a dollar shop.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and keep clean. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is good to cut your hair by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;It is descent for self hair clipper than other.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it if you have short hair style.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a 4 year old previous model and this one is even better.</li>
            <li> after twice exercises,i can cut my hair by myself,perfect!!! now i cut my hair every week,ha ha ha ha ha^</li>
            <li> Best Investment. Works really well. Holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. The charge always lasts enough so I can clip my hair and also my beard. Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> perfect buy, easy to handle and quick results</li>
            <li> Perfect for my guy who visits the barber every month, this product is easy to use and works well. Adjustable settings make it easy to get your hair to the exact length that you want it. The only thing we didn&#x27;t like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a storage bag, so you either store it in the original box, or it will get tangled among other things in a drawer or closet. This will pay for itself in a few short months.</li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting my hair every 12-14 days since 1990. With home haircuts, I&#x27;ve saved thousands of dollars, saved hundreds of hours of driving to a barber shop and waiting for a barber, and enjoyed the convenience of getting a haircut whenever I need one. My wife was a bit hesitant the first time or two, but now she&#x27;s really into haircutting, and she loves how much money we save. In 23 years, we&#x27;ve gone through an Oster, a Panasonic, and our current Conair is on its last legs, so we were glad to see the new Norelco clippers arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are really nice clippers. They have a futuristic look compared to the conventional shape of hair clippers, but form follows function, and the clippers are the best ergonomic design of any clippers we&#x27;ve had, as well as being the lightest weight. My wife/barber loved the simple, positive adjustment of the combs, which gave much better control of the cutting length than the levers or other controls of clippers we&#x27;ve had before. With other clippers, the cutting length had to be eyeballed and was neither very precise or consistent. With the Norelco clippers, a locking dial sets the exact length to the nearest 0.5mm for shorter lengths and 2mm for longer cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other nice touches:&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t appear that hair clippings can enter the body behind the cutting blades, a major annoyance with other clippers, causing the motor to slow down and requiring a difficult cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;2. The leading edges of the combs are curved, so they can&#x27;t poke your scalp accidentally. Why other clipper manufacturers haven&#x27;t figured this out is a mystery to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first haircut with these clippers, my wife/barber loves them, and I love them. I got a perfect haircut, and the clippers even got the little frizzy hairs around my balding spot, the ones that defied cutting with other clippers and had to be cut with scissors. She tried rotating the clipper head and said it was a nice feature, but for my style of haircut (a short buzz cut), it&#x27;s not really necessary. I can see how for some haircut styles, it would be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor negative comment: Other hair clippers that we&#x27;ve owned included a plastic storage container that held the clippers, battery charger, combs, and other accessories. The Norelco clippers came in a cardboard box with no storage container, a surprising omission. We solved the problem by using the container for the old clippers that we discarded, but a container of some kind is needed to keep everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend home haircuts, and I recommend the Norelco QC5570 clippers. These clippers are light-years ahead of any other clippers that we&#x27;ve used before.haircut (a short buzz cut), it&#x27;s not really necessary.

            <li> Works great But I wish they still made one with a longer comb. Not as flimsy as I&#x27;ve read others review. But I know better then to club myself in the head with clippers. If I&#x27;m going to risk a bad haircut at least I&#x27;m not paying someone else to do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my boys&#x27; hair for years. I like the ease of a good pair of shavers and these ones fill that bill nicely. The one attachment has variable depth control so you can cut as long or as short as they want it. So far, they haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;do it yourself\\&quot; part of this, but these work great if you just want to give someone a quick buzz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a clipper newbie. I&#x27;ve used scissors for hair cuts for my husband and son, with a razor to clean around the edges. This was easy and intuitive to use, taking much less time and effort (and risk of nicking ears or skin!) than my old way. These are great, and I love the adjust-ability and cordless/corded options. When I went to the salon for a haircut and brought my son with me, they were all amazed that I was able to do his cut by myself without any training or experience! These made it easy, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish a couple of longer length settings were available. I like my son&#x27;s hair a bit longer than the longest option with these, and I trust myself to freehand it just yet. After using these, I do definitely prefer clippers than scissors, though!</li>
            <li> My wife clips my hair and she is very pleased with the performance.  It really does a great job and pleases me.  I save $25 every four weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot to say , but in general norelco products are the best out there ! I&#x27;m very happy with it :-)</li>
            <li> Very good clipper. The same as a previous models. Nice design, pretty comfortable in hand. Strongly recommend to everybody. Ght</li>
            <li> Compact, fast and easy to use for shaving or having a haircut. Easy cleaning as well and more sturdy in comparison with older models.</li>
            <li> nice product fast shipping and good price</li>
            <li> This is a good product and my husband is very pleased to have it. It&#x27;s suitable for all easy hair styles.</li>
            <li> Lets face it - you don&#x27;t always have time to get to the barber shop when your hairline is a tad long.  Norelco created this with men in mind for a fast side shave (with 4 length settings) or to knock down that beard you no longer need without clogging your favorite  razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with 2 skin guards.  The \\&quot;long\\&quot; version allows you to set about a 4mm length.  Simply pulling on the long guard allows you to install the short guard, which has 3 settings - 0.5 mm, 1 mm, and 1.5 mm.  In both cases the guard fingers prevent the clipper from drawing blood, yet still produce an even cut.  With the short clipper, setting the length is not immediately intuitive.  There is a ring around the cutter assembly with diamond shaped decorations in it.  At first it does not appear functional, but rotating the ring forces the guard through it&#x27;s setting detents and holds it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is rechargable and notes that 1 hr of charge produces 1 hr of usage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, after figuring out the operation (instructions are in every language on a LARGE piece of paper without good illustrations) I found the cutter to be quiet, effective, and ideal for giving that fresh from the barber shop appearance when the shop is closed.  This is definitely not a professional tool, but for the occasional touch ups it works quite well.  The cutting head swivels through 270 degrees allowing&lt;br /&gt;Ovalldru</li>
            <li> This hair clipper is unique because instead of having 7-10 different clipper attachements to adjust the length of the cut, you simply turn the little dial and the clipper lengthens or shortens the cut. It&#x27;s pretty cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of fiddling with all the different length attachements, you just twist to the correct height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swivel head is another interesting feature. At first, it seemed that it would be weird, but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s a handy feature. You don&#x27;t have to use the swivel action. You can leave it set straight, but for cutting around the ears or side of the head, you can twist the cutting head to the angle you want. All it does is make it easy to hold and clip, but it&#x27;s a nice little addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the cutter is noticeably less than the other cutters we&#x27;ve used, yet the cut seems to be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great clipper.</li>
            <li> Really great buzzer. Good battery life. Only wish the guards had longer options</li>
            <li> Seems very well made.  Cuts great and battery life is very good.  I really like the swivel head and the built in dial for adjusting the trimming height.</li>
            <li> great stuff ,works great , worth every penny</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is head protect..</li>
            <li> Nice clipper set. Works well. No problems with cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have had was with the plastic clipper attachment (number 1-5) breaking and there is no possibility of buying a replacement piece, you just have to buy the whole unit again :/</li>
            <li> The resulting length of the hair is restricted, you cannot cut it longer than one or one 1/2 finger. But the result was good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in Feb,14. I have used it since. Because I cut my own hair and beard at the same time, I got tired of the heat and pointed clippers of the standard hair clippers. This product does as it is described. I don&#x27;t give product reviews lightly. If a product misses the description or if the product is worth the purchase, I will write a review. This is one of the latter.</li>
            <li> The most I know about hair cutting for men is&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;what number?&#x27;. But only when I saw the turnable clipper that can be rotated to the number setting that you like, the mystery has become clear about how the clipper does the holding the hair through the teeth of the comb, so the hair is not cut beyond the length you want to. For all the beginners, once you are over the awe, this clipper is easy to handle with its angled settings to help you reach the hair from different directions. Novice hair trimmer says, as you go along you&#x27;ll pick up the skills.</li>
            <li> Works fine if you only want a buzz cut. Longest hair length setting still too short.</li>
            <li> Works fine and good price, not quite as convenient to use as its forerunner(fatter profile).</li>
            <li> Very good product! I like it</li>
            <li> Does a good job, and the swivel head makes it easy to use.  However, the length setting tends to slip, and you get to choose between a bald patch and a buzz cut, if you are not careful.  It would also be great to have an attachment with a rounded bottom, to make tapered cuts around the ears, sideburns etc easy.  It looks weird with hair all the same length</li>
            <li> The best clippers I have ever gotten.  Let&#x27;s you cut your own hair easily.  I do a 1/2 buzz all over in under 5 minutes.  It doesn&#x27;t rust like Wahl clippers and the battery lasts a looooong time.</li>
            <li> This is a great cordless trimmer.  I have been shaving my head for years, and this is the first trimmer that I feel will last a long time and get the job done.  The adjustable length dial is nice and accurate, and I can get the exact length that I want.  I tend to keep my hair very short, and can trim it to about 1/8 inch in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the cutting head swivels 180-degrees so I can use it easily with either the right or the left hand.  Great product.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husbands hair for years, he only gets a buzz and we&#x27;re too cheap to pay someone else to do it!  I loved that the blade on this is adjustable, no more storing a bunch of sizes and having to change them, just easily adjust on the clippers themselves.  It charged quickly and lasted as long as we needed.  We didn&#x27;t turn it that much, but it could be useful for hard to reach places, especially if you&#x27;re cutting your own hair.  I did think it vibrated a bit more in my hand than the one we have now, but it wasn&#x27;t so bad that I&#x27;d stop using it.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> great do it yourself hair clipper very easy to use.could not ask for a better hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;i love it.</li>
