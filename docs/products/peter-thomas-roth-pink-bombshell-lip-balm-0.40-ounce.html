            <li>My daughter made her own lip gloss out of Vaseline and shimmery eye shadow.....</li>
            <li>This is the best I have tried, I am very choosy with my lip balm I will stay with this product..,</li>
            <li>Honestly?</li>
            <li>this has a very light tint to it you could wear alone or under or over your lipstick.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would love it in a tube.</li>
            <li>i hope that Peter Thomas Roth is not discontinuing this product because i love it</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>My lips feel great and not goopy (assuming that is a real word).  </li>
            <li>and I like it better than this for $17.</li>
            <li>Love PTR products, except this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a lot more from this company and from a lip product at the $20</li>
            <li>Had I know that petrolatum was one of the top ingredients I would have stayed away.</li>
            <li>i have tried many lip balms over the years for my dry lips and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>worth the money at all.!!</li>
            <li>It also has very little color but leaves a nice pinkish hue, which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>but it is a great product for keeping the lips soft.</li>
            <li>Perfect all year round.</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips smooth</li>
            <li>There are a lot more products out there worth trying, this is not it.</li>
            <li>It is a great night time balm and, best of all, a really nice base for my day makeup/lip color.  </li>
            <li>i love the smell but leaves my lips a bit dry, and wish there was more shine to it</li>
            <li>Stripped of any natural moisture and need of more balm.</li>
            <li>I was very amazed how this went on so smooth, right away</li>
            <li>Usually the PTR items I&#x27;ve tried work great, but this balm unexpectedly dries out my lips even more.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, pretty item, I like a lot, thank you so much :)</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>A lot of the Peter Thomas Roth products contain Parabens, so I had to send back most of my order.  </li>
            <li>I use it several times a day and for sure before bed.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm, especially before bed.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice opalescent sheen and makes lips feel protected/(albeit slightly suffocated).</li>
            <li>This lip balm stays on and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It really softens lips and keeps them from chapping.</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this and any PTR products!</li>
            <li>Given the expense of the kit, I began to doubt whether I should have also ought the lip balm -- even at its relatively reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>There was also a strangely salty tang to it and some discoloration throughout, despite an otherwise sweet, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>apply at nite time right before bed and wake up with refreshed and soft lips.  </li>
            <li>Love the feel , look and moisture level.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful shade of pink!  </li>
            <li>This product feels nice and thick at first.</li>
            <li>On the lip, it is a great neutral that slightly leans towards pink and does not dominate your lip color.</li>
            <li>My lips as I have gotten older have thinned and from being in the sun in Mexico and Arizona I have been sunburned even using sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Nice color, texture is a bit hard</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips very moist and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, luxurious and above other brands of lip balm.</li>
            <li>I love how moist and soft it feels on my lips, especially during these winter months, however, I was hoping for my shine and less frosted look.</li>
            <li>I like to use this before bed also because in the AM my lips feel so soft.</li>
            <li>My lips are soft.</li>
            <li>I bought it to make my lips soft.</li>
            <li>the pink shimmer is pretty.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the pink shimmer is pretty.</li>
            <li> It says bombshell pink, but its very, very light so you can use it under your lipstick or alone, very subtle color.</li>
            <li> the only other thing is I use a separate lip brush with this for sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li> so many Lip Balms ,not all were bad</li>
            <li> Not what I was expected.</li>
            <li> One caveat,  don&#x27;t think that the name \\&quot;pink bombshell\\&quot; is descriptive of color once on lip.  </li>
            <li> The color in the jar is a baby pink with a bit of opalesence.</li>
            <li> I cant seem to find any other product that compares.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got kind of a goopy texture, a terrible &amp; unflattering shimmer, and it&#x27;s just all around gross.</li>
            <li> Not actually moisturizing &amp; after 2 weeks use at least 2x a day - no positive results on way lips look.</li>
            <li> and although it&#x27;s small a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Not smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> Would work well if one could get past the taste and the smell.</li>
            <li> It is thick but stays on for along time</li>
            <li> Not good it just sits on the lips-does not moisturize at all--would not recommend</li>
            <li> When the balm wears off your lips feel worse then before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ugly cycle.  </li>
            <li> Smells and tastes dreadful.</li>

            <li> Not what I was expected.</li>
            <li> Nice color, texture is a bit hard but it&#x27;s really nice, got lots of good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Really great lip balm. My lips are soft. I bought it to make my lips soft. It serves it purpose.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as an afterthought after I purchased the PTR unwrinkle kit.  Given the expense of the kit, I began to doubt whether I should have also ought the lip balm -- even at its relatively reasonable price.  I am very happy I went with it.  It is a great night time balm and, best of all, a really nice base for my day makeup/lip color.  My lips feel great and not goopy (assuming that is a real word).  One caveat,  don&#x27;t think that the name \\&quot;pink bombshell\\&quot; is descriptive of color once on lip.  The color in the jar is a baby pink with a bit of opalesence. On the lip, it is a great neutral that slightly leans towards pink and does not dominate your lip color. P.S. Although not critical, you may want a lip brush.</li>
            <li> Not good it just sits on the lips-does not moisturize at all--would not recommend</li>

            <li> This gets one star b/c the pink shimmer is pretty. Love PTR products, except this one. Smells and tastes dreadful. Would work well if one could get past the taste and the smell.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, pretty item, I like a lot, thank you so much :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Not smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> sorry,nothing at all! thank you</li>
            <li> This is the best I have tried, I am very choosy with my lip balm I will stay with this product..,</li>
            <li> Honestly? I was expecting a lot more from this company and from a lip product at the $20+ point. Had I know that petrolatum was one of the top ingredients I would have stayed away. This product feels nice and thick at first. Gives a nice opalescent sheen and makes lips feel protected/(albeit slightly suffocated). But it&#x27;s a lie.. When the balm wears off your lips feel worse then before. Stripped of any natural moisture and need of more balm. It&#x27;s an ugly cycle.  And I&#x27;d rather stay out of it thank you very much.</li>
