            <li>and I love it now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than buying from birch box !!!!</li>
            <li>I first tried it in birch box and loved it.  </li>
            <li>As a hairdresser, and as someone who has single processed hair that need hydration, this is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in conjunction with the Hydration shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is silicone-based, which is fine for me as I find that silicones work better on my hair.  </li>
            <li>love all 3 products i purchased..shampoo, conditioner and super comb prep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so creamy and also light.</li>
            <li>This condition coupled with the shampoo made my hair soft, shiny, and feel so good.  </li>
            <li>I had previously bought this shampoo and conditioner at a nice salon and loved it for the heavenly scent and hydrating power.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This distributes evenly through my hair and rinses out cleanly without leaving noticeable residue.  </li>
            <li>It smells kind of like incense, for lack of a better way to describe it, and I&#x27;m not totally sold on the scent.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is great for keratin and color treated hair and the conditioner leaves the hair soft shiny and very sleek.</li>
            <li>Most excellent product for my naturally dry, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>A  big plus is that it really really smells so good!</li>
            <li>I had received a sample of it and had to have the full size.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny and smooth and I have many fewer flyaways.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing, it not only smells fantastic</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very light, easy to rinse out, and does not weigh your hair down like most moisturizing conditioners.</li>
            <li>Thanks Birch Box for the samples!!</li>
            <li>i thought if that was such an amazing product, this would be too.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>My old stylist uses this brand exclusively and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and how soft my hair feels after using.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product high end.</li>
            <li>It couldn&#x27;t have been the real product!</li>
            <li>purchase again here pretty soon.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight, color-treated long hair.</li>
            <li>This condition smells amazing, and it keeps my hair from looking dead.</li>
            <li>My hair is destroyed- years of home coloring, straight ironing.</li>
            <li>, it works, it makes your hair very silky, I will recommend this too everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Really like the conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, smells great and helps maintain the heath of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve moved out of state and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any salon/store other than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried just about every high end conditioner on the market.</li>
            <li>Life changing and worth the extra money!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I am unable to start paying full price for it, even though it does such good things for my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Hair is not soft and very tangled ..</li>
            <li>The bottle looks cool, but I think it&#x27;s design for waste.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually leaves my hair very silky when it dries: even after using a blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I have a major frizz problem.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, color-treated hair and I live in Georgia, so it&#x27;s humid.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just a little much to be stuck with all</li>

            <li> I decided to repurchase through amazon and this stuff was a different color and had an almost offensive odor and left a weird waxy coating on my hair.</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, but it just made my hair too limp.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> the hydrating conditioner does not hydrate, and it smells like dead animal.</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t waste i used the bottle.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is loosely acceptable, but the shampoo is horrible and doesn&#x27;t clean your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really unbelievable</li>
            <li> Naturally, when I find an almost-perfect conditioner for my hair, it has to be really expensive!  </li>
            <li> the shape of the bottle makes it hard for the conditioner to come out when you get to the end of it.</li>
            <li> biggest waste of money do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> OMG was i wrong.</li>
            <li> This was fake.</li>
            <li> Argh I am so darned angry!</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
            <li> worst product ever!</li>

            <li> Fantastic product high end.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I love the smell and it makes my hair soft and shiny. I first tried it in birch box and loved it.  It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than buying from birch box !!!!</li>
            <li> This Conditioners makes your hair feel great and adds shine!</li>
            <li> Great product! Have benign using about 3 years. A little goes a long way, smells great and helps maintain the heath of my hair.</li>

            <li> Naturally, when I find an almost-perfect conditioner for my hair, it has to be really expensive!  I was hoarding sample packets of this and I&#x27;ve been using them this week.  And I love this stuff.  Unfortunately, I am unable to start paying full price for it, even though it does such good things for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, color-treated hair and I live in Georgia, so it&#x27;s humid.  I have a major frizz problem.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, but this one has been absolutely the best at getting the problem under control.  My hair is so soft and shiny and smooth and I have many fewer flyaways.  (I&#x27;ve been using it along with the clarifying shampoo from No. 4.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This distributes evenly through my hair and rinses out cleanly without leaving noticeable residue.  However, the scent stays with you.  For up to a day.  It smells kind of like incense, for lack of a better way to describe it, and I&#x27;m not totally sold on the scent.  (It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just a little much to be stuck with all day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is silicone-based, which is fine for me as I find that silicones work better on my hair.

            <li> Love this product. Works well and smells amazing. Pricey no matter where you buy it. I treat myself to it occasionally.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner for my baby fine hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Most excellent product for my naturally dry, coarse hair. Smooths and hydrates beautifully.</li>
            <li> This smells so good!!!</li>
            <li> This condition smells amazing, and it keeps my hair from looking dead. It&#x27;s so creamy and also light. Love it!</li>
            <li> After trying many conditioners and shampoos and being somewhat satisfied but also spending $58-60 for the products I liked, finding n4 was a pleasure. The shampoo is great for keratin and color treated hair and the conditioner leaves the hair soft shiny and very sleek. 2 👍👍 up!!</li>

I decided to repurchase through amazon and this stuff was a different color and had an almost offensive odor and left a weird waxy coating on my hair. It couldn&#x27;t have been the real product! Huge disappointment!</li>
            <li> love all 3 products i purchased..shampoo, conditioner and super comb prep.</li>
            <li> Did not like  the product .. The smell is good , but the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t work .. Hair is not soft and very tangled ..&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again .. I wrote the seller to explain the product and they wouldn&#x27;t  return either one.. The FDA are something ..</li>
            <li> Conditioner is awesome.  It leaves my hair silky soft. The bottle looks cool, but I think it&#x27;s design for waste.  After a couple weeks , you have fight the bottle to get the conditioner out.  Very annoying.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!!  Thanks Birch Box for the samples!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so great and leaves my hair feeling amazing. I had received a sample of it and had to have the full size.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair care line.  Love all their products!!!</li>
            <li> Everything about this product is wonderful except the container...</li>
            <li> This company is non-responsive about their faulty products. The conditioner is loosely acceptable, but the shampoo is horrible and doesn&#x27;t clean your hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> Fabulous condition &amp; shampoos!!  I had used a different brand a few months ago and went back to the Number 4 products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again here pretty soon.</li>
            <li> This is counterfeit! Do not buy this product here. I just want my money back. Argh I am so darned angry! My hair is totally dry and straw like.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. Love this stuff and the shampoo that goes with it!</li>
            <li> I use other N4 products, but did not care for this at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff really smoothes and moisturizes my thick, frizzy, color treated hair. It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually leaves my hair very silky when it dries: even after using a blowdryer. I don&#x27;t even need any other product to take the frizz out. Just a tiny through the ends and let it sit a minute or two and rinse. I also bought the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have just discovered this brand and I&#x27;m so glad that I did!  I love the way it makes my hair feel and the smell is awesome!!</li>
            <li> worst product ever! ive used the N.4 prep and comb and it was one of the best products i ever used in my life, it was the only thing that worked on my daughters tangled hair. i thought if that was such an amazing product, this would be too. OMG was i wrong. the hydrating conditioner does not hydrate, and it smells like dead animal. i tried to return it but because of health regulation laws i couldn&#x27;t. so i don&#x27;t waste i used the bottle. the shape of the bottle makes it hard for the conditioner to come out when you get to the end of it. biggest waste of money do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! My hair is destroyed- years of home coloring, straight ironing. I got a sample of this shampoo in the mail and I was hooked. Amazon offered the best price and I use or every day. My friends and family say my hair has never looked or felt better and the smell is heavenly!</li>
            <li> I feel like i just poured vitamins into my hair! What is in this that makes it so incredible! Life changing and worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that can get frizzy and this helps tame them. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it - and so does my hair</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve found in years.  My old stylist uses this brand exclusively and I fell in love with it.  I&#x27;ve moved out of state and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any salon/store other than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: African-American/Caucasian, brown hair, normal/dry, partly curly.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, it not only smells fantastic, it works, it makes your hair very silky, I will recommend this too everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Love it....</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight, color-treated long hair. When used in combination with the hydrating shampoo, my hair has never looked, felt or smelled better!! This conditioner is very light, easy to rinse out, and does not weigh your hair down like most moisturizing conditioners. I had to treat myself to the combo!  A little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! Works wonderfully and leaves my hair smelling great, soft and shiny. Have gotten many compliments since I started using these product.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used and I&#x27;ve tried just about every high end conditioner on the market. I have wavy, curly, colored hair that tends to be frizzy and dry and this product makes it luxurious and shiny. It&#x27;s really unbelievable what a difference it makes. I highly recommend it! It deserves five stars and MORE!</li>
            <li> What can I say ... my heart started falling out with this shampoo... so did my wife&#x27;s.  I have never had anything like this happen before.</li>
            <li> This was fake. Smells nothing like Number 4.</li>
            <li> This condition coupled with the shampoo made my hair soft, shiny, and feel so good.  A  big plus is that it really really smells so good!</li>
            <li> Really like the conditioner and shampoo. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good product. My hairdresser used this on my hair and I love it now.</li>
            <li> As a hairdresser, and as someone who has single processed hair that need hydration, this is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in conjunction with the Hydration shampoo. Together, they work as promised. Have been using these for several years.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and how soft my hair feels after using.</li>
