            <li>Purchased this for my toddler &amp; she looks beautiful with her puff.</li>
            <li>and my hair has been in a beautiful puff courtesy of my clamp</li>
            <li>Great purchase.</li>
            <li>Works great on my transitioning hair.  </li>
            <li>I think this would be great if it was made of a move flexible material but, as it is, I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>is a great idea , but the clip is way to bid.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>It holds up great on my puff also.</li>
            <li>Would work great if I had purchased the correct size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because it doesn&#x27;t pull or try to break my hair like bobby pins.</li>
            <li>However great for puffs,poofs,big ponytails.</li>
            <li>This item allows me to rock a great updo.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It works for me great.</li>
            <li>I was happy when the package arrived, pulled my hair up and didn&#x27;t like it that the gadget snagged my hair.  </li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>This is the best accessory I own.</li>
            <li>Great idea for a product.</li>
            <li>but maybe that will be released in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>so she&#x27;s happy</li>
            <li>but it does work great on my 3c hair.</li>
            <li>This was great to do my puffs with..</li>
            <li>Just give it a try, if you don&#x27;t like it Amazon is so great and doing refunds or returns.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>This is a great invention.</li>
            <li>Great idea</li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>LOL)</li>
            <li>Its a great concept</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still happy I bought the puff cuff</li>
            <li>Besides that, its a great product.</li>
            <li>Great for kinky hair.</li>
            <li>Great investment for naturals.</li>
            <li>This clamp is great for those days that I cannot detangle her hair.  </li>
            <li>It gives her a great updo without straining her edges.  </li>
            <li>I love it !!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s now her favorite hair do!!</li>
            <li>Sturdy and gathers the hair nicely!</li>
            <li>I would love it in a 3 inch size, that&#x27;d be perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I am loving my Puff Cuff!  </li>
            <li>Perfect, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the puff cuff clamp it gives me the perfect size puff.</li>
            <li>Awesome idea, would love to give it 5 stars</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to be an awesome hair tool!!! :)</li>
            <li>The best part is that my puff is very full unlike when I put my hair in scrunchie/goody bands.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works great!</li>
            <li>Great way to keep my hair tidy but without the headache incurred from elastics.  </li>
            <li>I though it would be good for my hair</li>
            <li>Goody band works just as good and cheaper.</li>
            <li>the not so good</li>
            <li>I loved the cuff.</li>
            <li>Idea is good but doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li>The puff looks good.</li>
            <li>I had already had banana clips and attempted using those, but they were way to constricting and did not give a good look.  </li>
            <li>but it makes my puffs look gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Works great for bunning too and doesn&#x27;t cause stress on the edges like panty hose and the like is apt to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly sturdy, and does what it says it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li>It is a great idea and alternative to the banana clip as it is very light and doesn&#x27;t pull and tug on your hair when you use it..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the PuffCuff!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair clip!</li>

            <li>Love this thing!</li>
            <li>It is great quality and durable, unlike store bought hair clamps that break easily with one use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and so great for not messing with your hair.</li>
            <li>I was VERY excited to get it!</li>
            <li>The puff cuff hair clamp is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, and well put together, its not flimsy at all.....</li>
            <li>Once the hair is smoothed the puff cuff fits nicely around the hair and does not snag or pull the hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice head piece</li>
            <li>Very much loving the size.  </li>
            <li>The puff cuff has made it so much easier for me to get the perfect cuff without any of the pain</li>
            <li>Definitely handy</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have very dense hair it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>it is well made and has a nice thickness to it</li>
            <li>What kind of customer service is that?</li>
            <li>Hope this helps.s is one honest review that she can&#x27;t delete.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do believe that it should come with some kind of instructions.</li>
            <li>you note would be nice as well.</li>
            <li>actually liked it</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 so that she can enjoy her very own.</li>
            <li>Excellent product works great on my Natural hair, does not pull easy to use, my hair type is 3c</li>
            <li>Very easy to clip and unclip.</li>
            <li>The cuff was very easy to put in and it doesn&#x27;t snag in her hair at all.  </li>
            <li>If you are wondering how some ladies get that perfect high ponytail or puff on top of there head this is the answer.</li>
            <li>Best investment I&#x27;ve made since I&#x27;ve been natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural girls best friend.</li>
            <li>Very easy and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>So easy to use!</li>
            <li>Very easy to put on very light</li>

            <li>Great product, thanks!</li>
            <li>The plastic is very light though.</li>
            <li>You can also set your hair from the night before, its very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It feels very light in my hair, that I even forgot I have it in.</li>
            <li>I loved the PuffCuff so much I ordered two more!</li>
            <li>I love this hair clamp.</li>
            <li>So many clamps/clips are hair destroyers.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have plenty of room to grow! :)</li>
            <li>I just love this clamp.</li>
            <li>maybe will work better  when my hair is longer.</li>
            <li>I love this hair clamp.</li>
            <li>I love, love love it.</li>
            <li>I love this hair clamp.</li>
            <li>wish it were more flexible</li>
            <li>I WILL BUY ANOTHER AS A SPARE :-)</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>so I will see if it does better tomorrow.</li>
            <li>I like my headbands better.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE this puff cuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using this since May 2015 and love it.</li>
            <li>It has saved a many of hair styles for me.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Great for a &amp;#34;no must, no fuss; I really don&#x27;t have time to do my hair&amp;#34; day.</li>
            <li>Love this item, it makes putting my hair in a puff a breaze, plus it removes the hurt that bands cause throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using it more on my daughter though.</li>
            <li>Love, love this clip.  </li>
            <li>Received on time and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I will pass it&lt;br /&gt;along to family members who have more hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to make my puff look any better than I had with a headband.</li>
            <li>so I could buy more.</li>
            <li>You have to be creative with styling for variety.</li>
            <li>I love this hair clamp...</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I have to wait until my hair grow more to know if I like it or not.</li>
            <li>but I love it for my daughter</li>
            <li>gave this 3 stars because it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>After playing with it some more though, I got the hang of how it&#x27;s supposed to work</li>
            <li>I have never been able to create a puff until now.</li>
            <li>then I should be ok</li>
            <li>Love the puffcuff just pull your hair up on top of your head put the puffcuff on and go</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS THING&amp;#62;&amp;#62; need more in case</li>
            <li>I think I need a lot more length and thickness.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with the styles achieved using it.</li>
            <li>Love the PuffIng.</li>
            <li>I get much better results using a modified headband.</li>
            <li>Have to experiment with more styles .</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>but I love everything about the PuffCuff.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It probably would look even better if you braid your hair the night before, to get some cute curls in your puff!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>luck:)</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase another one as a backup just in case :-)</li>
            <li>but I love what the product does.</li>
            <li>Its great for when you need to get out the house fast or when the weather messes up your hairdo</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE the puff cuff for my hair.</li>
            <li>I gather my hair into a ponytail, bring the cuff from the bottom of the ponytail, and clip it on the top.</li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments about my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with this design.</li>
            <li>and  it made my hair look too cute.</li>
            <li>but I think it would look better if my hair were longer.</li>
            <li>My contribution will help support their manufacturing efforts and they will also gift me some FREE puff cuffs for my support!</li>
            <li>There needs to be more than one size for the clip.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I am still growing my hair out</li>
            <li>this would be phenomenal for my hair in 3-4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I could achieve more height with my puff.</li>
            <li>Enjoying the PuffCuff😀</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this clamp</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I love this hair clip.</li>
            <li>I love this design.</li>
            <li>I keep checking to make sure it hasn&#x27;t fallen off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this after putting it through its paces some more.  </li>
            <li>I could have done better with the Elastic band.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I thought it would be able to use it</li>
            <li>I love the ease of using the PuffCuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better to use this for a ponytail/bush then using a ponytail holder.</li>
            <li>Okay I didn&#x27;t use this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments</li>
            <li>it comes through the top.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I bought it in the end</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this clip.  </li>
            <li>the reason for the review were more operator error and not the product.  </li>
            <li>As my hair grew I was no longer able to wear a puffy puff because I couldn&#x27;t get my elastic to stop riding up.</li>
            <li>I love my puff cuff</li>
            <li>Love my puffcuffand</li>
            <li>I love this cuff.  </li>
            <li>Love the concept.</li>
            <li>but i love it.  </li>
            <li>I need to wait for my hair to get longer to be able to use this.</li>
            <li>I love my puffcuff.</li>
            <li>It works better than tying an elastic headband around my head for a puff.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it takes more work for people with thicker hair to get ALL of their hair in there, stretch or not.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the PuffCuff.  </li>
            <li>i love this clip.</li>
            <li>I love love love this clamp.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get it on</li>
            <li>I hope I have better luck.</li>
            <li>Great idea for natural hair!!!</li>
            <li>I just bought my clip last week and put it on this morning on a whim, and I&#x27;m in love!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited when i saw the advertisemen Of this product.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li>Love the product and nice to see women of color using their talents to manufacturing a useful product</li>
            <li>Afro puffs made easy:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and hold in place, but I would love if it had a tighter hold.</li>
            <li>This helps me on days when I do not want to fuss over my hair, quick click , and a nice updo to concure the day.</li>
            <li>and I was able to use it easily without tutorials.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, convenient, and stylish!</li>
            <li>Great item for natural hair ponytails!</li>
            <li>I tried out my new PuffCuff for the first time this weekend and it was AWESOME!!</li>
            <li>It is so much better than the large band!!!</li>
            <li>Over priced and more size choices would be helpful  Cheaply made for the price.  </li>
            <li>this is a great clip for  natural hair</li>
            <li>I thought the 5&amp;#34; would fit my hair, but the PuffCuff Jr. size would probably work better for me.</li>
            <li>Great for natural or relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>also like to see more sizes available.</li>
            <li>For now I will say that this clamp is okay since my hair wasn&#x27;t at the point where I could wear it comfortably.</li>
            <li>Nit really that good for curly hair...</li>
            <li>This baby right here is pain-free!!</li>
            <li>First the good: seems sturdy; easy to use; comfortable to wear; does not snag edges and was delivered within the stated delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>; one is AWESOME because my hair is fine and not very voluminous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet deal!</li>
            <li>so customers have better first time use results! :-)</li>
            <li>Waiting for the other sizes to become available!!!!!</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great product, and does provide you with a full puff! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The clamp opens and closes easily.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to put around my air.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The PuffCuff is made sturdy and is easy to use,  </li>
            <li>The PuffCuff easily holds all my hair without feeling like it&#x27;s pulling on my edges.</li>
            <li>I thought it was easy to use</li>
            <li>The fact that this doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair, it&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s lightweight?</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing my natural hair in puffs and updos and thought that the puff cuff would be a great alternative to my hair scrongie.</li>
            <li>It removed easily though I did see a strand in the hinge.</li>
            <li>Its easy to go in and doesn&#x27;t tug on my edges.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove, my hair has never gotten tangled in it.</li>
            <li>If you have think hair its easy to manipulate the puff.</li>
            <li>It allows you to easily put your hair into an extended ponytail.</li>
            <li>It was easy to put on</li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so incredibly easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Strong clip.</li>
            <li>Its durable, its strong plastic with a metal flexon to allow for repeated bending and flexing.</li>
            <li>I honestly think that this is a good concept, but it needs to go back to the drawing board.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived (really quickly) it was very light weight.</li>
            <li>I wear them high on top of my head and pull my hair forward sort of kind of like a Faux Hawk or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stays secure  through my workouts and comes out easily.</li>
            <li>I think my hair was to fine for this product</li>
            <li>I plan to try the mini for myself since I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work well for fine hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work well for my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine 4b/c hair</li>
            <li>To no avail, the puff cuff doesn&#x27;t work or even stay in my fine wavy/curly hair which is considered to be a 3a hair type.</li>
            <li>worked fine.  </li>
            <li>It works splendid on my hair when it&#x27;s voluminous enough and doesn&#x27;t snag in the slightest.</li>
            <li>Cute, quick and to the point.</li>
            <li>I wear a super curly weave and it keeps it in place!</li>
            <li>I love the concept, and think this is a great styling accessory for naturals who already have limited options.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to use; I got it on the first try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit cheaply made and the edges could be much smoother to avoid catching on your hair.</li>
            <li>But for the amount of hair I have on my head, it really fit the bill.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sturdy but light weight</li>
            <li>THIS IS LOVELY AND WELL WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>Comfortable doesn&#x27;t pull hair no tension headache</li>
            <li>and the clamp didn&#x27;t feel secure.</li>
            <li>The cuff is also comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, it now takes me less than 5 minutes to make the perfect Afro puff!</li>
            <li>Great idea, but this universal 5&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The clamp never feels secure on my head.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t fit my head as shown.</li>
            <li>The clamp was cheaply made with jagged edges&#x3D; lots of snags on my hair.</li>
            <li>Works well for a nice high puff !</li>
            <li>so comfortable some nights I accidentally fall alseep in it.</li>
            <li>It doesnt grab your hair securely at all.</li>
            <li>If I secure it in without gliding it on my hair</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s comfortable for all day wear.</li>
            <li>It feels really light.  </li>
            <li>thank you for making it available.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t fit my puffs at all.  </li>
            <li>I have borderline 3c/4a hair, and I can get my hair in the puffcuff, but it sags and does not hold my hair in place securely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, and intend to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Makes gathering my hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I wear it, but I&#x27;m not pleased, because it doesn&#x27;t fit or look as great as the picture!!!</li>
            <li>which is good that means no pulling or major headaches.</li>
            <li>It creates the perfect puff with very little effort.</li>
            <li>The material is a hard plastic which is good because this makes the item sturdy, the good thing is that it is light  weight.</li>
            <li>I have since found something that actually works and my puffs are amazing!</li>
            <li>I have since found something that actually works and my puffs are amazing!</li>
            <li>I would be interested to find something better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my daughter who has a lot of long curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try it...</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product.  </li>
            <li>My locks fit perfectly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, and the teeth are far enough apart not to snag my locks.</li>
            <li>I am really excited for my hair to grow longer so that I can try and use it again.</li>
            <li>so my curls hang more so over the clip hiding it completely which I love.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to pull your hair out for it to be clean and neat.</li>
            <li>The health of my hair has improved so much because I love the way it looks and it is comfortable and versatile.</li>
            <li>Works great for giving you a wide and secure puff.</li>
            <li>Wonderful it fit all my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, I highly recommend .</li>
            <li>Its just so quick and easy to use for those days when you need to come up with a beautiful style with little work required.  </li>
            <li>the 5 in was too large for my hair, maybe the 3in will hold better.  </li>
            <li>The cuff is priced just right!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this clip.</li>
            <li>Generally I was very pleased with the product</li>
            <li>Wow this PuffCuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My puff has never been so full</li>
            <li>Overall it may be good for some others</li>
            <li>This is no fault of the device, this holds true for anything I try to put around my hair when it is in it&#x27;s shrunken state.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid full price for this item.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the YouTube demos on how to use the Puff Cuff helped me to use the clamp better.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to love it because I thought it would be the answer to my puff prayers.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay in my full head of hair.  </li>
            <li>So much so that ive ordered about 5 more for family members.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I love it soooooooo much that I ordered another one.</li>
            <li>I find it excellent for my thick coily hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice ,with instructions for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I really wish it was more flexible.  </li>
            <li>Everyone was amazed at how full my puff was.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is really thick like a 4c, then this is perfect because the hair should&#x27;nt fall.</li>
            <li>No more trying to create my own holders, this is a good one and seems like it will hold up werll.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable not tight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It you don&#x27;t have a mound of hair this contraption won&#x27;t quite work or fit right.</li>
            <li>It does not snatch my hair and is pretty easy for me to install and remove.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my hair is not long enough to be impressed with it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a home run for me, but I think this could be a great styling tool for a lot of other naturals.</li>
            <li>great way to put thick hair in a cute bun without putting strain on your hair</li>
            <li>We are able to now do cute puffs on her hair and it last all day.</li>
            <li>It gives me a quick up-doo.</li>
            <li>It works GREAT and is much gentler on your head and scalp then the traditional elastic hair tie.</li>
            <li>It came quickly with Prime and was packaged in a padded envelope.  </li>
            <li>i love the nice big puff this gives my fine, natural hair!</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly/swavy type 2C hair and this was really huge for my particular hair.  </li>
            <li>Love it works perfect for my thick natural hair 4 b</li>
            <li>They also liked the idea of the Puffcuff in general.  </li>
            <li>Large and strong.</li>
            <li>This clip does live up to its expectation lovely  </li>
            <li>It came very fast and i was excited to use it.</li>
            <li>There is no metal on the hinge, and it really went in relatively easy.</li>
            <li>When i first opened it, I was impressed by the fact that it felt thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I really like it, and made sure to folow the instructions of gathering my hair into a ponytail first, then putting the PuffCuff on.</li>
            <li>easy to use and very durable.</li>
            <li>big enough yet secure &amp; genteel go contain all my kinks in a beautiful puff.  </li>
            <li>Also good if you want a loose look with straightened hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 3c/4a very thick hair and it works wonderful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair which really surprised me since my hair&#x27;s kind of sensitive.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully for my thin chin length curly hair.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more as gifts for my natural hair friends.</li>
            <li>But definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t realize I had enough for a nice puff.</li>
            <li>And if it works for you, you&#x27;ll probably get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>When you get the hang of it is rather useful</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I think a smaller clamp will work better, but they are still working on making those available.</li>
            <li>When I read about this product on one of my favorite natural hair blogs, I just had to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I make sure to direct people to where they can purchase it.</li>
            <li>agree it would be nice if they came in different colors.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if they offered the smaller sizes on Amazon.com,</li>
            <li>One freshly done hair</li>
            <li>I get it is nice because it is a big hole for your hair to do what it does.</li>
            <li>Fantastic natural hair invention!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is not black, so I have to make sure to cover the clip up with my hair.</li>
            <li>For starters, I want to tell anyone and everyone with extremely curly hair especially 4c that this right here is the BEST invention made!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful but it&#x27;s very large.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a really good thing to use besides elastic bands, shoe strings, banana combs and other stuff.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think my hair texture is right for this item.</li>
            <li>right now I have a $12 thing that just sits in my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote</li>
            <li>and I ordered it right away.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work right.</li>
            <li>I am an African American with natural hair and this is wonderful for doing top ponytails side ponytails very easy to apply and is actually is hidden if your hair has thickness to it.  </li>
            <li>I love this because I can finally wear my hair in a puff which looks full with the cuff.  </li>
            <li>A more flexible clip would allow the teeth to grab my hair more and maybe use less products to hold the shorter strands of hair.</li>
            <li>; is great but just a little large for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this just right for my short natural hair!!!!!</li>
            <li>sometimes i struggle a little bit with closing and removing it, but overall, it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li>but I certainly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made natural hair much easier to wear in a cute style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and makes combing my natural hair a breeze.</li>
            <li>I just wish it came in a smaller diameter for finer hair types or smaller heads - lol.</li>
            <li>it is perfect for her puffy thick 4c hair and she loves that it not tight</li>
            <li>An incredible creation for those with a thick unruly mane!</li>
            <li>Super clever design..a huge improvement from the old banana clips.</li>
            <li>I have 2 and ordered 2 more recently....</li>
            <li>It works great for my thick, kinky hair.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li>As for today I added products to my hair so it made my hair draw up more than what it would be two days later.</li>
            <li>Works great to hold my thick curly hair up without pulling or overly stressing the hair.</li>
            <li>The puff cuff works great on my daughter&#x27;s thick kinky hair.</li>
            <li>I gather my hair in a ponytail first then clamp on my puff cuff.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait until smaller sizes are available!</li>
            <li>A smaller size might work better, though.</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;ve got the Puffcuff exactly where I want it, I then remove the ponytail holder.</li>
            <li>I intend on get about 2 more as back up.</li>
            <li>Would be great for thick hair but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I use it to make the most massive buns.</li>
            <li>My first attempt to use it was nerve wrecking.</li>
            <li>The hooks at the top got caught in my hair and when i tried to correct it i got the entire comb tangled in my hair!</li>
            <li>(which in retrospect was pretty darn funny)</li>
            <li>I gather my hair first, then slip it around my puff and close.  </li>
            <li>Will love to get the next sizes</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about purchasing it at first because of the reviews</li>
            <li>I would probably do better with the smaller</li>
            <li>so i had to put my hair in a pony first then remove the scrunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only used this item once and have not been able to used it again...</li>
            <li>I first tried it with a twistout</li>
            <li>I have been using my puff cuff consistently since I received it.</li>
            <li>:) I am looking forward to when the company starts manufacturing smaller sizes.</li>
            <li>At first I used the incorrect technique to put on the puffcuff</li>
            <li>If you have straight hair, this product is not made for you!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well to make a puff.</li>
            <li>Glad to finally find a clip that will hold all of my hair!</li>
            <li>I am sending this product back mostly on the sucky customer service.</li>
            <li>If someone would have at least reached out to me I would have been happy to give it another try.</li>
            <li>So yes most of this review was about her customer service because I feel that is just as important too, but the product was certainly not worth the money either, it DOES pull hair and get tangled in the teeth</li>
            <li>So yes most of this review was about her customer service because I feel that is just as important too, but the product was certainly not worth the money either, it DOES pull hair and get tangled in the teeth</li>
            <li>This is great for thick coily or curly hair.</li>
            <li>And the fact that I have really thick almost shoulder length 4c hair may have something to do with that, lol.</li>
            <li>I guess I should&#x27;ve paid more attention the similar reviews.  </li>
            <li>I can wear a low puff with my raffia fiber sunhat, for an elegant summer sun look.</li>
            <li>;).  </li>
            <li>Maybe offer larger sizes for us girls with more hair.  </li>
            <li>This product solved that problem and I&#x27;m able to rock a big puff again.</li>
            <li>Way better than a regular scrunchie?</li>
            <li>I can even fold my hair back under the cuff to make my hair look more formal...</li>
            <li>I wish i could get more in different colors.  </li>
            <li>did not fit in my hair good.</li>
            <li>it really works like they say it does if you follow the directions you will have no problem getting it right</li>
            <li>I really like this clip...if you put it in right there are no tangling issues.  </li>
            <li>Really like the cuff, but I just don&#x27;t have the length right now to wear it the way I want to.</li>
            <li>Based on the positive reviews by the majority I will most likely purchase.</li>
            <li>Also would be nice if it came in tortoise shell brown or other fancy options.</li>
            <li>This is a less damaging way to keep your hair out of your face, and it creates a bigger puff (bigger is better right lol).</li>
            <li>The puff cuff is a great idea it just doesn&#x27;t fit everyone unfortunately.</li>
            <li>Iam very eager to see this develop into a line with smaller sizes and more colors.</li>
            <li>have had \\&quot;hand in hair syndrome\\&quot; since I was old enough to do my own hair.</li>
            <li>They really need to work on getting more sizes for different hair types and lengths though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost positive it works for locks and thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I keep seeing positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The size of the cuff means that it holds the hair very loosely - great for comfort but not good for achieving a neat look on 4c hair.</li>
            <li>i pretty much knew the basics on using the clamp.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much Ms. Lash!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The best thing EVER for big curly or african american natural hair.</li>
            <li>I can finally do a high pony and it is big with this love it.  </li>
            <li>My initial response is cool!  </li>
            <li>and I wanted something easy to use besides a big hair band.  </li>
            <li>Need a few more inches of length before I wear this full time.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for the new sizes to come out!!</li>
            <li>I think the clamp should be less than five inches( or more complete instructions given for fine hair)</li>
            <li>It is the only way I can keep my fine, multi-textured hair up and out of the way in a neat pony tail type style that doesn&#x27;t pull on the edges and cause breakage.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the big elastic bands</li>
            <li>I am part of the younger crowd and I will forsure be using this on those days that I need a quick up-do to go to class or even a night out!</li>
            <li>I have very thick 4C hair and this item works great.</li>
            <li>I have very thick curly hair, it works great.</li>
            <li>but, very cumbersome to use on curly afro hair especially if your goal is to have smooth sides.</li>
            <li>The only recommendation is to make additional sizes available.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>I am really looking forward to using this (as hair bands give me headaches).  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it is circular shaped.</li>
            <li>It does get the hair up, but construction is cheap, price definitely does not reflect product.</li>
            <li>This makes fixing much easier.  </li>
            <li>Really convenient for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I see the smaller sizes are available now</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d venture to try again if the smaller size became available.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work out.</li>
            <li>Closing the tool with an elastic is much easier than trying to get the hooks closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you do have to fluff a bit after you get it on and make sure you have</li>
            <li>I Will buy the smaller one as soon as it becomes available.</li>
            <li>However, I wish I could make it tighter, or a smaller size was available.</li>
            <li>I really like the Puff cuff.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much use for it yet as I have havana braids</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this.</li>
            <li>but it really works well with a wash and go.  </li>
            <li>I did the same routine of wetting and putting gel on my edges to make it smooth and neat....</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this comb/clip.</li>
            <li>It was okay not what I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very tender headed.</li>
            <li>Very helpful...</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s making all these posts on her page how she wants people to provide feedback etc</li>
            <li>The construction is simple and cheap.</li>
            <li>I have 4c hair and the PuffCuff holds my updo ponytail in place, and its real durable.</li>
            <li>I think I have to much hair for the cuff.</li>
            <li>Does provide a comfortable hold but the size is too big.</li>
            <li>It is MUCH easier to close than banana clips.  </li>
            <li>Really like the puffcuff.</li>
            <li>I have it to someone who had much thinker hair.</li>
            <li>, it will really help out a lot with my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as using a stretchy band does.</li>
            <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t cause headaches and seems like it&#x27;s much gentler on my hair.</li>
            <li>The edges are smooth enough to not have caused me issue.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>The 5&amp;#34; is too big to securely hold my hair.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice puff and holds the hair in firmly.</li>
            <li>It would also be nice to have a few color options as well.</li>
            <li>Right now the price is a bit high, but I can understand since this is a new product.</li>
            <li>I really love the concept of the Puff Cuff, but for my hair (which I thought was full and thick) it was too large.  </li>
            <li>excited about the smaller sizes to come so my daughter can use one too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited for them to get different sizes/colors.</li>
            <li>My hair covers the clamp completely, has a nice round circumference and looks so pretty.</li>
            <li>I love that this doesn&#x27;t force my hair into a small space and that my curls can be wild and free.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing especially if you don&#x27;t have long hair</li>
            <li>This thing is huge, you can&#x27;t adjust the tightness of it, is not seamless, and cost too much for what you get.</li>
            <li>My hair probably isn&#x27;t quite long enough yet for this to be effective</li>
            <li>My hair is short-medium length right now, but my big puff looks pretty substantial.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done the afro-puff hair style with random accessories that I&#x27;ve rigged together and was thrilled to find one accessory that could easily achieve the look.  </li>
            <li>I usually try to get a puff pretty much on the top of my head, so maybe it&#x27;s the style I&#x27;m choosing</li>
            <li>That is NOT good a good business practice.</li>
            <li>its a cool idea wish there were smaller size clamps.</li>
            <li>The curve of the clamp is too large and wide to fit my head</li>
            <li>She will continue using her elastic  headbands which works much better and cost a lot less.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this my hair was a bit shorter so more of the clamp was shown and less hair.</li>
            <li>mayve when they finally release the smaller version, will be better</li>
            <li>Would love smaller size same.</li>
            <li>Just wished it was a bit more solid to last longer.  </li>
            <li>I love this - such a simple idea but genius concept!</li>
            <li>So in my opinion if you have short hair, the smaller cuffs they are coming out with would probably work better for you.</li>
            <li>It makes a decent puff, but I think I will order the 3&amp;#34; as soon as I can.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s secure and loose, so i have no worries about damaging my edges.</li>
            <li>I love that I can wear a puff now and not worry about getting a headache from it being too tight</li>
            <li>The thing that I like the most is that it doesn&#x27;t feel tight or pull my hair in any way.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this hair clamp.  </li>
            <li>The price was a bit high for a hair clamp, but I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m rating it high because I like the construction</li>
            <li>I can wear my raffia-visor sunhat when I wear the puff high-</li>
            <li>I brought this with high hopes</li>
            <li>but really what she means is she only wants positive feedback.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that I would have thought of the idea first!</li>
            <li>It takse a little more time trying to get all of my hair into this thing</li>
            <li>Excellent for thick natural hair, does not tug at the hair or hold too tight.</li>
            <li>The edges are sharp and easily gets caught in my 4c hair.</li>
            <li>It was so hard to get it all in a nice puff ball pony tail.</li>
            <li>This thing saves me SO much time on busy mornings.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very neat tool to have for natural hair.</li>
            <li>This clip is great for thick wavy hair ,long dread locks ,and braids.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was not negative at all</li>
            <li>At least this is one honest review that she can&#x27;t delete.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll simply gift it to someone at work with curlier hair with the hope she will find it useful.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical because I thought that it could be cheap and easy to break</li>
            <li>its very sturdy as well as easy to apply if you&#x27;re looking for something to replace those double stretched headbands</li>
            <li>It simply slides right</li>
            <li>i noticed that there are other sizes available but not for ordering yet.  </li>
            <li>The seams snagged my strands and the teeth just caused tangles, making the product not really coily-girl friendly.  </li>
            <li>I cant wait for the new sizes to be introduced.</li>
            <li>It looks cute and elegant, and I get way more volume than my sad little ponytails (which I will never go back to).</li>
            <li>This will probably work better when hair is a few days old</li>
            <li>When I visited the official PuffCuff website there were size options, but currently the only size available to order is the largest 5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The only reason I rated 4 stars, instead of 5,  is because I needed the smaller size and it is not yet available.  </li>
            <li>I would not suggest purchasing this item unless you are fine w/ giving your money to a business that does not really care about its customers!!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for anyone with natural hair regardless of length.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any natural.</li>
            <li>I have better puffs when I just use a plain old Goody hair band.</li>
            <li>It is NOT AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE IN THE UK, which I think is a great pity because there is definitely a market for it here.</li>
            <li>Did exactly what I wanted it to do, hold my hair in a larger puff!</li>
            <li>received the item last week and used for the first time on a wash n go.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try it  with my 4c natural hair!</li>
            <li>Makes my fine thin 4a hair look full and luscious.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smooth my edges down since that does not work for my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: The owner did end up replying to my message and this is what she said: \\&quot;I&#x27;m trying to launch a new product and would like public post to be as positive as possible\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about my high puffs without the pain of a tight headband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>Be weary of companies that only show positive reviews.</li>
            <li>the sides and back are short while the top is long.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and its not tight at all!  </li>
            <li>cause everybody&#x27;s is different some people&#x27;s more dense others less.</li>
            <li>If your hair tends to hang, I would definitely wait until it&#x27;s dry and has poofed up a bit before attempting to secure it with the PuffCuff.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s too big, but it just makes my hair kind of flop down around it instead of actually being a puff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s secure without being tight.</li>
            <li>and this holds it securely but not too tight.</li>
            <li>This accessory allows me to wear a puff on top or in the back and not pull tightly at all.</li>
            <li>does not fit too tight, which is good..</li>
            <li>It is a great concept, but entirely too big for my hair (and I have a lot of thick curly hair)!</li>
            <li>The PuffCuff sat at the top of my crown and there was a little afro puff above that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is thick very thick so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>As a busy mom, I appreciate the ease of this hair accessory.</li>
            <li>for all my natural curly girls</li>
            <li>I have natural hair however this doesn&#x27;t hold my hair up my hair</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going natural, you need the PuffCuff😍</li>
            <li>I also added a product image for those who would like to see the cuff in action.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it on a week old wash-and-go</li>
            <li>I opened it to far</li>
            <li>This item does not work one natural hair.</li>
            <li>I might get one for my 9yr old.</li>
            <li>this is something a natural curly girl needs.</li>
            <li>I purchased the puff cuff directly from the manufacturer after reading the reviews here...</li>
            <li>I had a mini fight tryong to get all my natural hair in , but once I got the clasps hooked, I was hooked.</li>
            <li>But when I used it for an old WNG...</li>
            <li>I am the type of natural who likes to wear my hair out.</li>
            <li>I really like this product I wish it came in different sizes.</li>
            <li>It reminded me of those old school banana clips and those always got tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li>It reminded me of those old school banana clips and those always got tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li>My scalp is sensitive to hairpins and rubber bands</li>
            <li>Gave mine to my adult daughter, I&#x27;m ordering another.</li>
            <li>Will be very grateful for smaller sizes to come nd</li>
            <li>I will recommend this product to my natural friends.</li>
            <li>I really like this, just open gather your hair and click it to close.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural, 4a texture</li>
            <li>From reading prior reviews it looks like it helps to really know your hair.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>but then I looked like my four-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>and i recommend it to any natural.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed for my natural hair</li>
            <li>My hair ranges between mostly 4a/b (with a few sprinkles of 3c) and this clamp allows me to let my curls hang free without being bunched in a hair tie or scrungee, which I would need at least 5 or 6 of them to keep my hair up.</li>
            <li>May work better on thin or straight hair.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the PuffCuff Hair Clamp and would recommend the PuffCuff Clamp to anyone that has Thick, Coily hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cuff for my thick, 4b natural hair.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of tries to get it on right.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it really is a great product and I will be buying another one soon to replace my broken one.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve gotten older, no matter how big the rubber band/child&#x27;s headband I use to make a puff, my head alway hurts by early afternoon.</li>
            <li>Was kinda loose at first (I&#x27;m used to my puffs being a bit tighter).</li>
            <li>I had a nice big puff that wasn&#x27;t too tight or loose.  </li>
            <li>For my thick 4c hair it&#x27;s a little hard to close, but for my daughter&#x27;s 4A hair she has no problems with it and it really gives her the perfect puff!</li>
            <li>The puff cuff it isn&#x27;t a very tight fit.</li>
            <li>It seems sturdy and like it will last so the price is decent considering you&#x27;ll have it for a while.</li>
            <li>There is no need to fit the teeth down into the hair, simply lie the cuff around the hair and close it.</li>
            <li>I wear high puffs and low puffs.</li>
            <li>I was able to make a nice full messy bun as the cuff doesn&#x27;t condense the hair at the base ( like elastics and regular banana clips) which allows me to keep my hair&#x27;s volume.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not really sure whose head it WOULD fit).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not good for shorter hair like mine, but the longer, the better for optimal effect.</li>
            <li>MY hair is not thick enough for this but will be....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been stalking this product for months waiting anxiously for it to finally be available for purchase and when it was I snapped it up.</li>
            <li>Normal banana clips would pop open in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li>I am curious whether or not those who have had problems with the tool had detangled, moisturized and oiled their coily hair first.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull at my edges, way better than wearing a tight ponytail ( I&#x27;m in the military</li>
            <li>Go to your local BSS, find the extra large banana clips and use those instead</li>
            <li>I just received the new smaller ones in the mail and have been experimenting with them.  </li>
            <li>maybe it will take more than a few tries depending on texture and length</li>
            <li>The $11 price tag may be a bit much for such a simple tool</li>
            <li>I will keep at it, but with my hair type it does not go on easily like it does for the ladies who slick their edges back on those YouTube videos.</li>
            <li>The hook clips on top  of each other so keeping my huge puff tight while trying to lock the clamp together without getting it caught in my puff gets annoying very quickly!  </li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is very thick and coily.</li>
            <li>I love my puff cuff and have worn it almost everyday since receiving it!!!</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to come across other reviews (on other sites)</li>
            <li>My hair does not tangle in it, however I think it is because I know that it could if I am not careful when using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also like to get my hands on the smaller version for my 10 year old.</li>
            <li>Trying to reposition it without taking it out completely and starting over is just gonna cause a problem.</li>
            <li>but apparently it was not the \\&quot;GOOD\\</li>
            <li>I have only used this product 3 times but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>but so far this is a total keeper for me.  </li>
            <li>I do however love the concept where the edges of the air aren&#x27;t being pulled unnecessarily</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine thin nd the 5\\&quot; size is too big</li>
            <li>I did have to choose between this or two bottles of my most expensive fave conditioner with a little money leftover for hair accessories, but this was well worth the investment, I would made the choice over again!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear it because my hair not long enough naturally to sit on to of my head.</li>
            <li>The round shape is good, but by the time you figure out that you don&#x27; t have thick enough hair to fill this size clamp, you will take it out to re-do, only to discover that if you are not extremely careful, your hair will get tangled up causing difficulty removing the clamp.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not sitting anywhere near flat against my scalp</li>
            <li>But it really helps if you hold your hair as if you were putting it into a pony tail with one hand and put on the puff cuff with the other hand.</li>
            <li>I do wish that there was an option for smaller sizes, and different colors, however I know that with any business expansion tends to come after a product has hit the market, and feedback is taken into consideration, when developing new products or tweeking current products.</li>
            <li>Only really works for me when I wet my hair.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s bulky, I had to open it as far as possible or it would get caught in my hair.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my puff as big as it normally is with my stretched headbands</li>
            <li>Does not work for 4b/4c hair, if it&#x27;s not stretched!</li>
            <li>For the price I thought it would be a little higher quality</li>
            <li>But they are apparently coming out with smaller models soon.</li>
            <li>Not big enough to fit around my thick puff.</li>
            <li>Using the puff cuff allowed my puff or bun to appear thick and full of curls.</li>
            <li>Having said that the problem is my hair tangles really easily in it and it can be tough to close.</li>
            <li>Even though I would be excited and anxious to try out the clamp when it arrived, I would not do so if my hair was dry and tangled.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just too large to wear tightly..</li>
            <li>No more headaches, it&#x27;s perfect for a bad hair day, &amp;#34;pineapples&amp;#34; at night, the gym, etc.</li>
            <li>Not for me, but will give away as a gift to someone with super thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>My hair is super thick 4a/4b</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super thick</li>
            <li>Super duper thick hair.....</li>
            <li>My hair is not super long, but it is very very dense.  </li>
            <li>It works, but my hair is not long enough for it (yet).</li>
            <li>Perhaps the teeth are not long enough.</li>
            <li>If your hair is a little less kinky (mines isn&#x27;t as coily) wait until the smaller clamps are available and try it again.</li>
            <li>I value good customer service and unfortunately a lot of business&#x27;s lack it these days especially a lot of black businesses</li>
            <li>its really big and can even keep my super thick big hair in check.</li>
            <li>I obviously don&#x27;t know if the product is good or bad, but it seems like a really terrific concept for curly hair updo</li>

            <li> Purchased this for my toddler &amp; she looks beautiful with her puff.</li>
            <li> and my hair has been in a beautiful puff courtesy of my clamp</li>
            <li> Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great on my transitioning hair.  </li>
            <li> I think this would be great if it was made of a move flexible material but, as it is, I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> is a great idea , but the clip is way to bid.</li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> It holds up great on my puff also.</li>
            <li> Would work great if I had purchased the correct size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because it doesn&#x27;t pull or try to break my hair like bobby pins.</li>
            <li> However great for puffs,poofs,big ponytails.</li>
            <li> This item allows me to rock a great updo.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> It works for me great.</li>
            <li> I was happy when the package arrived, pulled my hair up and didn&#x27;t like it that the gadget snagged my hair.  </li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> This is the best accessory I own.</li>
            <li> Great idea for a product.</li>
            <li> but maybe that will be released in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> so she&#x27;s happy</li>
            <li> but it does work great on my 3c hair.</li>
            <li> This was great to do my puffs with..</li>
            <li> Just give it a try, if you don&#x27;t like it Amazon is so great and doing refunds or returns.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Great Product.</li>
            <li> This is a great invention.</li>
            <li> Great idea</li>
            <li> Great item.</li>
            <li> LOL)</li>
            <li> Its a great concept</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m still happy I bought the puff cuff</li>
            <li> Besides that, its a great product.</li>
            <li> Great for kinky hair.</li>
            <li> Great investment for naturals.</li>
            <li> This clamp is great for those days that I cannot detangle her hair.  </li>
            <li> It gives her a great updo without straining her edges.  </li>
            <li> I love it !!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s now her favorite hair do!!</li>
            <li> Sturdy and gathers the hair nicely!</li>
            <li> I would love it in a 3 inch size, that&#x27;d be perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I am loving my Puff Cuff!  </li>
            <li> Perfect, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the puff cuff clamp it gives me the perfect size puff.</li>
            <li> Awesome idea, would love to give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be an awesome hair tool!!! :)</li>
            <li> The best part is that my puff is very full unlike when I put my hair in scrunchie/goody bands.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great!</li>
            <li> Great way to keep my hair tidy but without the headache incurred from elastics.  </li>
            <li> I though it would be good for my hair</li>
            <li> Goody band works just as good and cheaper.</li>
            <li> the not so good</li>
            <li> I loved the cuff.</li>
            <li> Idea is good but doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> The puff looks good.</li>
            <li> I had already had banana clips and attempted using those, but they were way to constricting and did not give a good look.  </li>
            <li> but it makes my puffs look gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Works great for bunning too and doesn&#x27;t cause stress on the edges like panty hose and the like is apt to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly sturdy, and does what it says it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> It is a great idea and alternative to the banana clip as it is very light and doesn&#x27;t pull and tug on your hair when you use it..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the PuffCuff!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair clip!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> love that!  </li>
            <li> I love this banana clip for my curly mane!</li>
            <li> Love this thing!</li>
            <li> It is great quality and durable, unlike store bought hair clamps that break easily with one use.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and so great for not messing with your hair.</li>
            <li> I was VERY excited to get it!</li>
            <li> The puff cuff hair clamp is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, and well put together, its not flimsy at all.....</li>
            <li> Once the hair is smoothed the puff cuff fits nicely around the hair and does not snag or pull the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice head piece</li>
            <li> Very much loving the size.  </li>
            <li> The puff cuff has made it so much easier for me to get the perfect cuff without any of the pain</li>
            <li> Definitely handy</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have very dense hair it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li> it is well made and has a nice thickness to it</li>
            <li> What kind of customer service is that?</li>
            <li> Hope this helps.s is one honest review that she can&#x27;t delete.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do believe that it should come with some kind of instructions.</li>
            <li> you note would be nice as well.</li>
            <li> actually liked it</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 so that she can enjoy her very own.</li>
            <li> Excellent product works great on my Natural hair, does not pull easy to use, my hair type is 3c</li>
            <li> Very easy to clip and unclip.</li>
            <li> The cuff was very easy to put in and it doesn&#x27;t snag in her hair at all.  </li>
            <li> If you are wondering how some ladies get that perfect high ponytail or puff on top of there head this is the answer.</li>
            <li> Best investment I&#x27;ve made since I&#x27;ve been natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural girls best friend.</li>
            <li> Very easy and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> So easy to use!</li>
            <li> Very easy to put on very light</li>

            <li> Great product, thanks!</li>
            <li> The plastic is very light though.</li>
            <li> You can also set your hair from the night before, its very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It feels very light in my hair, that I even forgot I have it in.</li>
            <li> I loved the PuffCuff so much I ordered two more!</li>
            <li> I love this hair clamp.</li>
            <li> So many clamps/clips are hair destroyers.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have plenty of room to grow! :)</li>
            <li> I just love this clamp.</li>
            <li> maybe will work better  when my hair is longer.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clamp.</li>
            <li> I love, love love it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clamp.</li>

            <li> I WILL BUY ANOTHER AS A SPARE :-)</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> so I will see if it does better tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I like my headbands better.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE this puff cuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since May 2015 and love it.</li>
            <li> It has saved a many of hair styles for me.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Great for a &amp;#34;no must, no fuss; I really don&#x27;t have time to do my hair&amp;#34; day.</li>
            <li> Love this item, it makes putting my hair in a puff a breaze, plus it removes the hurt that bands cause throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using it more on my daughter though.</li>
            <li> Love, love this clip.  </li>
            <li> Received on time and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I will pass it&lt;br /&gt;along to family members who have more hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to make my puff look any better than I had with a headband.</li>
            <li> so I could buy more.</li>
            <li> You have to be creative with styling for variety.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clamp...</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> I have to wait until my hair grow more to know if I like it or not.</li>
            <li> but I love it for my daughter</li>
            <li> gave this 3 stars because it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> After playing with it some more though, I got the hang of how it&#x27;s supposed to work</li>
            <li> I have never been able to create a puff until now.</li>
            <li> then I should be ok</li>
            <li> Love the puffcuff just pull your hair up on top of your head put the puffcuff on and go</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS THING&amp;#62;&amp;#62; need more in case</li>
            <li> I think I need a lot more length and thickness.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with the styles achieved using it.</li>
            <li> Love the PuffIng.</li>
            <li> I get much better results using a modified headband.</li>
            <li> Have to experiment with more styles .</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> but I love everything about the PuffCuff.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It probably would look even better if you braid your hair the night before, to get some cute curls in your puff!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> luck:)</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase another one as a backup just in case :-)</li>
            <li> but I love what the product does.</li>
            <li> Its great for when you need to get out the house fast or when the weather messes up your hairdo</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE the puff cuff for my hair.</li>
            <li> I gather my hair into a ponytail, bring the cuff from the bottom of the ponytail, and clip it on the top.</li>
            <li> I have had so many compliments about my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this design.</li>
            <li> and  it made my hair look too cute.</li>
            <li> but I think it would look better if my hair were longer.</li>
            <li> My contribution will help support their manufacturing efforts and they will also gift me some FREE puff cuffs for my support!</li>
            <li> There needs to be more than one size for the clip.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am still growing my hair out</li>
            <li> this would be phenomenal for my hair in 3-4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I could achieve more height with my puff.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the PuffCuff😀</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this clamp</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip.</li>
            <li> I love this design.</li>
            <li> I keep checking to make sure it hasn&#x27;t fallen off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this after putting it through its paces some more.  </li>
            <li> I could have done better with the Elastic band.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I thought it would be able to use it</li>
            <li> I love the ease of using the PuffCuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot better to use this for a ponytail/bush then using a ponytail holder.</li>
            <li> Okay I didn&#x27;t use this product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments</li>
            <li> it comes through the top.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I bought it in the end</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this clip.  </li>
            <li> the reason for the review were more operator error and not the product.  </li>
            <li> As my hair grew I was no longer able to wear a puffy puff because I couldn&#x27;t get my elastic to stop riding up.</li>
            <li> I love my puff cuff</li>
            <li> Love my puffcuffand</li>
            <li> I love this cuff.  </li>
            <li> Love the concept.</li>
            <li> but i love it.  </li>
            <li> I need to wait for my hair to get longer to be able to use this.</li>
            <li> I love my puffcuff.</li>
            <li> It works better than tying an elastic headband around my head for a puff.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it takes more work for people with thicker hair to get ALL of their hair in there, stretch or not.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the PuffCuff.  </li>
            <li> i love this clip.</li>
            <li> I love love love this clamp.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get it on</li>
            <li> I hope I have better luck.</li>
            <li> Great idea for natural hair!!!</li>
            <li> I just bought my clip last week and put it on this morning on a whim, and I&#x27;m in love!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited when i saw the advertisemen Of this product.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li> Love the product and nice to see women of color using their talents to manufacturing a useful product</li>
            <li> Afro puffs made easy:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and hold in place, but I would love if it had a tighter hold.</li>
            <li> This helps me on days when I do not want to fuss over my hair, quick click , and a nice updo to concure the day.</li>
            <li> and I was able to use it easily without tutorials.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, convenient, and stylish!</li>
            <li> Great item for natural hair ponytails!</li>
            <li> I tried out my new PuffCuff for the first time this weekend and it was AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> It is so much better than the large band!!!</li>
            <li> Over priced and more size choices would be helpful  Cheaply made for the price.  </li>
            <li> this is a great clip for  natural hair</li>
            <li> I thought the 5&amp;#34; would fit my hair, but the PuffCuff Jr. size would probably work better for me.</li>
            <li> Great for natural or relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> also like to see more sizes available.</li>
            <li> For now I will say that this clamp is okay since my hair wasn&#x27;t at the point where I could wear it comfortably.</li>
            <li> Nit really that good for curly hair...</li>
            <li> This baby right here is pain-free!!</li>
            <li> First the good: seems sturdy; easy to use; comfortable to wear; does not snag edges and was delivered within the stated delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> ; one is AWESOME because my hair is fine and not very voluminous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sweet deal!</li>
            <li> so customers have better first time use results! :-)</li>
            <li> Waiting for the other sizes to become available!!!!!</li>
            <li> Overall it is a great product, and does provide you with a full puff! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The clamp opens and closes easily.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to put around my air.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The PuffCuff is made sturdy and is easy to use,  </li>
            <li> The PuffCuff easily holds all my hair without feeling like it&#x27;s pulling on my edges.</li>
            <li> I thought it was easy to use</li>
            <li> The fact that this doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair, it&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s lightweight?</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing my natural hair in puffs and updos and thought that the puff cuff would be a great alternative to my hair scrongie.</li>
            <li> It removed easily though I did see a strand in the hinge.</li>
            <li> Its easy to go in and doesn&#x27;t tug on my edges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to remove, my hair has never gotten tangled in it.</li>
            <li> If you have think hair its easy to manipulate the puff.</li>
            <li> It allows you to easily put your hair into an extended ponytail.</li>
            <li> It was easy to put on</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so incredibly easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Strong clip.</li>
            <li> Its durable, its strong plastic with a metal flexon to allow for repeated bending and flexing.</li>
            <li> I honestly think that this is a good concept, but it needs to go back to the drawing board.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived (really quickly) it was very light weight.</li>
            <li> I wear them high on top of my head and pull my hair forward sort of kind of like a Faux Hawk or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays secure  through my workouts and comes out easily.</li>
            <li> I think my hair was to fine for this product</li>
            <li> I plan to try the mini for myself since I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work well for fine hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well for my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine 4b/c hair</li>
            <li> To no avail, the puff cuff doesn&#x27;t work or even stay in my fine wavy/curly hair which is considered to be a 3a hair type.</li>
            <li> worked fine.  </li>
            <li> It works splendid on my hair when it&#x27;s voluminous enough and doesn&#x27;t snag in the slightest.</li>
            <li> Cute, quick and to the point.</li>
            <li> I wear a super curly weave and it keeps it in place!</li>
            <li> I love the concept, and think this is a great styling accessory for naturals who already have limited options.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to use; I got it on the first try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit cheaply made and the edges could be much smoother to avoid catching on your hair.</li>
            <li> But for the amount of hair I have on my head, it really fit the bill.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sturdy but light weight</li>
            <li> THIS IS LOVELY AND WELL WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Comfortable doesn&#x27;t pull hair no tension headache</li>
            <li> and the clamp didn&#x27;t feel secure.</li>
            <li> The cuff is also comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, it now takes me less than 5 minutes to make the perfect Afro puff!</li>
            <li> Great idea, but this universal 5&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The clamp never feels secure on my head.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t fit my head as shown.</li>
            <li> The clamp was cheaply made with jagged edges&#x3D; lots of snags on my hair.</li>
            <li> Works well for a nice high puff !</li>
            <li> so comfortable some nights I accidentally fall alseep in it.</li>
            <li> It doesnt grab your hair securely at all.</li>
            <li> If I secure it in without gliding it on my hair</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s comfortable for all day wear.</li>
            <li> It feels really light.  </li>
            <li> thank you for making it available.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit my puffs at all.  </li>
            <li> I have borderline 3c/4a hair, and I can get my hair in the puffcuff, but it sags and does not hold my hair in place securely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, and intend to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Makes gathering my hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I wear it, but I&#x27;m not pleased, because it doesn&#x27;t fit or look as great as the picture!!!</li>
            <li> which is good that means no pulling or major headaches.</li>
            <li> It creates the perfect puff with very little effort.</li>
            <li> The material is a hard plastic which is good because this makes the item sturdy, the good thing is that it is light  weight.</li>
            <li> I have since found something that actually works and my puffs are amazing!</li>
            <li> I have since found something that actually works and my puffs are amazing!</li>
            <li> I would be interested to find something better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my daughter who has a lot of long curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try it...</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product.  </li>
            <li> My locks fit perfectly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, and the teeth are far enough apart not to snag my locks.</li>
            <li> I am really excited for my hair to grow longer so that I can try and use it again.</li>
            <li> so my curls hang more so over the clip hiding it completely which I love.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to pull your hair out for it to be clean and neat.</li>
            <li> The health of my hair has improved so much because I love the way it looks and it is comfortable and versatile.</li>
            <li> Works great for giving you a wide and secure puff.</li>
            <li> Wonderful it fit all my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I highly recommend .</li>
            <li> Its just so quick and easy to use for those days when you need to come up with a beautiful style with little work required.  </li>
            <li> the 5 in was too large for my hair, maybe the 3in will hold better.  </li>
            <li> The cuff is priced just right!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this clip.</li>
            <li> Generally I was very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Wow this PuffCuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My puff has never been so full</li>
            <li> Overall it may be good for some others</li>
            <li> This is no fault of the device, this holds true for anything I try to put around my hair when it is in it&#x27;s shrunken state.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid full price for this item.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the YouTube demos on how to use the Puff Cuff helped me to use the clamp better.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to love it because I thought it would be the answer to my puff prayers.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in my full head of hair.  </li>
            <li> So much so that ive ordered about 5 more for family members.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I love it soooooooo much that I ordered another one.</li>
            <li> I find it excellent for my thick coily hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice ,with instructions for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I really wish it was more flexible.  </li>
            <li> Everyone was amazed at how full my puff was.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is really thick like a 4c, then this is perfect because the hair should&#x27;nt fall.</li>
            <li> No more trying to create my own holders, this is a good one and seems like it will hold up werll.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable not tight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It you don&#x27;t have a mound of hair this contraption won&#x27;t quite work or fit right.</li>
            <li> It does not snatch my hair and is pretty easy for me to install and remove.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is not long enough to be impressed with it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a home run for me, but I think this could be a great styling tool for a lot of other naturals.</li>
            <li> great way to put thick hair in a cute bun without putting strain on your hair</li>
            <li> We are able to now do cute puffs on her hair and it last all day.</li>
            <li> It gives me a quick up-doo.</li>
            <li> It works GREAT and is much gentler on your head and scalp then the traditional elastic hair tie.</li>
            <li> It came quickly with Prime and was packaged in a padded envelope.  </li>
            <li> i love the nice big puff this gives my fine, natural hair!</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly/swavy type 2C hair and this was really huge for my particular hair.  </li>
            <li> Love it works perfect for my thick natural hair 4 b</li>
            <li> They also liked the idea of the Puffcuff in general.  </li>
            <li> Large and strong.</li>
            <li> This clip does live up to its expectation lovely  </li>
            <li> It came very fast and i was excited to use it.</li>
            <li> There is no metal on the hinge, and it really went in relatively easy.</li>
            <li> When i first opened it, I was impressed by the fact that it felt thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I really like it, and made sure to folow the instructions of gathering my hair into a ponytail first, then putting the PuffCuff on.</li>
            <li> easy to use and very durable.</li>
            <li> big enough yet secure &amp; genteel go contain all my kinks in a beautiful puff.  </li>
            <li> Also good if you want a loose look with straightened hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 3c/4a very thick hair and it works wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair which really surprised me since my hair&#x27;s kind of sensitive.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully for my thin chin length curly hair.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more as gifts for my natural hair friends.</li>
            <li> But definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize I had enough for a nice puff.</li>
            <li> And if it works for you, you&#x27;ll probably get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> When you get the hang of it is rather useful</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I think a smaller clamp will work better, but they are still working on making those available.</li>
            <li> When I read about this product on one of my favorite natural hair blogs, I just had to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I make sure to direct people to where they can purchase it.</li>
            <li> agree it would be nice if they came in different colors.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if they offered the smaller sizes on Amazon.com,</li>
            <li> One freshly done hair</li>
            <li> I get it is nice because it is a big hole for your hair to do what it does.</li>
            <li> Fantastic natural hair invention!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is not black, so I have to make sure to cover the clip up with my hair.</li>
            <li> For starters, I want to tell anyone and everyone with extremely curly hair especially 4c that this right here is the BEST invention made!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful but it&#x27;s very large.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a really good thing to use besides elastic bands, shoe strings, banana combs and other stuff.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think my hair texture is right for this item.</li>
            <li> right now I have a $12 thing that just sits in my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote</li>
            <li> and I ordered it right away.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work right.</li>
            <li> I am an African American with natural hair and this is wonderful for doing top ponytails side ponytails very easy to apply and is actually is hidden if your hair has thickness to it.  </li>
            <li> I love this because I can finally wear my hair in a puff which looks full with the cuff.  </li>
            <li> A more flexible clip would allow the teeth to grab my hair more and maybe use less products to hold the shorter strands of hair.</li>
            <li> ; is great but just a little large for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this just right for my short natural hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> sometimes i struggle a little bit with closing and removing it, but overall, it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li> but I certainly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made natural hair much easier to wear in a cute style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and makes combing my natural hair a breeze.</li>
            <li> I just wish it came in a smaller diameter for finer hair types or smaller heads - lol.</li>
            <li> it is perfect for her puffy thick 4c hair and she loves that it not tight</li>
            <li> An incredible creation for those with a thick unruly mane!</li>
            <li> Super clever design..a huge improvement from the old banana clips.</li>
            <li> I have 2 and ordered 2 more recently....</li>
            <li> It works great for my thick, kinky hair.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> As for today I added products to my hair so it made my hair draw up more than what it would be two days later.</li>
            <li> Works great to hold my thick curly hair up without pulling or overly stressing the hair.</li>
            <li> The puff cuff works great on my daughter&#x27;s thick kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I gather my hair in a ponytail first then clamp on my puff cuff.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait until smaller sizes are available!</li>
            <li> A smaller size might work better, though.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve got the Puffcuff exactly where I want it, I then remove the ponytail holder.</li>
            <li> I intend on get about 2 more as back up.</li>
            <li> Would be great for thick hair but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I use it to make the most massive buns.</li>
            <li> My first attempt to use it was nerve wrecking.</li>
            <li> The hooks at the top got caught in my hair and when i tried to correct it i got the entire comb tangled in my hair!</li>
            <li> (which in retrospect was pretty darn funny)</li>
            <li> I gather my hair first, then slip it around my puff and close.  </li>
            <li> Will love to get the next sizes</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about purchasing it at first because of the reviews</li>
            <li> I would probably do better with the smaller</li>
            <li> so i had to put my hair in a pony first then remove the scrunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used this item once and have not been able to used it again...</li>
            <li> I first tried it with a twistout</li>
            <li> I have been using my puff cuff consistently since I received it.</li>
            <li> :) I am looking forward to when the company starts manufacturing smaller sizes.</li>
            <li> At first I used the incorrect technique to put on the puffcuff</li>
            <li> If you have straight hair, this product is not made for you!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well to make a puff.</li>
            <li> Glad to finally find a clip that will hold all of my hair!</li>
            <li> I am sending this product back mostly on the sucky customer service.</li>
            <li> If someone would have at least reached out to me I would have been happy to give it another try.</li>
            <li> So yes most of this review was about her customer service because I feel that is just as important too, but the product was certainly not worth the money either, it DOES pull hair and get tangled in the teeth</li>

            <li> This is great for thick coily or curly hair.</li>
            <li> And the fact that I have really thick almost shoulder length 4c hair may have something to do with that, lol.</li>
            <li> I guess I should&#x27;ve paid more attention the similar reviews.  </li>
            <li> I can wear a low puff with my raffia fiber sunhat, for an elegant summer sun look.</li>
            <li> ;).  </li>
            <li> Maybe offer larger sizes for us girls with more hair.  </li>
            <li> This product solved that problem and I&#x27;m able to rock a big puff again.</li>
            <li> Way better than a regular scrunchie?</li>
            <li> I can even fold my hair back under the cuff to make my hair look more formal...</li>
            <li> I wish i could get more in different colors.  </li>
            <li> did not fit in my hair good.</li>
            <li> it really works like they say it does if you follow the directions you will have no problem getting it right</li>
            <li> I really like this clip...if you put it in right there are no tangling issues.  </li>
            <li> Really like the cuff, but I just don&#x27;t have the length right now to wear it the way I want to.</li>
            <li> Based on the positive reviews by the majority I will most likely purchase.</li>
            <li> Also would be nice if it came in tortoise shell brown or other fancy options.</li>
            <li> This is a less damaging way to keep your hair out of your face, and it creates a bigger puff (bigger is better right lol).</li>
            <li> The puff cuff is a great idea it just doesn&#x27;t fit everyone unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Iam very eager to see this develop into a line with smaller sizes and more colors.</li>
            <li> have had \\&quot;hand in hair syndrome\\&quot; since I was old enough to do my own hair.</li>
            <li> They really need to work on getting more sizes for different hair types and lengths though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost positive it works for locks and thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I keep seeing positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The size of the cuff means that it holds the hair very loosely - great for comfort but not good for achieving a neat look on 4c hair.</li>
            <li> i pretty much knew the basics on using the clamp.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much Ms. Lash!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The best thing EVER for big curly or african american natural hair.</li>
            <li> I can finally do a high pony and it is big with this love it.  </li>
            <li> My initial response is cool!  </li>
            <li> and I wanted something easy to use besides a big hair band.  </li>
            <li> Need a few more inches of length before I wear this full time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for the new sizes to come out!!</li>
            <li> I think the clamp should be less than five inches( or more complete instructions given for fine hair)</li>
            <li> It is the only way I can keep my fine, multi-textured hair up and out of the way in a neat pony tail type style that doesn&#x27;t pull on the edges and cause breakage.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the big elastic bands</li>
            <li> I am part of the younger crowd and I will forsure be using this on those days that I need a quick up-do to go to class or even a night out!</li>
            <li> I have very thick 4C hair and this item works great.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair, it works great.</li>
            <li> but, very cumbersome to use on curly afro hair especially if your goal is to have smooth sides.</li>
            <li> The only recommendation is to make additional sizes available.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> I am really looking forward to using this (as hair bands give me headaches).  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it is circular shaped.</li>
            <li> It does get the hair up, but construction is cheap, price definitely does not reflect product.</li>
            <li> This makes fixing much easier.  </li>
            <li> Really convenient for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I see the smaller sizes are available now</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d venture to try again if the smaller size became available.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work out.</li>
            <li> Closing the tool with an elastic is much easier than trying to get the hooks closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you do have to fluff a bit after you get it on and make sure you have</li>
            <li> I Will buy the smaller one as soon as it becomes available.</li>
            <li> However, I wish I could make it tighter, or a smaller size was available.</li>
            <li> I really like the Puff cuff.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much use for it yet as I have havana braids</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this.</li>
            <li> but it really works well with a wash and go.  </li>
            <li> I did the same routine of wetting and putting gel on my edges to make it smooth and neat....</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this comb/clip.</li>
            <li> It was okay not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very tender headed.</li>
            <li> Very helpful...</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s making all these posts on her page how she wants people to provide feedback etc</li>
            <li> The construction is simple and cheap.</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair and the PuffCuff holds my updo ponytail in place, and its real durable.</li>
            <li> I think I have to much hair for the cuff.</li>
            <li> Does provide a comfortable hold but the size is too big.</li>
            <li> It is MUCH easier to close than banana clips.  </li>
            <li> Really like the puffcuff.</li>
            <li> I have it to someone who had much thinker hair.</li>
            <li> , it will really help out a lot with my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as using a stretchy band does.</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t cause headaches and seems like it&#x27;s much gentler on my hair.</li>
            <li> The edges are smooth enough to not have caused me issue.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy.</li>
            <li> The 5&amp;#34; is too big to securely hold my hair.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice puff and holds the hair in firmly.</li>
            <li> It would also be nice to have a few color options as well.</li>
            <li> Right now the price is a bit high, but I can understand since this is a new product.</li>
            <li> I really love the concept of the Puff Cuff, but for my hair (which I thought was full and thick) it was too large.  </li>
            <li> excited about the smaller sizes to come so my daughter can use one too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited for them to get different sizes/colors.</li>
            <li> My hair covers the clamp completely, has a nice round circumference and looks so pretty.</li>
            <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t force my hair into a small space and that my curls can be wild and free.  </li>
            <li> This is amazing especially if you don&#x27;t have long hair</li>
            <li> This thing is huge, you can&#x27;t adjust the tightness of it, is not seamless, and cost too much for what you get.</li>
            <li> My hair probably isn&#x27;t quite long enough yet for this to be effective</li>
            <li> My hair is short-medium length right now, but my big puff looks pretty substantial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done the afro-puff hair style with random accessories that I&#x27;ve rigged together and was thrilled to find one accessory that could easily achieve the look.  </li>
            <li> I usually try to get a puff pretty much on the top of my head, so maybe it&#x27;s the style I&#x27;m choosing</li>
            <li> That is NOT good a good business practice.</li>
            <li> its a cool idea wish there were smaller size clamps.</li>
            <li> The curve of the clamp is too large and wide to fit my head</li>
            <li> She will continue using her elastic  headbands which works much better and cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this my hair was a bit shorter so more of the clamp was shown and less hair.</li>
            <li> mayve when they finally release the smaller version, will be better</li>
            <li> Would love smaller size same.</li>
            <li> Just wished it was a bit more solid to last longer.  </li>
            <li> I love this - such a simple idea but genius concept!</li>
            <li> So in my opinion if you have short hair, the smaller cuffs they are coming out with would probably work better for you.</li>
            <li> It makes a decent puff, but I think I will order the 3&amp;#34; as soon as I can.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s secure and loose, so i have no worries about damaging my edges.</li>
            <li> I love that I can wear a puff now and not worry about getting a headache from it being too tight</li>
            <li> The thing that I like the most is that it doesn&#x27;t feel tight or pull my hair in any way.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this hair clamp.  </li>
            <li> The price was a bit high for a hair clamp, but I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m rating it high because I like the construction</li>
            <li> I can wear my raffia-visor sunhat when I wear the puff high-</li>
            <li> I brought this with high hopes</li>
            <li> but really what she means is she only wants positive feedback.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that I would have thought of the idea first!</li>
            <li> It takse a little more time trying to get all of my hair into this thing</li>
            <li> Excellent for thick natural hair, does not tug at the hair or hold too tight.</li>
            <li> The edges are sharp and easily gets caught in my 4c hair.</li>
            <li> It was so hard to get it all in a nice puff ball pony tail.</li>
            <li> This thing saves me SO much time on busy mornings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very neat tool to have for natural hair.</li>
            <li> This clip is great for thick wavy hair ,long dread locks ,and braids.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was not negative at all</li>
            <li> At least this is one honest review that she can&#x27;t delete.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll simply gift it to someone at work with curlier hair with the hope she will find it useful.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because I thought that it could be cheap and easy to break</li>
            <li> its very sturdy as well as easy to apply if you&#x27;re looking for something to replace those double stretched headbands</li>
            <li> It simply slides right</li>
            <li> i noticed that there are other sizes available but not for ordering yet.  </li>
            <li> The seams snagged my strands and the teeth just caused tangles, making the product not really coily-girl friendly.  </li>
            <li> I cant wait for the new sizes to be introduced.</li>
            <li> It looks cute and elegant, and I get way more volume than my sad little ponytails (which I will never go back to).</li>
            <li> This will probably work better when hair is a few days old</li>
            <li> When I visited the official PuffCuff website there were size options, but currently the only size available to order is the largest 5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The only reason I rated 4 stars, instead of 5,  is because I needed the smaller size and it is not yet available.  </li>
            <li> I would not suggest purchasing this item unless you are fine w/ giving your money to a business that does not really care about its customers!!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for anyone with natural hair regardless of length.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any natural.</li>
            <li> I have better puffs when I just use a plain old Goody hair band.</li>
            <li> It is NOT AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE IN THE UK, which I think is a great pity because there is definitely a market for it here.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I wanted it to do, hold my hair in a larger puff!</li>
            <li> received the item last week and used for the first time on a wash n go.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it  with my 4c natural hair!</li>
            <li> Makes my fine thin 4a hair look full and luscious.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smooth my edges down since that does not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: The owner did end up replying to my message and this is what she said: \\&quot;I&#x27;m trying to launch a new product and would like public post to be as positive as possible\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited about my high puffs without the pain of a tight headband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> Be weary of companies that only show positive reviews.</li>
            <li> the sides and back are short while the top is long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and its not tight at all!  </li>
            <li> cause everybody&#x27;s is different some people&#x27;s more dense others less.</li>
            <li> If your hair tends to hang, I would definitely wait until it&#x27;s dry and has poofed up a bit before attempting to secure it with the PuffCuff.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s too big, but it just makes my hair kind of flop down around it instead of actually being a puff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s secure without being tight.</li>
            <li> and this holds it securely but not too tight.</li>
            <li> This accessory allows me to wear a puff on top or in the back and not pull tightly at all.</li>
            <li> does not fit too tight, which is good..</li>
            <li> It is a great concept, but entirely too big for my hair (and I have a lot of thick curly hair)!</li>
            <li> The PuffCuff sat at the top of my crown and there was a little afro puff above that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is thick very thick so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> As a busy mom, I appreciate the ease of this hair accessory.</li>
            <li> for all my natural curly girls</li>
            <li> I have natural hair however this doesn&#x27;t hold my hair up my hair</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going natural, you need the PuffCuff😍</li>
            <li> I also added a product image for those who would like to see the cuff in action.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on a week old wash-and-go</li>
            <li> I opened it to far</li>
            <li> This item does not work one natural hair.</li>
            <li> I might get one for my 9yr old.</li>
            <li> this is something a natural curly girl needs.</li>
            <li> I purchased the puff cuff directly from the manufacturer after reading the reviews here...</li>
            <li> I had a mini fight tryong to get all my natural hair in , but once I got the clasps hooked, I was hooked.</li>
            <li> But when I used it for an old WNG...</li>
            <li> I am the type of natural who likes to wear my hair out.</li>
            <li> I really like this product I wish it came in different sizes.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of those old school banana clips and those always got tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of those old school banana clips and those always got tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li> My scalp is sensitive to hairpins and rubber bands</li>
            <li> Gave mine to my adult daughter, I&#x27;m ordering another.</li>
            <li> Will be very grateful for smaller sizes to come nd</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to my natural friends.</li>
            <li> I really like this, just open gather your hair and click it to close.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural, 4a texture</li>
            <li> From reading prior reviews it looks like it helps to really know your hair.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> but then I looked like my four-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> and i recommend it to any natural.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my natural hair</li>
            <li> My hair ranges between mostly 4a/b (with a few sprinkles of 3c) and this clamp allows me to let my curls hang free without being bunched in a hair tie or scrungee, which I would need at least 5 or 6 of them to keep my hair up.</li>
            <li> May work better on thin or straight hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the PuffCuff Hair Clamp and would recommend the PuffCuff Clamp to anyone that has Thick, Coily hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cuff for my thick, 4b natural hair.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tries to get it on right.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it really is a great product and I will be buying another one soon to replace my broken one.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten older, no matter how big the rubber band/child&#x27;s headband I use to make a puff, my head alway hurts by early afternoon.</li>
            <li> Was kinda loose at first (I&#x27;m used to my puffs being a bit tighter).</li>
            <li> I had a nice big puff that wasn&#x27;t too tight or loose.  </li>
            <li> For my thick 4c hair it&#x27;s a little hard to close, but for my daughter&#x27;s 4A hair she has no problems with it and it really gives her the perfect puff!</li>
            <li> The puff cuff it isn&#x27;t a very tight fit.</li>
            <li> It seems sturdy and like it will last so the price is decent considering you&#x27;ll have it for a while.</li>
            <li> There is no need to fit the teeth down into the hair, simply lie the cuff around the hair and close it.</li>
            <li> I wear high puffs and low puffs.</li>
            <li> I was able to make a nice full messy bun as the cuff doesn&#x27;t condense the hair at the base ( like elastics and regular banana clips) which allows me to keep my hair&#x27;s volume.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not really sure whose head it WOULD fit).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for shorter hair like mine, but the longer, the better for optimal effect.</li>
            <li> MY hair is not thick enough for this but will be....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been stalking this product for months waiting anxiously for it to finally be available for purchase and when it was I snapped it up.</li>
            <li> Normal banana clips would pop open in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I am curious whether or not those who have had problems with the tool had detangled, moisturized and oiled their coily hair first.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull at my edges, way better than wearing a tight ponytail ( I&#x27;m in the military</li>
            <li> Go to your local BSS, find the extra large banana clips and use those instead</li>
            <li> I just received the new smaller ones in the mail and have been experimenting with them.  </li>
            <li> maybe it will take more than a few tries depending on texture and length</li>
            <li> The $11 price tag may be a bit much for such a simple tool</li>
            <li> I will keep at it, but with my hair type it does not go on easily like it does for the ladies who slick their edges back on those YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> The hook clips on top  of each other so keeping my huge puff tight while trying to lock the clamp together without getting it caught in my puff gets annoying very quickly!  </li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is very thick and coily.</li>
            <li> I love my puff cuff and have worn it almost everyday since receiving it!!!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to come across other reviews (on other sites)</li>
            <li> My hair does not tangle in it, however I think it is because I know that it could if I am not careful when using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to get my hands on the smaller version for my 10 year old.</li>
            <li> Trying to reposition it without taking it out completely and starting over is just gonna cause a problem.</li>
            <li> but apparently it was not the \\&quot;GOOD\\</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 3 times but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> but so far this is a total keeper for me.  </li>
            <li> I do however love the concept where the edges of the air aren&#x27;t being pulled unnecessarily</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine thin nd the 5\\&quot; size is too big</li>
            <li> I did have to choose between this or two bottles of my most expensive fave conditioner with a little money leftover for hair accessories, but this was well worth the investment, I would made the choice over again!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear it because my hair not long enough naturally to sit on to of my head.</li>
            <li> The round shape is good, but by the time you figure out that you don&#x27; t have thick enough hair to fill this size clamp, you will take it out to re-do, only to discover that if you are not extremely careful, your hair will get tangled up causing difficulty removing the clamp.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not sitting anywhere near flat against my scalp</li>
            <li> But it really helps if you hold your hair as if you were putting it into a pony tail with one hand and put on the puff cuff with the other hand.</li>
            <li> I do wish that there was an option for smaller sizes, and different colors, however I know that with any business expansion tends to come after a product has hit the market, and feedback is taken into consideration, when developing new products or tweeking current products.</li>
            <li> Only really works for me when I wet my hair.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s bulky, I had to open it as far as possible or it would get caught in my hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my puff as big as it normally is with my stretched headbands</li>
            <li> Does not work for 4b/4c hair, if it&#x27;s not stretched!</li>
            <li> For the price I thought it would be a little higher quality</li>
            <li> But they are apparently coming out with smaller models soon.</li>
            <li> Not big enough to fit around my thick puff.</li>
            <li> Using the puff cuff allowed my puff or bun to appear thick and full of curls.</li>
            <li> Having said that the problem is my hair tangles really easily in it and it can be tough to close.</li>
            <li> Even though I would be excited and anxious to try out the clamp when it arrived, I would not do so if my hair was dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just too large to wear tightly..</li>
            <li> No more headaches, it&#x27;s perfect for a bad hair day, &amp;#34;pineapples&amp;#34; at night, the gym, etc.</li>
            <li> Not for me, but will give away as a gift to someone with super thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick 4a/4b</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super thick</li>
            <li> Super duper thick hair.....</li>
            <li> My hair is not super long, but it is very very dense.  </li>
            <li> It works, but my hair is not long enough for it (yet).</li>
            <li> Perhaps the teeth are not long enough.</li>
            <li> If your hair is a little less kinky (mines isn&#x27;t as coily) wait until the smaller clamps are available and try it again.</li>
            <li> I value good customer service and unfortunately a lot of business&#x27;s lack it these days especially a lot of black businesses</li>
            <li> its really big and can even keep my super thick big hair in check.</li>
            <li> I obviously don&#x27;t know if the product is good or bad, but it seems like a really terrific concept for curly hair updo</li>
            <li> She has super long and thick 4A hair</li>
            <li> not easy to use and does not stay in very well</li>
            <li> I normally have a hard time getting all of my natural 4b/c hair into a regular banana clip.</li>
            <li> I wish this product came in different sizes, like small, medium and this large....</li>
            <li> The only thing you have to be aware of is that it is only for thick, coily, textured hair, as it is advertised on the package, it will not work for hair that is medium grade/thickness, and not coily like mine....</li>
            <li> I think the price is a little high....</li>
            <li> Depending on how I style my hair, I use a new elastic, an old stretched out elastic, or two small elastics looped together - whatever is needed for comfort.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has only been a week, so I can&#x27;t rate on durability, but I hope that it is durable for long term, because I definitely see myself using this product</li>
            <li> Lol I know it sounds silly, but thought the combs should go down into my hair and it actually hurt, but I found out after a couple of tries that it did not have to go down to my scalp for it to work.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and this works!</li>
            <li> If she is filtering her reviews based on POSITIVE only then she is being dishonest.</li>
            <li> As long as you are following the instructions then you should not have any problems using this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> Since my natural hair is getting longer, the regular ponytail holders do not give me the big round puff that I was seeking.  </li>
            <li> I know my hair is thick, but I even tried using a head band first and then placing the PuffCuff around</li>
            <li> Makes the difficult hair days easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I find using this puff cuff to be difficult as I can&#x27;t easily pull all my hair into it.</li>
            <li> I like to read both positive AND Negative reviews when purchasing products.</li>
            <li> I can only use it when my hair is dry, when my hair is wet or damp it is not curly enough to support itself into a puff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large and holds thick, curly afro-textured hair well without pulling or tugging or breaking it off.</li>
            <li> You need thick hair to fill in that large 5&amp;#34; circle.</li>
            <li> I have natural type 4 hair--mostly 4A, but with patches of 4B and a little 4C throughout.  </li>
            <li> Your hair should be manageable and to make natural hair manageable, it should be a little moist.  </li>
            <li> Plus, when I try using this item, it get tangled up in my curls so much that I found myself having a hard time trying to remove the clamp....</li>
            <li> This will work for you if you have very thick/coarse hair that is at least medium length.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just a minor issue though.</li>
            <li> This clamp is a tiny bit too wide at 5&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Next I take off my pontail holder and fluff my curls.</li>
            <li> Instead, I hook an ouchless elastic around the ends to keep it closed at the proper tension.  </li>
            <li> My hair is chin-length 3c/4b (shoulder-length when stretched).  </li>
            <li> Just reminds me of a round old school banana clip.</li>
            <li> I have long 3b-4a hair</li>
            <li> so my hair was stretched.</li>
            <li> I felt like an adolescent that day, and I work in a military clinic with medical professionals (and one couldn&#x27;t help but comment that &amp;#34;I like your hair</li>
            <li> this was extremely big not what I expected</li>
            <li> My six year old daughter was cursed with a mom that does not enjoy &amp;#34;doing hair&amp;#34; and she has LOTS of it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not even long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still transitioning to natural, so my hair isn&#x27;t quiet thick enough for this clamp.</li>
            <li> A major company like Goody could make and sell it for half the price.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about ordering this since some of the reviews on here are shady, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to take the risk since I&#x27;m experimenting with new styles.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised at how high this product is rated by others due to its poor quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough to hold the thickness of my hair without being tight but still holding everything in place.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait until the other smaller sizes come out.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that it is a little too big</li>
            <li> Sometimes the clip gets a little tangled but nothing major.</li>
            <li> and it was no different than a lot of other products like this that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and it was no different than a lot of other products like this that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It totally beats all the other ties and knee-highs</li>
            <li> I would have to blow dry or stretch my hair out in order to wear it.</li>
            <li> This should be a must for those with natural, thick and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I would think to write this is especially for thick natural hair.</li>
            <li> naturally curly and thick hair was short when I got it</li>
            <li> This did not live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> My hair got tangled in this thing every single time I tried it.</li>
            <li> My hair got tangled in this thing every single time I tried it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m limited info.  </li>
            <li> Too small for an adult.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product, but the creator stresses that it should fit thick, natural hair types, so I decided to give it a go.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too loose.</li>
            <li> I have a loose curl pattern</li>
            <li> I ended up pulling my hair in a loose ponytail with a scrunchie and then putting the clamp on and then fluffing my hair out.  </li>
            <li> My hair is at an odd length in the grow out process (back longer than sides)</li>
            <li> Since my hair is only about chin length the puff cuff made my puff smaller than the band&#x27;s I usually use.</li>
            <li> This size was way too big and bulky and when I got it on to how I thought I may like it, it was just too tight and pulling at my edges.</li>
            <li> This size was way too big and bulky and when I got it on to how I thought I may like it, it was just too tight and pulling at my edges.</li>
            <li> but it holds my hair tight enough</li>
            <li> Other than the difficulty of closing the cuff (and again I did have stretched, wet hair)</li>
            <li> so maybe if it was a little smaller</li>
            <li> I  need one a little smaller - medium sized.</li>
            <li> its a little too big</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> so Im going to buy a few for the little natural ladies in my life.</li>
            <li> You have to have a lot of thickness to you hair, or the hair clamp will be very loose, and not stay in</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> This was only after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I thought that the PuffCuff worked just like I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> but you do have to be careful when you take it our of your hair as it can wrap around the cuff.</li>
            <li> It is too wide for me.  </li>
            <li> It snags but I expected that, since I have kinky hair and combs don&#x27;t work with my hair anyway.</li>
            <li> Also, the wide diameter maximized the puff volume.</li>
            <li> Just clamp, fluff, and go.</li>
            <li> This is no different, its just round.</li>
            <li> This is no different, its just round.</li>
            <li> In the morning I just put the clamp on and use my fingers to fluff out my puff.</li>
            <li> I take off the ponytail holder and fluff up my puff for the desired look.</li>
            <li> The teeth gets caught in the hair, not a very well made product</li>
            <li> And yes, I do wet my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful when unhooking the clamp and ensuring that I don&#x27;t pull my hair</li>
            <li> However, I am a bit concerned about reviews stating that the seams along the teeth are rough and catch on their hair.</li>
            <li> I will give it try on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick natural hair and this clamp keeps it all in place.</li>
            <li> This tool is a MUST HAVE for all my naturally curlies and anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Must have for any natural with thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Definelty buy this ladies for your thick curly natural hair, it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lazy natural and typically just wash and go</li>
            <li> Hair puff clamp was delivered in good timing  however, the packaging was very disappointing and the clamp itself was no better.</li>
            <li> Too big and wide for my small cranium.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not grab the hair tight enough, it was actually hard to get the clamp around my hair to close it.  </li>
            <li> I would like to see other colors as well.</li>
            <li> As a result, when I get one side of the clamp in place, the other side moves and vice versa.  </li>
            <li> A bit big for a small girls head.</li>
            <li> Not nearlly as flimpsy as my other banana clips.</li>
            <li> I have seen other ladies make a bun out of it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now that my hair is grown i can gather my hair like a ponytail and with the other hand place the puffcuff around my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I usually end up just leaving it in the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I can try other styles.</li>
            <li> clip other colours are needed.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it does what it says it does</li>
            <li> so I do not exactly get a puff</li>
            <li> but I will have to wait until my hair is longer due to the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I Was extremely hopeful for this product and anticipated using it as an alternative to hair bands to hold my hair in a looser pony tail.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> the other way&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Then, when I gave it a second chance, it was way to small for my hair.  </li>
            <li> but that would be unfair because it does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> The plastic has sharp edges which breaks and tears at your hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is African American thick!  </li>
            <li> I do wish it was adjustable so that you can decide how loose or how tight you can wear your puff.  </li>
            <li> I have to be very careful with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 5&amp;#34; clip because the other smaller sizes were not available to order although it was after the round about promise date for them to be.</li>
            <li> My hair is not thick or thin, it&#x27;s average thickness.</li>
            <li> ie wide combs for short thick hair.</li>
            <li> so it was a little difficult to use AT FIRST because I tried when my hair was wet.</li>
            <li> not too tight like a goody band nor is it too loose so thumbs up to whom ever made this!</li>
            <li> Also, as other reviewers have stated--it&#x27;s not worth $11 even if it did work.  </li>
            <li> do wish there were smaller versions of the PuffCuff because I would like to give this to other naturals in my family whose hair isn&#x27;t as thick as mine.</li>
            <li> This one may be just a little too wide for my shoulder length kinky hair.</li>
            <li> This stupid thing was such a disappointment, does not hold your hair tight, no amount of gel will smooth it all enough for a decent ponytail.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has very thick natural hair, from using a banana clip</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have VERY thick hair this will work for you, but so far, I&#x27;m not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please stick to a panty hose for ponytail, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This clamp is made of very rigid plastic making it unable to conform to my head curvature</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the amount of money I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> It was too expensive and shipping to much.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I also wish it came in a dark brown</li>
            <li> My only complaint if you want to call it</li>
            <li> Finally something for my hair all of my thick hair..</li>
            <li> Now because my hair is relaxed, it&#x27;s probably not as thick as someone with really coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I frequently wear my hair up, but get tired of a pony tail.</li>
            <li> mine is growing out, and soon it will be thick enough to use this item.</li>
            <li> It always feels like I need a smaller clamp although my hair is really thick.  </li>
            <li> It worked well with my WL natural hair, it might not fare well if your hair is thin.</li>
            <li> Its cut into a few layers and when wet is shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Had to give it to a friend because my hair isn&#x27;t thick enough!</li>
            <li> It is definitely for THICK hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder length 4a hair and this makes my puff look bigger than using a hairtie.  </li>
            <li> Not very comfortable to wear all day...</li>
            <li> By that time I hope the price comes down just a tad</li>
            <li> it clamped all the way down to your scalp so the teeth can grasp your roots</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of work to get your hair to lay down.</li>
            <li> For me to get ALL of my hair up in the cuff, I have to pineapple my hair with a scrunchie and tie my scarf around my edges to lay them down overnight.</li>
            <li> Plus it does not hold your hair down instead</li>
            <li> or you need to wear a headband to keep your hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and very thick it fits and isn&#x27;t to tight</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not funny!</li>
            <li> I had more expectations from this product was VERY disappointed especially for the cost!  </li>
            <li> I have very high density hair, so it&#x27;s mega thick and approximately shoulder-length when stretch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because its a CIRCLE SHAPE, I found it to be less constricting than a banana clip.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s not a quick snap and go.</li>
            <li> An expensive item made cheaply and poorly</li>
            <li> It literally takes less than five minutes to do.  </li>
            <li> Non the less</li>
            <li> and well I was a little let down.</li>
            <li> My only bad critique on the product is the same as my only compliment.</li>
            <li> You have to have long and thick hair to use this size.</li>
            <li> Her hair is long and thick.  </li>
            <li> 1- it doesn&#x27;t pull tight on your hair so you won&#x27;t get the head pain that we often get when doing a puff and 2-the shape allows it to hold even the thickest of hair.</li>
            <li> so it holds your hair in place and isn&#x27;t tight...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not to tight.</li>
            <li> they also pulled my hair so tight it would hurt my head, the puffcuff  </li>
            <li> I do not lock the ends together because it would be too tight.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the clamp doesn&#x27;t hold my pony as tight as I like, but works well with a headband or scarf.</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t get a headache the way she does with the tight rubber bands or scrunchy</li>
            <li> It WILL snag if you don&#x27;t position it properly the first time and at the base of your puff closest to your scalp</li>
            <li> /&gt;Downsides: The price is a little hefty</li>
            <li> My little sister told me about this</li>
            <li> little background:  </li>
            <li> A little business card or a thank</li>
            <li> Teeth could be a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> and I try to support small black business&#x27;s as much as possible but the attitudes, lack of professionalism and customer service usually sucks!</li>
            <li> The price tag was not attractive but, after seeing the overall rating and reading some reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t seem to get the hold as firm as I would like.  </li>
            <li> The clamp did not secure all the hair nor did the ponytail look neat.</li>
            <li> unlike banana clips this clip does not pull or tug on my hair, the banana clips wouldn&#x27;t stay closed, because my hair is so thick.</li>
            <li> cannot use it because my hair is too short and thin.  </li>
            <li> Too small for my average hair length and thickness, 3c to 4c texture curly hair.</li>
            <li> I need to watch a few tutorials</li>
            <li> but it was not available</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at a difficult point in my transition to natural hair.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday, but it took me some time to get use to it.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday in my hair and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> Just purchased the puff cuff a few days ago</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have much trouble with it.  </li>
            <li> but it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I would have gave it 3 stars if it wasn&#x27;t heavily marketed towards &amp;#34;thick,</li>
            <li> I just slick it up with Ecostyler gel and water and tie it down with a scarf.</li>
            <li> I can gather my hair, put the clamp on, and my hair is styled in less than 60 secs!</li>
            <li> No more tight ponytail holders.</li>
            <li> However it get my hair to fit and clamp the puffcuff was impossible!</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly type 4 hair that is about armpit length when stretched.  </li>
            <li> I would have to brush &amp; tie my hair down for at least fifteen minutes after putting it in.</li>
            <li> The plastic is a little to firm to go around her thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to use, clamp is also very loose and does not stay in place.  </li>
            <li> I have thich hair and a small head.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> The one small metal piece doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and the cuff doesn&#x27;t place a lot of tension on my strands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and have converted friends and family members to the Cuff!  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> Too small of my daughters head.  </li>
            <li> and I usually use a Goody headband wrapped twice for my puffs.  </li>
            <li> so the small cuff works for me,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the small things that matter.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would purchase this tool again for $11.</li>
            <li> Beware folks with small heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken every single hair accessory labeled &amp;#34;for thick hair&amp;#34</li>
            <li> What;s worse is that she is EXTREMELY tender headed.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, this might not work for you as the clamp is very wide.  </li>
            <li> From previous reviews, I expected the puff cuff to be enormous and difficult to use, but I was desperate for a way to put my hair up without the breakage I get from even ouchless rubber bands.  </li>
            <li> Not many hair clips can handle thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my hair is to thick or what.</li>
            <li> Also, maybe another type of closure, because I did sometimes find it hard to close when my puff was at it&#x27;s fullness.  </li>
            <li> The clamp is hard to fasten.</li>
            <li> I will keep MY hard earned money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hard plastic (not flexible)</li>
            <li> while smooth..is hard.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, so I was a bit skeptical of how this would make my puff look, but it actually creates the illusion of an even thicker and fuller puff.</li>
            <li> I use it at least 6 days per week.  </li>
            <li> : I wear my puff cuff at least three times a week.</li>
            <li> Clumsy....... Don&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> I got a haircut in March and am now in the awkward in  between stages growing it back.</li>
            <li> I have kinky, curly hair that it thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly  hair and this clamp holds it in place and does not snag my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, kinky/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It works for my thick hair...</li>
            <li> PuffCuff does work for thick hair, but you have to use it correctly.  </li>
            <li> It is made for extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, you have to pull your hair together, as if you were going to make a ponytail, then put the clip in, then let the hair go once you&#x27;ve locked the clip in.  </li>
            <li> and I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Slow shipping and arrived as promised.</li>

            <li> I have really thick hair....</li>
            <li> You have to have thick hair to use this.</li>
            <li> I have thick, 4a hair</li>
            <li> so I thought my hair was too thick</li>
            <li> It holds thick, coily hair while giving a look of a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick but it was for thick bushy hair would not hold mine.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick, this doesnt work.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I ended up gifting it to a friend who doesn&#x27;t have thick or coily hair and it worked for her.  </li>
            <li> have a lot of thick, kinky-curly hair and this size</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, this is a must.  </li>
            <li> My hair is too thick for this product.  </li>
            <li> Waste of MONEY!!</li>
            <li> I still getting the hang of the puff cuff, I have small hands but very thick hair</li>
            <li> Too thin and slick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair  in the least and couldn&#x27;t get all of my hair in this thing!</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected and was a little disappointed when I saw that it was hinged.</li>
            <li> Pulling my hair back hurts so bad</li>
            <li> They are possibly filtering all the bad ones out.</li>
            <li> Once you get all the hair in a bun and the clasps secured, it is very tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for any curly girl with really thick hair!  </li>
            <li> If you have very thick kinky coily hair this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I repeat, A LOT and very thick.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> and it is very thick.</li>
            <li> It is hard, inflexible and useless</li>
            <li> I hate it and want my money back.:</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and wavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it, used it, and broken it.</li>
            <li> and I hate having my hair pulled back because it starts to hurt throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Was NOT happy with this.</li>
            <li> I read some of the negative reviews, which I think are unfair and possibility</li>
            <li> My hair was too thin for this</li>
            <li> Decided to try this despite the expensive price and somewhat negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thin hair would get lost in this clamp.</li>
            <li> I have to wear my hair in a ponytail or bun for work and this makes my life easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> Worst thing ever if your hair is soft and curly like mine.</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted $12 :(  </li>
            <li> I guess it was my bad because the description did say &#x27;Thick, Coily, Textured Hair&#x27;...</li>
            <li> Unable to wear with assistance from someone else to help me adjust and clip it close</li>
            <li> Difficult to hold while.</li>
            <li> Wrong decision.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the material.</li>
            <li> definitely can&#x27;t go wrong there.</li>
            <li> When my hai is in it&#x27;s shrunken state, it is difficult to get the puff cuff around my hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of getting a puff cuff because I suffer headaches when I use the goody headband</li>
            <li> nothing&#x27;s  wrong  with it at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> and I found it quite difficult trying to get the clamp on my hair...</li>
            <li> and I was unable to use it.</li>
            <li> So now it sits in my drawer with the rest of my failed hair clips.</li>
            <li> and maybe that I was doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> (still difficult at times)</li>
            <li> nothing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> This is the WRONG way to go about it!</li>
            <li> It is like the infamous 80&#x27;s banana clip but rebooted!</li>
            <li> I got all of my hair up, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t stay up.... :(  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s bad because i doesn&#x27;t look as sleek as i would like my updos to look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off during school and her looking crazy!</li>
            <li> So totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have all the volume type 4 curlies have :(</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> But I base my four star rating on how it FITS.</li>
            <li> and I hate those rubber band things when you work 14 hr shifts in a pain.</li>
            <li> I became frustrated and disappointed when I tried to use it!!!!! :(</li>
            <li> It is a life saver for those bad hair days when you have to rush to get to work!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Awful product.</li>
            <li> When I put it on loser, it was worst.</li>
            <li> When I put it on loser, it was worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this hair clamp. It&#x27;s large and holds thick, curly afro-textured hair well without pulling or tugging or breaking it off. That is awesome. So many clamps/clips are hair destroyers. This clamp allows the user to have a neat hair style without a lot of fuss. The clamp opens and closes easily. The only recommendation is to make additional sizes available. As a busy mom, I appreciate the ease of this hair accessory. The product seems well made and is not flimsy. I would like to see other colors as well. Great purchase. I would repurchase and recommend.</li>
            <li> This will not hold my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great on my transitioning hair.  Need a few more inches of length before I wear this full time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, and well put together, its not flimsy at all.....The only thing you have to be aware of is that it is only for thick, coily, textured hair, as it is advertised on the package, it will not work for hair that is medium grade/thickness, and not coily like mine....You have to have a lot of thickness to you hair, or the hair clamp will be very loose, and not stay in....Hopefully they will come out with a hair clamp for medium textured hair...</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, just the trick for my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I love it. Your hair does not get caught in it.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully for my thin chin length curly hair. I have plenty of room to grow! :)</li>
            <li> Great item for natural hair ponytails! I have kinky, curly hair that it thick. It was so hard to get it all in a nice puff ball pony tail. Now that I have bought this cuff, it has helped a lot with styling. It also doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out. Great product, thanks!</li>
            <li> Unable to wear with assistance from someone else to help me adjust and clip it close</li>
            <li> Finally something for my hair all of my thick hair..banana clips didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I have 2 and ordered 2 more recently....I absolutely love the PuffCuff!</li>
            <li> This stupid thing was such a disappointment, does not hold your hair tight, no amount of gel will smooth it all enough for a decent ponytail. Please stick to a panty hose for ponytail, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! Great way to keep my hair tidy but without the headache incurred from elastics.  Can&#x27;t wait for the new sizes to come out!! It is the only way I can keep my fine, multi-textured hair up and out of the way in a neat pony tail type style that doesn&#x27;t pull on the edges and cause breakage.  I use it at least 6 days per week.  I have had it for about a year and the only issue i have had is that one of the teeth broke about a month ago.  Given how often I use it I really can&#x27;t complain.  I recommend it to anymore that needs a fail safe, go to method of dealing with their hair. I just received the new smaller ones in the mail and have been experimenting with them.  The 2.5&amp;#34; one is AWESOME because my hair is fine and not very voluminous.</li>
            <li> Over priced and more size choices would be helpful  Cheaply made for the price.  I will need to handle with extra care if I intend on using it often, which I do not.  I have thich hair and a small head.  The curve of the clamp is too large and wide to fit my head</li>
            <li> snags your hair.  I hate it and want my money back.:(</li>
            <li> It works, but my hair is not long enough for it (yet).</li>
            <li> I though it would be good for my hair but I don&#x27;t think my hair texture is right for this item. I plan on giving mine away.</li>
            <li> Too thin and slick. Difficult to hold while.</li>
            <li> its really big and can even keep my super thick big hair in check. for all my natural curly girls</li>
            <li> I just love this clamp. I have thick curly  hair and this clamp holds it in place and does not snag my hair. The combs does not dig into the scalp like others hair clips/combs. This should be a must for those with natural, thick and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this hair clamp.  I have thick, kinky/curly hair.  I&#x27;ve done the afro-puff hair style with random accessories that I&#x27;ve rigged together and was thrilled to find one accessory that could easily achieve the look.  The price tag was not attractive but, after seeing the overall rating and reading some reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  Wrong decision.  This clamp is made of very rigid plastic making it unable to conform to my head curvature (I&#x27;m not really sure whose head it WOULD fit).  As a result, when I get one side of the clamp in place, the other side moves and vice versa.  So, after the tug-of-war, I finally get the thing on but it&#x27;s not sitting anywhere near flat against my scalp and I can&#x27;t seem to get the hold as firm as I would like.  I have reviewed the directions for use and tried this hair clamp over and over and OVER again with the same issues.  I think this would be great if it was made of a move flexible material but, as it is, I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length relaxed hair but I don&#x27;t like to use heat so I wear it air-dried and curly a lot. I was looking for a hair clip to add to my collection. I came across this on Amazon. The price was a bit high for a hair clamp, but I decided to give it a try. When it arrived (really quickly) it was very light weight. But I base my four star rating on how it FITS. Now because my hair is relaxed, it&#x27;s probably not as thick as someone with really coarse hair. But for the amount of hair I have on my head, it really fit the bill. It IS NOT like one of those banana clips! Because its a CIRCLE SHAPE, I found it to be less constricting than a banana clip. There is no metal on the hinge, and it really went in relatively easy. I didn&#x27;t lose ANY hair. I would advise you to take your time and be patient, and it will work for you. I am really looking forward to using this (as hair bands give me headaches).  The plastic is very light though. Be careful. I will probably purchase another one so that this one doesn&#x27;t wear out.</li>
            <li> i love the nice big puff this gives my fine, natural hair! sometimes i struggle a little bit with closing and removing it, but overall, it&#x27;s awesome!! excited about the smaller sizes to come so my daughter can use one too.</li>
            <li> did not fit in my hair good. i still have it. maybe will work better  when my hair is longer.</li>
            <li> Only really works for me when I wet my hair. So, I don&#x27;t use it to often.</li>
            <li> Hair puff clamp was delivered in good timing  however, the packaging was very disappointing and the clamp itself was no better. I purchased this for my daughter who has very thick natural hair, from using a banana clip i pretty much knew the basics on using the clamp. The clamp did not secure all the hair nor did the ponytail look neat. She will continue using her elastic  headbands which works much better and cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the material. Plastic seemed to be on the cheaper side. Puff section was way too big, and did not hold my curls well.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the puff cuff. It was only when i received it did i realise that my hair is too short to do the type of puff style that i like...but!! I improvised and found a way to wear it...and it is awesome...1- it doesn&#x27;t pull tight on your hair so you won&#x27;t get the head pain that we often get when doing a puff and 2-the shape allows it to hold even the thickest of hair. it&#x27;s sturdy but light weight so it holds your hair in place and isn&#x27;t tight...definitely can&#x27;t go wrong there.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair clip! Afro puffs made easy:)</li>
            <li> I love it !!!! My puff has never been so full</li>
            <li> The puff cuff hair clamp is absolutely amazing. It works great for my thick, kinky hair. It creates the perfect puff with very little effort. I can gather my hair, put the clamp on, and my hair is styled in less than 60 secs! It is great quality and durable, unlike store bought hair clamps that break easily with one use. I will be ordering more as gifts for my natural hair friends. It is a must have, especially for women with type 4a-c hair.</li>
            <li> It works for my thick hair...and it&#x27;s not to tight.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clamp. unlike banana clips this clip does not pull or tug on my hair, the banana clips wouldn&#x27;t stay closed, because my hair is so thick. they also pulled my hair so tight it would hurt my head, the puffcuff  does the job without pulling my hair I love, love love it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clamp. It came in 2 days</li>
            <li> love it &amp; wear it often!!!</li>
            <li> not easy to use and does not stay in very well</li>
            <li> I love it! Had to get use to putting it in my hair but after that great!! Can&#x27;t wait until the other smaller sizes come out.</li>
            <li> It definitely works. Was kinda loose at first (I&#x27;m used to my puffs being a bit tighter). But definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> wish it were more flexible but it does hold my hair and i don&#x27;t have to worry whether it will break or not.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t big enough, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. Purchased it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I want it to do. Gives a nice puff and holds the hair in firmly. I did think the puff would have been bigger but when you close it and clip it - it lessens the size of the puff. That&#x27;s just a minor issue though. Generally I was very pleased with the product but it eventually broke at the area where it clips. This was only after a few uses. I considered purchasing another one but what&#x27;s the sense? It may brake again.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love them! I ordered 2 so that she can enjoy her very own. Cute, quick and to the point.</li>
            <li> THIS IS LOVELY AND WELL WORTH THE PRICE. I GOT ONE FOR ME AND ONE FOR MY SISTER. I WILL BUY ANOTHER AS A SPARE :-)</li>
            <li> This thing saved me from ponytail headaches!</li>
            <li> It can on time and was a quality product</li>
            <li> PuffCuff does work for thick hair, but you have to use it correctly.  Gather Your Hair First.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish there were smaller versions of the PuffCuff because I would like to give this to other naturals in my family whose hair isn&#x27;t as thick as mine.</li>
            <li> Not flexible. ....so it didn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
            <li> Its ok. Maybe my hair is not long enough to be impressed with it. Goody band works just as good and cheaper.</li>
            <li> It is made for extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> I would think to write this is especially for thick natural hair. I have natural hair however this doesn&#x27;t hold my hair up my hair waves up when brushed up in the up do. The puff cuff it isn&#x27;t a very tight fit. My hair is thin and wavy. This will probably work better when hair is a few days old so I will see if it does better tomorrow. As for today I added products to my hair so it made my hair draw up more than what it would be two days later. I would be interested to find something better. Overall it may be good for some others may not always get the look they are looking for.</li>
            <li> not big enough for my hair and the closure didn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> I so wanted this prinect to work for me, but it is way too big for my hair so I had no choice but to return it. I wish this product came in different sizes, like small, medium and this large....I have fine, curly/swavy type 2C hair and this was really huge for my particular hair.  I obviously don&#x27;t know if the product is good or bad, but it seems like a really terrific concept for curly hair updo, it just needs to be offered in different sizes. I would definitely try it again if it was offered in a smaller size...</li>
            <li> I like my headbands better.</li>
            <li> Need size variations for different textured hair</li>
            <li> This PuffCuff works wonders, but I wish they had a smaller size which would be prefect for what I want to do.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE this puff cuff. I really like the fact that it is circular shaped. This makes it easy to put around my air. When my hai is in it&#x27;s shrunken state, it is difficult to get the puff cuff around my hair. This is no fault of the device, this holds true for anything I try to put around my hair when it is in it&#x27;s shrunken state. When hair is in the shrunken state you need to the hair plyable with water or conditioner. Once the hair is smoothed the puff cuff fits nicely around the hair and does not snag or pull the hair. There is no need to fit the teeth down into the hair, simply lie the cuff around the hair and close it. You then spread the length of your hair out. It stays secure  through my workouts and comes out easily. I have been using this since May 2015 and love it. It has saved a many of hair styles for me. I like the fact that it does not snag on my edges or the hair in the back of my head. The material is a hard plastic which is good because this makes the item sturdy, the good thing is that it is light  weight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice head piece but, very cumbersome to use on curly afro hair especially if your goal is to have smooth sides. It takes some practice to get it on neatly.</li>
            <li> Works great to hold my thick curly hair up without pulling or overly stressing the hair. Very easy to clip and unclip.</li>
            <li> i use this hair product . the only thing is that it is a little too big but i can still use it</li>
            <li> I love it! If you&#x27;re going natural, you need the PuffCuff😍</li>
            <li> Comfortable doesn&#x27;t pull hair no tension headache</li>
            <li> I received it over the weekend and got a chance to try it this morning. The instructions are on the back of the package. It was very easy to use; I got it on the first try. No more tight ponytail holders. It&#x27;s secure without being tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but even with my short fro it clamps and keeps it together. Can&#x27;t wait to see how well it works once my hair grows out for a big puff.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday! It&#x27;s made natural hair much easier to wear in a cute style.</li>
            <li> This puff cuff is great! I wish I would have had one before I cut my hair. Purchased this for my toddler &amp; she looks beautiful with her puff. Would highly recommend for anyone with natural hair regardless of length.</li>
            <li> Not big enough to fit around my thick puff.</li>
            <li> Love this cuff, this makes it very easy to create a mega puff.  I haven&#x27;t relaxed my hair in 20 months, didn&#x27;t realize I had enough for a nice puff. Very easy to use &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  I used my puffcuff very often and after a few months one of the clips did break off.  I do wish it was adjustable so that you can decide how loose or how tight you can wear your puff.  Also, maybe another type of closure, because I did sometimes find it hard to close when my puff was at it&#x27;s fullness.  Other than that it really is a great product and I will be buying another one soon to replace my broken one.  Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, and intend to buy more in the future. I have very thick hair, and it works very well. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid full price for this item.</li>
            <li> is a great idea , but the clip is way to bid. mayve when they finally release the smaller version, will be better</li>
            <li> I finally received my PuffCuff. It&#x27;s a bit cheaply made and the edges could be much smoother to avoid catching on your hair. I have also found the hinge catches hair and is nightmare to get hair out of the hinge. It does get the hair up, but construction is cheap, price definitely does not reflect product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, it works okay but I needed a smaller clamp. A bit big for a small girls head.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I highly recommend .</li>
            <li> All my hair fits finally.</li>
            <li> Perfect for putting hair up without causes stress on the edges. Great for a &amp;#34;no must, no fuss; I really don&#x27;t have time to do my hair&amp;#34; day.</li>
            <li> great way to put thick hair in a cute bun without putting strain on your hair</li>
            <li> Love this item, it makes putting my hair in a puff a breaze, plus it removes the hurt that bands cause throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Couldn&#x27;t find in stores!</li>
            <li> The puff cuff works great on my daughter&#x27;s thick kinky hair. We are able to now do cute puffs on her hair and it last all day. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off during school and her looking crazy! Lol. It holds up great on my puff also. I&#x27;ll be using it more on my daughter though.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me it was to big and the clamp didn&#x27;t feel secure. I think my hair was to fine for this product</li>
            <li> Love, love this clip.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  On days when I don&#x27;t feel like styling my hair. This makes fixing much easier.  Strong clip.</li>
            <li> Received on time and I love it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This clip is great for thick wavy hair ,long dread locks ,and braids.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use it because my hair is too short and thin.  I will pass it&lt;br /&gt;along to family members who have more hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is made in USA. Support this business.</li>
            <li> Would work great if I had purchased the correct size. Pay attention to the size chart.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair.  I&#x27;ve broken every single hair accessory labeled &amp;#34;for thick hair&amp;#34; that I purchased from a local retailer.  This clamp is a tiny bit too wide at 5&amp;#34;.  I use it to gather my hair in the back and pin it into a bun.  It works and it seems sturdy enough to last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try the smaller version if/when they are released.  It would also be nice to have a few color options as well.</li>
            <li> Makes gathering my hair quick and easy. The one small metal piece doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and the cuff doesn&#x27;t place a lot of tension on my strands. My hair is at an odd length in the grow out process (back longer than sides) so the best style for me is an updo to avoid a mullet 😳. The cuff is also comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> The product did not meet my expectation.  It&#x27;s not worth the amount of money I paid for it.  I would not recommend it to anyone else.</li>
            <li> This clip has been a lifesaver for me. I frequently wear my hair up, but get tired of a pony tail. This is a less damaging way to keep your hair out of your face, and it creates a bigger puff (bigger is better right lol). Sometimes the clip gets a little tangled but nothing major. I&#x27;m excited for them to get different sizes/colors.</li>
            <li> So I bought the puff cuff thinking that I had found the solution to the problem that I am having with making a puff and when I got it I tried it and it I wasn&#x27;t able to make my puff look any better than I had with a headband. So totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair ranges between mostly 4a/b (with a few sprinkles of 3c) and this clamp allows me to let my curls hang free without being bunched in a hair tie or scrungee, which I would need at least 5 or 6 of them to keep my hair up. Its durable, its strong plastic with a metal flexon to allow for repeated bending and flexing. Its versatile it can make ponytails, buns and if it can hold my twists up I&#x27;m almost positive it works for locks and thicker hair. Iam very eager to see this develop into a line with smaller sizes and more colors. By that time I hope the price comes down just a tad so I could buy more. Right now the price is a bit high, but I can understand since this is a new product. I did have to choose between this or two bottles of my most expensive fave conditioner with a little money leftover for hair accessories, but this was well worth the investment, I would made the choice over again! Thanks to the YouTube demos on how to use the Puff Cuff helped me to use the clamp better. Can&#x27;t wait for the smaller ones so my daughter and I can rock our Puff Cuffs together! Thanks so much Ms. Lash! Good luck and blessings!</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day! It&#x27;s great because it doesn&#x27;t pull or try to break my hair like bobby pins. If you have thick hair, you have to pull your hair together, as if you were going to make a ponytail, then put the clip in, then let the hair go once you&#x27;ve locked the clip in.  This is on the directions too.</li>
            <li> My hair probably isn&#x27;t quite long enough yet for this to be effective</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of getting a puff cuff because I suffer headaches when I use the goody headband and I have thick hair. I did my research I keep seeing positive reviews. I can wear my puff cuff  8 hours I couldn&#x27;t do that with my goody headband.</li>
            <li> I love that I can wear a puff now and not worry about getting a headache from it being too tight and there&#x27;s no stress on my edges or nape.</li>
            <li> I love this item! I wish I&#x27;d purchased more!  It&#x27;s great for my daughter who has a lot of long curly hair. It&#x27;s not good for shorter hair like mine, but the longer, the better for optimal effect.</li>
            <li> Very much loving the size.  Really convenient for my hair type.</li>
            <li> The best thing EVER for big curly or african american natural hair. You have to be creative with styling for variety. However great for puffs,poofs,big ponytails. Wish it was invented before I broke all those Banana Clips in the 80s.</li>
            <li> My curls are 3b so my curls hang more so over the clip hiding it completely which I love.  I thought that the PuffCuff worked just like I expected it to.  It is basically a circular banana clip.  My hair does not tangle in it, however I think it is because I know that it could if I am not careful when using it. The PuffCuff is made sturdy and is easy to use,  I do wish that there was an option for smaller sizes, and different colors, however I know that with any business expansion tends to come after a product has hit the market, and feedback is taken into consideration, when developing new products or tweeking current products.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clamp...I cant wait for the new sizes to be introduced. My hair is thick very thick so this is perfect for me. As long as you are following the instructions then you should not have any problems using this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I wear my puff cuff at least three times a week. I have had no issues with it. I did buy two and gave one to my mom who also has no complaints. I see the smaller sizes are available now so Im going to buy a few for the little natural ladies in my life.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work on my hair. The clamp is hard to fasten.</li>
            <li> I love it !! At first I was skeptical because I thought that it could be cheap and easy to break but it totally isn&#x27;t. This item allows me to rock a great updo. A bit of a hassle getting it in because I recently did a big chop. Also it&#x27;s not a quick snap and go. I would have to brush &amp; tie my hair down for at least fifteen minutes after putting it in. Nevertheless it gets the job done. I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I loved the PuffCuff so much I ordered two more!</li>
            <li> Not for me, but will give away as a gift to someone with super thick hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair. Works great. I gather my hair in a ponytail first then clamp on my puff cuff. Next I take off my pontail holder and fluff my curls. That&#x27;s what works best for me..</li>
            <li> It works for me great. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this item! Super easy to use, it now takes me less than 5 minutes to make the perfect Afro puff! The cuff is priced just right!</li>
            <li> Love love love. Makes the difficult hair days easy to manage. THANK YOU !</li>
            <li> This is amazing especially if you don&#x27;t have long hair and you would like for your puff to have volume. You don&#x27;t have to pull your hair out for it to be clean and neat. You can also set your hair from the night before, its very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Not flexible at all and I wanted to cancel this order but the site would not allow me to cancel</li>
            <li> Puff Cuff was go.e nothing&#x27;s  wrong  with it at all. I can&#x27;t wear it because my hair not long enough naturally to sit on to of my head. I would have to blow dry or stretch my hair out in order to wear it. I have to wait until my hair grow more to know if I like it or not.</li>
            <li> I tried out my new PuffCuff for the first time this weekend and it was AWESOME!! I normally have a hard time getting all of my natural 4b/c hair into a regular banana clip. The PuffCuff easily holds all my hair without feeling like it&#x27;s pulling on my edges. I thought it was easy to use but you do have to be careful when you take it our of your hair as it can wrap around the cuff. I was able to make a nice full messy bun as the cuff doesn&#x27;t condense the hair at the base ( like elastics and regular banana clips) which allows me to keep my hair&#x27;s volume. I can&#x27;t wait until smaller sizes are available! I also added a product image for those who would like to see the cuff in action.</li>
            <li> Too small for an adult.</li>
            <li> Excellent, durable, and dependable</li>
            <li> Too small for my average hair length and thickness, 3c to 4c texture curly hair. Couldn&#x27;t get it to wrap around&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return but didn&#x27;t hear back from seller. May work better on thin or straight hair.</li>
            <li> Great idea for natural hair!!! Sturdy and gathers the hair nicely!</li>
            <li> MY hair is not thick enough for this but will be....soon. I think this is made for thicker hair,&lt;br /&gt;So mine is growing out, and soon it will be thick enough to use this item. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Too big and wide for my small cranium. Plastic is not pliable at all. A smaller size might work better, though. I&#x27;d venture to try again if the smaller size became available.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about ordering this since some of the reviews on here are shady, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to take the risk since I&#x27;m experimenting with new styles. I only had an issue with tangling when I put it on and tried to slide it upwards into place. This is the WRONG way to go about it! I was fortunate to come across other reviews (on other sites) that suggested putting your hair into a ponytail and then using the Puffcuff. Once I&#x27;ve got the Puffcuff exactly where I want it, I then remove the ponytail holder. My hair is short-medium length right now, but my big puff looks pretty substantial. I intend on get about 2 more as back up. I&#x27;d also like to get my hands on the smaller version for my 10 year old.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet but I love it for my daughter it is perfect for her puffy thick 4c hair and she loves that it not tight it&#x27;s now her favorite hair do!!</li>
            <li> I  didn&#x27;t use it yet but I thought it was going to b bigger than it is. After I use it I&#x27;ll let u guys know.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and very thick it fits and isn&#x27;t to tight I like the way it looks and will get another for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable not tight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Too big for my hair type, but I should have done my homework prior to making this purchase.</li>
            <li> i like the concept and versatility  of the puff cuff.  i noticed that there are other sizes available but not for ordering yet.  the 5 in was too large for my hair, maybe the 3in will hold better.  how soon on availability?!!!!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the PuffCuff Hair Clamp and would recommend the PuffCuff Clamp to anyone that has Thick, Coily hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 4C hair when I want to wear a puff.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Would love smaller size same. Slow shipping and arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been stalking this product for months waiting anxiously for it to finally be available for purchase and when it was I snapped it up. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I REALLY wanted to love it because I thought it would be the answer to my puff prayers. Sadly, I&#x27;ve never actually worn it in public because it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe it&#x27;s too big, but it just makes my hair kind of flop down around it instead of actually being a puff. I usually try to get a puff pretty much on the top of my head, so maybe it&#x27;s the style I&#x27;m choosing, I can&#x27;t call it. I&#x27;ve tried it on a week old wash-and-go and that&#x27;s when my hair is at it&#x27;s puffiest (short of actually picking it out). I have better puffs when I just use a plain old Goody hair band. I&#x27;ll try the smaller one when it comes out, but I don&#x27;t have a lot of confidence that it&#x27;ll be much different. Maybe if you have VERY thick hair this will work for you, but so far, I&#x27;m not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 3 stars because it&#x27;s OK. It seems sturdy and like it will last so the price is decent considering you&#x27;ll have it for a while. And if it works for you, you&#x27;ll probably get your moneys worth. Great idea, but this universal 5&amp;#34; size is too big, so right now I have a $12 thing that just sits in my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: There is a bit of learning curve. You HAVE to follow the instructions about not gliding this thing through your hair. It WILL snag if you don&#x27;t position it properly the first time and at the base of your puff closest to your scalp (Which is another issue I had initially.) Trying to reposition it without taking it out completely and starting over is just gonna cause a problem. After playing with it some more though, I got the hang of how it&#x27;s supposed to work so I don&#x27;t have the snagging problem anymore.</li>
            <li> First the good: seems sturdy; easy to use; comfortable to wear; does not snag edges and was delivered within the stated delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;Now the not so good: I think the product is a little too big for my normal sized head!  The end result was a puff that I felt was too big.  In addition, I have 4c hair which does not &#x27;lay&#x27; without some assistance.  The size of the cuff means that it holds the hair very loosely - great for comfort but not good for achieving a neat look on 4c hair.</li>
            <li> I loved the cuff. It worked perfectly. I have never been able to create a puff until now. Very easy and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It was too expensive and shipping to much. Was not worth the price.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Awful product. It&#x27;s useless. The hold is so slack that we need to wear a headband. The look it creates is not flattering.Would NOT recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> Just got my puff cuff....I&#x27;m excited to try it...I need to watch a few tutorials then I should be ok</li>
            <li> The fact that this doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair, it&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s lightweight? Excellent.</li>
            <li> This did not live up to my expectations. Doesn&#x27;t hold hair well at all. An expensive item made cheaply and poorly</li>
            <li> Love the puffcuff just pull your hair up on top of your head put the puffcuff on and go</li>
            <li> This clamp does NOT do what it says it will do for MY hair.  I have very thick curly type 4 hair that is about armpit length when stretched.  The clamp never feels secure on my head.  It always feels like I need a smaller clamp although my hair is really thick.  Perhaps it&#x27;s just me.  I endup up giving up and went back to my head band puffs.  I feel like I wasted $12 :(  I really wanted it to work out.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product.  I became frustrated and disappointed when I tried to use it!!!!! :( It is now collecting dust.  Waste of MONEY!!</li>
            <li> I have not purchased this clip, but I have something similar I purchased a while ago.  My tool is smaller, but it also has interlocking ends.  I do not lock the ends together because it would be too tight.  Instead, I hook an ouchless elastic around the ends to keep it closed at the proper tension.  Depending on how I style my hair, I use a new elastic, an old stretched out elastic, or two small elastics looped together - whatever is needed for comfort.  Closing the tool with an elastic is much easier than trying to get the hooks closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have 4c, medium length hair.  Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> The puff cuff has made it so much easier for me to get the perfect cuff without any of the pain that those Goody&#x27;s headband cause.  With proper handling and care the Puff Cuff will last for years, not like the headbands that can stretch out after a while requiring to replace them on the regular.  Its just so quick and easy to use for those days when you need to come up with a beautiful style with little work required.  Just brush your hair up as if you are creating a pony tail, wrap the Puff Cuff around the ponytail and hook the two ends together.  It literally takes less than five minutes to do.  I would recommend that every naturalista to purchase and give it a try.  Thank God For The Puff Cuff!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS THING&amp;#62;&amp;#62; need more in case i  lose it... best product ever!!</li>
            <li> Excellent . Love it works perfect for my thick natural hair 4 b</li>
            <li> It is a great concept, but entirely too big for my hair (and I have a lot of thick curly hair)! I would purchase again, but a smaller size.</li>
            <li> Would be great for thick hair but didn&#x27;t work for me. My hair is not thick or thin, it&#x27;s average thickness. You need thick hair to fill in that large 5&amp;#34; circle. I would love it in a 3 inch size, that&#x27;d be perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product works great on my Natural hair, does not pull easy to use, my hair type is 3c</li>
            <li> When you get the hang of it is rather useful it really works like they say it does if you follow the directions you will have no problem getting it right maybe it will take more than a few tries depending on texture and length cause everybody&#x27;s is different some people&#x27;s more dense others less. So it depends on your hair how big your puff will be but you do have to fluff a bit after you get it on and make sure you have it clamped all the way down to your scalp so the teeth can grasp your roots</li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is very thick and coily. My hair is softer and a wavy. This is to big for my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my puff cuff!</li>
            <li> When I visited the official PuffCuff website there were size options, but currently the only size available to order is the largest 5&amp;#34; cuff.  The 5&amp;#34; cuff doesn&#x27;t work well in my hair.  I think I need a lot more length and thickness.  I wear it, but I&#x27;m not pleased, because it doesn&#x27;t fit or look as great as the picture!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick natural hair and this clamp keeps it all in place.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I bought this PuffCuff for my daughter and it is great!  She has super long and thick 4A hair and I wanted something easy to use besides a big hair band.  The cuff was very easy to put in and it doesn&#x27;t snag in her hair at all.  I plan to try the mini for myself since I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> The teeth are way too short.  Doesn&#x27;t stay in my full head of hair.  I should have never have purchased it.</li>
            <li> The clamp holds well and it helps making your puff look fuller, but... It takes a lot of work to get your hair to lay down. Unlike the video u can&#x27;t clamp it and go. You have to gel it up, clamp it then tie a scarf around it.</li>
            <li> My hair is chin-length 3c/4b (shoulder-length when stretched).  From previous reviews, I expected the puff cuff to be enormous and difficult to use, but I was desperate for a way to put my hair up without the breakage I get from even ouchless rubber bands.  I was pleased to find it to be neither oversized nor difficult to use.  It looks cute and elegant, and I get way more volume than my sad little ponytails (which I will never go back to).</li>
            <li> I looked at the videos online and the pics online. This didn&#x27;t fit my head as shown. I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with the styles achieved using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it, used it, and broken it. Would I repurchase it? Probably not. The clamp was cheaply made with jagged edges&#x3D; lots of snags on my hair. The joint was snag city. My hair would catch constantly at the joint, every time I removed I had to twist the pieces in opposite directions or pull my hair out. It ended up breaking when I went to wear it one day. Because it&#x27;s bulky, I had to open it as far as possible or it would get caught in my hair. I opened it to far and it cracked and broke. This thing is huge, you can&#x27;t adjust the tightness of it, is not seamless, and cost too much for what you get. It worked well with my WL natural hair, it might not fare well if your hair is thin. Go to your local BSS, find the extra large banana clips and use those instead</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Works perfectly for my hair. Hope its patented. It&#x27;s a winner.  Also would be nice if it came in tortoise shell brown or other fancy options.</li>
            <li> I had more expectations from this product was VERY disappointed especially for the cost!  I was happy when the package arrived, pulled my hair up and didn&#x27;t like it that the gadget snagged my hair.  I haven&#x27;t used once and wish I could return it to get my money back!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cuff for my thick, 4b natural hair. I use it to make the most massive buns. I don&#x27;t get any snagging or resistance, because it is the perfect size. I want another one for my daughter when the mini comes out.</li>
            <li> If you have very thick kinky coily hair this is not for you. Your hair will get caught into the teeth. Not worth the purchase. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the PuffIng. The only reason I rated 4 stars, instead of 5,  is because I needed the smaller size and it is not yet available.  The puff cuff holds the hair in place perfectly without pulling.  I don&#x27;t even realize I have it on.  I have even slept with it on and didn&#x27;t feel it. I Will buy the smaller one as soon as it becomes available.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work well for fine hair. I get much better results using a modified headband. Also, the default size seems to work for people with longer hair.</li>
            <li> It works great. However, I wish I could make it tighter, or a smaller size was available.</li>
            <li> This is the best accessory I own. I found it a bit pricey but the convenience is unmatched. It&#x27;s really easy to use and makes combing my natural hair a breeze. Not many hair clips can handle thick hair like mine. This does it effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I really like the Puff cuff.  It us big enough yet secure &amp; genteel go contain all my kinks in a beautiful puff.  Have to experiment with more styles .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much use for it yet as I have havana braids so I&#x27;m not using it now.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this clip. I enjoy wearing my natural hair in puffs and updos and thought that the puff cuff would be a great alternative to my hair scrongie. (since hair bands and scrongies will pull on your edges and cause alopecia.) When i first opened it, I was impressed by the fact that it felt thick and sturdy. Not nearlly as flimpsy as my other banana clips. My first attempt to use it was nerve wrecking. The hooks at the top got caught in my hair and when i tried to correct it i got the entire comb tangled in my hair! (which in retrospect was pretty darn funny) After i corrected myself and tried again, i was sucessful in clipping it in. My only bad critique on the product is the same as my only compliment. It&#x27;s too loose. That&#x27;s bad because i doesn&#x27;t look as sleek as i would like my updos to look. However, it&#x27;s secure and loose, so i have no worries about damaging my edges. I think i will continue to use it. Maybe i just need practice.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use, clamp is also very loose and does not stay in place.  I was really looking forward to using this.</li>
            <li> This item does not work one natural hair. It&#x27;s too small. Idea is good but doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected and was a little disappointed when I saw that it was hinged. It wasn&#x27;t overly packaged, a padded envelope and the hardest plastic bag ever. I have been wearing it over 5 hours now and I&#x27;m very pleased. I have super thick hair and this holds it securely but not too tight. It removed easily though I did see a strand in the hinge. I will definitely wear it again. I might get one for my 9yr old.</li>
            <li> I love my puff cuff and have worn it almost everyday since receiving it!!! It is effortless and very easy to use!! I gather my hair first, then slip it around my puff and close.  I&#x27;m a lazy natural and typically just wash and go and this product allows me to get different looks depending on placement.  Looking forward to smaller sizes for use on my daughters&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my fine thin 4a hair look full and luscious. my hair is below BSL, with shrinkage its ear length. Using the puff cuff allowed my puff or bun to appear thick and full of curls. It surpasses any goody hair clip/comb.</li>
            <li> It is hard, inflexible and useless</li>
            <li> love it.  just have diffiulty on my part in trying to clamp it together but I think I got the hang of it now.</li>
            <li> I am loving my Puff Cuff!  I use it everyday and have converted friends and family members to the Cuff!  It is so easy to use and so great for not messing with your hair. Love my Puff Cuff!  Will love to get the next sizes</li>
            <li> I really like this clip...if you put it in right there are no tangling issues.  Just wished it was a bit more solid to last longer.  Mine broke in my purse!</li>
            <li> I just bought my clip last week and put it on this morning on a whim, and I&#x27;m in love!!! Since I&#x27;ve gotten older, no matter how big the rubber band/child&#x27;s headband I use to make a puff, my head alway hurts by early afternoon. This baby right here is pain-free!! Thank you for the awesome product!</li>
            <li> Best investment I&#x27;ve made since I&#x27;ve been natural. I&#x27;m 3c/4a very thick hair and it works wonderful. I ordered Saturday and it was delivered Tuesday. Several people asked if my puff was real..lol</li>
            <li> Works well for a nice high puff !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural girls best friend. Creates a perfect puff everytime!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I love everything about the PuffCuff.  I use elastic bands for my puffs and I can fell it pulling on my hair.  I cannot feel the PuffCuff at all.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Greats product. I have had &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; envy for a while now. i couldn&#x27;t seem to perfect mine. Now I am apart of the &amp;#34;puff crew&amp;#34;!!! Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried can compare. Saw product on Instagram and placed an order. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Definitely handy but it really works well with a wash and go.  I couldn&#x27;t get it around my hair with a braid/twist out.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about purchasing it at first because of the reviews and I knew it would be a hit or miss! and it was definitely a hit! I am part of the younger crowd and I will forsure be using this on those days that I need a quick up-do to go to class or even a night out! It probably would look even better if you braid your hair the night before, to get some cute curls in your puff!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck:)</li>
            <li> You have to have long and thick hair to use this size. I would probably do better with the smaller but it was not available</li>
            <li> Awesome product, works great on my hair!!</li>
            <li> I love this - such a simple idea but genius concept! No more headaches, it&#x27;s perfect for a bad hair day, &amp;#34;pineapples&amp;#34; at night, the gym, etc. The $11 price tag may be a bit much for such a simple tool but I think it&#x27;s worth it. My hair is super thick 4a/4b and I use this without any issues or problems. I plan to purchase another one as a backup just in case :-)</li>
            <li> this is something a natural curly girl needs. it is wonderful! I can finally do a high pony and it is big with this love it.  must order another for my kick bag.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I wanted it to do, hold my hair in a larger puff!</li>
            <li> this is a great clip for  natural hair</li>
            <li> Too small of my daughters head.  The plastic is a little to firm to go around her thick hair.  Great idea for a product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick 4C hair and this item works great. Its easy to go in and doesn&#x27;t tug on my edges.The best part is that my puff is very full unlike when I put my hair in scrunchie/goody bands. It feels very light in my hair, that I even forgot I have it in. I have seen other ladies make a bun out of it, I will be trying that soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: The price is a little hefty but I love what the product does. I also wish it came in a dark brown but maybe that will be released in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product. Its great for when you need to get out the house fast or when the weather messes up your hairdo</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my puff cuff! So much so that ive ordered about 5 more for family members.&lt;br /&gt;My naturally curly and thick hair was short when I got it so i had to put my hair in a pony first then remove the scrunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my hair is grown i can gather my hair like a ponytail and with the other hand place the puffcuff around my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its so comfortable some nights I accidentally fall alseep in it.</li>
            <li> I have completely thick curly hair and I found it quite difficult trying to get the clamp on my hair... Plus, when I try using this item, it get tangled up in my curls so much that I found myself having a hard time trying to remove the clamp.... I have only used this item once and have not been able to used it again... I will probably ending up giving it away....</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair....I love it soooooooo much that I ordered another one.</li>
            <li> This tool is a MUST HAVE for all my naturally curlies and anyone with thick hair. If you are wondering how some ladies get that perfect high ponytail or puff on top of there head this is the answer. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> My girl loves it so she&#x27;s happy</li>
            <li> Loooove my puff cuff! Doesn&#x27;t pull at my edges, way better than wearing a tight ponytail ( I&#x27;m in the military, I have to keep my hair up). Great design! Blessings to you, your business, and future endevors!</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer that this clamp may be a bit overpriced but it does work great on my 3c hair. No more trying to create my own holders, this is a good one and seems like it will hold up werll.</li>
            <li> This was great to do my puffs with..</li>
            <li> I am a white woman(with some Irish in my background)with ridicously curly hair..3a-b. Its cut into a few layers and when wet is shoulder length.I purchased the puff cuff directly from the manufacturer after reading the reviews here...LOVE the puff cuff for my hair. It gives me a quick up-doo. I can only use it when my hair is dry, when my hair is wet or damp it is not curly enough to support itself into a puff. I gather my hair into a ponytail, bring the cuff from the bottom of the ponytail, and clip it on the top. I then sort of pull my hair evenly into the clip. I have had so many compliments about my hair it&#x27;s not funny! It&#x27;s easy to remove, my hair has never gotten tangled in it. I have even left it in while sleeping. Super clever design..a huge improvement from the old banana clips.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my puffy hair that I&#x27;m trying to grow out. This clamp is the perfect size and gives your hair a chance to breathe. I don&#x27;t like those jaw clips you find in the regular stores. I&#x27;m quite pleased with this design.</li>
            <li> just used this for the last two days and  it made my hair look too cute.You have to have thick hair to use this. I had a mini fight tryong to get all my natural hair in , but once I got the clasps hooked, I was hooked.</li>
            <li> It is too wide for me.  Maybe if you have very dense hair it would be perfect.  It snags but I expected that, since I have kinky hair and combs don&#x27;t work with my hair anyway. Just reminds me of a round old school banana clip. It has its uses for some.</li>
            <li> It worked for me!!!  I first tried it with a twistout and I thought it was too big.  But when I used it for an old WNG...it was perfect.  I have thick, 4a hair and I usually use a Goody headband wrapped twice for my puffs.  I did the same routine of wetting and putting gel on my edges to make it smooth and neat....also make my hair pliable to me to gather into one hand. I had a nice big puff that wasn&#x27;t too tight or loose.  Its plastic, so I hope it don&#x27;t break.  I think the price is a little high....A major company like Goody could make and sell it for half the price.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  Perhaps the teeth are not long enough.</li>
            <li> I am the type of natural who likes to wear my hair out. I like to show off my big hair and I hate having my hair pulled back because it starts to hurt throughout the day. My little sister told me about this and I ordered it right away. It came very fast and i was excited to use it. I literally don&#x27;t go a day without wearing it. It makes my puffs look fuller and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. I wear high puffs and low puffs. I even wear mine to bed to pineapple but I usually end up just leaving it in the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I have had \\&quot;hand in hair syndrome\\&quot; since I was old enough to do my own hair. This nifty accessory has brought an end to that. The health of my hair has improved so much because I love the way it looks and it is comfortable and versatile. When I wear this I tend to keep my hands out of my hair. I am still waiting for them to release the Puff Cuff Jr. so I can try other styles. I highly recommend this to any natural. Just give it a try, if you don&#x27;t like it Amazon is so great and doing refunds or returns.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this comb/clip. I am an African American with natural hair and this is wonderful for doing top ponytails side ponytails very easy to apply and is actually is hidden if your hair has thickness to it.  it is well made and has a nice thickness to it its very sturdy as well as easy to apply if you&#x27;re looking for something to replace those double stretched headbands this is what you want.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Saves time, and makes my puff look flawless every time! It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and its not tight at all!  I don&#x27;t even feel it!</li>
            <li> This product does not work well with 4C Hair. Once you get all the hair in a bun and the clasps secured, it is very tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It definitely held the hair up but I think it would look better if my hair were longer.</li>
            <li> This clip does live up to its expectation lovely  clip other colours are needed.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase this item and have it delivered to a relative in the US.  My relative then brought the order with her as she was coming to visit us here in the UK.  I find it excellent for my thick coily hair.  It is NOT AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE IN THE UK, which I think is a great pity because there is definitely a market for it here. It is the best hair clip that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;cuff&amp;#34; is PERFECT solution for creating pony tails and &amp;#34;puffs&amp;#34; for afro textured hair! It is like the infamous 80&#x27;s banana clip but rebooted! It works GREAT and is much gentler on your head and scalp then the traditional elastic hair tie. I have been using my puff cuff consistently since I received it. It makes doing my hair in the morning a breeze. My only wish is that I would have thought of the idea first! :) I am looking forward to when the company starts manufacturing smaller sizes. They currently have a &amp;#34;fund me&amp;#34; campaign to help raise money to support the manufacturing for smaller sizes and I&#x27;m all in. My contribution will help support their manufacturing efforts and they will also gift me some FREE puff cuffs for my support! It&#x27;s a sweet deal! The puff cuff is definitely a must have hair accessory for ladies of all hair types.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and hold in place, but I would love if it had a tighter hold. A more flexible clip would allow the teeth to grab my hair more and maybe use less products to hold the shorter strands of hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the big elastic bands didn&#x27;t work for me. But this does!!! This accessory allows me to wear a puff on top or in the back and not pull tightly at all. Also, the wide diameter maximized the puff volume. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at a difficult point in my transition to natural hair. This thing saves me SO much time on busy mornings. Just clamp, fluff, and go. I do wish it was about an inch shorter in diameter though...</li>
            <li> Not just for puffs&lt;br /&gt;I have sisterlocks and I hate those rubber band things when you work 14 hr shifts in a pain. My locks fit perfectly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, and the teeth are far enough apart not to snag my locks. It takes me one minute to do my hair in the morning and when you go to work at 3 am it&#x27;s a blessing.</li>
            <li> At first I used the incorrect technique to put on the puffcuff so I thought my hair was too thick but the second time I did just as the directions on this page said and it worked like a charm! Easy/fast to use and no hair loss! Win Win! PuffCuff you should include the directions in the packaging so customers have better first time use results! :-)</li>
            <li> I really like it, and made sure to folow the instructions of gathering my hair into a ponytail first, then putting the PuffCuff on. However, I am eager to try a smaller size. I thought the 5&amp;#34; would fit my hair, but the PuffCuff Jr. size would probably work better for me. Overall it is a great product, and does provide you with a full puff! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Wow this PuffCuff is amazing.  It holds thick, coily hair while giving a look of a lot of hair.  Also good if you want a loose look with straightened hair.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> The puff cuff is a great idea it just doesn&#x27;t fit everyone unfortunately. I ordered the 5&amp;#34; clip because the other smaller sizes were not available to order although it was after the round about promise date for them to be. It was way to big for my head and I was unable to use it. So now it sits in my drawer with the rest of my failed hair clips.</li>
            <li> I like the Puff Cuff, I bought 2, one for me and one for my daughter. Holds hair like its supposed to and comes out of hair like it is supposed to do, Make sure to follow instructions! I had no pulling or anything. Very loose puff, not heavy feeling at all. It&#x27;s almost like you don&#x27;t have anything in your hair. My only complaint if you want to call it that is the 5&amp;#34; cuff is to big for my hair. My daughter&#x27;s hair it fits perfectly. But my daughter&#x27;s hair is longer than mine. So in my opinion if you have short hair, the smaller cuffs they are coming out with would probably work better for you.</li>
            <li> I really like this product I wish it came in different sizes. Great for natural or relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> There needs to be more than one size for the clip. It doesn&#x27;t work well for my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> If you have straight hair, this product is not made for you! It was made for US!!! Keyword. PUFF. I love this product and I am still growing my hair out, I have a medium fro so the small cuff works for me,  the people complaining just seem like haters to me, let us shine please!! Be gone.</li>
            <li> Love my PuffCuff! I have long 3b-4a hair so it was a little difficult to use AT FIRST because I tried when my hair was wet. If your hair tends to hang, I would definitely wait until it&#x27;s dry and has poofed up a bit before attempting to secure it with the PuffCuff. This item would be ABSOLUTELY PERFECT if it came in a variety of sizes. 5&amp;#34; is great but just a little large for my hair. I don&#x27;t have all the volume type 4 curlies have :( this would be phenomenal for my hair in 3-4&amp;#34;. Other than that, it does what it says it does and I love it!</li>
            <li> I like this hair accessory. I use it almost everyday, but it took me some time to get use to it. I&#x27;m still transitioning to natural, so my hair isn&#x27;t quiet thick enough for this clamp. I think a smaller clamp will work better, but they are still working on making those available. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the clamp doesn&#x27;t hold my pony as tight as I like, but works well with a headband or scarf. Overall I like it, and I would recommend it. If your hair is a little less kinky (mines isn&#x27;t as coily) wait until the smaller clamps are available and try it again.</li>
            <li> Meh- it&#x27;s ok. Maybe I need the smaller size. Doesn&#x27;t seem too durable.</li>
            <li> It was okay not what I expected. My hair is thick but it was for thick bushy hair would not hold mine. But  over all food</li>
            <li> I love this clamp! I wear it everyday in my hair and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> Was NOT happy with this. I don&#x27;t have thick hair  in the least and couldn&#x27;t get all of my hair in this thing!</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and thought I would try this product. However it get my hair to fit and clamp the puffcuff was impossible! Not sure if my hair is to thick or what. It pulled my hair also which I didn&#x27;t like. I will stick with my head band</li>
            <li> I love this just right for my short natural hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well to make a puff. I just wish it came in a smaller diameter for finer hair types or smaller heads - lol. Also please bring us more fashion colors! I do think it&#x27;s a bit pricey for one clamp though.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick, this doesnt work. It doesnt grab your hair securely at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great invention. Pulling my hair back hurts so bad I&#x27;m very tender headed. I have to wear my hair in a ponytail or bun for work and this makes my life easier and less painful. I have a loose curl pattern so I do not exactly get a puff but it keeps my curls out of my face. My hair isn&#x27;t super thick so maybe if it was a little smaller I could achieve more height with my puff.</li>
            <li> Excellent for thick natural hair, does not tug at the hair or hold too tight.</li>
            <li> It works great !!!! Waiting for the other sizes to become available!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very helpful... Enjoying the PuffCuff😀</li>
            <li> Just purchased the puff cuff a few days ago and I love it. Glad to finally find a clip that will hold all of my hair!</li>
            <li> This will work for even the thickest hair!</li>
            <li> So I received my product yesterday. I was VERY excited to get it! I tried to use it several times and for some reason it did not work for me. I posted a comment on the Facebook Page of PuffCuff. It was not negative at all but apparently it was not the \\&quot;GOOD\\&quot; review that she wanted. I posted that I had just received my puffCuff but it was not working for me at all and maybe that I was doing something wrong. The next day my comment had been deleted. So instead of her reaching out to me to offer suggestions or to see why it wasn&#x27;t working she just dismissed it all together. What kind of customer service is that? I even sent her private message after I noticed that it was deleted and there was NO response. She&#x27;s making all these posts on her page how she wants people to provide feedback etc but really what she means is she only wants positive feedback. I am sending this product back mostly on the sucky customer service. If someone would have at least reached out to me I would have been happy to give it another try. I value good customer service and unfortunately a lot of business&#x27;s lack it these days especially a lot of black businesses and I try to support small black business&#x27;s as much as possible but the attitudes, lack of professionalism and customer service usually sucks! I would not suggest purchasing this item unless you are fine w/ giving your money to a business that does not really care about its customers!! I will keep MY hard earned money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The owner did end up replying to my message and this is what she said: \\&quot;I&#x27;m trying to launch a new product and would like public post to be as positive as possible\\&quot; So there you have it. If she is filtering her reviews based on POSITIVE only then she is being dishonest. I like to read both positive AND Negative reviews when purchasing products. Be weary of companies that only show positive reviews. They are possibly filtering all the bad ones out. That is NOT good a good business practice. At least this is one honest review that she can&#x27;t delete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/9/14: I decided to post part of my reply that I gave to another person so that people can see my actual review on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things stated that this product would not do was pull at your hair. My hair got tangled in this thing every single time I tried it. It reminded me of those old school banana clips and those always got tangled in my hair. This is no different, its just round. This size was way too big and bulky and when I got it on to how I thought I may like it, it was just too tight and pulling at my edges. When I put it on loser, it was worst. So yes most of this review was about her customer service because I feel that is just as important too, but the product was certainly not worth the money either, it DOES pull hair and get tangled in the teeth and it was no different than a lot of other products like this that don&#x27;t work. I have since found something that actually works and my puffs are amazing! The cost is a lot cheaper and it doesn&#x27;t tangle or pull my hair. Hope this helps.s is one honest review that she can&#x27;t delete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/9/14: I decided to post part of my reply that I gave to another person so that people can see my actual review on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things stated that this product would not do was pull at your hair.

            <li> The construction is simple and cheap. The edges are sharp and easily gets caught in my 4c hair. I find using this puff cuff to be difficult as I can&#x27;t easily pull all my hair into it. If I put it on to glide onto my hair it snags it. If I secure it in without gliding it on my hair it just looks like all my ponytails do that I use a goody band on. I will keep at it, but with my hair type it does not go on easily like it does for the ladies who slick their edges back on those YouTube videos. I don&#x27;t smooth my edges down since that does not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> Clumsy....... Don&#x27;t like it at all I&#x27;m hoping my luck improves as my hair gets a bit longer and I like this comb</li>
            <li> Love this clamp &amp; it&#x27;s comfortable for all day wear. Does not cause any stress to the hair.</li>
            <li> This is for women with a LOT of hair, preferably curly. I repeat, A LOT and very thick. It is very big. I won&#x27;t be using it because although I have curly hair I don&#x27;t have enough to fill it in. I guess it was my bad because the description did say &#x27;Thick, Coily, Textured Hair&#x27;...</li>
            <li> I like this hair clip a lot! I have very thick hair. I would recommend it to any one who has this hair type (4c).</li>
            <li> Not for thicke hair. Great idea but the creator should listen to the fedback to improve the product.  I suggest having different sizes for hair density and lengths of hair..ie wide combs for short thick hair. I like the product but I will have to wait until my hair is longer due to the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I dont like the hook that connects the clips together it sometimes gets tangled in my 4c coily hair. The hook clips on top  of each other so keeping my huge puff tight while trying to lock the clamp together without getting it caught in my puff gets annoying very quickly!  Non the less its a cool idea wish there were smaller size clamps.</li>
            <li> An incredible creation for those with a thick unruly mane! I can wear my hair in a bun or puff without stressing my edges. It is a life saver for those bad hair days when you have to rush to get to work! I can&#x27;t wait until she creates some smaller ones so I can create more styles! My scalp is sensitive to hairpins and rubber bands so this gives me the freedom to wear a ponytail without headaches or irritation!! I Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Nit really that good for curly hair...my hair kept getting stuck n it&#x27;s too big for my hair type...3B &amp; 3 C</li>
            <li> I could not get this clamp to work for me&lt;br /&gt;Even after watching tutorials on YouTube and following instructions I just ended up snagging my hair and in pain! Such a shame</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and this works!</li>
            <li> Can pull on my hair at times. I have to be very careful with it.</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair and the PuffCuff holds my updo ponytail in place, and its real durable. Love it</li>
            <li> Perfect, I love it.  Gave mine to my adult daughter, I&#x27;m ordering another.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 3 times but so far I like it. It is hard plastic (not flexible) and I fear it will break over time. This is why I did not give it 5 stars. It takse a little more time trying to get all of my hair into this thing than I like but I like the look once I do get it into it.</li>
            <li> This is great for thick coily or curly hair. My daughter doesn&#x27;t get a headache the way she does with the tight rubber bands or scrunchy</li>
            <li> It definitely takes some practice to put it on properly. And the fact that I have really thick almost shoulder length 4c hair may have something to do with that, lol. But it really helps if you hold your hair as if you were putting it into a pony tail with one hand and put on the puff cuff with the other hand. I&#x27;m excited about my high puffs without the pain of a tight headband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to see more sizes available.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s perfect for my type 4 hair. The thing that I like the most is that it doesn&#x27;t feel tight or pull my hair in any way.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. It&#x27;s big enough to hold the thickness of my hair without being tight but still holding everything in place. Great item. It&#x27;s become one of my staple items. My buns and puff comes out perfect</li>
            <li> I think I have to much hair for the cuff. I couldn&#x27;t get my hair in a puff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful but it&#x27;s very large. I  need one a little smaller - medium sized.</li>
            <li> I like it, but my hair needs to be longer to use</li>
            <li> Wonderful it fit all my thick hair. If you have think hair its easy to manipulate the puff.</li>
            <li> I love the puff cuff clamp it gives me the perfect size puff.</li>
            <li> Does not work for 4b/4c hair, if it&#x27;s not stretched!</li>
            <li> Does provide a comfortable hold but the size is too big.</li>
            <li> When I read about this product on one of my favorite natural hair blogs, I just had to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background:  I have natural type 4 hair--mostly 4A, but with patches of 4B and a little 4C throughout.  I have very high density hair, so it&#x27;s mega thick and approximately shoulder-length when stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Puff Cuff did nothing for my hair.  I couldn&#x27;t even fasten it around my hair to close the clasps of the &amp;#34;cuff&amp;#34;.  I made multiple attempts to make this thing work, but to no avail.  I guess I should&#x27;ve paid more attention the similar reviews.  Also, as other reviewers have stated--it&#x27;s not worth $11 even if it did work.  The product is a simple plastic construction.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> So easy to use! I love this hair clip. It allows you to easily put your hair into an extended ponytail. There was no pulling or snagging. I love this design. I wish I found it sooner. Must have for any natural with thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Nice ,with instructions for natural hair.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I went ahead and purchased this.  It came quickly with Prime and was packaged in a padded envelope.  Ive been wearing it at home for about 4 hours now so I&#x27;m limited info.  My initial response is cool!  It took me a couple of tries to get it on right.  I ended up pulling my hair in a loose ponytail with a scrunchie and then putting the clamp on and then fluffing my hair out.  I will say the plastic..while smooth..is hard.  There is no give.  I really wish it was more flexible.  I have fine 4b/c hair so I didn&#x27;t have much trouble with it.  Super duper thick hair.....I don&#x27;t know.  This is not adjustable.  The 5&#x27; is it. It is MUCH easier to close than banana clips.  It feels really light.  Like there is nothing on my head. I keep checking to make sure it hasn&#x27;t fallen off.  (it hasn&#x27;t..LOL) There is not an ounce of tension on any strand of hair anywhere.  I will wear it all day tomorrow but so far this is a total keeper for me.  It totally beats all the other ties and knee-highs I&#x27;ve been using.  I&#x27;ll update this after putting it through its paces some more.  I&#x27;ll add a couple of initial pics so you can see.</li>
            <li> Really like the puffcuff. My hair is very fine thin nd the 5\\&quot; size is too big but I make it work for now. Very easy to put on very light which is good that means no pulling or major headaches. Will be very grateful for smaller sizes to come nd will purchase with a quickness. This is a must have in my hair accessory bin.</li>
            <li> I just hated it! My hair is thick didn&#x27;t work well for me. I could have done better with the Elastic band.</li>
            <li> I Was extremely hopeful for this product and anticipated using it as an alternative to hair bands to hold my hair in a looser pony tail. To no avail, the puff cuff doesn&#x27;t work or even stay in my fine wavy/curly hair which is considered to be a 3a hair type. It simply slides right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great concept for curly hair. After watching YouTube videos I noticed the puff cuff was used by my curlier or coily haired gals. I&#x27;ll simply gift it to someone at work with curlier hair with the hope she will find it useful.</li>
            <li> For starters, I want to tell anyone and everyone with extremely curly hair especially 4c that this right here is the BEST invention made!!  I bought this on February 21 and received it on the 25th and today is March 3 and my hair has been in a beautiful puff courtesy of my clamp and I just want to say THANK YOUUUU!!!!  I love it n great job!!  I would definitely recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Its a great concept but it was too big for me. I have it to someone who had much thinker hair. They should offer smaller sizes.</li>
            <li> Love it! Can&#x27;t wait until they have a smaller size too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is my hair type or what but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work right.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be able to use it but it was a waste of money. It didn&#x27;t work on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of using the PuffCuff.  Everyone was amazed at how full my puff was.  They also liked the idea of the Puffcuff in general.  I have used it for about two weeks now along with my 5 and 13 yo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very neat tool to have for natural hair. It&#x27;s a lot better to use this for a ponytail/bush then using a ponytail holder. I do believe that it should come with some kind of instructions. Lol I know it sounds silly, but thought the combs should go down into my hair and it actually hurt, but I found out after a couple of tries that it did not have to go down to my scalp for it to work. A little business card or a thank you note would be nice as well. It&#x27;s just the small things that matter. I will recommend this product to my natural friends.</li>
            <li> Had to give it to a friend because my hair isn&#x27;t thick enough!</li>
            <li> Okay I didn&#x27;t use this product.  I purchased it for future use.  However, I&#x27;m rating it high because I like the construction and I know once my hair is longer enough it will work.</li>
            <li> I really like this, just open gather your hair and click it to close. This helps me on days when I do not want to fuss over my hair, quick click , and a nice updo to concure the day. Definelty buy this ladies for your thick curly natural hair, it works.</li>
            <li> Love love love mine! Ive had mine for a year now and I don&#x27;t leave home without it!  Quick, easy, convenient, and stylish!</li>
            <li> My puffs are AMAZING!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the item last week and used for the first time on a wash n go. It was easy to put on and I realized that the wider I made the cuff, the larger my puff was (no pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I put it on a twistout- so my hair was stretched. It was GORGEOUS!!! I wear them high on top of my head and pull my hair forward sort of kind of like a Faux Hawk or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has only been a week, so I can&#x27;t rate on durability, but I hope that it is durable for long term, because I definitely see myself using this product regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job, Puff Cuff team! You deserve whatever is coming to you!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I bought it 2 months ago and using it has become my go-to style. It has sturdy construction but I am about to purchase a back-up just in case so I can be sure I always have it! I get so many compliments and I make sure to direct people to where they can purchase it. The size is perfect for me and I was able to use it easily without tutorials. I don&#x27;t like how restricted elastic bands make my hair look. My hair is natural, 4a texture and it is very thick. I just slick it up with Ecostyler gel and water and tie it down with a scarf. In the morning I just put the clamp on and use my fingers to fluff out my puff. My hair covers the clamp completely, has a nice round circumference and looks so pretty. From reading prior reviews it looks like it helps to really know your hair. It may not work for everyone like anything else but if it does...you&#x27;ll love it!!! Thank you...thank you for making it available.</li>
            <li> I think the clamp should be less than five inches( or more complete instructions given for fine hair) The round shape is good, but by the time you figure out that you don&#x27; t have thick enough hair to fill this size clamp, you will take it out to re-do, only to discover that if you are not extremely careful, your hair will get tangled up causing difficulty removing the clamp. I got a headache after having it in all day. I got compliments on the look once I wore it all day. I can do multiple hairstyles with the clamp. It is perfect for working out. I can wear my raffia-visor sunhat when I wear the puff high- it comes through the top. I can wear a low puff with my raffia fiber sunhat, for an elegant summer sun look.</li>
            <li> Not an item for a caucasian</li>
            <li> I like it so far. It&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair which really surprised me since my hair&#x27;s kind of sensitive. The puff looks good. I was skeptical at first but I&#x27;m glad I bought it in the end, it will really help out a lot with my hair.</li>
            <li> does not fit too tight, which is good.. it does grasp all the hair Thanks</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, product was exactly what I ordered. I still getting the hang of the puff cuff, I have small hands but very thick hair so it&#x27;s a struggle lol. But I&#x27;m still happy I bought the puff cuff</li>
            <li> For my thick 4c hair it&#x27;s a little hard to close, but for my daughter&#x27;s 4A hair she has no problems with it and it really gives her the perfect puff!</li>
            <li> Just perfect for keeping these locks in place. Lightweight and easy to use. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this clip.  It is just what I needed.  Since my natural hair is getting longer, the regular ponytail holders do not give me the big round puff that I was seeking.  I had already had banana clips and attempted using those, but they were way to constricting and did not give a good look.  I guess if you wanted to go for a Mohawk it would work, but that&#x27;s not my thing.  The PuffCuff Hair Clamp is simple and one should not need a manual on how to put it on your hair.  It&#x27;s not rocket science.  I read some of the negative reviews, which I think are unfair and possibility the reason for the review were more operator error and not the product.  Your hair should be manageable and to make natural hair manageable, it should be a little moist.  I moistened my hair every day with a leave in conditioner or just water.  I pull my hair in a pony tail with a ponytail holder and then I put the clip on.  I take off the ponytail holder and fluff up my puff for the desired look.</li>
            <li> Hair got stuck sometimes. Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as using a stretchy band does. Not sure if I would purchase this tool again for $11.</li>
            <li> It is definitely for THICK hair.  My hair was too thin for this so I gave it away and they love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military and was hoping the PuffCuff would give me a professional hairstyle and within regulations.  I was very disappointed.  Not only did it not grab the hair tight enough, it was actually hard to get the clamp around my hair to close it.  I know my hair is thick, but I even tried using a head band first and then placing the PuffCuff around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually tricked the PuffCuff around my hair but then I looked like my four-year old daughter.  The PuffCuff sat at the top of my crown and there was a little afro puff above that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPECIAL NOTE:  The PuffCuff DOES NOT give you the sleek look that you can achieve with a headband.  I felt like an adolescent that day, and I work in a military clinic with medical professionals (and one couldn&#x27;t help but comment that &amp;#34;I like your hair the other way&amp;#34;).  I was hopeful this product would have solved a lot of problems associated with wearing natural hair in the military but it did not.</li>
            <li> Thought the product would have lasted longer for the price paid. The clasp broke and i do not use this product on a daily basis</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable to wear all day...</li>
            <li> Works great for giving you a wide and secure puff.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit my puffs at all.  My hair is not super long, but it is very very dense.  I was skeptical about the product, but the creator stresses that it should fit thick, natural hair types, so I decided to give it a go.  The second I tried to put it on, it got tangled in my  coils and I almost had to cut it out.  Then, when I gave it a second chance, it was way to small for my hair.  I honestly think that this is a good concept, but it needs to go back to the drawing board.  Maybe offer larger sizes for us girls with more hair.  Also, it would help if it was seamless/teethless  The seams snagged my strands and the teeth just caused tangles, making the product not really coily-girl friendly.  I ended up gifting it to a friend who doesn&#x27;t have thick or coily hair and it worked for her.  I would have gave it 3 stars if it wasn&#x27;t heavily marketed towards &amp;#34;thick, coily, textured hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> FINALLY!!! As my hair grew I was no longer able to wear a puffy puff because I couldn&#x27;t get my elastic to stop riding up. This product solved that problem and I&#x27;m able to rock a big puff again. Fantastic natural hair invention!!!</li>
            <li> I love this because I can finally wear my hair in a puff which looks full with the cuff.  easy to use and very durable.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when i saw the advertisemen Of this product. After reading the reviews,  I&#x27;ll Pass.</li>
            <li> I love my puff cuff it makes my hair look so voluminous. Way better than a regular scrunchie?</li>
            <li> Decided to try this despite the expensive price and somewhat negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually liked it and it served it purpose.  I had quit wearing my hair up because the band I used would give me a headache.  This allowed me to wear it up without any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is basically a wide-mouthed banana clip.  Yes, it can get tangled when you take it out, unless you know how to do so without getting your hair tangled, which I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of thick, kinky-curly hair and this size worked fine.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind a smaller one for my daughter&#x27;s hair, but not at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree it would be nice if they came in different colors.  My hair is not black, so I have to make sure to cover the clip up with my hair.</li>
            <li> Love my puffcuffand it Works perfectly with my hair and my daughters hair! Would recommend all naturalist to wear it.</li>
            <li> The teeth gets caught in the hair, not a very well made product</li>
            <li> Love it! Just wish they&#x27;d hurry up with the smaller sizes...and larger just in case I wear a kinky weave this summer😁</li>
            <li> But was way too big for my hair...But its what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I really love the concept of the Puff Cuff, but for my hair (which I thought was full and thick) it was too large.  Something for my hair would be about 1 to 1 1/2 inches.  Hope you will make such a product someday and if so I will definitely be a customer!</li>
            <li> My hair is African American thick!  This clamp not only holds all of my hair, it is truly unbreakable!  If you have thin hair, this might not work for you as the clamp is very wide.  Thin hair would get lost in this clamp.</li>
            <li> I simply adore this product.  It is so incredibly easy to use.  I can even fold my hair back under the cuff to make my hair look more formal...love that!  I cannot wait for the smaller sizes!</li>
            <li> My hair gets snagged on the metal clamp nail. I hate it! I put oil on the metal piece and it still rips hair  out of my head. Besides that, its a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this cuff.  I have thick, shoulder length 4a hair and this makes my puff look bigger than using a hairtie.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t cause headaches and seems like it&#x27;s much gentler on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the concept. Normal banana clips would pop open in the thickness of my hair. This one may be just a little too wide for my shoulder length kinky hair. It makes a decent puff, but I think I will order the 3&amp;#34; as soon as I can. I have not had issues with it pulling hair or snagging. The edges are smooth enough to not have caused me issue.</li>
            <li> I love this banana clip for my curly mane! It&#x27;s perfect! not too tight like a goody band nor is it too loose so thumbs up to whom ever made this!</li>
            <li> Teeth could be a little longer.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Took a little getting used to but i love it.  My hair would not stay in ponytail, it would slide off.  Rubberbands didn&#x27;t get all the hair and they break hair off.  I wish i could get more in different colors.  Now i can create puffs, ponytails, and buns.  Love the product and nice to see women of color using their talents to manufacturing a useful product</li>
            <li> I need to wait for my hair to get longer to be able to use this.</li>
            <li> I cannot get it around my hair but I will keep trying when it gets longer hopefully I can fasten it!</li>
            <li> I like this clamp and it&#x27;s ease of use.  It does help me in achieving the cutest puffs.  It does not snatch my hair and is pretty easy for me to install and remove.  It would be nice if they offered the smaller sizes on Amazon.com,</li>
            <li> I love my puffcuff. It works better than tying an elastic headband around my head for a puff. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it takes more work for people with thicker hair to get ALL of their hair in there, stretch or not. For me to get ALL of my hair up in the cuff, I have to pineapple my hair with a scrunchie and tie my scarf around my edges to lay them down overnight. And yes, I do wet my hair. Then I leave the scrunchie on so that all of my hair is in one place so I can close it (still difficult at times) but it makes my puffs look gorgeous. I feel they should make a 6&amp;#34; cuff for thicker hair. Other than the difficulty of closing the cuff (and again I did have stretched, wet hair), it&#x27;s a really good thing to use besides elastic bands, shoe strings, banana combs and other stuff.</li>
            <li> For now I will say that this clamp is okay since my hair wasn&#x27;t at the point where I could wear it comfortably. I do however love the concept where the edges of the air aren&#x27;t being pulled unnecessarily which is what I need when I do place my hair in a puff. When I purchased this my hair was a bit shorter so more of the clamp was shown and less hair. It&#x27;s been a year so I will give it a try again and see how I like it when styling my hair.</li>
            <li> It works splendid on my hair when it&#x27;s voluminous enough and doesn&#x27;t snag in the slightest. One freshly done hair it&#x27;s a bit big so I will be awaiting for smaller sizes. Works great for bunning too and doesn&#x27;t cause stress on the edges like panty hose and the like is apt to do.</li>
            <li> Wished it was adjustable.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the PuffCuff.  It is so much better than the large band!!! Now all I wear is Puffs!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly sturdy, and does what it says it&#x27;ll do. The only hiccups I had were:&lt;br /&gt;1) Ever so often, I&#x27;d get hair caught in the hinges&lt;br /&gt;2) It didn&#x27;t make my puff as big as it normally is with my stretched headbands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Probably! Would I recommend it to a friend? Yup!</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair, it works great.</li>
            <li> I brought this with high hopes and well I was a little let down. I do like the puff I get it is nice because it is a big hole for your hair to do what it does. Having said that the problem is my hair tangles really easily in it and it can be tough to close. Plus it does not hold your hair down instead it puffs back up or you need to wear a headband to keep your hair down. For the price I thought it would be a little higher quality</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but nothing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is only about chin length the puff cuff made my puff smaller than the band&#x27;s I usually use.</li>
            <li> Large and strong. Great for kinky hair.</li>
            <li> My go to hair accessory! I keep it in my car and need to get another to keep in my gym bag!</li>
            <li> Very flimsy. No different than the dollar ones</li>
            <li> I love, love, love my puff cuff! I wear a super curly weave and it keeps it in place! no pulling, no bunching, no poking. I wore it all the way up and kept in and slept with it for 3 days with no problems. no I ssues with tangling. I can&#x27;t wait to try it  with my 4c natural hair! I look fwd to the smaller sizes!</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, this is a must.  I&#x27;ve had issues with using bands for my puff &amp; I end up with a headache. This puff cuff does not give the same issue. It can be worn all day.</li>
            <li> Awesome idea, would love to give it 5 stars but it&#x27;s just too large to wear tightly.. But they are apparently coming out with smaller models soon.</li>
            <li> Love this thing! Great investment for naturals. I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, so I was a bit skeptical of how this would make my puff look, but it actually creates the illusion of an even thicker and fuller puff.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for any curly girl with really thick hair!  I love that this doesn&#x27;t force my hair into a small space and that my curls can be wild and free.  I have to be careful when unhooking the clamp and ensuring that I don&#x27;t pull my hair but I certainly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> i love this clip. its a little too big but it holds my hair tight enough and it makes my hair appear thicker and longer. this clip is awesome and i recommend it to any natural.</li>
            <li> The 5&amp;#34; is too big to securely hold my hair.  This will work for you if you have very thick/coarse hair that is at least medium length.  I have borderline 3c/4a hair, and I can get my hair in the puffcuff, but it sags and does not hold my hair in place securely.  I love the concept, and think this is a great styling accessory for naturals who already have limited options.  They really need to work on getting more sizes for different hair types and lengths though.  If it were a smaller size, I&#x27;d give it a 5.  Still, I recommend anyone try it.  It wasn&#x27;t a home run for me, but I think this could be a great styling tool for a lot of other naturals.</li>
            <li> this was extremely big not what I expected</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my wife and these are her words: Really like the cuff, but I just don&#x27;t have the length right now to wear it the way I want to. I got a haircut in March and am now in the awkward in  between stages growing it back. the sides and back are short while the top is long. I got all of my hair up, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t stay up.... :(  I am really excited for my hair to grow longer so that I can try and use it again. It is a great idea and alternative to the banana clip as it is very light and doesn&#x27;t pull and tug on your hair when you use it..It&#x27;s going to be an awesome hair tool!!! :)</li>
            <li> I am considering purchasing this hair styling tool. Based on the positive reviews by the majority I will most likely purchase. However, I am a bit concerned about reviews stating that the seams along the teeth are rough and catch on their hair. I am curious whether or not those who have had problems with the tool had detangled, moisturized and oiled their coily hair first. Even though I would be excited and anxious to try out the clamp when it arrived, I would not do so if my hair was dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this product a 3 but that would be unfair because it does exactly what it says it will. Beware folks with small heads. It you don&#x27;t have a mound of hair this contraption won&#x27;t quite work or fit right. I give it 4 stars because, in my personal opinion, it&#x27;s made for big heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great idea though!</li>
            <li> I love love love this clamp.  My six year old daughter was cursed with a mom that does not enjoy &amp;#34;doing hair&amp;#34; and she has LOTS of it.  Her hair is long and thick.  What;s worse is that she is EXTREMELY tender headed.  This clamp is great for those days that I cannot detangle her hair.  It gives her a great updo without straining her edges.  She loves it, and I am ordering one for me too!!</li>
            <li> My hair is too thick for this product.  I was able to get it on but it was a process. I will give it try on my wet hair. I hope I have better luck.</li>
            <li> Worst thing ever if your hair is soft and curly like mine. My hair just plopped in the back and it&#x27;s not even long. If your hair is really thick like a 4c, then this is perfect because the hair should&#x27;nt fall.</li>
            <li> I thought I would like this . But the actually item looks the a hair nightmare . If the clip was make out of a softer material I would use . I threw the clip away.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with the quality of this product.  The plastic has sharp edges which breaks and tears at your hair.  I would definitely not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my natural hair</li>
            <li> I am very surprised at how high this product is rated by others due to its poor quality. I have not used it because I dont trust it will last. I feel it will pop off my hair while i am surrounded by people and I refuse to be embarras by a hair clip.</li>
