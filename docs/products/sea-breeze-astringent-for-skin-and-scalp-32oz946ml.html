            <li> Received this product super fast. I have used SEA breeze for my hair and my face for many years!  I just wish they sold SEA Breeze Sensitive in larger quantities (i.e., by the gallon).</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s family has genes of loosing or thinning hair. So my mom started to use this product in her 30&#x27;s. She is in late 50&#x27;s now. She is the only one has lots of hair. So I started to use in early 20&#x27;s. I am 30&#x27;s. I massage my scalp with it every night after shower like my mom. I have very healthy scalp and hair. Since I come from oily scalp family(mom and dad family), I need this product to remove excess oils. I heard oily scalp can cause loosing hair.   In Japan, lots of hair salon use this product. I feel so good to massage my scalp every night!!! I will continue all my life.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel on my scalp, and the smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> It is accomplishing what I was told that it would do. Thus far, it is very effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been only three days of using this product and I already feel a great improvement on my scalp !! Thank You.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my barber 25 years ago for my hair.  I use for hair, Shaving lotion and for all skin irritations.</li>
            <li> Our family uses this product for dry scalp--which seems to occur with our heated winter environment.  I have been unable to find this product in any stores so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  Also a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My sixteen year old has had a tender, itchy , red scalp since toddler days --- and  expensive dermatologist&#x27;s meds  don&#x27;t help.  This astringent dries it right up.</li>
            <li> The product is great but it seems like it smells different from the one I was using for years. It bothers me a bit but I guess can get used to it.</li>
            <li> Convenient 32 oz Bottle for skin antisepsis and scalp treatment.  There are numerous mint shampoos on the market, but the Sea Breeze astringent is useful for pre-shampoo scalp treatment.  In the winter, treatment of the scalp a couple of times a week helps prevent and palliate scalp itch problems created by cold weather.  Mint, including peppermint, stimulates circulation to the skin, including the scalp.</li>
            <li> If glycerin is one of the listed ingredients, then this is definitely NOT the original formula.  Also, if it&#x27;s made by Idelle Labs in 2004 or earlier, the formula is close but not identical.  But read the list of ingredients very carefully or you will be disappointed.  Believe me, if I was able to list 1/2 a star, I would have.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product before. I like the way it tingles my scalp. It was recommended to me by my beautician because I was suffering from an itchy scalp. For the ladies who have itchy scalps due to too much hair product build up, use this. It cleans the hair follicles and scalp. It does not leave residue on your hair. It also makes your hair smell delightful!</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to do take the itch off the sclap.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this old favorite</li>
            <li> Got this due to a number of reviews that said how it really helped their scalp and hair. I couldn&#x27;t agree more. It works better than dry shampoo but I actually use both together for all my off days from shampooing. Really takes the oil right out. I spray it on my roots in sections all over the top of my head, then blow dry it dry, add some sprays of dry shampoo, and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> Really thought this would give a good astringent like feeling especially when applying to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly it does not.&lt;br /&gt;Expected more.</li>
            <li> Received fast and well packed.  I love this product, it&#x27;s been around forever</li>
            <li> The benefits of Sea Breeze speaks for its self. Great product and fast shipping from Amazon.</li>
