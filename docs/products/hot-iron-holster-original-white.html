            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It is silicone and sticks to the surface of my granite top vanity with no problem.</li>
            <li>I figure clutter is more of an eyesore than this.</li>

            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This work like a charm, love it</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It clings perfectly to any smooth surface, you can leave your curler either on the flat surface or the holster</li>
            <li>This holster is very cool-</li>
            <li>Perfect tool to keep your flat iron/curling iron readily accessible when you need it</li>
            <li>This is so cool!</li>
            <li>Does not stick to things easily.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described---- grips the lid of the toilet tank perfectly</li>
            <li>also works great just for a place to store my extra combs, brushes etc</li>
            <li>I might get a few as presents - would make a great gift!</li>
            <li>This gets them out of the way but keeps them accessible.</li>
            <li>This is space saving while being a safe way to store hot styling tools.</li>
            <li>and it keeps the iron in safe place when it is hot.</li>
            <li>Excellent space saver in a small, cramped bathroom.</li>
            <li>This is simple yet perfect product to clear counter.</li>
            <li>Stays in place...easy to clean</li>
            <li>and they are adjustable as to how much you do or don&#x27;t want on your bech top.</li>
            <li>Note that we don&#x27;t have a pedestal sink as they show in the picture, which was clearly on purpose (nicely done, Marketing Department).</li>
            <li>But I love being able to put my hot straightener directly in it.</li>
            <li>The hot iron holster has exceeded our expectations!  </li>
            <li>Something so simple works so nicely.....</li>
            <li>The half that goes on the counter has a nice gripping effect to hold it in place and protects the counter from the hot surface.</li>
            <li>I wish they had more designs to be able to put other products in (like toothbrush holders, etc.)</li>
            <li>I have to secure it with other objects on top.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hot iron off the counter where space is at a premium</li>
            <li>Currently needed just a touch more counter space</li>
            <li>This is the first that worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two... one for my brushes, and one for the hot iron.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Looks great and the flap is long enough to have other things placed on top and off the counter!</li>
            <li>I have it exactly like the photo, on the edge of my pedestal sink, and it falls off every time.</li>
            <li>Adds so much storage room for curling irons even when hot.</li>
            <li>Bought 2 after seeing it used for its main purpose, hot irons.</li>
            <li>it is very sticky on the flap and secures itself to your sink</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really use it anymore...</li>
            <li>something to keep your stuff in without drilling a whole to your cabinets.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>but my hair dryer is always ready to use.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>And it is not going anywhere, it really stays put.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much space on my bathroom sink for my hair irons</li>
            <li>Use this with most other bathroom cabinets and you&#x27;re either blocking drawers or doors when you use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually have been using it to hold a gameboy and some games on the back of the toilet (BEST way to pass toilet time if you ask me!).</li>
            <li>I paid around $20 and it seemed to be a decent value.  </li>
            <li>Decent quality...</li>
            <li>OK, seems like a few bucks high, but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This product actually works, can fit multiple hot iron tools, and keeps the items organized.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Such a genius thing for solving the problem of a hot curling iron on the bathroom vanity!</li>
            <li>That takes up the whole thing so it would be nice if it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li>I have pretty much stopped using it entirely.</li>
            <li>Safely stores hot iron in a subtle not intrusive way.</li>
            <li>Simple, no hole to worry about the size of the barrel of the curling iron, flat iron also fits easily.  </li>
            <li>Finally - a product to hold the hot straightner and curling irons.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to clear some space on my bathroom counter and found this online.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stayed for almost a full day then fell down.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean (just gets  little dusty now and again) and never falls off.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no slipping.  </li>
            <li>Only drawback is that from the picture I thought it would be big enough to hold two curling irons and it doesn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not wet, there&#x27;s nothing in it.</li>
            <li>The material makes it hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone tight on space for a hot item.</li>
            <li>I have looked for a long time for something to hold my curling irons, hot or cold, and tried many.  </li>

            <li> I have looked for a long time for something to hold my curling irons, hot or cold, and tried many.  </li>
            <li> Not sure they could improve it much by making it smaller,</li>
            <li> I put it on the back of my toilet and have my hair dryer in it.</li>
            <li> I ordered a white one and the part that was showing through the window of the packaging got some black on it.</li>
            <li> They DO stay attached to the sink, just be careful you don&#x27;t get any water under them.  </li>
            <li> I bought three - kept one and gave the other two to my granddaughters for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Every time I use it I plug in my straightener, go into the other room, then hear it fall.</li>
            <li> I was tired of constantly moving both a curling iron and flat iron around on my sink.  </li>
            <li> It is crazy how this just sticks right on and stays.</li>
            <li> It makes  the once cluttered pile of black wires and tools look neat in my room.</li>
            <li> I bought this less than 2 months ago and it already stopped working.</li>
            <li> Was a little leery it would hold, but it stuck tight.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty of room in the little caddy for my straightener and my curling iron</li>
            <li> Hangs down, so it takes up NO bathroom counter space!</li>
            <li> It has trouble sticking to the counter sometimes.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it sticking to the different surfaces, but it does!  </li>
            <li> It is small andconvenient and keeps from laying on counters or laying on the floor.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it came dirty.</li>
            <li> Failure to do its one intended purpose.</li>
            <li> So frustrating.</li>
            <li> I regret buying this, the &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; backing part gets easily dirty with hair, etc and doesn&#x27;t hang on the sink well.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a must have.  I love it.  It is perfect.</li>
            <li> Works well at home and for travel</li>
            <li> Bought 2 after seeing it used for its main purpose, hot irons. I&#x27;ve placed them on the night stands between the bed and stand. It holds a remote/glasses and phone. Helps keep things close at hand. Highly recommend. I have glass tops on night stands and they stay put.</li>
            <li> This is great, just what we needed , bought two -  one for our en-suite and one for the downstairs guest bathroom - most of the females who stay all have hair straighteners and this is a fabulous addition to our bathrooms. I chose white to blend in with our white colour scheme.&lt;br /&gt;They stay-put on the bench top and they are adjustable as to how much you do or don&#x27;t want on your bech top.</li>
            <li> This holster is very cool- I spotted it at a friend&#x27;s house and immediately asked what it was.  I was tired of constantly moving both a curling iron and flat iron around on my sink.  I always had to worry about my cat jumping on the sink and getting burned.  This gets them out of the way but keeps them accessible.</li>
            <li> This is space saving while being a safe way to store hot styling tools.</li>
            <li> I have 4 of these now, and have bought for gifts!  Such a genius thing for solving the problem of a hot curling iron on the bathroom vanity! also works great just for a place to store my extra combs, brushes etc..........works great in kitchen too!  :)</li>
            <li> This product is a really good idea! It keeps my hot iron off the counter where space is at a premium and it keeps the iron in safe place when it is hot.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it...it is very sticky on the flap and secures itself to your sink so there&#x27;s no slipping.  I paid around $20 and it seemed to be a decent value.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The hot iron holster has exceeded our expectations!  I was skeptical about it sticking to the different surfaces, but it does!  I have no idea how it works, but it doesn&#x27;t leave residue, it just holds on to anything! I wish they had more designs to be able to put other products in (like toothbrush holders, etc.)</li>
            <li> Love this product! And doesn&#x27;t take up counter space.</li>
            <li> stays on counter and doesn&#x27;t slide off as some have reported.</li>
            <li> This is simple yet perfect product to clear counter. Stays in place...easy to clean</li>
            <li> We have tried tis product on several surfaces and it does not wok on any of them&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Not only holds my curling iron but a brush and pick comb.&lt;br /&gt;Delighted to have the extra room on my sink area.</li>
            <li> The holster works great. I use it for my hair dryer. Excellent space saver in a small, cramped bathroom. Don&#x27;t know what I did without it!</li>
            <li> This product actually works, can fit multiple hot iron tools, and keeps the items organized. It makes  the once cluttered pile of black wires and tools look neat in my room.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item!  Adds so much storage room for curling irons even when hot.</li>
            <li> Currently needed just a touch more counter space and this did the trick for me. Would recommend this to anyone tight on space for a hot item.</li>
            <li> I wanted to clear some space on my bathroom counter and found this online.&lt;br /&gt;It clings perfectly to any smooth surface, you can leave your curler either on the flat surface or the holster and it does not damage anything at all.</li>
            <li> It actually works!  Something that does what it says it does.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It has trouble sticking to the counter sometimes. Don&#x27;t really use it anymore...</li>
            <li> This is a great invention somebody should have thought of sooner. My oversize pedestal sink has a slope toward the oval bowl. Everything gravitates toward the slope and falls in the sink - hair brush, blow dryer, Perfector styler... If it&#x27;s on the side of the vanity, sooner or later it&#x27;s going to end up in the sink. This solves the problem, keeps tools close at hand while using, and even protects surfaces from burning. Was a little leery it would hold, but it stuck tight. I might get a few as presents - would make a great gift!</li>
            <li> I have looked for a long time for something to hold my curling irons, hot or cold, and tried many.  This is the first that worked for me.  Simple, no hole to worry about the size of the barrel of the curling iron, flat iron also fits easily.  Stays hung on the counter edge perfectly.  Only drawback is that from the picture I thought it would be big enough to hold two curling irons and it doesn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li> I ordered two... one for my brushes, and one for the hot iron.  They DO stay attached to the sink, just be careful you don&#x27;t get any water under them.  Then they do fall off........  great though!</li>
            <li> I bought three - kept one and gave the other two to my granddaughters for Christmas.  We all love them!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Great price and delivered on time.  Works perfectly and looks great.</li>
            <li> Nice holster!!!! something to keep your stuff in without drilling a whole to your cabinets.</li>
            <li> OK, seems like a few bucks high, but this is the real deal. She moves it from bedroom to bathroom. Simply said, IT WORKS! Very nice quality. Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
            <li> Something so simple works so nicely.....love it!!</li>
            <li> I use this every day. Keep it over the tub and move it to the sink to do my hair. Great product. Not enough room for the cord, though, so I put 2 side-by-side.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. It is small andconvenient and keeps from laying on counters or laying on the floor.</li>
            <li> Has helped with the clutter in my bathroom, now gives me a place to put my hairdryer. It is silicone and sticks to the surface of my granite top vanity with no problem. I got white and it is not the prettiest thing, but not an eyesore either. I figure clutter is more of an eyesore than this. My hairdryer used to always end up on the floor.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed. I hang it off the edge of my vanity and it stays out of the way but my hair dryer is always ready to use. The big acrylic one I used to have was way too bulky.</li>
            <li> It is crazy how this just sticks right on and stays. I put it on the back of my toilet and have my hair dryer in it. That takes up the whole thing so it would be nice if it was a little bigger. I&#x27;m thinking I might switch my hair dryer out though and put my straightener and curler in it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it came dirty. I ordered a white one and the part that was showing through the window of the packaging got some black on it. The material makes it hard to clean. It would be nice if they changed the packaging so that none of it would come through...that would eliminate it from getting dirty at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect tool to keep your flat iron/curling iron readily accessible when you need it but out of the way when you don&#x27;t. Hangs down, so it takes up NO bathroom counter space!</li>
            <li> Perfect and doesn&#x27;t slip! Looks great and the flap is long enough to have other things placed on top and off the counter!</li>
            <li> Love this holster. Sits on my sink. I use it everyday</li>
            <li> This is so cool! Love it</li>
            <li> Not sure they could improve it much by making it smaller, but my wife doesn&#x27;t use this anymore, as it was always getting in the way. Note that we don&#x27;t have a pedestal sink as they show in the picture, which was clearly on purpose (nicely done, Marketing Department). Use this with most other bathroom cabinets and you&#x27;re either blocking drawers or doors when you use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work as advertised? Absolutely. But plan ahead and know what storage you&#x27;re potentially giving up with it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> This work like a charm, love it</li>
            <li> I regret buying this, the &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; backing part gets easily dirty with hair, etc and doesn&#x27;t hang on the sink well. Every time I use it I plug in my straightener, go into the other room, then hear it fall. So frustrating. I have pretty much stopped using it entirely.</li>
            <li> Does not stick to things easily. I have to secure it with other objects on top. But I love being able to put my hot straightener directly in it.</li>
            <li> This item is supposed to stay on the side of a sink or a counter. It stayed for almost a full day then fell down. Failure to do its one intended purpose.</li>
            <li> This works great! It fits my blow dryer, curling iron and instyler, not all at once of course, but they each fit on their own. And it is not going anywhere, it really stays put.</li>
            <li> Love this holster! I actually have been using it to hold a gameboy and some games on the back of the toilet (BEST way to pass toilet time if you ask me!). It is very easy to clean (just gets  little dusty now and again) and never falls off. Love it!</li>
            <li> Decent quality... It still falls off my counter.</li>
            <li> Very glad I bought this item.  It is exactly as described---- grips the lid of the toilet tank perfectly and it is SO handy!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Safely stores hot iron in a subtle not intrusive way.</li>
            <li> I bought this less than 2 months ago and it already stopped working. I have it exactly like the photo, on the edge of my pedestal sink, and it falls off every time. It&#x27;s not wet, there&#x27;s nothing in it. It just stopped working. What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much space on my bathroom sink for my hair irons so this was an awesome find! The half that goes on the counter has a nice gripping effect to hold it in place and protects the counter from the hot surface. There&#x27;s plenty of room in the little caddy for my straightener and my curling iron so I can always have them at hand instead of tangled under the sink.</li>
            <li> Finally - a product to hold the hot straightner and curling irons.  And they don&#x27;t slip off the counter onto the floor!  Got 2.  ! for home 1 for our college student.  Love it</li>
