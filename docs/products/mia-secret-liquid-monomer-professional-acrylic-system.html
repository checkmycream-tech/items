            <li> if you know what I mean, I use it with the ibd crystal clear acrylic powder.</li>
            <li> Other monomers...</li>
            <li> I did placed a paper towel over the cap &amp; tied it with a band because it seemed to dry out after a few days and noticed it had less.</li>
            <li> Slow drying wiggle room for designs or beginers.</li>

            <li> This monomer is beyond its shelf life.  When I received it, the bottle was sucked in.  When I used it, the acrylic never dried.  I had to take it off the nails, buy another product and redo my nails.  I guess I should have known that the value was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I really really love this product! It works better then CND! I . . . Tested the product by refilling and waiting about a month to see how long before lifting. . . . A lil over a month later still no lifting! I recommend using the primer!</li>
