            <li> Small pads aren&#x27;t for me I guess, but others might like them.</li>
            <li> you like all natural &amp; avoiding useless chemicals/preservatives, then just buy a bottle of witch hazel &amp; avoid this carp!  </li>

            <li> i love love love the feeling of the cool and pain relive from this pads. i recommend any new mom to use it after delivery. it is magic, very good product.</li>
            <li> These really make you much more comfortable. Not much else needs to be said.</li>
            <li> Great for wife after giving birth (first one) so they&#x27;re was some ripping.  These wipes helped alot same quality as the ones she got while in the hospital just different shape.</li>
            <li> Perfect, more witch hazel ( the active ingredient in Tucks) than Tucks brand.&lt;br /&gt;As a Physician use and prescribe them extensively; short of European style bidet use best care for South Pole.</li>
            <li> For those who have had problems with hemorrhoid swelling, itching, burning, and yes...even a little bleeding, Equate - Hygienic Cleansing Pads is an excellent product to use.    They are cooling to the touch.  When the medicated pads are held to the bleeding area...after a few moments the bleeding is stopped.  However; I do suggest that you lay down for a bit and not strain as the tear heals from the medication.    Next, I strongly suggest you drink plenty of water daily.  Preferably alkaline water which actually help to keep you hydrated the natural way.  [...]</li>
            <li> You can buy these pads in WAL-MART FOR $4 same size. I have been doing this for years. they are becoming harder to find. Now Tucks wants the whole market I suppose. This price is twice what Wal-Mart charges so think twice before buying these here.</li>
            <li> About half way through the (100 ct.) tub I ran into several pads that were contaminated with some sort of black material. Could have anything from mold to grease. I threw away the remainder of the pads, keeping the label and a photo of the information on the bottom of the tub. However, I have searched high and low and cannot find out who manufactures this product. Until I personally contact the manufacturer or their U.S. representative, I&#x27;ll no longer use Equate products and will  tell every one at every opportunity about this situation. I don&#x27;t like the idea of a product being sold and no way of knowing who or where it was manufactured.</li>
            <li> love it is probably not completely true.  but these are really really good.  they are an excellent size for the &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; being treated.  not much wastage as there is with many other wipes like these that I cut in half, some even quarters.  work just as well as the name brand product.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and they are very effective.  Unfortunately the price has more than doubled just in the last few months.  But I need to use them.</li>
            <li> They did what they claim to do - very moist and cools like a charm. Highly recommended specially for women post partum.</li>
            <li> There was no inactive ingredient list to let me know there was more than a pad &amp; witch hazel in this....WARNING! It&#x27;s laden with chemicals I don&#x27;t want on my rear while I am pregnant with hemorrhoids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, this arrived with all the liquid spilled out onto the package, meaning it wasn&#x27;t seal correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promptly returned the two I purchased  &amp; just bought round cotton pads &amp; a bottle of witch hazel....so much better &amp; no preservatives or other chemical additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like all natural &amp; avoiding useless chemicals/preservatives, then just buy a bottle of witch hazel &amp; avoid this carp!  If you don&#x27;t care, get this at Wal-Mart, it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is the brand&#x27;s fault, but I don&#x27;t like these small pads because I feel like I touch that area because the pads are so small, so I won&#x27;t buy them again. I prefer vaginal wipes which is closer in size to toilet paper. Small pads aren&#x27;t for me I guess, but others might like them.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Low rating is for the price, which I found expensive when later comparing with local prices for similar items.</li>
            <li> Does the job, nice amount in there. I used it after I had my baby. I also used tucks and didn&#x27;t find a difference between these and tucks.</li>
            <li> Huge size pads, I cut them in 4 so I didn&#x27;t waste any. Heavily saturated with witch hazel.</li>
            <li> FYI... these work really good while dealing with this issue.</li>
            <li> Same time on going to the Store, great&lt;br /&gt;Price . Will buy again. Same ingredient as&lt;br /&gt;The Name Brand, Check the ingredient !</li>
            <li> good... they are a bit larger in diameter than expected.</li>
