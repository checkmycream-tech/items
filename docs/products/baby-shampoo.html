            <li>This is my new favorite shampoo!</li>

            <li>I really love that this shampoo is completely free of chemicals so that I can feel good about using it on my little one.  </li>
            <li>I have used several of the Good</li>
            <li>The product lived up to it&#x27;s promises and we were pleased with the service - fast shipping and quality product.</li>
            <li>The company makes good stuff and should probably dilute the shampoo with some purified water to bring down the price and provide more quantity.</li>
            <li>I have really been on the look out for a good, all natural baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone young or old,if 2 uses on my daughters hair,made hers look and feel so much better,it has to be good for anyone.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been working great on my child&#x27;s sensitive screen.</li>
            <li>(I also apply coconut oil to his scalp and hair) and it has made a TREMENDOUS difference to his hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky when I try new shampoos as some have so many additives that they leave my skin itchy.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s cleared up my one sons dry scalp, I also love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li>and I love knowing it&#x27;s ingredients are completely pure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any one concerned about using a safe natural shampoo on their children s hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers nicely, rinses out easy and left my kids hair really shiny, soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo but just too pricey at $5 an ounce, I could buy a gallon of gas for less and still have money leftover.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to use it in my own hair to see if it will help with my tangles and dry scalp.</li>
            <li>:) Would definitely recommend to my mother mommy-friends!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product as a gift to my grown daughter who has my first grand-daughter.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely a fan of this product and look forward to trying more.</li>
            <li>She found the shampoo to be mild and no negative side effects - no tearing up or burning eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is really one of those products that needs more attention than the ones we see at our local stores.</li>
            <li>Pure excellence.</li>
            <li>so we didn&#x27;t need as much conditioner on her hair.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast....</li>
            <li>Gentle but not healing.</li>
            <li>This really is tear-free ,my daughter is always opening her eyes in the bath when I tell her not to, well</li>
            <li>We are going to get the whole line of these products for my niece.  </li>
            <li>As a mom, I am very cautious with what I use on my son&#x27;s skin and hair.</li>
            <li>It is so soft, silky and best of all, NO MORE DRY AND FLAKY scalp.</li>
            <li>i was able to brush my hair while it was wet before i wasnt able to with the other shampoos.</li>
            <li>The small is amazing and without all the chemicals in today&#x27;s baby products.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing (like oranges) and leaves my baby&#x27;s hair so soft and fluffy</li>
            <li>so I know his hair will get curly as he gets older).</li>
            <li>I used it on my baby and his hair is much shinier and is very soft.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I truly recommend this for your little precious one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very health conscious about what she feeds her daughter and what products she uses for her.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo actually incorporates Plant-Based Ingredients Like Organic Aloe Vera, The Cehami Botanical, Manuka Honey from New Zealand and Fresh Orange Peel Oil.</li>
            <li>When my hair is dry, it&#x27;s soft and feels so clean.  </li>
            <li>my daughter has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin and anything with sulfates seems to give her a rash.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new all natural shampoo and bath soap for my baby.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my kids hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>my hair is amazingly soft</li>
            <li>I use this on my 5 month old baby boy as shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my children, 10 7 and 3 years old.</li>
            <li>My son has really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I came across this company&#x27;s promotion on their natural baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>I tried this because of a recommendation and was happily surprised.  </li>
            <li>Of course I expected exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>I see no difference from other natural soaps bought from Whole Foods or Target.  </li>
            <li>However, I only give 5 stars to those products that I firmly believe are worthy and after having ample time to make my observation.</li>
            <li>This might sound strange but she has a little bit of wave to her hair that I have not seen for awhile but after using this shampoo on it the waves are back.</li>

            <li> I have really been on the look out for a good, all natural baby shampoo. It&#x27;s actually harder than it sounds, because the big name brands take over the shelves at the stores. Online shopping leaves you far more options, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so glad I can buy this incredible shampoo from Amazon!! My little nephew has cradle cap right now, and if you are a parent or have ever seen a baby with cradle cap, you know how almost impossible it is to relieve the scalp of the cradle cap. It&#x27;s just a bunch of dry skin in the baby&#x27;s hair, and sometimes you have to literally resort to just brushing the cradle cap out with a little baby brush and comb until there is no more dry skin. It&#x27;s usually a very difficult, tedious, and time consuming task that is not comfortable for you or the baby. However, after using this shampoo ONLY one time, my nephew&#x27;s cradle crap was nearly gone! I love that this product is all natural, organic, and  sulfate free!! Try finding a baby shampoo in the store that meets that criteria! Also, another thing that impressed me was the quality of ingredients! Most of the time, the 1st thing listed on the ingredient list will be water. .......But you guessed it, this product does NOT have water listed as the 1st ingredient! The shampoo actually incorporates Plant-Based Ingredients Like Organic Aloe Vera, The Cehami Botanical, Manuka Honey from New Zealand and Fresh Orange Peel Oil. Doesn&#x27;t that sound amazing for your hair? Oh, and I also wanted to point out that adults can and should use this shampoo as well!! :) It works wonders!! I did receive this shampoo at a promotional price in exchange for my honest evaluation. However, I only give 5 stars to those products that I firmly believe are worthy and after having ample time to make my observation. I have a good feeling this shampoo will work wonders for you and your baby! :)</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a great scent.  It leaves my kids hair soft and shiny.  I noticed that it also help with the tangles in my daughters curly hair so we didn&#x27;t need as much conditioner on her hair.  Also with the product a little goes a long way so it last longer.  I love that it is Organic as well.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the sampoo also smells amazing .....i used it on my son and on myself........ my hair is amazingly soft i was able to brush my hair while it was wet before i wasnt able to with the other shampoos. i feel very safe using this shampoo on my son great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky when I try new shampoos as some have so many additives that they leave my skin itchy. This shampoo does none of that. It smells nice and feels great. When my hair is dry, it&#x27;s soft and feels so clean.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.... love it my daughter has very sensitive skin so this so amazing for her....</li>
            <li> I must confess I don&#x27;t have a baby and I didn&#x27;t buy this for a friend&#x27;s baby. I bought this Natural Baby Shampoo from Good On Ya&#x27; Kids for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine hair which has been color treated for years. I have used several of the Good On Ya&#x27; products in the past and continue to do so. So I knew I could trust the company. When I was given the opportunity to receive this at a promotional cost in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased opinion, I was thrilled to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got it, I used it to wash my hair. Of course I expected exactly what I got. Pure excellence. I love this product so much my hair is not flyaway, it smells great and my hair is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every product I have used from Good On Ya&#x27; has been fabulous. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about their products. This is my own true story &amp; my honest opinon.</li>
            <li> Great product in combination with the conditioner worth the price for the organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is not too strong, nothing notable. It doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my toddler&#x27;s eyes at all. A little goes a long way too. :) Would definitely recommend to my mother mommy-friends!</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday and I love it! Smells amazing (like oranges) and leaves my baby&#x27;s hair so soft and fluffy :) love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Just okay for us. Gentle but not healing. I see no difference from other natural soaps bought from Whole Foods or Target.  My son still has the same dry skin and rashes after using this just like any other soap.  Super expensive, won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great product, got here faster then I expected too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift to my grown daughter who has my first grand-daughter.  My daughter is very health conscious about what she feeds her daughter and what products she uses for her.  She was pleased to use this shampoo which is fits with my daughter&#x27;s desire to create a healthy environment for her daughter.  She found the shampoo to be mild and no negative side effects - no tearing up or burning eyes.  The smell was pleasant.  The shampoo cleaned her hair and my grand-daughter approved!  She loves taking baths.  The product lived up to it&#x27;s promises and we were pleased with the service - fast shipping and quality product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my daughters hair for the last 2 nights and it is really great. This might sound strange but she has a little bit of wave to her hair that I have not seen for awhile but after using this shampoo on it the waves are back. I can only assume that the shampoo I have been using on her hair has so much crap in it that it has been weighing it down. This really is tear-free ,my daughter is always opening her eyes in the bath when I tell her not to, well tonight,no screams and no tears,it was wonderful. It has a very pleasant orange smell that is not overbearing at all. I would recommend this product to anyone young or old,if 2 uses on my daughters hair,made hers look and feel so much better,it has to be good for anyone. I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been working great on my child&#x27;s sensitive screen.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! Very easy to rinse out and super nice!  Awesome that it&#x27;s organic!!!! Love love love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece,  my sister in law says she is so happy with it.  The small is amazing and without all the chemicals in today&#x27;s baby products.  We are going to get the whole line of these products for my niece.  So pleased!</li>
            <li> I love this product it leave my hair soft and easy to brush!!!</li>
            <li> I received the item for testing and review purposes. It is gentle on my baby&#x27;s delicate scalp and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I like the fact that it is organic and made of quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> New favorite baby shampoo! I use this on my 5 month old baby boy as shampoo and body wash. It doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin and I love knowing it&#x27;s ingredients are completely pure.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to trying their other products for myself!</li>
            <li> I really love that this shampoo is completely free of chemicals so that I can feel good about using it on my little one.  She has very sensitive skin and anything with sulfates seems to give her a rash.  Thanks for creating such a great product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my children, 10 7 and 3 years old. It is amazing and gentle. I will be continuing to use this as a choice shampoo for them!</li>
            <li> The softest kids shampoo we have ever used. I think it would be great even for babies.</li>
            <li> Really great shampoo! My son has really sensitive skin and I hate using chemical filled products so I&#x27;m always looking for great natural products. This shampoo lathers nicely, rinses out easy and left my kids hair really shiny, soft and clean. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> What a fabulous product!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making this product! As a mom, I am very cautious with what I use on my son&#x27;s skin and hair. My son is mixed (African American and Pacific Islander) and he has thick wavy hair (he&#x27;s 11 months old so I know his hair will get curly as he gets older). His scalp gets really dry and flaky; I don&#x27;t know if the cold weather has something to do with it. I was searching for a good product for his hair and I came across this company&#x27;s promotion on their natural baby shampoo. I have decided to purchase it during their promotion to try it out and provide my honest feedback. I have been washing my baby&#x27;s hair with this shampoo twice (I also apply coconut oil to his scalp and hair) and it has made a TREMENDOUS difference to his hair. It is so soft, silky and best of all, NO MORE DRY AND FLAKY scalp. I love the fact that it is totally safe to use on my baby&#x27;s hair and it is chemical free. This is really one of those products that needs more attention than the ones we see at our local stores. I truly recommend this for your little precious one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo but just too pricey at $5 an ounce, I could buy a gallon of gas for less and still have money leftover.  The company makes good stuff and should probably dilute the shampoo with some purified water to bring down the price and provide more quantity.</li>
            <li> I got this for my kids hair. A little really goes a long way with this so although the bottle may seem small it lasts as long as the larger bottles from the drug store. My sons&#x27; hair looks really shiny and stays clean and nice looking for 2 days, probably more, it also smells great, almost a light citrus fragrance. I love that it&#x27;s cleared up my one sons dry scalp, I also love that it&#x27;s organic. That&#x27;s a huge bonus in my book. I&#x27;m tempted to use it in my own hair to see if it will help with my tangles and dry scalp. I plan on repurchasing when we run out, great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I tried this because of a recommendation and was happily surprised.  I have been looking for a new all natural shampoo and bath soap for my baby.  I am very particular about the smells of a product and unfortunately just about every natural product I&#x27;ve tried has a smell, usually a chemical one or it has an odd smell.  When I got this shampoo, I expected it to have a weird smell, but it smells like oranges and does t have a funky after smell either.  Made me very happy.  I used it on my baby and his hair is much shinier and is very soft.  I&#x27;m definitely a fan of this product and look forward to trying more.</li>
            <li> My grandkids love this product. From the rich lemony smell to the soft healthy hair, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I also like the fact that it that the PH is 5.5 so I don&#x27;t need to worry about damaged hair. I would recommend this product to any one concerned about using a safe natural shampoo on their children s hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s organic and has a fresh clean smell! I also appreciate that it paraben, sulfate and fragrance free, but most of all I love how healthy my hair looks and feels after using it! This is my new favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li> Great product and great service. I will buy it again. Thank you</li>
